EU leaders call for UK trade talks to continue,"This video can not be played ""A few words on Brexit"" â EU leaders' views from the summit EU leaders have called for post-Brexit trade talks to continue beyond the end of the week - the deadline suggested by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. At a two-day summit in Brussels beginning on Thursday, they called on the UK to ""make the necessary moves"" towards a deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said fresh ""intensive"" talks should aim to reach a deal around the end of October. But his UK counterpart said he was ""disappointed"" by the EU's approach. Lord David Frost tweeted the EU was expecting ""all future moves"" for a deal to come from the UK, which he called an ""unusual approach to conducting a negotiation"". He added the prime minister would react to the EU's position as the summit wraps up on Friday. PM 'disappointed' with pre-summit trade progress Nine moments that explain where Brexit has got to What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Both sides are calling on each other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and limits on government subsidies to businesses. They are seeking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in December. Following the talks on Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""in some places there was movement, in other places there is still a lot of work to do."" ""We have asked Great Britain to continue to be willing to compromise towards an agreement. Of course, this also means that we have to make compromises,"" she told reporters. European Council President Charles Michel said the EU would decide whether talks should continue in the coming days, based on the UK's next move. Mr Barnier said negotiations were ""not finished"", and the EU was ready to accelerate talks from Monday for the ""two or three weeks that remain before us"". Earlier, in aconclusions document,externalissued during the summit, the EU said progress in key areas was currently ""not sufficient"" to reach a deal. It asked Mr Barnier to ""continue negotiations in the coming weeks"". The formal written conclusions of EU leaders' Brexit meeting seemed harsher than expected. They insisted it was up to the UK to make ""the necessary moves"" for a deal to be reached. No hint that the EU too was preparing to compromise - and words matter in these highly sensitive negotiations. The UK's chief negotiator immediately took to Twitter to object. He also noted that, while EU leaders had called for negotiations to continue, their document didn't describe them as ""intensive"" talks. Minutes after, the European Commission tweeted that its chief negotiator Michel Barnier had called for two weeks of intensive talk to start as of Monday. So what do we learn from this confused war of words? Negotiations are drawing to a close, difficult political compromises loom for both sides, tempers are frayed, and time is tight. All eyes are on Boris Johnson on Friday, when he has promised to announce the UK's next move. As the summit got under way, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would be self-isolating for the second time in a month after a member of her staff tested positive for Covid-19. In a tweet, she added she had tested negative herself but would be leaving the summit ""as a precaution"". Arriving at the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron said his country's fishermen would not ""in any situation"" be ""sacrificed to Brexit"". ""We didn't choose Brexit. Preserving access for our fishermen to British waters is an important point for us,"" he told reporters. Mrs von der Leyen (R) left the summit early after exchanging views with EU leaders. The Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a deal was still possible ""within the timeframe available to us"". He told the BBC a no-deal outcome would represent a ""significant additional shock to our societies"" on top of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""That is a motivating factor in seeking to arrive at a comprehensive deal,"" he added. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: """"It would be crazy for the outside world if the UK and the EU will not be able to come to an agreement"". Over the summer, both the UK and EU seemed to agree the end of October was the final date to get a deal done - allowing enough time for it to be ratified before 31 December. But come 7 September, Boris Johnson decided to shorten the deadline. Hesaid,externalif a deal wasn't reached by 15 October, ""then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on"". Thursday was that day - but Downing Street appears to have moved back from it as a hard deadline. Formal negotiations ended at the start of October, but Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen pledged to ""intensify talks"" over the coming weeks. Pressed on whether the UK would walk away on 15 October, the government's chief negotiator Lord Frost said it was his job to ""advise the prime minister"" on whether a deal was on the cards by then. By remaining in the bloc's single market and customs union, the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules during its post-Brexit transition period. This 11-month period is due to end in December, and the UK has ruled out seeking an extension. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, initially via video link before in-person discussions resumed over the summer. If a deal is not done, the UK will trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the World Trade Organization.

No 'return to normal' when Scottish pubs reopenNicola Sturgeon says the expiry of existing rules on 26 October will not signal a return to complete normality.ScotlandComments,"Pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt are currently closed,but could reopen from 26 October Nicola Sturgeon has warned that Scotland will not return to normal when the current restrictions on pubs and restaurants expire later this month. Licensed premises across the central belt were temporarily closed last week, with tough restrictions placed on those elsewhere in the country. The rules are due to expire on 26 October - but Ms Sturgeon said this would not signal a return to normality. The ban on visiting other people's homes will also remain in place. And the Scottish government is to introduce a multi-tier system of alert levels similar to that now in force in England, which could potentially see venues in areas with coronavirus outbreaks remain closed. Ms Sturgeon was giving a video statement to MSPs as she announced that a further 1,351 cases of Covid-19 and 13 deaths were registered in Scotland. She said the country was in a ""precarious"" position and facing a ""critical moment"" in the battle to contain the virus, with ""tough decisions"" needed from government. All existing restrictions and guidance are to remain in place for now, and the first minister warned that even the expiry of ""tough temporary restrictions"" on the hospitality trade would not signal a major change. She said: ""It is important to stress that given the ongoing challenge of Covid, that will not herald a return to complete normality. ""The restrictions on household gatherings for example will remain in place until it is considered safe to ease them. ""And more generally we intend to replace the temporary restrictions with a more strategic approach to managing the pandemic"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was in a ""precarious"" position The government is drawing up a system similar to that newly in force in England, with ""different tiers of levels of interventions"". It will include plans to ""strengthen and improve the effectiveness"" of existing measures, and improve compliance with rules particularly around self-isolation. Ms Sturgeon also said she could not rule out ""having to go further in future"". The Welsh government is introducing a system of travel restrictions to stop people moving from areas of the UK with higher rates of Covid-19 into areas with lower prevalence of the virus. Ms Sturgeon said that ""needs to be considered"" in Scotland, and has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for ""urgent talks"". New regulations have also been tabled tightening the rules around face coverings. The new rules will make it mandatory for workers to wear them while moving around in offices or in staff canteens. However one rule has been eased, with an exemption introduced to allow couples to take part in marriage and civil partnership ceremonies without wearing masks. The first minister has written to Boris Johnson urging him to adopt a ""four nations"" approach to travel restrictions Ms Sturgeon's speech took place in an entirely virtual meeting, with Holyrood currently in recess, and connection issues meant Ruth Davidson's question was largely inaudible. The Scottish Conservative group leader called on the government to introduce more testing in hospitals to stop the virus from spreading there. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie echoed this, and called for ""regular weekly testing on a much bigger scale"". The first minister said hospital acquired infections were ""a concern"", and that opposition party leaders would be consulted as part of an ongoing review of the testing strategy. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said measures had been introduced ""with no engagement of those affected"", which had resulted in ""ambiguity and confusion"". Ms Sturgeon rejected his claims she had ""ignored scientific advice"", saying: ""I will make no apology, given the nature of the threat we are dealing with right now, of being prepared to take quick, firm and decisive action if we deem that is necessary to save lives."" Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie pressed the first minister on delays in the contact tracing system, saying it was ""alarming"" and ""dangerous"" that in the past week 567 people had waited more than two days to get a call from Test and Protect. Ms Sturgeon said the system was ""working incredibly well"" but accepted that ""the turnaround time is not as quick as we want it to be"".

Photographer 'devastated' by 'Fatima' dancer ad,"A US photographer has said she was ""devastated"" when one of her photos was used for a UK government-backed advert suggesting a dancer should retrain. The ad was criticised for encouraging ""Fatima"" to give up on dancing and ""reskill"" in cyber security. The dancer is actually called Desire'e and the photo was taken by Krys Alex. ""I was shocked,"" the Atlanta-based photographer saidin a YouTube video,external. Artists ""should not be encouraged to stop doing what we love"", she added. Allow YouTube content?

A 10 Downing Street spokesperson agreed that it was ""not appropriate"". âInappropriateâ government job ad removed The first Alex knew of her photo's use was when the advert began to be criticised on social media. ""I woke up Monday morning to a bunch of emails and tags, and I really felt devastated,"" she said. ""I immediately thought of Desire'e and how her face was just plastered all over social media and the internet, different news articles, and memes were created, and she had no clue. All of that really hurt me. ""Some people questioned if I knew and if I approved the use of my work. If I'd have know that this was going to be used in the way it was, I would have never agreed to it."" Desire'e Kelley is ""a young, talented and beautiful aspiring dancer from Atlanta"", she added. ""We're exploring all our options and we're talking and consulting with different professionals to figure out the best way to protect our rights in this situation."" The photo was available on stock image site Unsplash, whose licence says pictures can normally be downloaded for free for commercial and non-commercial purposes. The campaign, which also features images of people from other walks of life, was created for CyberFirst,which is described as,external""a government outreach and education programme run by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of GCHQ"". The original photo also included Tasha Williams, owner of the Vibez in Motion Dance Studio in Atlanta, Georgia. She was cropped out for the ad.

The UK campaign took me right back to that place mentally, which was a bit scary. ""Being about 11 or 12 and feeling like I had to be someone I wasn't and suppress my creative energy to satisfy what 'others' saw as productive lives."" Mr Dowden again distanced himself from the advert when he was asked about it by MPs on the House of Commons culture select committee on Wednesday. ""I was at the Royal Ballet just on Friday and it was wonderful to see artists perform again. I know the huge value they bring to this country,"" he said.

"London, Essex, York and other areas move to Tier 2","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Things will get worse before they get better"" Millions of people in London, Essex, York and other areas face tougher Tier 2 Covid measures from Saturday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Under this ""high"" alert level, there is a ban on households mixing indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham is resisting the region moving to Tier 3, ahead of a final decision on this. More than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high-alert restrictions. The areas to go into high alert restrictions this weekend are: London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow in Furness, Cumbria. As unitary authorities,Southend and Thurrock councils are not included in the move,externaland will remain in Tier 1, Essex County Council has said. How will millions cope with new Tier 2 rules? Check the restrictions where you live How does England's tier system work? The health secretary said ""things will get worse before they get better"". ""Now, I know that these measures are not easy but I also know that they are vital,"" Mr Hancock told MPs. ""Responding to this unprecedented pandemic requires difficult choices, some of the most difficult choices any government has to make in peacetime."" On Thursday, a further18,980 cases and 138 deaths,externalwithin 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK. The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert - also known as Tiers 1 to 3, respectively. It came into effect on Wednesday, and the Liverpool City Region remains the only area currently in the highest tier. Meanwhile, the government announced thattravellers returning to the UK from Italy, Vatican City and San Marino must self-isolate for 14 daysfrom 04:00 BST on Sunday. This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules Discussions are continuing over whether Greater Manchester will be moved into the highest tier of restrictions, with a financial support package yet to be finalised. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Mr Burnham said the region's leaders were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of Tier 3 measures, calling the government's plans ""flawed and unfair"". He said: ""They are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and a large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work."" Repeating his calls for a financial support package for parts of the North West, he added: ""Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are being set up as the canaries in the coalmine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy as an attempt to prevent the expense of what is truly needed. ""The very least they should be offering the people of Greater Manchester who will be affected by these closures is a full and fair 80% furlough for all affected workers, 80% income support for people who are self-employed and a proper compensation scheme for businesses."" This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is one of those ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" Tier 3 involves pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor hospitality venues and ticketed events. Mr Hancock confirmed in the Commons that no decision had been made on moving more regions to Tier 3, but added ""we need to make rapid progress"". Meanwhile, the NHS Test and Trace system in England recorded its worst week for reaching community contacts since the middle of June. Data showed some 62% of non-household contacts of people who tested positive in the community were reached through the system in the week ending 7 October. This is the lowest success rate since 24 June, down from 67% last week. Asked about the latest data, the PM's spokesman said tests were being provided on an ""unprecedented scale"" and No 10 was still workingto raise capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Circuit-breaker lockdown 'likely for Wales' Scotland 'will not return to normal' when pubs reopen London rules 'put 250,000 hospitality jobs at risk' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has defended his call for a nationwide ""circuit-breaker"" - a short limited lockdown - to stem rising infection rates, saying""no region will be immune"" from Covid-19. Speaking to the BBC, he said the alternative was ""weeks and months of prolonged agony"" in a tiered system. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told MPs in the Commons that a full national lockdown ""stretching for weeks and weeks"" would ""be disastrous for society"", but that a lockdown of between two and three weeks could help ""take back control of the virus"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS providers, said he also favoured this move to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, Labour mayor Sadiq Khan told London's City Hall there was ""simply no other option"" than introducing the new restrictions. He said he will continue to press the government for more financial support, but added that ""we've got a difficult winter ahead"". Concerns have been raised about the impact the restrictions will have on businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector. London has 3,640 pubs and 7,556 restaurants, according to real estate adviser Altus Group, but they will not be eligible for government support available to premises which have been ordered to close. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan says there is ""simply no other option"" as London moves to Tier 2 restrictions The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), the trade association for Britain's brewing and pub sector, said Tier 2 restrictions without a ""proper package of support"" would ""decimate"" pubs. Emma McClarkin, BBPA chief executive, said pubs were already struggling due to the current restrictions, with the new measures leaving ""most pubs fighting for their very survival"". Nickie Aiken, Tory MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, urged the government to set out an ""exit plan"" for ensuring London is placed back into Tier 1. She said she remained ""deeply concerned about the impact further lockdown will have on the capital's hospitality, leisure and retail businesses"". Robert Halfon, Conservative MP for Harlow in Essex, said he welcomed Tier 2 measures for the county but would call on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to prevent businesses suffering financially. Liverpool is consideringa two-week half-term break for schoolsas part of its ""battle with Covid-19"". Under the plan, backed by a teaching union, pupils would be taught remotely at home for the second week of the break.

Planning under way for Covid circuit breaker,"This video can not be played Covid circuit breakers are doomed to fail, says disease expert Ministers are ""planning very seriously"" for a circuit breaker lockdown for Wales, the first minister has said. ""We're very actively talking about and preparing for that should it be necessary,"" Mark Drakeford told Sky News. The short-term measurescould include closing pubs and restaurants. However disease expert Dr Roland Salmon said such circuit breaker lockdowns were ""doomed to failure"" and would only bring ""cost without benefit"". Acircuit breakeris a short, set period of maybe two or three weeks, where tighter restrictions are brought in to break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising. The UK government's Scientific Advisory Committee (Sage) urged forthe introduction of circuit breaker restrictions three weeks ago. Mr Drakeford said: ""We want to act now in order to prevent the worst from happening, to give us a better chance of getting through the rest of the autumn and the winter, and if a circuit breaker is the right way to do it then that is what we will do. ""I'm not announcing it today but I do want people to know we are planning very seriously, so if we do need to do it we'll be in a position to do it and in a position to do it quickly."" Mr Drakeford has already called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to convene a Cobra meeting so that all four UK nations could discuss the measure. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said earlier on Wednesday a decision would be made in the next few days on the issue in Wales A circuit break would see tighter restrictions would be brought in for a short period Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said a circuit breaker lockdown was needed to provide time to get the test and trace system ""in order"" and prevent the NHS from being ""overwhelmed"". He said there should also be a full reintroduction of the furlough scheme, financial help for businesses and support for people asked to self-isolate. ""Unless we take action, our NHS could be overwhelmed and unable to contend with a second wave which may well be worse than the first."" When asked about a circuit breaker on Wednesday morning, Mr Gething told BBC Breakfast the school half term - staring on 26 October - was a ""potential way to introduce a break"" if it was decided to do so. However Dr Salmon, former director of communicable diseases at Public Health Wales, said it will not suppress the virus. He said any short-term measures - lasting between two and three weeks - would not be long enough to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from households where people are infectious but do not show symptoms. ""I simply don't think a circuit breaker will work,"" he said. ""It won't work because even Sage (UK government Scientific Advisory Committee for Emergencies) in its consideration thought it would only delay matters, not suppress the virus altogether."" What can I do during local lockdowns? Social distancing needed 'until vaccine found' 'Rolling lockdowns' will become the norm in Wales Whatever period was chosen for a circuit breaker, infectious people would still be released back into the community, he said. The retired epidemiologist, who led the response to the E-coli outbreak in south Wales in 2005, believes governments should ""rethink the whole model"" and focus more on shielding the most vulnerable sections of the community, rather than placing restrictions on those considered to be at lower risk. ""We should be shielding older people, shielding at-risk occupations and for track and trace the priority should be on those places we know the virus is transmitted, like hospitals, care homes, meat factories, prisons or even universities,"" he said. ""We need a rational approach that's so far been lacking."" His view was echoed by Prof Dale Andrew Fisher, who specialises in infectious diseases at the National University Hospital, Singapore, and is part of the World Health Organisation's outbreak alert and response network. He said circuit breakers were a short-term fix and were not ""sustainable"". ""It has to be just to buy time or to recover, but really this virus is going to be with us for a lot longer yet,"" he told Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast ""We don't expect to be vaccinating most of the world until 2022 so we have to learn to live with this virus and we have to be able to go to school, go to work, do our normal activities in a Covid-safe way, limiting the impact of social and economic needs."" He added: ""You shouldn't need to do this if you can ramp up contact tracing, get all your contacts in quarantine, isolating all the positive cases. ""It needs to be part of a strategy, not 'lets do a circuit breaker, numbers are down, let's open up again'."" It is not clear if a circuit breaker would see schools close in Wales, as ishappening in Northern Ireland from Monday. Laura Doel, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, said any circuit break should be Wales-wide and not down to individual local authorities as confusion causes ""more harm than good"". She said: ""The concern for schools is always going to be what about the vulnerable pupils."" She said a circuit breaker would be ""another issue"" for parents but added: ""On the flipside, this option would be a much needed break for teaching staff at this time.""

How will millions cope with new Tier 2 rules?,"Increased lockdown measures will be introduced from Saturday in London Millions of people across England will be banned from meeting friends and family inside their household from Saturday. The regions have been told they will move to stricter Tier 2 restrictions to try and stop the spread of coronavirus. But how will locals cope with the new rules? The restrictions in London, Essex, York and other areas mean more than half of England's population will be living under high or very high-alert restrictions. The infection rate in London has been steadily increasing for several weeks and in the week to 9 October it was 77.8 cases per 100,000 people. Henry Conlon owns the Dublin Castle, an iconic pub and live music venue in the capital's Camden region, and he fears the worst. ""This is the day the music died,"" he said. ""If you can't meet your mates in the pub, then what's the point in them? ""The 10pm curfew really stuck the knife in, but there was a bit of hope when things were returning to normality. ""We'll be lucky if we can keep our staff after this."" Tougher Tier 2 restrictionswill put up to 250,000 jobs at risk in London's hospitality sector, according to the industry's trade body. Jeremy Joseph (centre) has launched legal action against the 10pm curfew for hospitality venues Amanda, an A&E doctor in Essex, said she supported the move to Tier 2. ""I think we should stop [the virus] now rather wait until it gets worse,"" she said. ""We are coming into a full department in the morning and we have patients on trolleys waiting for wards, and that's before we've hit flu season. ""It's dangerous to carry on and just assume everything will be fine."" London, Essex, York and other areas move to Tier 2 What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? No Tier 3 Covid deal yet, say Manchester leaders The leader of Essex County Council, David Finch, said it was the ""correct decision"" to move the region into Tier 2 restrictions. He said a stricter lockdown was ""guided by the science and the fact is that the number of cases in Essex is rising exponentially"". ""We understand that the move to the High local Covid alert level may affect people's lives and businesses and understand the very strong feelings about this,"" he said. ""However, we have a duty of care to the people of Essex, and we firmly believe that this is the best route to minimise disruptions, to save lives and to protect businesses."" The Campaign for Real Ale said a Tier 2 lockdown put pubs and bars into a ""danger zone"" Jeremy Josesph, owner of the G-A-Y nightclub chain in London and Manchester, said the new lockdown rules were ""too confusing"". ""Keeping households from mixing seems unmanageable,"" he said. ""If a group come to G-A-Y, who's responsible in making sure they're all from the same household? And who gets fined? ""We need the government to be working with business to make things work."" Beth Stephenson fits women for bras at work, but is unable to visit her mum Beth Stephenson, a shop manager from York, said she feel ""frustrated"" by the lockdown rules she feels ""make no sense"". Her work fitting women for bras means she is in close contact with people all day. ""But now I can't meet my mum at her house, even if we socially distance,"" she says. ""I think I'll go insane during another lockdown. I'm quite a social person. Ms Stephenson says she now plans to ""have a few friends round for a few drinks tomorrow whilst I still can"". Ruth Ifode believes England is heading towards a full lockdown Ruth Ifode, from Brentford, says she has made emergency plans to see her parents on Friday night. ""I don't know when I'll next get to see them,"" she added.""I kind of wish we just did a proper lockdown. You can see we're creeping towards it anyway, when you see people dancing in the streets, people are misbehaving and won't listen to the experts."" London Essex Elmbridge in Surrey Barrow in Furness, Cumbria York North East Derbyshire Chesterfield Erewash, Derbyshire Mayor of London Sadiq Khan believes the new restrictions are ""necessary in order to protect Londoners lives"". Speaking at Mayor's Question Time, he said: ""Nobody wants to see more restrictions. ""This move is based on the expert public health and scientific advice about what is necessary to save lives in the capital."" The lobby group Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said pubs in areas being placed into Tier 2 were ""being put into a devastating danger zone"". Nik Antona, Camra's chairman, said they would suffer the ""additional restrictions"" without the ""additional support"" that forms part of a Tier 3 lockdown. ""Because pubs aren't being forced to close, they aren't eligible for Government support - despite being forced to operate under much tighter restrictions that other businesses,"" he said. ""This also has a huge knock on effect for our brewers, who will struggle to get their product to market."" The infection rate in London has been steadily increasing for several weeks London, Essex, York and other areas move to Tier 2 London rules 'put 250,000 hospitality jobs at risk' No Tier 3 Covid deal yet, say Manchester leaders The rules where you live The county pleading for tighter Covid restrictions Three-tier system explained Why is Liverpool in top tier?

Greater Manchester 'fighting back' against Tier 3,"This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" for the government's lockdown strategy Greater Manchester is ""fighting back for fairness"" and will ""stand firm"" against government plans to move it into the highest level of Covid measures, the mayor has said. Labour Mayor Andy Burnham said local leaders were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of ""flawed and unfair"" Tier 3 rules. But the health secretary said they must ""set aside party politics"". Meanwhile, other parts of England willmove into Tier 2 from Saturday. Measures under Tier 3 - a very high alert level - include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Mr Burnham said they would amount to a ""punishing lockdown"" without ""proper support"" for the people and businesses affected. What are the Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 lockdown rules? Gym fined for refusing to close in Covid shutdown Circuit-breaker lockdown 'likely for Wales' Ministers ""are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and a large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work,"" he told a press briefing. ""Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are being set up as the canaries in the coal mine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy as an attempt to prevent the expense of what is truly needed."" He added: ""This is an important moment. Greater Manchester will stand firm. We are fighting back for fairness and for the health of our people in the broadest sense."" But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said local leaders should ""set aside party politics"" and work with the government, with cases rising ""exponentially"" in the north west of England. ""This is a time for people to come together so that we can control this virus,"" he said. He added that an ""unprecedented package of support"" has been put forward, and that the government favoured a regional approach to restrictions because ""there are different levels of virus in different parts of the country"". Earlier, he told MPs that discussions with local leaders ""in Greater Manchester, in Lancashire, and elsewhere"" were ongoing - including ""what financial support is needed"". Andy Burnham and other leaders in Greater Manchester are clearly furious that more support isn't on the table for the area. They are standing firm against the government's plans. The decision here ultimately lies with central government - they don't need the agreement of local politicians. But they desperately want it. Ministers have been stung by accusations they are treating the north of England differently to the south, and want to share some responsibility for extra measures. At the moment, that seems some way off in Greater Manchester. Discussions continue over whether Lancashire moves into Tier 3. At the moment, local leaders are unsure over whether a final decision will be made tonight. Underthe chancellor's Job Support Scheme, which replaces furlough at the start of November, workers at firms told to shut because of coronavirus rules over the winter will receive at least 67% of their pay from the government. However, leaders in Greater Manchester said they want an 80% furlough scheme for all affected workers, 80% income support for the self-employed and a ""proper compensation scheme for businesses"". ""They have said there's no money left, there's no money for them to put on the table. But, to be honest with you, I don't believe that for one second,"" Mr Burnham told reporters. What Covid tier is my area in? What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? Why is Liverpool alone in top tier restrictions? Asked whether he was concerned about the public health implications of not moving to Tier 3, he said local leaders ""will take every step necessary"" to stem the spread of Covid-19 and ""wait for further engagement"" with the government. The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert - also known as Tiers 1 to 3, respectively. Mediumalertmeans areas are subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas onhigh alert- including north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas onvery high alert- at present, the Liverpool City Region - face extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. People from different households can still meet in certain outdoor public spaces, such as parks, beaches, the countryside, forests, public gardens, allotments, outdoor sports facilities and playgrounds. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos have also been forced to close.

'We need to break the stigma around miscarriage',"Binky Felstead has spoken out about her miscarriage Made in Chelsea star Binky Felstead says she wants to ""break the stigma"" around miscarriage and open up conversations about baby loss. Lots of the influencer's followers and friends got in touch with her after she posted on Instagram about losing her baby. The 30-year-old told Newsbeat many of those people had never talked about their own miscarriages. ""It's heart-breaking, so I felt that I'd like to try and break the stigma."" About one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage, and it's most common in the first three months of pregnancy. After 24 weeks, it's known as stillbirth. Binky says her miscarriage happened when she was almost 12 weeks pregnant. She had two early scans which showed ""a strong heartbeat"", but at the third scan she was told there wasn't a heartbeat at all. ""It's such important issue to raise because no-one really talks about it,"" she says. ""It's almost like it's a taboo subject."" Allow Instagram content?

Binky told Newsbeat that she and partner Max Darnton made the decision to post about her miscarriage because her followers deserved to see her ""reality"". ""I've always shared my happy moments, from when I got pregnant with India, when I had India and my engagement last month. ""I don't think it's reality - or that it's fair - that I don't share my down time as well. ""The one piece of advice I feel that I can give is to make sure you allow yourself to physically and emotionally heal."" What to say to someone who's lost a baby Teigen speaks of 'deep pain' of losing baby Since Binky's post,the Miscarriage Association,externalsays it's been inundated with phone calls from women. ""It's really helpful when someone well-known like Binky talks publicly about her experience of miscarriage because it's not an easy thing to do,"" says Ruth Bender-Atik from the Miscarriage Association.. ""For some reason it's still a taboo and it can be difficult to talk about. ""Sometimes you feel like you could have done better, lots of people feel like it's because they've done something wrong and that they could have done something. ""It's hard to talk about, but it really helps if we can get miscarriage talked about more."" The coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact for women who have had a miscarriage. Charities say it's complicated grief, with partners unable to always attend appointments and scans. 'I faced miscarriage alone - my partner had to wait in the car park' There have been some changes to official NHS guidance, but it's still an issue for many. ""Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, feelings of isolation have become more widespread than ever and many people have begun to talk more openly about grief,"" Dr Clea Harmer, chief executive of the stillbirth and neonatal death charity (SANDS) said. ""Many of those whose baby died during the pandemic will not have been able to spend time making memories or saying goodbye to their baby in the way they would have wanted to. ""Now more than ever, we can all come together to let those affected by pregnancy and baby loss know they are not alone and that we are all here to support them.""

The page was written by Joseph Lee,  Sophie Williams, Joshua Cheetham and Alex Kleiderman, and edited by Paulin Kola, Emma Owen and John Hand. We're wrapping our coverage up now, but here are some of today's biggest global developments: It's been a day of fast-moving developments in the UK as the government imposed additional restrictions on some regions to control a rise in cases. By James Wong Some images of the Covid-19 pandemic will last generations â deserted city streets, football games played in empty stadia or world leaders in face masks. For many of us, the most vivid memories may be a little closer to home: queues at the shops, talking to loved ones on mobile screens and bare aisles in the supermarket. I live in the UK where in the early days of the pandemic, grocery store shelves emptied long before we were told to stop going to the pub, schools closed and face masks became mandatory. The severity of what was approaching only hit home for some people when the rice and pasta ran out. Other people around the world were far less fortunate than I was. In Africa,73 million people across 36 countries are deemed acutely food-insecureas a result of Covid-19 by the World Food Programme, compared to half a million in Europe. The pandemic has highlighted how fragile our food chain â from field to fork â really is. But have we learned anything from the experience about food security? And how might we be better prepared next time? Read more here. Earlier we reported an announcement by Grant Shapps that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. The transport secretary also said those returning from the Greek island of Crete will now not need to quarantine. So where can you go without having to self-isolate on return? Check our guide,here.  The latest government figures show the total number of people to have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK has now reached 673,622. And the number of people dying within 28 days of testing positive stands at 43,293. The graphs here show how cases have been rising again in recent weeks - with daily hospital admissions now at a seven-day average of 730.  Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent Israeli police have made arrests at an
ultra-Orthodox wedding which descended into chaos as guests were dragged away
and officers said glass bottles of cooking oil were thrown at them. The celebration broke Covid-19 rules as
it involved âdozensâ of guests, according to police. It took place in a private house in
the settlement of Givat Zeâev in the occupied West Bank. Videos posted on social media,externalshowed
scuffles between officers and guests. One man with a bloodied face was detained
while another was shown bleeding on the ground. Israeli media reported that
people slipped on the cooking oil and fell on broken glass. Family members accused police of
attacking the brideâs brother. The incident comes amid a growing
row between secular and ultra-religious communities over the response to
lockdown rules in Israel, which is starting to turn the tide on a dramatic
surge in the virus. Some ultra-Orthodox politicians
strongly criticised officers for heavy-handed tactics. But police slammed
attacks on their officers saying they were stopping a âgross violationâ of the
rules. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged local leaders to ""set aside party politics"" so that ""people come together so we can control this virus"". He was speaking after the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said he and other representatives in the region were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of Tier 3 restrictions. Mr Hancock said the leaders should ""work with us to put in place the measures that are needed in Greater Manchester - across the North West, so that we can deal with this virus and support people through it"". He said: ""This is a time for people to come together so that we can control this virus."" When asked if there would be a more generous financial package for the area he said ""there has been an unprecedented package of support"", pointing to measures already announced. And when asked if a national circuit-breaker was necessary he said ""what we want to do is take a regional, a local approach because there are different levels of virus in different parts of the country"". With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. Footballer Marcus Rashford helped force a U-turn from the government on providing on free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils in England over the summer holidays - but hislatest appeal to ministersappears to have been turned down. During the coronavirus lockdown the government helped families whose children qualify for free meals. They insisted this would not continue outside of term time - but changed their mind after the England and Manchester United striker's campaign. Now the footballer has launched a petition calling on ministers to go further in tackling child hunger - including providing meals over the Christmas break. It comes as meals are being made available during the breaks to eligible children in Wales. But Downing Street has now indicated that free school meals will not be given to children in England during the holidays. Rashford, who was made an MBE in last week's honours list on the back of his work for vulnerable children,,hit back on Twitter,,externalwriting: ""Merry Christmas kids... It's also not for food banks to feed millions of British children but here we are... This is not going away anytime soon and neither am I..."" As cases and hospital admissions continue to rise across Europe, several countries are rolling out restrictions to ease the stress on healthcare systems and economies. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments on the continent: UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has announced that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. As a result, anyone travelling to the UK from any of the states must quarantine for 14 days. The new measure will come into effect from 04:00 BST on Sunday 18 October. Mr Shapps has also announced that anyone arriving in the UK from the Greek island of Crete will no longer need to follow the 14-day isolation rule. Nicola Sturgeon said she could not ""rule out"" having to take further measures At an earlier virtual meeting of the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Welsh-style ban on people travelling from Covid hotspots in other parts of the UK ""is being considered"". ""Although we have put in place tough measures, we cannot rule out having to go further in the future,"" she said. The travel ban for Wales is expected to come into force at 18:00 BST tomorrow, and affects people living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions of England - which will cover half the population by the weekend - as well as the whole of Northern Ireland and the central belt of Scotland. A further 18,980 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to the latest data. Thegovernment's dashboard,externalalso show another 138 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The figures compare with 19,724 cases and 137 deaths recorded on Wednesday. This video can not be played Over the last few months weâve been told how important it is to wash our hands regularly â for at least 20 seconds â to protect against coronavirus. But with so many different soaps to choose from, how do we work out whatâs best? To mark Global Handwashing Day, Dr Michelle Wong â a beauty blogger with a PhD in chemistry â explains how to find the best soap for your skin when cleaning our hands more regularly, and a trick to get children to wash their hands. Listen toBBC CrowdSciencefor more about how soap works. Authorities in Italy have registered 8,804 new cases during the last 24 hours, beating the previous official high of 7,332 set yesterday. Italy's health ministry also reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths, jumping from 43 on Wednesday, but far less than the peak of the country's outbreak in March and April, when daily death tolls reached more than 900. It comes as infections continue to soar around Europe, prompting the rollout of restrictions in countries like neighbouring France. While Burnham was talking in Manchester, there was news of a likely development in Wales. The BBC has been told that the Welsh Governmentis expected to announce a limited ""circuit breaker"" lockdown in the next few days. A circuit-breaker a short period of time where tighter restrictions are brought in to break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising. It is not yet clear when the announcement will be made, for how long a limited shutdown would last, or which sectors would close. But what is known  is that Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has written to First Minister Mark Drakeford asking him to give businesses time to prepare for such a move.  The Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham concludes his comments by revealing that government ministers suggested there is ""no money left"" for the kind of financial package the local leaders say is necessary before their areas are put into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Burnham, who spoke to health ministers earlier today, said he had been told ""there is no money to put on the table"". He added: ""To be honest with you, I don't believe that for one second. When I look today at some of the fees they are paying to consultants working on the failed test and trace scheme, when I look at the billions that is being thrown at a scheme that isn't working for Greater Manchester, money that has been found for other things this year. ""The argument I am making is... support people right now when they need it because by supporting people  now you will save jobs and businesses that will be able to restart the minute we find a vaccine, the minute the recovery is on."" Burnham says he and other Greater Manchester leaders were told by the deputy chief medical officer  that the ""only certain thing to work is a national lockdown"". But Burnham then points out the government was ""unwilling to do that because of the harm it would do to the national economy"". ""They are willing to sacrifice jobs and businesses here [in north-west England] to try and save them elsewhere,"" Burnham said, adding that they were being treated as ""canaries in the coal mine"" for an ""experimental regional lockdown strategy"". He said the ""very least"" the government needed to do was to offer a furlough scheme with 80% of wages paid, support for the self-employed and help for businesses, the same as that offered to the general population during the first national lockdown from March. Burnham, a former Labour health secretary who has been the Greater Manchester mayor since 2017, said regional leaders had communicated their ""clear and unanimous"" view to the government that it was wrong to put some of poorest parts in England into a ""punishing lockdown"" without adequate support that was ""not certain to control the virus"". Asked whether he thinks the government would impose the Tier 3 restrictions on the region without local agreement, Burnham said: ""We can't simply be treated as second-class citizens. We understand the government's view and wait for further engagement."" He added: ""If the government are convinced this approach will work.... they have to back that properly, fully financially, so it will have a chance of working."" Burnham adds that the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said bringing infection rates down would ""require widespread closures way beyond pubs"". ""They are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts say will not work,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

Gym fined for refusing to close in Covid shutdown,"Body Tech Fitness owner Nick Whitcombe refused to close despite a warning A Merseyside gym that stayed open despite strict new coronavirus restrictions has been fined Â£1,000. Police attended Body Tech Fitness in Moreton, Wirral, twice on Wednesday as newTier 3 measures came into force. The rules for the Liverpool City Region mean gyms, betting shops and many pubs cannot open. Owner Nick Whitcombe had repeatedly taken to social media to say the gym would continue to stay open as it is ""vital to physical and mental health"". He said: ""We are not staying open for financial gain but more for our members mental and physical well-being. ""Gyms should be supported in fighting against Covid obesity, mental health and many other conditions and diseases."" Merseyside Police said officers acted after a report from a member of the public concerned the gym was breaking the rules. Officers ordered the gym to close on Wednesday morning but issued the fine after finding it still open when they returned later that day. Body Tech Fitness in Moreton, Wirral, is among the gyms opposed to the closure order Ch Supt Claire Richards said she understood people were ""frustrated"" but appealed to the public and businesses ""to adhere to the guidance"" She said enforcement would be used ""where there are clear breaches of legislation"". ""While this lockdown does present huge challenges, the focus of us all should now be on preventing the spread of the virus and getting us back to normality as safely and as quickly as possible. ""The new restrictions have been brought in to try to achieve that."" Some medical experts say gyms could encourage the virus to spread, as they are humid and confined spaces with shared equipment. Butseveral gym operators have opposed that view, claiming the fitness benefits to the public are of greater value. The UK's largest gym chain, Pure Gym, has said it is considering legal action over the decision to close gyms and fitness centres in Liverpool.

EU leaders call for UK trade talks to continueThe EU wants to keep pushing for a deal beyond the end-of-week deadline set by Boris Johnson.,"This video can not be played ""A few words on Brexit"" â EU leaders' views from the summit EU leaders have called for post-Brexit trade talks to continue beyond the end of the week - the deadline suggested by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. At a two-day summit in Brussels beginning on Thursday, they called on the UK to ""make the necessary moves"" towards a deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said fresh ""intensive"" talks should aim to reach a deal around the end of October. But his UK counterpart said he was ""disappointed"" by the EU's approach. Lord David Frost tweeted the EU was expecting ""all future moves"" for a deal to come from the UK, which he called an ""unusual approach to conducting a negotiation"". He added the prime minister would react to the EU's position as the summit wraps up on Friday. PM 'disappointed' with pre-summit trade progress Nine moments that explain where Brexit has got to What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Both sides are calling on each other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and limits on government subsidies to businesses. They are seeking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in December. Following the talks on Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""in some places there was movement, in other places there is still a lot of work to do."" ""We have asked Great Britain to continue to be willing to compromise towards an agreement. Of course, this also means that we have to make compromises,"" she told reporters. European Council President Charles Michel said the EU would decide whether talks should continue in the coming days, based on the UK's next move. Mr Barnier said negotiations were ""not finished"", and the EU was ready to accelerate talks from Monday for the ""two or three weeks that remain before us"". Earlier, in aconclusions document,externalissued during the summit, the EU said progress in key areas was currently ""not sufficient"" to reach a deal. It asked Mr Barnier to ""continue negotiations in the coming weeks"". The formal written conclusions of EU leaders' Brexit meeting seemed harsher than expected. They insisted it was up to the UK to make ""the necessary moves"" for a deal to be reached. No hint that the EU too was preparing to compromise - and words matter in these highly sensitive negotiations. The UK's chief negotiator immediately took to Twitter to object. He also noted that, while EU leaders had called for negotiations to continue, their document didn't describe them as ""intensive"" talks. Minutes after, the European Commission tweeted that its chief negotiator Michel Barnier had called for two weeks of intensive talk to start as of Monday. So what do we learn from this confused war of words? Negotiations are drawing to a close, difficult political compromises loom for both sides, tempers are frayed, and time is tight. All eyes are on Boris Johnson on Friday, when he has promised to announce the UK's next move. As the summit got under way, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would be self-isolating for the second time in a month after a member of her staff tested positive for Covid-19. In a tweet, she added she had tested negative herself but would be leaving the summit ""as a precaution"". Arriving at the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron said his country's fishermen would not ""in any situation"" be ""sacrificed to Brexit"". ""We didn't choose Brexit. Preserving access for our fishermen to British waters is an important point for us,"" he told reporters. Mrs von der Leyen (R) left the summit early after exchanging views with EU leaders. The Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a deal was still possible ""within the timeframe available to us"". He told the BBC a no-deal outcome would represent a ""significant additional shock to our societies"" on top of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""That is a motivating factor in seeking to arrive at a comprehensive deal,"" he added. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: """"It would be crazy for the outside world if the UK and the EU will not be able to come to an agreement"". Over the summer, both the UK and EU seemed to agree the end of October was the final date to get a deal done - allowing enough time for it to be ratified before 31 December. But come 7 September, Boris Johnson decided to shorten the deadline. Hesaid,externalif a deal wasn't reached by 15 October, ""then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on"". Thursday was that day - but Downing Street appears to have moved back from it as a hard deadline. Formal negotiations ended at the start of October, but Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen pledged to ""intensify talks"" over the coming weeks. Pressed on whether the UK would walk away on 15 October, the government's chief negotiator Lord Frost said it was his job to ""advise the prime minister"" on whether a deal was on the cards by then. By remaining in the bloc's single market and customs union, the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules during its post-Brexit transition period. This 11-month period is due to end in December, and the UK has ruled out seeking an extension. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, initially via video link before in-person discussions resumed over the summer. If a deal is not done, the UK will trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the World Trade Organization.

"London rules 'put 250,000 hospitality jobs at risk'The industry warns Tier 2 restrictions will be 'absolutely catastrophic' for pubs and restaurantsBusiness","Tougher Tier 2 Covid restrictions will put up to 250,000 jobs at risk in London's hospitality sector, according to the industry's trade body. From Saturday, households will not be allowed to mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said that without additional government support thousands of jobs in the capital will go. ""It will be absolutely catastrophic,"" she told the BBC. Ms Nicholls has written to the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning that elevating the capital's coronavirus risk level ""will be incredibly damaging without additional financial support"". Job Support Scheme: What is changing after furlough? 'Pubs and restaurants facing jobs cliff edge' Heineken forced pubs to stock too many of its beers She said hospitality businesses should be excluded from paying for part of the new Job Support Scheme (JSS), which replaces furlough in November. Under JSS, a company pays up to 55% of an employee's wage with the government contributing 22%. To access the scheme, a person will also have to work at least a third of their normal hours. Businesses that have to shut under the more stringent Tier 3 restrictions - such as those in Liverpool - will see the government pay 67% of a worker's wage. The employer does not have to pay towards the salary. Ms Nicholls said: ""It is imperative that the employer contribution of the Job Support Scheme is removed from all hospitality businesses, as all are facing restrictions. ""From 1 November it is really uncertain whether our businesses will be able to access the new Job Support Scheme but in any case that requires businesses to be able to pay 55% of wages and hospitality just can't afford to do that with no revenues. ""So you've got a real squeezed middle in Tier 2 with next to no help, maximum restrictions and no alternative but job losses."" Greene King cuts 800 jobs as pub curfew hits trade Harvester owner consulting on job cuts The hospitality sector has been one of the worst hit by the pandemic and many firms are cutting jobs as the current furlough scheme winds up at the end of October. On Thursday, pub group Marston's said it would axe up to 2,150 furloughed jobs following new restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The company said that since 4 July it had reopened 99% of its pubs and ""consumer confidence increased steadily throughout July, August and into September"". However, it said new restrictions such as the 10pm curfew, table-only service and the closure of pubs in some areas of Scotland had undermined consumer confidence. By Sima Kotecha, BBC business presenter It's inevitable that we'll see more businesses follow in Marston's footsteps in the coming days and weeks. When the government's furlough scheme ends this month, businesses are likely to let people go as they simply can't afford paying their wages without the same level of state support. For those companies in the harshest restriction zones, the government has said it will provide two-thirds of workers' wages if they're forced to shut down. But for Marston's, the less generous offer isn't enough for them to keep many of their staff on their books. No trade for weeks, and now another forced lockdown is destroying not just businesses but the lives of those who once worked for them. Commenting on how restrictions had impacted its business, Marston's said it has 21 pubs in Scotland, of which eight are currently closed.

""The additional restrictions which have been applied across the UK most recently present significant challenges to us and will make business more difficult for a period of time,"" said Marston's boss Ralph Findlay. He said he regretted the job cuts, but that they were ""an inevitable consequence of the limitations placed upon our business"".

No 'return to normal' when Scottish pubs reopen,"Pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt are currently closed,but could reopen from 26 October Nicola Sturgeon has warned that Scotland will not return to normal when the current restrictions on pubs and restaurants expire later this month. Licensed premises across the central belt were temporarily closed last week, with tough restrictions placed on those elsewhere in the country. The rules are due to expire on 26 October - but Ms Sturgeon said this would not signal a return to normality. The ban on visiting other people's homes will also remain in place. And the Scottish government is to introduce a multi-tier system of alert levels similar to that now in force in England, which could potentially see venues in areas with coronavirus outbreaks remain closed. Ms Sturgeon was giving a video statement to MSPs as she announced that a further 1,351 cases of Covid-19 and 13 deaths were registered in Scotland. She said the country was in a ""precarious"" position and facing a ""critical moment"" in the battle to contain the virus, with ""tough decisions"" needed from government. All existing restrictions and guidance are to remain in place for now, and the first minister warned that even the expiry of ""tough temporary restrictions"" on the hospitality trade would not signal a major change. She said: ""It is important to stress that given the ongoing challenge of Covid, that will not herald a return to complete normality. ""The restrictions on household gatherings for example will remain in place until it is considered safe to ease them. ""And more generally we intend to replace the temporary restrictions with a more strategic approach to managing the pandemic"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was in a ""precarious"" position The government is drawing up a system similar to that newly in force in England, with ""different tiers of levels of interventions"". It will include plans to ""strengthen and improve the effectiveness"" of existing measures, and improve compliance with rules particularly around self-isolation. Ms Sturgeon also said she could not rule out ""having to go further in future"". The Welsh government is introducing a system of travel restrictions to stop people moving from areas of the UK with higher rates of Covid-19 into areas with lower prevalence of the virus. Ms Sturgeon said that ""needs to be considered"" in Scotland, and has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for ""urgent talks"". New regulations have also been tabled tightening the rules around face coverings. The new rules will make it mandatory for workers to wear them while moving around in offices or in staff canteens. However one rule has been eased, with an exemption introduced to allow couples to take part in marriage and civil partnership ceremonies without wearing masks. The first minister has written to Boris Johnson urging him to adopt a ""four nations"" approach to travel restrictions Ms Sturgeon's speech took place in an entirely virtual meeting, with Holyrood currently in recess, and connection issues meant Ruth Davidson's question was largely inaudible. The Scottish Conservative group leader called on the government to introduce more testing in hospitals to stop the virus from spreading there. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie echoed this, and called for ""regular weekly testing on a much bigger scale"". The first minister said hospital acquired infections were ""a concern"", and that opposition party leaders would be consulted as part of an ongoing review of the testing strategy. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said measures had been introduced ""with no engagement of those affected"", which had resulted in ""ambiguity and confusion"". Ms Sturgeon rejected his claims she had ""ignored scientific advice"", saying: ""I will make no apology, given the nature of the threat we are dealing with right now, of being prepared to take quick, firm and decisive action if we deem that is necessary to save lives."" Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie pressed the first minister on delays in the contact tracing system, saying it was ""alarming"" and ""dangerous"" that in the past week 567 people had waited more than two days to get a call from Test and Protect. Ms Sturgeon said the system was ""working incredibly well"" but accepted that ""the turnaround time is not as quick as we want it to be"".

"London rules 'put 250,000 hospitality jobs at risk'","Tougher Tier 2 Covid restrictions will put up to 250,000 jobs at risk in London's hospitality sector, according to the industry's trade body. From Saturday, households will not be allowed to mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said that without additional government support thousands of jobs in the capital will go. ""It will be absolutely catastrophic,"" she told the BBC. Ms Nicholls has written to the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning that elevating the capital's coronavirus risk level ""will be incredibly damaging without additional financial support"". Job Support Scheme: What is changing after furlough? 'Pubs and restaurants facing jobs cliff edge' Heineken forced pubs to stock too many of its beers She said hospitality businesses should be excluded from paying for part of the new Job Support Scheme (JSS), which replaces furlough in November. Under JSS, a company pays up to 55% of an employee's wage with the government contributing 22%. To access the scheme, a person will also have to work at least a third of their normal hours. Businesses that have to shut under the more stringent Tier 3 restrictions - such as those in Liverpool - will see the government pay 67% of a worker's wage. The employer does not have to pay towards the salary. Ms Nicholls said: ""It is imperative that the employer contribution of the Job Support Scheme is removed from all hospitality businesses, as all are facing restrictions. ""From 1 November it is really uncertain whether our businesses will be able to access the new Job Support Scheme but in any case that requires businesses to be able to pay 55% of wages and hospitality just can't afford to do that with no revenues. ""So you've got a real squeezed middle in Tier 2 with next to no help, maximum restrictions and no alternative but job losses."" Greene King cuts 800 jobs as pub curfew hits trade Harvester owner consulting on job cuts The hospitality sector has been one of the worst hit by the pandemic and many firms are cutting jobs as the current furlough scheme winds up at the end of October. On Thursday, pub group Marston's said it would axe up to 2,150 furloughed jobs following new restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The company said that since 4 July it had reopened 99% of its pubs and ""consumer confidence increased steadily throughout July, August and into September"". However, it said new restrictions such as the 10pm curfew, table-only service and the closure of pubs in some areas of Scotland had undermined consumer confidence. By Sima Kotecha, BBC business presenter It's inevitable that we'll see more businesses follow in Marston's footsteps in the coming days and weeks. When the government's furlough scheme ends this month, businesses are likely to let people go as they simply can't afford paying their wages without the same level of state support. For those companies in the harshest restriction zones, the government has said it will provide two-thirds of workers' wages if they're forced to shut down. But for Marston's, the less generous offer isn't enough for them to keep many of their staff on their books. No trade for weeks, and now another forced lockdown is destroying not just businesses but the lives of those who once worked for them. Commenting on how restrictions had impacted its business, Marston's said it has 21 pubs in Scotland, of which eight are currently closed. It also has 18 pubs in the ""highest risk"" Liverpool region, the majority of which can serve food so therefore can remain open. ""The additional restrictions which have been applied across the UK most recently present significant challenges to us and will make business more difficult for a period of time,"" said Marston's boss Ralph Findlay. He said he regretted the job cuts, but that they were ""an inevitable consequence of the limitations placed upon our business"".

Biden article reignites social media bias claims,"The way Twitter communicated its handling of a controversial article about US presidential hopeful Joe Biden was ""unacceptable"", its chief has said. On Wednesday, Twitter prevented people from posting links to a New York Post story, warning those trying to click it that the link was ""potentially unsafe"". It only later explained it had limited sharing because the story contained ""hacked materials"". Facebook also took action, limiting the report's distribution in its news feed. It said it had done this as part of a ""standard process"" to give third-party fact-checkers time to review the content and decide if it should be treated as misinformation. However, it is highly unusual for an article published by one of the mainstream popular newspapers to be treated in this way. It is now less than three weeks until Mr Biden, the Democratic candidate, faces the Republican incumbent Donald Trump in the presidential election on 3 November. The moves by Twitter and Facebook have renewed accusations of social media censorship and bias. The New York Post article contained screenshots of emails allegedly sent and received by Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son. It also contained personal, intimate photos of Hunter Biden, allegedly taken from a laptop computer that was given to a repair shop. Twitter said discussing the claims in the New York Post article was not against its rules, but it had imposed restrictions on the article because it exposed private information such as email addresses and exposed material obtained by ""hacking"". Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, acknowledged that it should have informed users as to why it had intervened sooner. ""Our communication around our actions on the @nypost article was not great. And blocking URL [website link] sharing via tweet or DM [direct message] with zero context as to why we're blocking: unacceptable,"" he tweeted. The Senate Judiciary Committee now plans to vote on Tuesday whether to force Mr Dorsey to appear before it three days later to answer questions about the affair. Several Republican members have already said they will vote in favour. ""Never before have we seen the censorship of a major outlet's reporting,"" said Ted Cruz, the Republican senator for Texas. ""Big Tech crossed a line and must be held accountable."" The article focused on an email from April 2015, in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet Joe Biden in Washington. It did not provide evidence that the meeting ever took place, and the Biden election campaign says it did not. Hunter Biden joined the board of directors of the energy company in 2014, while his father was US vice-president. He stepped down from the company in 2019. ""We have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,"" it said. ""Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing,"" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. ""Trump administration officials have attested to these facts under oath."" The emails and photos of Hunter Biden were allegedly obtained from a MacBook Pro that was taken to a repair shop in April 2019. The device was never collected by its owner, but the store owner made a copy of the hard drive. On Wednesday, Twitter stopped people from posting links to the article, and would display an error message saying: ""We can't complete this request because this link has been identified by Twitter or our partners as being potentially harmful."" People were also stopped from sending the article in a private direct message, and they were warned that the link was ""potentially unsafe"" if they tried to click it or retweet a copy that had already been posted on Twitter. Twitter has now explained that the article violated its private information policy, and its hacked material policy. The New York Post article contained screenshots of Hunter Biden's emails that exposed personal email addresses. It also contained personal and intimate photographs of Hunter Biden which had been taken from the copied hard drive, the New York Post said. Twitter said discussing the article or the allegations made in it was not against its rules. Twitter said: ""We know we have more work to do to provide clarity in our product when we enforce our rules in this manner."" This is the latest escalation in two battles. The first is social media's fight against misinformation - especially ahead of the US election. Pressure has been growing on Twitter and Facebook to tackle political disinformation and interference - but this raises big questions about how much they should or should not do. This is the first time Twitter has so comprehensively limited the spread of information from a mainstream news outlet. For Facebook, it is less of a departure. It often slows down the spread of stories when there are questions about their veracity, so that third-party fact checkers can have a look. The second battle going on here is between the companies - especially Twitter - and President Trump. The president and his supporters have repeatedly accused Big Tech of silencing right-wing voices - and this latest move will fuel those claims. Twitter chief Jack Dorsey explained how the company's action was driven by concerns about private details in the story, and the network's rules about hacked material. But given that its reasoning was not explained immediately, Republicans have been left outraged at Twitter's move. Twitter's actions have fuelled claims that social networks are biased against conservatives. US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of 'Smoking Gun' emails."" The president also told a rally that Twitter had locked the personal account of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany ""for reporting the truth"" after she shared details of the New York Post's article. Twitter confirmed that it had required Ms McEnany to delete a tweet to regain access to her account. The Trump campaign posted a screenshot as evidence that Kayleigh McEnany's account was locked The president has also repeated a call to ""repeal section 230"", a legal protection that stops websites being held responsible for what their users post. Mr Trump has previously indicated that he would like social media websites to be treated as publishers, if they exercise control over what users are allowed to post. The New York Post itself has accused the social networks of promoting the Biden campaign, publishing an editorial in which it claimed: ""Facebook and Twitter are not media platforms. They're propaganda machines."" The official Twitter account for the Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee tweeted they had posted a copy of the New York Post article on their own website and encouraged users to share a link to it. Twitter now also prevents users from posting this link.

Greater Manchester 'fighting back' against Tier 3Mayor Andy Burnham says leaders are 'fighting back for fairness' in talks with the government.UK,"This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" for the government's lockdown strategy Greater Manchester is ""fighting back for fairness"" and will ""stand firm"" against government plans to move it into the highest level of Covid measures, the mayor has said. Labour Mayor Andy Burnham said local leaders were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of ""flawed and unfair"" Tier 3 rules. But the health secretary said they must ""set aside party politics"". Meanwhile, other parts of England willmove into Tier 2 from Saturday. Measures under Tier 3 - a very high alert level - include pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Mr Burnham said they would amount to a ""punishing lockdown"" without ""proper support"" for the people and businesses affected. What are the Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 lockdown rules? Gym fined for refusing to close in Covid shutdown Circuit-breaker lockdown 'likely for Wales' Ministers ""are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and a large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work,"" he told a press briefing. ""Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are being set up as the canaries in the coal mine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy as an attempt to prevent the expense of what is truly needed."" He added: ""This is an important moment. Greater Manchester will stand firm. We are fighting back for fairness and for the health of our people in the broadest sense."" But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said local leaders should ""set aside party politics"" and work with the government, with cases rising ""exponentially"" in the north west of England. ""This is a time for people to come together so that we can control this virus,"" he said. He added that an ""unprecedented package of support"" has been put forward, and that the government favoured a regional approach to restrictions because ""there are different levels of virus in different parts of the country"". Earlier, he told MPs that discussions with local leaders ""in Greater Manchester, in Lancashire, and elsewhere"" were ongoing - including ""what financial support is needed"". Andy Burnham and other leaders in Greater Manchester are clearly furious that more support isn't on the table for the area. They are standing firm against the government's plans. The decision here ultimately lies with central government - they don't need the agreement of local politicians. But they desperately want it. Ministers have been stung by accusations they are treating the north of England differently to the south, and want to share some responsibility for extra measures. At the moment, that seems some way off in Greater Manchester. Discussions continue over whether Lancashire moves into Tier 3. At the moment, local leaders are unsure over whether a final decision will be made tonight. Underthe chancellor's Job Support Scheme, which replaces furlough at the start of November, workers at firms told to shut because of coronavirus rules over the winter will receive at least 67% of their pay from the government. However, leaders in Greater Manchester said they want an 80% furlough scheme for all affected workers, 80% income support for the self-employed and a ""proper compensation scheme for businesses"". ""They have said there's no money left, there's no money for them to put on the table. But, to be honest with you, I don't believe that for one second,"" Mr Burnham told reporters. What Covid tier is my area in? What are the rules in Tier 2 and Tier 3? Why is Liverpool alone in top tier restrictions? Asked whether he was concerned about the public health implications of not moving to Tier 3, he said local leaders ""will take every step necessary"" to stem the spread of Covid-19 and ""wait for further engagement"" with the government. The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert - also known as Tiers 1 to 3, respectively. Mediumalertmeans areas are subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas onhigh alert- including north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas onvery high alert- at present, the Liverpool City Region - face extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. People from different households can still meet in certain outdoor public spaces, such as parks, beaches, the countryside, forests, public gardens, allotments, outdoor sports facilities and playgrounds. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos have also been forced to close.

People from different households can still meet in certain outdoor public spaces, such as parks, beaches, the countryside, forests, public gardens, allotments, outdoor sports facilities and playgrounds. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos have also been forced to close.

Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham is resisting the region moving to Tier 3, ahead of a final decision on this. More than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high-alert restrictions. The areas to go into high alert restrictions this weekend are: London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow in Furness, Cumbria.

It came into effect on Wednesday, and the Liverpool City Region remains the only area currently in the highest tier.

Meanwhile, the NHS Test and Trace system in England recorded its worst week for reaching community contacts since the middle of June. Data showed some 62% of non-household contacts of people who tested positive in the community were reached through the system in the week ending 7 October. This is the lowest success rate since 24 June, down from 67% last week.

Speaking to the BBC, he said the alternative was ""weeks and months of prolonged agony"" in a tiered system. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told MPs in the Commons that a full national lockdown ""stretching for weeks and weeks"" would ""be disastrous for society"", but that a lockdown of between two and three weeks could help ""take back control of the virus"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS providers, said he also favoured this move to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, Labour mayor Sadiq Khan told London's City Hall there was ""simply no other option"" than introducing the new restrictions. He said he will continue to press the government for more financial support, but added that ""we've got a difficult winter ahead"". Concerns have been raised about the impact the restrictions will have on businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector. London has 3,640 pubs and 7,556 restaurants, according to real estate adviser Altus Group, but they will not be eligible for government support available to premises which have been ordered to close.

Emma McClarkin, BBPA chief executive, said pubs were already struggling due to the current restrictions, with the new measures leaving ""most pubs fighting for their very survival"". Nickie Aiken, Tory MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, urged the government to set out an ""exit plan"" for ensuring London is placed back into Tier 1.

The page was written by Joseph Lee,  Sophie Williams, Joshua Cheetham and Alex Kleiderman, and edited by Paulin Kola, Emma Owen and John Hand. We're wrapping our coverage up now, but here are some of today's biggest global developments: It's been a day of fast-moving developments in the UK as the government imposed additional restrictions on some regions to control a rise in cases. By James Wong Some images of the Covid-19 pandemic will last generations â deserted city streets, football games played in empty stadia or world leaders in face masks. For many of us, the most vivid memories may be a little closer to home: queues at the shops, talking to loved ones on mobile screens and bare aisles in the supermarket. I live in the UK where in the early days of the pandemic, grocery store shelves emptied long before we were told to stop going to the pub, schools closed and face masks became mandatory. The severity of what was approaching only hit home for some people when the rice and pasta ran out. Other people around the world were far less fortunate than I was. In Africa,73 million people across 36 countries are deemed acutely food-insecureas a result of Covid-19 by the World Food Programme, compared to half a million in Europe. The pandemic has highlighted how fragile our food chain â from field to fork â really is. But have we learned anything from the experience about food security? And how might we be better prepared next time? Read more here. Earlier we reported an announcement by Grant Shapps that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. The transport secretary also said those returning from the Greek island of Crete will now not need to quarantine. So where can you go without having to self-isolate on return? Check our guide,here.  The latest government figures show the total number of people to have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK has now reached 673,622. And the number of people dying within 28 days of testing positive stands at 43,293. The graphs here show how cases have been rising again in recent weeks - with daily hospital admissions now at a seven-day average of 730.  Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent Israeli police have made arrests at an
ultra-Orthodox wedding which descended into chaos as guests were dragged away
and officers said glass bottles of cooking oil were thrown at them. The celebration broke Covid-19 rules as
it involved âdozensâ of guests, according to police. It took place in a private house in
the settlement of Givat Zeâev in the occupied West Bank. Videos posted on social media,externalshowed
scuffles between officers and guests. One man with a bloodied face was detained
while another was shown bleeding on the ground. Israeli media reported that
people slipped on the cooking oil and fell on broken glass. Family members accused police of
attacking the brideâs brother. The incident comes amid a growing
row between secular and ultra-religious communities over the response to
lockdown rules in Israel, which is starting to turn the tide on a dramatic
surge in the virus. Some ultra-Orthodox politicians
strongly criticised officers for heavy-handed tactics. But police slammed
attacks on their officers saying they were stopping a âgross violationâ of the
rules. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged local leaders to ""set aside party politics"" so that ""people come together so we can control this virus"". He was speaking after the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said he and other representatives in the region were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of Tier 3 restrictions. Mr Hancock said the leaders should ""work with us to put in place the measures that are needed in Greater Manchester - across the North West, so that we can deal with this virus and support people through it"". He said: ""This is a time for people to come together so that we can control this virus."" When asked if there would be a more generous financial package for the area he said ""there has been an unprecedented package of support"", pointing to measures already announced. And when asked if a national circuit-breaker was necessary he said ""what we want to do is take a regional, a local approach because there are different levels of virus in different parts of the country"". With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. Footballer Marcus Rashford helped force a U-turn from the government on providing on free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils in England over the summer holidays - but hislatest appeal to ministersappears to have been turned down. During the coronavirus lockdown the government helped families whose children qualify for free meals. They insisted this would not continue outside of term time - but changed their mind after the England and Manchester United striker's campaign. Now the footballer has launched a petition calling on ministers to go further in tackling child hunger - including providing meals over the Christmas break. It comes as meals are being made available during the breaks to eligible children in Wales. But Downing Street has now indicated that free school meals will not be given to children in England during the holidays. Rashford, who was made an MBE in last week's honours list on the back of his work for vulnerable children,,hit back on Twitter,,externalwriting: ""Merry Christmas kids... It's also not for food banks to feed millions of British children but here we are... This is not going away anytime soon and neither am I..."" As cases and hospital admissions continue to rise across Europe, several countries are rolling out restrictions to ease the stress on healthcare systems and economies. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments on the continent: UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has announced that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. As a result, anyone travelling to the UK from any of the states must quarantine for 14 days. The new measure will come into effect from 04:00 BST on Sunday 18 October. Mr Shapps has also announced that anyone arriving in the UK from the Greek island of Crete will no longer need to follow the 14-day isolation rule. Nicola Sturgeon said she could not ""rule out"" having to take further measures At an earlier virtual meeting of the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Welsh-style ban on people travelling from Covid hotspots in other parts of the UK ""is being considered"". ""Although we have put in place tough measures, we cannot rule out having to go further in the future,"" she said. The travel ban for Wales is expected to come into force at 18:00 BST tomorrow, and affects people living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions of England - which will cover half the population by the weekend - as well as the whole of Northern Ireland and the central belt of Scotland. A further 18,980 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to the latest data. Thegovernment's dashboard,externalalso show another 138 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The figures compare with 19,724 cases and 137 deaths recorded on Wednesday. This video can not be played Over the last few months weâve been told how important it is to wash our hands regularly â for at least 20 seconds â to protect against coronavirus. But with so many different soaps to choose from, how do we work out whatâs best? To mark Global Handwashing Day, Dr Michelle Wong â a beauty blogger with a PhD in chemistry â explains how to find the best soap for your skin when cleaning our hands more regularly, and a trick to get children to wash their hands. Listen toBBC CrowdSciencefor more about how soap works. Authorities in Italy have registered 8,804 new cases during the last 24 hours, beating the previous official high of 7,332 set yesterday. Italy's health ministry also reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths, jumping from 43 on Wednesday, but far less than the peak of the country's outbreak in March and April, when daily death tolls reached more than 900. It comes as infections continue to soar around Europe, prompting the rollout of restrictions in countries like neighbouring France. While Burnham was talking in Manchester, there was news of a likely development in Wales. The BBC has been told that the Welsh Governmentis expected to announce a limited ""circuit breaker"" lockdown in the next few days. A circuit-breaker a short period of time where tighter restrictions are brought in to break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising. It is not yet clear when the announcement will be made, for how long a limited shutdown would last, or which sectors would close. But what is known  is that Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has written to First Minister Mark Drakeford asking him to give businesses time to prepare for such a move.  The Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham concludes his comments by revealing that government ministers suggested there is ""no money left"" for the kind of financial package the local leaders say is necessary before their areas are put into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Burnham, who spoke to health ministers earlier today, said he had been told ""there is no money to put on the table"". He added: ""To be honest with you, I don't believe that for one second. When I look today at some of the fees they are paying to consultants working on the failed test and trace scheme, when I look at the billions that is being thrown at a scheme that isn't working for Greater Manchester, money that has been found for other things this year. ""The argument I am making is... support people right now when they need it because by supporting people  now you will save jobs and businesses that will be able to restart the minute we find a vaccine, the minute the recovery is on."" Burnham says he and other Greater Manchester leaders were told by the deputy chief medical officer  that the ""only certain thing to work is a national lockdown"". But Burnham then points out the government was ""unwilling to do that because of the harm it would do to the national economy"". ""They are willing to sacrifice jobs and businesses here [in north-west England] to try and save them elsewhere,"" Burnham said, adding that they were being treated as ""canaries in the coal mine"" for an ""experimental regional lockdown strategy"". He said the ""very least"" the government needed to do was to offer a furlough scheme with 80% of wages paid, support for the self-employed and help for businesses, the same as that offered to the general population during the first national lockdown from March. Burnham, a former Labour health secretary who has been the Greater Manchester mayor since 2017, said regional leaders had communicated their ""clear and unanimous"" view to the government that it was wrong to put some of poorest parts in England into a ""punishing lockdown"" without adequate support that was ""not certain to control the virus"". Asked whether he thinks the government would impose the Tier 3 restrictions on the region without local agreement, Burnham said: ""We can't simply be treated as second-class citizens. We understand the government's view and wait for further engagement."" He added: ""If the government are convinced this approach will work.... they have to back that properly, fully financially, so it will have a chance of working."" Burnham adds that the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said bringing infection rates down would ""require widespread closures way beyond pubs"". ""They are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts say will not work,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

Family of seven's one-bedroom flat lockdown 'hell',"This video can not be played The family were ""on top of each other"" during lockdown For more than six months, Sarah Wheddon, her partner Chris Hill and five children have been living in a privately rented one-bedroom flat, with a garden like a ""prison cell"". Lockdown was ""murder"" she said, with everyone ""on top of each other"". They have had some support from Shelter Cymru, which says Covid-19 has exposed ""huge inequalities"". The Welsh Government said social housing was a top priority and it had invested Â£2bn in affordable homes. Sarah had not long become a first-time mother when mechanic Chris's eldest child Ashanti, 15, came to live with them. The communal yard, including other people's scaffolding poles and planks, was wasp-infested over the summer, says Sarah His three other children came later, just before lockdown. ""I love them all to bits like they were my own. But I didn't expect to have them all under the one-bedroom flat roof,"" said former hairdresser Sarah. Their ground floor flat in Grangetown, Cardiff, has two main rooms - the bedroom and the sitting room - and then a small bathroom and kitchen. ""We're counted as severely overcrowded or homeless,"" the 29-year-old said. The family's sitting room doubles as a bedroom for four of the children, one of whom sleeps on the black flowery foot rest The older children sleep in the sitting room - Ashanti and her 12-year-old sister on the sofas, the six-year-old on a ""foot rest"", and the nine-year-old on the floor. Sarah and Chris's two-year-old girl is currently in a cot in her parents' small double bedroom. Ashanti finds the situation claustrophobic - and has exam stress on the horizon. ""I'm not really getting that much sleep when I'm heading into my GCSEs now. It's kind of hard for me."" ""I don't really have much room to study - there's not really any rooms I can do my studying in."" They do not have enough seats for everyone, and someone has to sit on the floor to eat. Outside they share a dark ""grubby and slippy"" concrete back yard with other flats. It is home to piles of scaffolding poles and planks that do not belong to them, and they could hardly go out this summer because of a wasp nest. Fifteen-year-old Ashanti is not sleeping properly and has nowhere to study for her GCSEs Sarah no longer has a paid job because she suffers from chronic pain conditionfibromyalgia,external, and their childcare costs would be unaffordable. She said she was worried about the impact of such an overcrowded environment on the children. ""It's been hell. It's not fair on the kids at all. It put a lot of strain on the family. ""They're not sleeping properly at all. It's affecting their schoolwork as well. Their personalities are changing because of it because they've got no space."" She said there would be no way they could isolate from each other within the house if one of them fell ill with coronavirus. Covid: Circuit breaker preparations under way in Wales Wales' local coronavirus lockdowns: What are the rules? Coronavirus: Housing upgrades urged to create thousands of jobs Sarah said they would not be able to isolate from each other if one of them became ill with coronavirus Shelter Cymru has carried out a survey which it said showed how poor-quality housing affected people's health and made it harder to avoid the virus. They have now called for 20,000 new social homes to be built over the next five years. Their survey suggested: One in 10 of all households with children - equivalent to 63,000 children across Wales - had no access to a private or communal garden between March and June Eighteen per cent of families, or around 114,000 children, did not have computer access or a home broadband connection Only 42% of private tenants said they would be able to self-isolate effectively in their home Thirty-two per cent of families with children experienced problems in their home during lockdown such as damp, mould, electrical hazards, and leaking roofs or windows. Fifty-four per cent were unable to get any of the problems resolved An estimated 30,000 children live in homes where parents or guardians have had to choose between paying for food and paying housing costs Jennie Bibbings from the charity said children had been among the hardest hit: ""It is appalling that so many people are living in poor-quality housing which is affecting their mental health and making it harder to avoid the virus."" Cardiff council said there was high demand for ""good quality and affordable accommodation"" in the city, with limited availability of larger family homes. A council spokeswoman said more than 7,740 applicants were on the waiting list for council houses and housing association homes, with more than 4,700 people in ""significant housing"" need due to overcrowded accommodation, medical needs or homelessness. ""We recognise the problems caused by overcrowding in the city and offer a higher priority on the common waiting list for overcrowded families. ""We are currently reviewing the help available to overcrowded families and are developing a range of measures to increase the supply of larger properties,"" she said. Meanwhile the council plans to deliver 2,000 new council homes, 1,000 of which will be completed by 2022. A Welsh Government spokesman said social housing remained a top priority. ""[The Â£2bn] investment is having a significant impact on the delivery of housing that meets the real needs of Welsh communities and we are on track to deliver our ambitious 20,000 affordable homes target this term despite the adverse impact the pandemic has had on the housebuilding sector."" The Welsh Conservative manifesto has pledged a reformed ""right to buy"" from which 100% of receipts would be invested in social housing. They said they would build 40,000 social homes over a decade and protect new-build social homes from sale for at least 10 years. They added that they were committed to building 12,000 houses a year. Plaid Cymru shadow minister for housing Delyth Jewell said they had pledged to create 50,000 homes over a five-year Senedd term, including 30,000 social homes. She said it would be the biggest public housing programme since the 1970s. Planning under way for Covid circuit breaker What can I do during local lockdowns?

By James Wong Some images of the Covid-19 pandemic will last generations â deserted city streets, football games played in empty stadia or world leaders in face masks. For many of us, the most vivid memories may be a little closer to home: queues at the shops, talking to loved ones on mobile screens and bare aisles in the supermarket. I live in the UK where in the early days of the pandemic, grocery store shelves emptied long before we were told to stop going to the pub, schools closed and face masks became mandatory. The severity of what was approaching only hit home for some people when the rice and pasta ran out. Other people around the world were far less fortunate than I was. In Africa,73 million people across 36 countries are deemed acutely food-insecureas a result of Covid-19 by the World Food Programme, compared to half a million in Europe.

ultra-Orthodox wedding which descended into chaos as guests were dragged away
and officers said glass bottles of cooking oil were thrown at them. The celebration broke Covid-19 rules as
it involved âdozensâ of guests, according to police. It took place in a private house in

attacking the brideâs brother. The incident comes amid a growing
row between secular and ultra-religious communities over the response to
lockdown rules in Israel, which is starting to turn the tide on a dramatic
surge in the virus. Some ultra-Orthodox politicians
strongly criticised officers for heavy-handed tactics. But police slammed
attacks on their officers saying they were stopping a âgross violationâ of the

Mr Hancock said the leaders should ""work with us to put in place the measures that are needed in Greater Manchester - across the North West, so that we can deal with this virus and support people through it"". He said: ""This is a time for people to come together so that we can control this virus."" When asked if there would be a more generous financial package for the area he said ""there has been an unprecedented package of support"", pointing to measures already announced.

Footballer Marcus Rashford helped force a U-turn from the government on providing on free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils in England over the summer holidays - but hislatest appeal to ministersappears to have been turned down. During the coronavirus lockdown the government helped families whose children qualify for free meals. They insisted this would not continue outside of term time - but changed their mind after the England and Manchester United striker's campaign. Now the footballer has launched a petition calling on ministers to go further in tackling child hunger - including providing meals over the Christmas break. It comes as meals are being made available during the breaks to eligible children in Wales. But Downing Street has now indicated that free school meals will not be given to children in England during the holidays. Rashford, who was made an MBE in last week's honours list on the back of his work for vulnerable children,,hit back on Twitter,,externalwriting: ""Merry Christmas kids... It's also not for food banks to feed millions of British children but here we are... This is not going away anytime soon and neither am I..."" As cases and hospital admissions continue to rise across Europe, several countries are rolling out restrictions to ease the stress on healthcare systems and economies. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments on the continent: UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has announced that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. As a result, anyone travelling to the UK from any of the states must quarantine for 14 days. The new measure will come into effect from 04:00 BST on Sunday 18 October. Mr Shapps has also announced that anyone arriving in the UK from the Greek island of Crete will no longer need to follow the 14-day isolation rule. Nicola Sturgeon said she could not ""rule out"" having to take further measures At an earlier virtual meeting of the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Welsh-style ban on people travelling from Covid hotspots in other parts of the UK ""is being considered"". ""Although we have put in place tough measures, we cannot rule out having to go further in the future,"" she said. The travel ban for Wales is expected to come into force at 18:00 BST tomorrow, and affects people living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions of England - which will cover half the population by the weekend - as well as the whole of Northern Ireland and the central belt of Scotland.

To mark Global Handwashing Day, Dr Michelle Wong â a beauty blogger with a PhD in chemistry â explains how to find the best soap for your skin when cleaning our hands more regularly, and a trick to get children to wash their hands. Listen toBBC CrowdSciencefor more about how soap works. Authorities in Italy have registered 8,804 new cases during the last 24 hours, beating the previous official high of 7,332 set yesterday. Italy's health ministry also reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths, jumping from 43 on Wednesday, but far less than the peak of the country's outbreak in March and April, when daily death tolls reached more than 900. It comes as infections continue to soar around Europe, prompting the rollout of restrictions in countries like neighbouring France. While Burnham was talking in Manchester, there was news of a likely development in Wales. The BBC has been told that the Welsh Governmentis expected to announce a limited ""circuit breaker"" lockdown in the next few days. A circuit-breaker a short period of time where tighter restrictions are brought in to break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising. It is not yet clear when the announcement will be made, for how long a limited shutdown would last, or which sectors would close. But what is known  is that Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has written to First Minister Mark Drakeford asking him to give businesses time to prepare for such a move.  The Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham concludes his comments by revealing that government ministers suggested there is ""no money left"" for the kind of financial package the local leaders say is necessary before their areas are put into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Burnham, who spoke to health ministers earlier today, said he had been told ""there is no money to put on the table"". He added: ""To be honest with you, I don't believe that for one second. When I look today at some of the fees they are paying to consultants working on the failed test and trace scheme, when I look at the billions that is being thrown at a scheme that isn't working for Greater Manchester, money that has been found for other things this year. ""The argument I am making is... support people right now when they need it because by supporting people  now you will save jobs and businesses that will be able to restart the minute we find a vaccine, the minute the recovery is on."" Burnham says he and other Greater Manchester leaders were told by the deputy chief medical officer  that the ""only certain thing to work is a national lockdown"". But Burnham then points out the government was ""unwilling to do that because of the harm it would do to the national economy"". ""They are willing to sacrifice jobs and businesses here [in north-west England] to try and save them elsewhere,"" Burnham said, adding that they were being treated as ""canaries in the coal mine"" for an ""experimental regional lockdown strategy"". He said the ""very least"" the government needed to do was to offer a furlough scheme with 80% of wages paid, support for the self-employed and help for businesses, the same as that offered to the general population during the first national lockdown from March. Burnham, a former Labour health secretary who has been the Greater Manchester mayor since 2017, said regional leaders had communicated their ""clear and unanimous"" view to the government that it was wrong to put some of poorest parts in England into a ""punishing lockdown"" without adequate support that was ""not certain to control the virus"". Asked whether he thinks the government would impose the Tier 3 restrictions on the region without local agreement, Burnham said: ""We can't simply be treated as second-class citizens. We understand the government's view and wait for further engagement."" He added: ""If the government are convinced this approach will work.... they have to back that properly, fully financially, so it will have a chance of working."" Burnham adds that the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said bringing infection rates down would ""require widespread closures way beyond pubs"". ""They are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts say will not work,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"London, Essex, York and other areas move to Tier 2These areas face tougher restrictions from Saturday, including a ban on households mixing indoors.","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Things will get worse before they get better"" Millions of people in London, Essex, York and other areas face tougher Tier 2 Covid measures from Saturday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Under this ""high"" alert level, there is a ban on households mixing indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham is resisting the region moving to Tier 3, ahead of a final decision on this. More than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high-alert restrictions. The areas to go into high alert restrictions this weekend are: London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow in Furness, Cumbria. As unitary authorities,Southend and Thurrock councils are not included in the move,externaland will remain in Tier 1, Essex County Council has said. How will millions cope with new Tier 2 rules? Check the restrictions where you live How does England's tier system work? The health secretary said ""things will get worse before they get better"". ""Now, I know that these measures are not easy but I also know that they are vital,"" Mr Hancock told MPs. ""Responding to this unprecedented pandemic requires difficult choices, some of the most difficult choices any government has to make in peacetime."" On Thursday, a further18,980 cases and 138 deaths,externalwithin 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK. The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert - also known as Tiers 1 to 3, respectively. It came into effect on Wednesday, and the Liverpool City Region remains the only area currently in the highest tier. Meanwhile, the government announced thattravellers returning to the UK from Italy, Vatican City and San Marino must self-isolate for 14 daysfrom 04:00 BST on Sunday. This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules Discussions are continuing over whether Greater Manchester will be moved into the highest tier of restrictions, with a financial support package yet to be finalised. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Mr Burnham said the region's leaders were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of Tier 3 measures, calling the government's plans ""flawed and unfair"". He said: ""They are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and a large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work."" Repeating his calls for a financial support package for parts of the North West, he added: ""Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are being set up as the canaries in the coalmine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy as an attempt to prevent the expense of what is truly needed. ""The very least they should be offering the people of Greater Manchester who will be affected by these closures is a full and fair 80% furlough for all affected workers, 80% income support for people who are self-employed and a proper compensation scheme for businesses."" This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is one of those ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" Tier 3 involves pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor hospitality venues and ticketed events. Mr Hancock confirmed in the Commons that no decision had been made on moving more regions to Tier 3, but added ""we need to make rapid progress"". Meanwhile, the NHS Test and Trace system in England recorded its worst week for reaching community contacts since the middle of June. Data showed some 62% of non-household contacts of people who tested positive in the community were reached through the system in the week ending 7 October. This is the lowest success rate since 24 June, down from 67% last week. Asked about the latest data, the PM's spokesman said tests were being provided on an ""unprecedented scale"" and No 10 was still workingto raise capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Circuit-breaker lockdown 'likely for Wales' Scotland 'will not return to normal' when pubs reopen London rules 'put 250,000 hospitality jobs at risk' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has defended his call for a nationwide ""circuit-breaker"" - a short limited lockdown - to stem rising infection rates, saying""no region will be immune"" from Covid-19. Speaking to the BBC, he said the alternative was ""weeks and months of prolonged agony"" in a tiered system. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told MPs in the Commons that a full national lockdown ""stretching for weeks and weeks"" would ""be disastrous for society"", but that a lockdown of between two and three weeks could help ""take back control of the virus"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS providers, said he also favoured this move to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, Labour mayor Sadiq Khan told London's City Hall there was ""simply no other option"" than introducing the new restrictions. He said he will continue to press the government for more financial support, but added that ""we've got a difficult winter ahead"". Concerns have been raised about the impact the restrictions will have on businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector. London has 3,640 pubs and 7,556 restaurants, according to real estate adviser Altus Group, but they will not be eligible for government support available to premises which have been ordered to close. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan says there is ""simply no other option"" as London moves to Tier 2 restrictions The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), the trade association for Britain's brewing and pub sector, said Tier 2 restrictions without a ""proper package of support"" would ""decimate"" pubs. Emma McClarkin, BBPA chief executive, said pubs were already struggling due to the current restrictions, with the new measures leaving ""most pubs fighting for their very survival"". Nickie Aiken, Tory MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, urged the government to set out an ""exit plan"" for ensuring London is placed back into Tier 1. She said she remained ""deeply concerned about the impact further lockdown will have on the capital's hospitality, leisure and retail businesses"". Robert Halfon, Conservative MP for Harlow in Essex, said he welcomed Tier 2 measures for the county but would call on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to prevent businesses suffering financially. Liverpool is consideringa two-week half-term break for schoolsas part of its ""battle with Covid-19"". Under the plan, backed by a teaching union, pupils would be taught remotely at home for the second week of the break.

"No Tier 3 Covid deal yet, say Manchester leadersGreater Manchester is among the areas that could be moved to the ""very high"" coronavirus alert level.UK","A final decision has not yet been made on whether Greater Manchester will move into the highest level of Covid measures, local MPs have told the BBC. A financial package has not been finalised, with local leaders expressing concerns about the impact on the hospitality industry. Tier 3 involves pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Meanwhile, other parts of England willmove into Tier 2 from Saturday. Under this ""high"" alert level, the regions will face restrictions on meeting indoors. It means more than half of England's population will be living under Tier 2 or 3 restrictions. Talks between the government and officials in Greater Manchester and Lancashirewere taking place on Thursday morningabout moving to Tier 3 or the ""very high"" alert level. Why is Liverpool alone in top tier restrictions? What can and can't you do where you live? How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Speaking in the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said discussions with local leaders in other parts of the country ""in Greater Manchester, in Lancashire, and elsewhere"" were ongoing - including ""what financial support is needed"". But he told MPs he wanted to see ""rapid progress"" on the issue, and said ""we have put in place unprecedented support [for] those affected"". He added: ""Let us be under no illusions about the danger posed by this virus. ""Coronavirus is deadly and it is now spreading exponentially in the UK."" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has been resisting following the Liverpool City Region into Tier 3 restrictions, which he has described as unfair and a threat to jobs and businesses. Shadow foreign secretary and Labour MP for Wigan Lisa Nandy said ""despite repeated attempts to claim we're divided"" there was ""total unity"" from Conservative and Labour Greater Manchester MPs on a call with Downing Street officials on Thursday morning. Shetweeted,external: ""We will support evidence based interventions with adequate financial support. We will not support this chaos."" Oldham Council leader Sean Fielding described the meeting as a ""masterclass in how not to"" hold negotiations. He said the government's ""opening line"" was that Tier 3 would be implemented with local leaders or imposed, with ""nothing... to bring us on side because 'there is no money'"". Meanwhile, Labour's Andrew Gwynne, the MP for Denton and Reddish,tweeted,externalthat the briefing ""was utterly pointless"". ""While they claim 'no decision on Tier 3' we know it was being heavily briefed,"" he said. ""The strength of feeling was strong from Tory and Labour MPs alike. The minister needs to listen: we are a city united."" This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert - also known as Tiers 1 to 3, respectively. Mediumalertmeans areas are subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas onhigh alert- including north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas onvery high alertface extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. People from different households can still meet in certain outdoor public spaces, such as parks, beaches, the countryside, forests, public gardens, allotments, outdoor sports facilities and playgrounds. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos have also been forced to close. Workers at firms told to shut because of coronavirus rules over the winter will receive at least two-thirds of their pay from the government,under the Job Support Schemeannounced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak. This means the scheme - which replaces furlough at the start of November for six months - will pay those people who can't go to work because pubs and restaurants have been closed under ''very high'' Tier 3 coronavirus restrictions. Until then, workers are in line for up to 80% of their pay - 20% from their employer and 60% from the government - if their premises must close, or if there isn't enough for them to do. In a meeting on Wednesday, health officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) suggested that Greater Manchester along with much of north-east and north-west England and parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands should be moved into the top tier. Meanwhile,schools in Northern Ireland will close from Mondayand pubs and restaurants face new restrictions from Friday. Wales is preparing to ban people from parts of the UK that have high rates of coronavirusfrom travelling to the countryfrom 18:00 BST on Friday. And in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has advised Scots against travelling to high risk areas of England,singling out Blackpool as being linked to ""a large and growing number"" of Covid-19 cases in her country. On Wednesday, a further 19,724 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK, while 137 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. How will the new measures affect you?

"Biden article reignites social media bias claimsTwitter's chief says the way it communicated its decision to restrict an article was ""unacceptable"".Technology","The way Twitter communicated its handling of a controversial article about US presidential hopeful Joe Biden was ""unacceptable"", its chief has said. On Wednesday, Twitter prevented people from posting links to a New York Post story, warning those trying to click it that the link was ""potentially unsafe"". It only later explained it had limited sharing because the story contained ""hacked materials"". Facebook also took action, limiting the report's distribution in its news feed. It said it had done this as part of a ""standard process"" to give third-party fact-checkers time to review the content and decide if it should be treated as misinformation. However, it is highly unusual for an article published by one of the mainstream popular newspapers to be treated in this way. It is now less than three weeks until Mr Biden, the Democratic candidate, faces the Republican incumbent Donald Trump in the presidential election on 3 November. The moves by Twitter and Facebook have renewed accusations of social media censorship and bias. The New York Post article contained screenshots of emails allegedly sent and received by Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son. It also contained personal, intimate photos of Hunter Biden, allegedly taken from a laptop computer that was given to a repair shop. Twitter said discussing the claims in the New York Post article was not against its rules, but it had imposed restrictions on the article because it exposed private information such as email addresses and exposed material obtained by ""hacking"". Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, acknowledged that it should have informed users as to why it had intervened sooner. ""Our communication around our actions on the @nypost article was not great. And blocking URL [website link] sharing via tweet or DM [direct message] with zero context as to why we're blocking: unacceptable,"" he tweeted. The Senate Judiciary Committee now plans to vote on Tuesday whether to force Mr Dorsey to appear before it three days later to answer questions about the affair. Several Republican members have already said they will vote in favour. ""Never before have we seen the censorship of a major outlet's reporting,"" said Ted Cruz, the Republican senator for Texas. ""Big Tech crossed a line and must be held accountable."" The article focused on an email from April 2015, in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet Joe Biden in Washington. It did not provide evidence that the meeting ever took place, and the Biden election campaign says it did not. Hunter Biden joined the board of directors of the energy company in 2014, while his father was US vice-president. He stepped down from the company in 2019. ""We have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,"" it said. ""Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing,"" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. ""Trump administration officials have attested to these facts under oath."" The emails and photos of Hunter Biden were allegedly obtained from a MacBook Pro that was taken to a repair shop in April 2019. The device was never collected by its owner, but the store owner made a copy of the hard drive. On Wednesday, Twitter stopped people from posting links to the article, and would display an error message saying: ""We can't complete this request because this link has been identified by Twitter or our partners as being potentially harmful."" People were also stopped from sending the article in a private direct message, and they were warned that the link was ""potentially unsafe"" if they tried to click it or retweet a copy that had already been posted on Twitter. Twitter has now explained that the article violated its private information policy, and its hacked material policy. The New York Post article contained screenshots of Hunter Biden's emails that exposed personal email addresses. It also contained personal and intimate photographs of Hunter Biden which had been taken from the copied hard drive, the New York Post said. Twitter said discussing the article or the allegations made in it was not against its rules. Twitter said: ""We know we have more work to do to provide clarity in our product when we enforce our rules in this manner."" This is the latest escalation in two battles. The first is social media's fight against misinformation - especially ahead of the US election. Pressure has been growing on Twitter and Facebook to tackle political disinformation and interference - but this raises big questions about how much they should or should not do. This is the first time Twitter has so comprehensively limited the spread of information from a mainstream news outlet. For Facebook, it is less of a departure. It often slows down the spread of stories when there are questions about their veracity, so that third-party fact checkers can have a look. The second battle going on here is between the companies - especially Twitter - and President Trump. The president and his supporters have repeatedly accused Big Tech of silencing right-wing voices - and this latest move will fuel those claims. Twitter chief Jack Dorsey explained how the company's action was driven by concerns about private details in the story, and the network's rules about hacked material. But given that its reasoning was not explained immediately, Republicans have been left outraged at Twitter's move. Twitter's actions have fuelled claims that social networks are biased against conservatives. US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of 'Smoking Gun' emails."" The president also told a rally that Twitter had locked the personal account of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany ""for reporting the truth"" after she shared details of the New York Post's article. Twitter confirmed that it had required Ms McEnany to delete a tweet to regain access to her account. The Trump campaign posted a screenshot as evidence that Kayleigh McEnany's account was locked The president has also repeated a call to ""repeal section 230"", a legal protection that stops websites being held responsible for what their users post. Mr Trump has previously indicated that he would like social media websites to be treated as publishers, if they exercise control over what users are allowed to post. The New York Post itself has accused the social networks of promoting the Biden campaign, publishing an editorial in which it claimed: ""Facebook and Twitter are not media platforms. They're propaganda machines."" The official Twitter account for the Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee tweeted they had posted a copy of the New York Post article on their own website and encouraged users to share a link to it. Twitter now also prevents users from posting this link.

Post-virus housing upgrades urged to boost jobs,"This video can not be played There would need to be 50,000 homes transformed a year until 2050, experts say Thousands of old homes should be ""retro-fitted"" with energy-saving improvements to create jobs as part of the economic recovery from coronavirus, housing bodies have urged. Better insulation and the latest energy-efficient technology could cut bills and help tackle climate change. The Federation of Master Builders wants Wales to push ahead with a programme. The Welsh Government said housing had an important role in the ""green recovery"" after Covid-19. These new solar-powered timber homes in Pembrokeshire demonstrate the technology in new developments Ifan Glyn, director of FMB Cymru, said Wales had the oldest housing stock in Europe but investing in an energy efficiency upgrade programme would ""turbocharge"" the building industry. ""Retrofitting ticks all the boxes: it creates good quality jobs and boosts economic growth whilst also helping to tackle fuel poverty and climate change,"" he added. Over the next 10 years, a national retrofit programme should focus on council houses, social housing and privately-owned homes in fuel poverty, a Welsh Government advisory group on the decarbonisation of homes has suggested. That is 300,000 (21%) of Wales' 1.4 million homes. An independent review on decarbonising homes in Wales, published last year,external, found that 12% of homes are in fuel poverty. Christopher Jofeh, chair of the advisory group, said: ""It's a huge challenge, because we've got almost 1.4 million homes so that would mean 50,000 homes being done each year. ""Costs will be high and there will be lots of people who can't afford it so we would need public money to do that. I have no doubt that if the Welsh Government announced a 10-year programme that the industry would respond."" He added: ""To focus on costs alone is to miss the bigger picture, which is the benefits such as reduced fuel bills, reduced green house gases, increased employment, improvements in health for people living in cold, damp homes and enormous tax revenues for the Treasury to pay for public services improvements. ""Yes, it's expensive but it's necessary and it would deliver enormous benefits.""  32%of Welsh homes were built before 1919 43%in private rented accommodation are
in pre-1919 homes Â£0.5bn to Â£1bnretrofit spending suggested per year for the next 10 years In 2019, the Welsh minister for environment, energy and rural affairs declared the ambition ""to bring forward a target for Wales to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050"". Some local authorities have already started work to introduce the latest carbon neutral technology to their existing housing stock. A row of bungalows in the Swansea valley have recently undergone a retrofit by the council A row of council-owned bungalows at Craig-cefn-parc near Clydach in the Swansea valley which used oil, LPG and electric heaters, have now been retro-fitted with insulated wall rendering. They also have a system which circulates filtered air through ceiling vents and a Tesla battery which stores electricity generated by solar panels. Community Housing Cymru said the pandemic had ""shone a light"" on the importance of a good home for everyone's wellbeing, and housing must now be ""at the heart of Welsh Government's plans for the economic recovery in Wales"". It said it could create 50,000 new jobs, Â£1.8bn fuel savings for tenants and deliver more than Â£23.2bn of economic activity over the next 20 years. ""Poor quality housing costs the Welsh NHS more than Â£95m each year, and investment in housing associations is key to deliver the high quality, affordable homes Wales needs to tackle this,"" a spokesman said. Call to 'cautiously reopen' Wales' housing market Welsh self-build housing scheme 'world first' Clean energy to power all new Welsh homes from 2025 The Welsh Government said: ""We are committed to a green recovery from the pandemic which creates a fairer Wales - housing has an important role to play in achieving this."" It said its Innovative Housing Programme funded the development of new models of social housing models and it would be announcing details of an extensive new programme to retrofit existing homes with energy efficiency measures. ""Later this year, we will also be consulting on a new plan to tackle fuel poverty, which will include continued investment in the Warm Homes Programme and exploring new ways to help reduce fuel poverty and improve home energy efficiency,"" a spokesman added.

EU leaders to call for UK trade talks to continue,"This video can not be played ""A few words on Brexit"" â EU leaders' views from the summit EU leaders have called for post-Brexit trade talks to continue beyond the end of the week - the deadline suggested by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. At a two-day summit in Brussels beginning on Thursday, they called on the UK to ""make the necessary moves"" towards a deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said fresh ""intensive"" talks should aim to reach a deal around the end of October. But his UK counterpart said he was ""disappointed"" by the EU's approach. Lord David Frost tweeted the EU was expecting ""all future moves"" for a deal to come from the UK, which he called an ""unusual approach to conducting a negotiation"". He added the prime minister would react to the EU's position as the summit wraps up on Friday. PM 'disappointed' with pre-summit trade progress Nine moments that explain where Brexit has got to What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Both sides are calling on each other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and limits on government subsidies to businesses. They are seeking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in December. Following the talks on Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""in some places there was movement, in other places there is still a lot of work to do."" ""We have asked Great Britain to continue to be willing to compromise towards an agreement. Of course, this also means that we have to make compromises,"" she told reporters. European Council President Charles Michel said the EU would decide whether talks should continue in the coming days, based on the UK's next move. Mr Barnier said negotiations were ""not finished"", and the EU was ready to accelerate talks from Monday for the ""two or three weeks that remain before us"". Earlier, in aconclusions document,externalissued during the summit, the EU said progress in key areas was currently ""not sufficient"" to reach a deal. It asked Mr Barnier to ""continue negotiations in the coming weeks"". The formal written conclusions of EU leaders' Brexit meeting seemed harsher than expected. They insisted it was up to the UK to make ""the necessary moves"" for a deal to be reached. No hint that the EU too was preparing to compromise - and words matter in these highly sensitive negotiations. The UK's chief negotiator immediately took to Twitter to object. He also noted that, while EU leaders had called for negotiations to continue, their document didn't describe them as ""intensive"" talks. Minutes after, the European Commission tweeted that its chief negotiator Michel Barnier had called for two weeks of intensive talk to start as of Monday. So what do we learn from this confused war of words? Negotiations are drawing to a close, difficult political compromises loom for both sides, tempers are frayed, and time is tight. All eyes are on Boris Johnson on Friday, when he has promised to announce the UK's next move. As the summit got under way, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would be self-isolating for the second time in a month after a member of her staff tested positive for Covid-19. In a tweet, she added she had tested negative herself but would be leaving the summit ""as a precaution"". Arriving at the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron said his country's fishermen would not ""in any situation"" be ""sacrificed to Brexit"". ""We didn't choose Brexit. Preserving access for our fishermen to British waters is an important point for us,"" he told reporters. Mrs von der Leyen (R) left the summit early after exchanging views with EU leaders. The Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a deal was still possible ""within the timeframe available to us"". He told the BBC a no-deal outcome would represent a ""significant additional shock to our societies"" on top of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""That is a motivating factor in seeking to arrive at a comprehensive deal,"" he added. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: """"It would be crazy for the outside world if the UK and the EU will not be able to come to an agreement"". Over the summer, both the UK and EU seemed to agree the end of October was the final date to get a deal done - allowing enough time for it to be ratified before 31 December. But come 7 September, Boris Johnson decided to shorten the deadline. Hesaid,externalif a deal wasn't reached by 15 October, ""then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on"". Thursday was that day - but Downing Street appears to have moved back from it as a hard deadline. Formal negotiations ended at the start of October, but Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen pledged to ""intensify talks"" over the coming weeks. Pressed on whether the UK would walk away on 15 October, the government's chief negotiator Lord Frost said it was his job to ""advise the prime minister"" on whether a deal was on the cards by then. By remaining in the bloc's single market and customs union, the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules during its post-Brexit transition period. This 11-month period is due to end in December, and the UK has ruled out seeking an extension. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, initially via video link before in-person discussions resumed over the summer. If a deal is not done, the UK will trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the World Trade Organization.

Bride 'refused Â£16k deposit for cancelled wedding',"Alisha Rehman married her husband in a small ceremony earlier this year A bride whose dream wedding plans were derailed by Covid-19 has said she is being denied her Â£16,000 deposit. Alisha Rehman, 25, from Birmingham, was due to get married at Excellency Midlands' venue in Telford in July in a 500-person ceremony. Official rules say couples affected by government restrictionshave a right to refunds,external, but getting money back has proved difficult. Excellency Midlands said the whole sector had been left ""on hold"". Mrs Rehman cancelled her booking when restrictions were brought in and got married in a small ceremony in her mother-in-law's garden. She said the pandemic meant it was not certain when a large-scale event could be held. Excellency Midlands hit the headlines last month when police found 120 guests at a post-wedding party at its venue. It wasfined Â£10,000 and banned from hosting weddingsduring government measures. Currently only 15 people can attend weddings in England, but Excellency Midlands was fined after it hosted a party for 120 people last month Couples up and down the country have faced similar decisions to Mrs Rehman - whether or not to cancel. Official figures suggest 73,600 weddings and civil partnership ceremonieshave been affected by restrictions. ""My wedding was initially booked for July, then because of the pandemic, clearly nothing can go ahead,"" she said. ""We've given them Â£16,000 and they are not giving us a penny back."" Mrs Rehman said the package included ""the food, photography, the car, the whole thing"". According to theCompetitions and Markets Authority,external, refunds should be given for weddings that could not take place as planned due to coronavirus. Mrs Rehman and her husband drove to Telford to meet the venue owners to discuss the refund, but she said nobody turned up. They scheduled another meeting and ""still nothing"". What are the rules on weddings? 'I have gone from 65 weddings this year to one' Latest news and updates from the West Midlands ""It's taken my whole life to save that and they're not even giving us a penny,"" Mrs Rehman said. ""It stresses me out... it's just a joke."" She said the firm had instead offered a new date in March 2021. Despite approaches from her solicitor, she said the venue had failed to respond. Where lockdown laws prevent or prevented a wedding from going ahead on the agreed date as planned, the starting point under the law is that the consumer should be offered a full refund, under section 1(2) of the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943. Consumers would be entitled to refunds even where they have paid what the business says are ""non-refundable"" deposits or other advance payments. The wedding business may, however, be able to withhold certain limited amounts for services already provided, like meal tasting, but it needs to provide a breakdown of costs. Read the full CMA statement,external In a statement to BBC News on Thursday, Excellency Midlands said the wedding industry had been badly affected by the pandemic and the whole hospitality sector was ""on hold"". It blamed the government for a lack of ""any directions, help or guidance as to how we are looking to open in the near future"" which meant it was ""impossible"" to provide any clear information to clients. ""We completely understand the difficulty couples, hoping to get married, are in, and want to let them know that we will be supporting them fully, once the industry is back,"" a spokesman said. ""As soon as the government provides a pathway to opening the industry back, we will be contacting all of our loyal customers and making sure they receive the urgent attention we know they deserve.""

Long Covid 'could be four different syndromes',"Continuing symptoms can affect everything from the brain to the heart and the skin ""Long Covid"" - the long-lasting impact of coronavirus infection - may be affecting people in four different ways, according to a review. And this could explain why some of those with continuing symptoms are not being believed or treated. There could be a huge psychological impact on people living with long-term Covid-19,the National Institute for Health Research report,externalsays. They need more support - and healthcare staff require better information. Most people are told they will recover from mild coronavirus infections within two weeks and from more serious disease within three. But the report says thousands could be living with ""ongoing Covid"". And with coronavirus cases rising across the UK, this number is also likely to increase in the coming months. This video can not be played 'It was so serious that I don't know about it': Michael Rosen was put in a coma to fight Covid-19 Based on interviews with 14 members of a long-Covid support group on Facebook and the most recent published research, the review found recurring symptoms affecting everything from breathing, the brain, the heart and cardiovascular system to the kidneys, the gut, the liver and the skin. These symptoms may be due to four different syndromes: permanent organ damage to the lungs and heart post-intensive-care syndrome post-viral fatigue syndrome continuing Covid-19 symptoms Some of those affected have had a long stay in hospital with severe Covid-19 - but others, who have had a mild infection, have never even been tested or diagnosed. The review says coming up with a ""working diagnosis for ongoing Covid-19"" would help people access support. ""It is becoming clear that, for some people, Covid-19 infection is a long-term illness,"" the report says. ""For some, this is related to their rehabilitation following a hospital admission - but others are reporting life-changing experiences that follow an initial infection that they managed at home, with symptoms becoming more severe over time."" Specialist 'long Covid' clinics to be set up 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering? 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' Report author Dr Elaine Maxwell said she had assumed those who had been seriously ill with Covid-19 would be affected the most and those at low risk of death were also at low risk of living with its long-term effects. But the review found this was not the case. ""We now know that there are people with no record of having Covid who are suffering more than someone who was ventilated for several weeks,"" she said. And these debilitating effects on some people could put a ""significant burden on the NHS"". Jo House and her partner Ash are both experiencing ongoing symptoms Jo House, a lecturer at the University of Bristol, has still not returned to work more than six months after being infected. It started with a bad cough and difficulty breathing, but this turned into crushing fatigue and headaches before heart problems and muscle pain took over. ""The other day I got up, was really dizzy, fainted and ended up in A&E,"" she says. Although her racing heart and shortness of breath have improved a bit, her ongoing symptoms are still having a huge impact on her, and her family's, life. Her partner Ash is also experiencing symptoms that won't go away. As a result, her teenage sons have had to take on all the cooking and cleaning. ""Lots of people are classed as having mild symptoms, but it's really not mild at all. We need support,"" she says. Although Jo had pneumonia, she was never tested for the virus and not admitted to hospital. ""We both made wills when we were very ill. It was scary."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? The report calls for support in the community alongside the recently announcedone-stop hospital clinicsfor long Covid. And it says ongoing Covid is likely to have a disproportionate effect on certain groups, such as black or Asian people as well as those with existing mental health problems or learning difficulties. ""Our aim is that healthcare services and staff will use this review to better understand the experiences patients have to deal with, and provide them with the access to treatment, care and support they need,"" Dr Maxwell added.

"Marston's to cut up to 2,150 furloughed pub jobs","Tougher Tier 2 Covid restrictions will put up to 250,000 jobs at risk in London's hospitality sector, according to the industry's trade body. From Saturday, households will not be allowed to mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said that without additional government support thousands of jobs in the capital will go. ""It will be absolutely catastrophic,"" she told the BBC. Ms Nicholls has written to the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning that elevating the capital's coronavirus risk level ""will be incredibly damaging without additional financial support"". Job Support Scheme: What is changing after furlough? 'Pubs and restaurants facing jobs cliff edge' Heineken forced pubs to stock too many of its beers She said hospitality businesses should be excluded from paying for part of the new Job Support Scheme (JSS), which replaces furlough in November. Under JSS, a company pays up to 55% of an employee's wage with the government contributing 22%. To access the scheme, a person will also have to work at least a third of their normal hours. Businesses that have to shut under the more stringent Tier 3 restrictions - such as those in Liverpool - will see the government pay 67% of a worker's wage. The employer does not have to pay towards the salary. Ms Nicholls said: ""It is imperative that the employer contribution of the Job Support Scheme is removed from all hospitality businesses, as all are facing restrictions. ""From 1 November it is really uncertain whether our businesses will be able to access the new Job Support Scheme but in any case that requires businesses to be able to pay 55% of wages and hospitality just can't afford to do that with no revenues. ""So you've got a real squeezed middle in Tier 2 with next to no help, maximum restrictions and no alternative but job losses."" Greene King cuts 800 jobs as pub curfew hits trade Harvester owner consulting on job cuts The hospitality sector has been one of the worst hit by the pandemic and many firms are cutting jobs as the current furlough scheme winds up at the end of October. On Thursday, pub group Marston's said it would axe up to 2,150 furloughed jobs following new restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The company said that since 4 July it had reopened 99% of its pubs and ""consumer confidence increased steadily throughout July, August and into September"". However, it said new restrictions such as the 10pm curfew, table-only service and the closure of pubs in some areas of Scotland had undermined consumer confidence. By Sima Kotecha, BBC business presenter It's inevitable that we'll see more businesses follow in Marston's footsteps in the coming days and weeks. When the government's furlough scheme ends this month, businesses are likely to let people go as they simply can't afford paying their wages without the same level of state support. For those companies in the harshest restriction zones, the government has said it will provide two-thirds of workers' wages if they're forced to shut down. But for Marston's, the less generous offer isn't enough for them to keep many of their staff on their books. No trade for weeks, and now another forced lockdown is destroying not just businesses but the lives of those who once worked for them. Commenting on how restrictions had impacted its business, Marston's said it has 21 pubs in Scotland, of which eight are currently closed. It also has 18 pubs in the ""highest risk"" Liverpool region, the majority of which can serve food so therefore can remain open. ""The additional restrictions which have been applied across the UK most recently present significant challenges to us and will make business more difficult for a period of time,"" said Marston's boss Ralph Findlay. He said he regretted the job cuts, but that they were ""an inevitable consequence of the limitations placed upon our business"". In the 13 weeks since reopening, Marston's said sales were 10% below last year. July recorded the biggest fall, with sales down 26% before turning positive again in August. However, in September, trade dropped by 12%. Mr Findlay also said the company was looking at further reducing its costs and is undergoing a review which will be completed in December. Earlier this week, Mitchells & Butlers said it had begun consultations with some employees about redundancies. Greene King meanwhile has saidit will cut 800 jobsblaming tighter lockdown restrictions.

French police raid officials' homes in virus probe,"Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran (L) and Prime Minister Jean Castex are reportedly under investigation French police have raided the homes of senior government and health officials as part of an investigation into their handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran and the director of the national health agency, JÃ©rÃ´me Salomon, are among those whose properties were searched on Thursday. The raids came after a court launched an inquiry earlier this year into the government's handling of the pandemic. It has faced criticism over shortages of equipment and slow response times. Prime Minister Jean Castex is also under investigation, French media report, as is his predecessor Edouard Philippe and Mr VÃ©ran's predecessor AgnÃ¨s Buzyn. The prime minister and Mr VÃ©ran have been at the forefront of France's new policy of imposing night-time curfews in nine cities, including Paris, from Saturday, which will be enforced by 12,000 police. ""This means at 21:00 everyone must be at home and, without exception, every place, business or public service open to the public will be shut,"" Mr Castex said on Thursday. WHO: Europe restrictions 'absolutely necessary' How to tell which countries are coping best Tracking the global outbreak In July, the court launched the inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemicafter members of the public, including doctors and relatives of victims, alleged that it had been criminally negligent in its response to Covid-19. The special court hears cases of alleged wrongdoing by ministers and other government officials in the course of their duties. But for the claims to be substantiated, there would have to be evidence that officials knowingly failed to take obvious steps that would have saved lives. This video can not be played Emmanuel Macron said the curfew would last for four weeks but could be extended At a news conference on Thursday, Prime Minister Castex said he had ""absolute"" confidence in both Mr VÃ©ran and Mr Salomon. A further 22,951 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Wednesday. ""We have to act. We need to put a brake on the spread of the virus,"" Mr Macron said in a television address. The president added that this wave of Covid-19 was different to the outbreak in the spring because the virus had spread to all parts of France. France managed to control the first outbreak by introducing a national lockdown. It then opened bars and restaurants in the summer, and allowed foreign tourists to visit as part of an effort to boost the ailing economy. Schools reopened and universities began teaching classes in person in early autumn. But since August the number of reported cases has accelerated quickly. Wednesday was the third time in six days that France reported more than 20,000 new infections. Mr Macron said the new measures aimed to reduce daily cases to around 3,000. As with the first wave of Covid-19, there is concern that hospitals and intensive care units will become overwhelmed with patients. The curfew, from 21:00 to 06:00, will apply for at least four weeks to Paris and its suburbs as well as Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Saint-Etienne, Rouen, Toulouse, Grenoble and Montpellier. Affecting around 22 million people, it will be applied for four weeks to begin with and Mr Macron's government will seek to extend it to six. President Macron said the virus has spread to all parts of France now The measures will stop people visiting restaurants and private homes during the evening and night-time. Private parties will be banned, even in areas not under curfew, from midnight on Friday. But there is some scepticism over how effective the curfew might be. ""People were mainly going out to eat out which they will continue to do... until 9pm,"" Lou Mielot, a student at the University of Lyon, told the BBC. ""This will create restaurants that are full from 7pm to 9pm, [where people] won't be able to keep a safe distance,"" she added. Residents will need a valid reason to be outside their homes during the hours of curfew. President Macron said on Wednesday night he understood a curfew was a ""hard"" thing to ask people to do. On Thursday, Mr Castex said travel during hours of curfew was permitted for trips to the hospital or pharmacy, or if work hours required. But a special certificate would need to be produced as proof. Pre-booked tickets for planes and trains that arrive after the curfew will be allowed. Anyone found breaking the curfew will be fined â¬135 (Â£121). Businesses that suffer financially due to the new measures will be eligible for state aid. Any company with up to 50 staff in the nine cities affected will be eligible for help if their turnover has fallen by over half in the past year. All companies in curfew areas will be asked to move towards having employees work from home for at least part of the week, and to stagger working hours. President Macron has already suggested ""tele-working"" for two or three days a week. ""We're in the second wave,"" the president said. For many people his address will have sounded distressingly similar to what he had to say at the start of wave one. Situation dire; hospitals under threat; public failing to get it; action. Of course there are huge differences. Today we know so much more. We wear masks and get tested. Doctors have better treatments. And another national lockdown - like the one in March - has been ruled out. But suddenly it feels like we are back where we began. Just as in March, we are warned of a virus that has become rampant and can only be stopped with drastic action.  Just as in March, we're told the health system risks being swamped. People will accept the curfew. What choice do they have? But it feels like the start of a long, miserable winter. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law. Some UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding.SagaandP&Ohave said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. How do I get my free Covid tests? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated?

Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit.

Scotland 'will not return to normal' when pubs reopen,"Pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt are currently closed,but could reopen from 26 October Nicola Sturgeon has warned that Scotland will not return to normal when the current restrictions on pubs and restaurants expire later this month. Licensed premises across the central belt were temporarily closed last week, with tough restrictions placed on those elsewhere in the country. The rules are due to expire on 26 October - but Ms Sturgeon said this would not signal a return to normality. The ban on visiting other people's homes will also remain in place. And the Scottish government is to introduce a multi-tier system of alert levels similar to that now in force in England, which could potentially see venues in areas with coronavirus outbreaks remain closed. Ms Sturgeon was giving a video statement to MSPs as she announced that a further 1,351 cases of Covid-19 and 13 deaths were registered in Scotland. She said the country was in a ""precarious"" position and facing a ""critical moment"" in the battle to contain the virus, with ""tough decisions"" needed from government. All existing restrictions and guidance are to remain in place for now, and the first minister warned that even the expiry of ""tough temporary restrictions"" on the hospitality trade would not signal a major change. She said: ""It is important to stress that given the ongoing challenge of Covid, that will not herald a return to complete normality. ""The restrictions on household gatherings for example will remain in place until it is considered safe to ease them. ""And more generally we intend to replace the temporary restrictions with a more strategic approach to managing the pandemic"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was in a ""precarious"" position The government is drawing up a system similar to that newly in force in England, with ""different tiers of levels of interventions"". It will include plans to ""strengthen and improve the effectiveness"" of existing measures, and improve compliance with rules particularly around self-isolation. Ms Sturgeon also said she could not rule out ""having to go further in future"". The Welsh government is introducing a system of travel restrictions to stop people moving from areas of the UK with higher rates of Covid-19 into areas with lower prevalence of the virus. Ms Sturgeon said that ""needs to be considered"" in Scotland, and has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for ""urgent talks"". New regulations have also been tabled tightening the rules around face coverings. The new rules will make it mandatory for workers to wear them while moving around in offices or in staff canteens. However one rule has been eased, with an exemption introduced to allow couples to take part in marriage and civil partnership ceremonies without wearing masks. The first minister has written to Boris Johnson urging him to adopt a ""four nations"" approach to travel restrictions Ms Sturgeon's speech took place in an entirely virtual meeting, with Holyrood currently in recess, and connection issues meant Ruth Davidson's question was largely inaudible. The Scottish Conservative group leader called on the government to introduce more testing in hospitals to stop the virus from spreading there. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie echoed this, and called for ""regular weekly testing on a much bigger scale"". The first minister said hospital acquired infections were ""a concern"", and that opposition party leaders would be consulted as part of an ongoing review of the testing strategy. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said measures had been introduced ""with no engagement of those affected"", which had resulted in ""ambiguity and confusion"". Ms Sturgeon rejected his claims she had ""ignored scientific advice"", saying: ""I will make no apology, given the nature of the threat we are dealing with right now, of being prepared to take quick, firm and decisive action if we deem that is necessary to save lives."" Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie pressed the first minister on delays in the contact tracing system, saying it was ""alarming"" and ""dangerous"" that in the past week 567 people had waited more than two days to get a call from Test and Protect. Ms Sturgeon said the system was ""working incredibly well"" but accepted that ""the turnaround time is not as quick as we want it to be"".

Pubs and restaurants 'will not return to normal'Nicola Sturgeon says the expiry of existing rules on 26 October will not signal a return to complete normality.ScotlandComments,"Pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt are currently closed,but could reopen from 26 October Nicola Sturgeon has warned that Scotland will not return to normal when the current restrictions on pubs and restaurants expire later this month. Licensed premises across the central belt were temporarily closed last week, with tough restrictions placed on those elsewhere in the country. The rules are due to expire on 26 October - but Ms Sturgeon said this would not signal a return to normality. The ban on visiting other people's homes will also remain in place. And the Scottish government is to introduce a multi-tier system of alert levels similar to that now in force in England, which could potentially see venues in areas with coronavirus outbreaks remain closed. Ms Sturgeon was giving a video statement to MSPs as she announced that a further 1,351 cases of Covid-19 and 13 deaths were registered in Scotland. She said the country was in a ""precarious"" position and facing a ""critical moment"" in the battle to contain the virus, with ""tough decisions"" needed from government. All existing restrictions and guidance are to remain in place for now, and the first minister warned that even the expiry of ""tough temporary restrictions"" on the hospitality trade would not signal a major change. She said: ""It is important to stress that given the ongoing challenge of Covid, that will not herald a return to complete normality. ""The restrictions on household gatherings for example will remain in place until it is considered safe to ease them. ""And more generally we intend to replace the temporary restrictions with a more strategic approach to managing the pandemic"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was in a ""precarious"" position The government is drawing up a system similar to that newly in force in England, with ""different tiers of levels of interventions"". It will include plans to ""strengthen and improve the effectiveness"" of existing measures, and improve compliance with rules particularly around self-isolation. Ms Sturgeon also said she could not rule out ""having to go further in future"". The Welsh government is introducing a system of travel restrictions to stop people moving from areas of the UK with higher rates of Covid-19 into areas with lower prevalence of the virus. Ms Sturgeon said that ""needs to be considered"" in Scotland, and has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for ""urgent talks"". New regulations have also been tabled tightening the rules around face coverings. The new rules will make it mandatory for workers to wear them while moving around in offices or in staff canteens. However one rule has been eased, with an exemption introduced to allow couples to take part in marriage and civil partnership ceremonies without wearing masks. The first minister has written to Boris Johnson urging him to adopt a ""four nations"" approach to travel restrictions Ms Sturgeon's speech took place in an entirely virtual meeting, with Holyrood currently in recess, and connection issues meant Ruth Davidson's question was largely inaudible. The Scottish Conservative group leader called on the government to introduce more testing in hospitals to stop the virus from spreading there. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie echoed this, and called for ""regular weekly testing on a much bigger scale"". The first minister said hospital acquired infections were ""a concern"", and that opposition party leaders would be consulted as part of an ongoing review of the testing strategy. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said measures had been introduced ""with no engagement of those affected"", which had resulted in ""ambiguity and confusion"". Ms Sturgeon rejected his claims she had ""ignored scientific advice"", saying: ""I will make no apology, given the nature of the threat we are dealing with right now, of being prepared to take quick, firm and decisive action if we deem that is necessary to save lives."" Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie pressed the first minister on delays in the contact tracing system, saying it was ""alarming"" and ""dangerous"" that in the past week 567 people had waited more than two days to get a call from Test and Protect. Ms Sturgeon said the system was ""working incredibly well"" but accepted that ""the turnaround time is not as quick as we want it to be"".

"Family of seven's one-bedroom flat lockdown 'hell'The children's personalities are being changed by the cramped conditions, Sarah Wheddon says.","This video can not be played The family were ""on top of each other"" during lockdown For more than six months, Sarah Wheddon, her partner Chris Hill and five children have been living in a privately rented one-bedroom flat, with a garden like a ""prison cell"". Lockdown was ""murder"" she said, with everyone ""on top of each other"". They have had some support from Shelter Cymru, which says Covid-19 has exposed ""huge inequalities"". The Welsh Government said social housing was a top priority and it had invested Â£2bn in affordable homes. Sarah had not long become a first-time mother when mechanic Chris's eldest child Ashanti, 15, came to live with them. The communal yard, including other people's scaffolding poles and planks, was wasp-infested over the summer, says Sarah His three other children came later, just before lockdown. ""I love them all to bits like they were my own. But I didn't expect to have them all under the one-bedroom flat roof,"" said former hairdresser Sarah. Their ground floor flat in Grangetown, Cardiff, has two main rooms - the bedroom and the sitting room - and then a small bathroom and kitchen. ""We're counted as severely overcrowded or homeless,"" the 29-year-old said. The family's sitting room doubles as a bedroom for four of the children, one of whom sleeps on the black flowery foot rest The older children sleep in the sitting room - Ashanti and her 12-year-old sister on the sofas, the six-year-old on a ""foot rest"", and the nine-year-old on the floor. Sarah and Chris's two-year-old girl is currently in a cot in her parents' small double bedroom. Ashanti finds the situation claustrophobic - and has exam stress on the horizon. ""I'm not really getting that much sleep when I'm heading into my GCSEs now. It's kind of hard for me."" ""I don't really have much room to study - there's not really any rooms I can do my studying in."" They do not have enough seats for everyone, and someone has to sit on the floor to eat. Outside they share a dark ""grubby and slippy"" concrete back yard with other flats. It is home to piles of scaffolding poles and planks that do not belong to them, and they could hardly go out this summer because of a wasp nest. Fifteen-year-old Ashanti is not sleeping properly and has nowhere to study for her GCSEs Sarah no longer has a paid job because she suffers from chronic pain conditionfibromyalgia,external, and their childcare costs would be unaffordable. She said she was worried about the impact of such an overcrowded environment on the children. ""It's been hell. It's not fair on the kids at all. It put a lot of strain on the family. ""They're not sleeping properly at all. It's affecting their schoolwork as well. Their personalities are changing because of it because they've got no space."" She said there would be no way they could isolate from each other within the house if one of them fell ill with coronavirus. Covid: Circuit breaker preparations under way in Wales Wales' local coronavirus lockdowns: What are the rules? Coronavirus: Housing upgrades urged to create thousands of jobs Sarah said they would not be able to isolate from each other if one of them became ill with coronavirus Shelter Cymru has carried out a survey which it said showed how poor-quality housing affected people's health and made it harder to avoid the virus. They have now called for 20,000 new social homes to be built over the next five years. Their survey suggested: One in 10 of all households with children - equivalent to 63,000 children across Wales - had no access to a private or communal garden between March and June Eighteen per cent of families, or around 114,000 children, did not have computer access or a home broadband connection Only 42% of private tenants said they would be able to self-isolate effectively in their home Thirty-two per cent of families with children experienced problems in their home during lockdown such as damp, mould, electrical hazards, and leaking roofs or windows. Fifty-four per cent were unable to get any of the problems resolved An estimated 30,000 children live in homes where parents or guardians have had to choose between paying for food and paying housing costs Jennie Bibbings from the charity said children had been among the hardest hit: ""It is appalling that so many people are living in poor-quality housing which is affecting their mental health and making it harder to avoid the virus."" Cardiff council said there was high demand for ""good quality and affordable accommodation"" in the city, with limited availability of larger family homes. A council spokeswoman said more than 7,740 applicants were on the waiting list for council houses and housing association homes, with more than 4,700 people in ""significant housing"" need due to overcrowded accommodation, medical needs or homelessness. ""We recognise the problems caused by overcrowding in the city and offer a higher priority on the common waiting list for overcrowded families. ""We are currently reviewing the help available to overcrowded families and are developing a range of measures to increase the supply of larger properties,"" she said. Meanwhile the council plans to deliver 2,000 new council homes, 1,000 of which will be completed by 2022. A Welsh Government spokesman said social housing remained a top priority. ""[The Â£2bn] investment is having a significant impact on the delivery of housing that meets the real needs of Welsh communities and we are on track to deliver our ambitious 20,000 affordable homes target this term despite the adverse impact the pandemic has had on the housebuilding sector."" The Welsh Conservative manifesto has pledged a reformed ""right to buy"" from which 100% of receipts would be invested in social housing. They said they would build 40,000 social homes over a decade and protect new-build social homes from sale for at least 10 years. They added that they were committed to building 12,000 houses a year. Plaid Cymru shadow minister for housing Delyth Jewell said they had pledged to create 50,000 homes over a five-year Senedd term, including 30,000 social homes. She said it would be the biggest public housing programme since the 1970s. Planning under way for Covid circuit breaker What can I do during local lockdowns?

"Marstons to cut up to 2,150 furloughed pub jobs","Tougher Tier 2 Covid restrictions will put up to 250,000 jobs at risk in London's hospitality sector, according to the industry's trade body. From Saturday, households will not be allowed to mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said that without additional government support thousands of jobs in the capital will go. ""It will be absolutely catastrophic,"" she told the BBC. Ms Nicholls has written to the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning that elevating the capital's coronavirus risk level ""will be incredibly damaging without additional financial support"". Job Support Scheme: What is changing after furlough? 'Pubs and restaurants facing jobs cliff edge' Heineken forced pubs to stock too many of its beers She said hospitality businesses should be excluded from paying for part of the new Job Support Scheme (JSS), which replaces furlough in November. Under JSS, a company pays up to 55% of an employee's wage with the government contributing 22%. To access the scheme, a person will also have to work at least a third of their normal hours. Businesses that have to shut under the more stringent Tier 3 restrictions - such as those in Liverpool - will see the government pay 67% of a worker's wage. The employer does not have to pay towards the salary. Ms Nicholls said: ""It is imperative that the employer contribution of the Job Support Scheme is removed from all hospitality businesses, as all are facing restrictions. ""From 1 November it is really uncertain whether our businesses will be able to access the new Job Support Scheme but in any case that requires businesses to be able to pay 55% of wages and hospitality just can't afford to do that with no revenues. ""So you've got a real squeezed middle in Tier 2 with next to no help, maximum restrictions and no alternative but job losses."" Greene King cuts 800 jobs as pub curfew hits trade Harvester owner consulting on job cuts The hospitality sector has been one of the worst hit by the pandemic and many firms are cutting jobs as the current furlough scheme winds up at the end of October. On Thursday, pub group Marston's said it would axe up to 2,150 furloughed jobs following new restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The company said that since 4 July it had reopened 99% of its pubs and ""consumer confidence increased steadily throughout July, August and into September"". However, it said new restrictions such as the 10pm curfew, table-only service and the closure of pubs in some areas of Scotland had undermined consumer confidence. By Sima Kotecha, BBC business presenter It's inevitable that we'll see more businesses follow in Marston's footsteps in the coming days and weeks. When the government's furlough scheme ends this month, businesses are likely to let people go as they simply can't afford paying their wages without the same level of state support. For those companies in the harshest restriction zones, the government has said it will provide two-thirds of workers' wages if they're forced to shut down. But for Marston's, the less generous offer isn't enough for them to keep many of their staff on their books. No trade for weeks, and now another forced lockdown is destroying not just businesses but the lives of those who once worked for them. Commenting on how restrictions had impacted its business, Marston's said it has 21 pubs in Scotland, of which eight are currently closed. It also has 18 pubs in the ""highest risk"" Liverpool region, the majority of which can serve food so therefore can remain open. ""The additional restrictions which have been applied across the UK most recently present significant challenges to us and will make business more difficult for a period of time,"" said Marston's boss Ralph Findlay. He said he regretted the job cuts, but that they were ""an inevitable consequence of the limitations placed upon our business"". In the 13 weeks since reopening, Marston's said sales were 10% below last year. July recorded the biggest fall, with sales down 26% before turning positive again in August. However, in September, trade dropped by 12%. Mr Findlay also said the company was looking at further reducing its costs and is undergoing a review which will be completed in December. Earlier this week, Mitchells & Butlers said it had begun consultations with some employees about redundancies. Greene King meanwhile has saidit will cut 800 jobsblaming tighter lockdown restrictions.

"No Tier 3 Covid deal yet, say Manchester leadersGreater Manchester is among the areas that could be moved to the ""very high"" coronavirus alert level.UKLGBT pupils 'need better support' from schoolsFinlay Bertram says he was bullied but there was no-one in school to get help from.Wales","A final decision has not yet been made on whether Greater Manchester will move into the highest level of Covid measures, local MPs have told the BBC. A financial package has not been finalised, with local leaders expressing concerns about the impact on the hospitality industry. Tier 3 involves pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor venues. Meanwhile, other parts of England willmove into Tier 2 from Saturday. Under this ""high"" alert level, the regions will face restrictions on meeting indoors. It means more than half of England's population will be living under Tier 2 or 3 restrictions. Talks between the government and officials in Greater Manchester and Lancashirewere taking place on Thursday morningabout moving to Tier 3 or the ""very high"" alert level. Why is Liverpool alone in top tier restrictions? What can and can't you do where you live? How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Speaking in the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said discussions with local leaders in other parts of the country ""in Greater Manchester, in Lancashire, and elsewhere"" were ongoing - including ""what financial support is needed"". But he told MPs he wanted to see ""rapid progress"" on the issue, and said ""we have put in place unprecedented support [for] those affected"". He added: ""Let us be under no illusions about the danger posed by this virus. ""Coronavirus is deadly and it is now spreading exponentially in the UK."" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has been resisting following the Liverpool City Region into Tier 3 restrictions, which he has described as unfair and a threat to jobs and businesses. Shadow foreign secretary and Labour MP for Wigan Lisa Nandy said ""despite repeated attempts to claim we're divided"" there was ""total unity"" from Conservative and Labour Greater Manchester MPs on a call with Downing Street officials on Thursday morning. Shetweeted,external: ""We will support evidence based interventions with adequate financial support. We will not support this chaos."" Oldham Council leader Sean Fielding described the meeting as a ""masterclass in how not to"" hold negotiations. He said the government's ""opening line"" was that Tier 3 would be implemented with local leaders or imposed, with ""nothing... to bring us on side because 'there is no money'"". Meanwhile, Labour's Andrew Gwynne, the MP for Denton and Reddish,tweeted,externalthat the briefing ""was utterly pointless"". ""While they claim 'no decision on Tier 3' we know it was being heavily briefed,"" he said. ""The strength of feeling was strong from Tory and Labour MPs alike. The minister needs to listen: we are a city united."" This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert - also known as Tiers 1 to 3, respectively. Mediumalertmeans areas are subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas onhigh alert- including north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas onvery high alertface extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. People from different households can still meet in certain outdoor public spaces, such as parks, beaches, the countryside, forests, public gardens, allotments, outdoor sports facilities and playgrounds. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos have also been forced to close. Workers at firms told to shut because of coronavirus rules over the winter will receive at least two-thirds of their pay from the government,under the Job Support Schemeannounced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak. This means the scheme - which replaces furlough at the start of November for six months - will pay those people who can't go to work because pubs and restaurants have been closed under ''very high'' Tier 3 coronavirus restrictions. Until then, workers are in line for up to 80% of their pay - 20% from their employer and 60% from the government - if their premises must close, or if there isn't enough for them to do. In a meeting on Wednesday, health officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) suggested that Greater Manchester along with much of north-east and north-west England and parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands should be moved into the top tier. Meanwhile,schools in Northern Ireland will close from Mondayand pubs and restaurants face new restrictions from Friday. Wales is preparing to ban people from parts of the UK that have high rates of coronavirusfrom travelling to the countryfrom 18:00 BST on Friday. And in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has advised Scots against travelling to high risk areas of England,singling out Blackpool as being linked to ""a large and growing number"" of Covid-19 cases in her country. On Wednesday, a further 19,724 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK, while 137 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. How will the new measures affect you?

London and Essex to move to Covid Tier 2 at weekend,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""Things will get worse before they get better"" Millions of people in London, Essex, York and other areas face tougher Tier 2 Covid measures from Saturday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Under this ""high"" alert level, there is a ban on households mixing indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham is resisting the region moving to Tier 3, ahead of a final decision on this. More than half of England's population will now be living under high or very high-alert restrictions. The areas to go into high alert restrictions this weekend are: London, Essex (apart from Southend and Thurrock), York, North East Derbyshire, Chesterfield, Erewash in Derbyshire, Elmbridge in Surrey, and Barrow in Furness, Cumbria. As unitary authorities,Southend and Thurrock councils are not included in the move,externaland will remain in Tier 1, Essex County Council has said. How will millions cope with new Tier 2 rules? Check the restrictions where you live How does England's tier system work? The health secretary said ""things will get worse before they get better"". ""Now, I know that these measures are not easy but I also know that they are vital,"" Mr Hancock told MPs. ""Responding to this unprecedented pandemic requires difficult choices, some of the most difficult choices any government has to make in peacetime."" On Thursday, a further18,980 cases and 138 deaths,externalwithin 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK. The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert - also known as Tiers 1 to 3, respectively. It came into effect on Wednesday, and the Liverpool City Region remains the only area currently in the highest tier. Meanwhile, the government announced thattravellers returning to the UK from Italy, Vatican City and San Marino must self-isolate for 14 daysfrom 04:00 BST on Sunday. This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules Discussions are continuing over whether Greater Manchester will be moved into the highest tier of restrictions, with a financial support package yet to be finalised. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Mr Burnham said the region's leaders were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of Tier 3 measures, calling the government's plans ""flawed and unfair"". He said: ""They are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and a large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts tell them might not work."" Repeating his calls for a financial support package for parts of the North West, he added: ""Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City Region and Lancashire are being set up as the canaries in the coalmine for an experimental regional lockdown strategy as an attempt to prevent the expense of what is truly needed. ""The very least they should be offering the people of Greater Manchester who will be affected by these closures is a full and fair 80% furlough for all affected workers, 80% income support for people who are self-employed and a proper compensation scheme for businesses."" This video can not be played Andy Burnham says his region is one of those ""being set up as the canaries in the coal mine"" Tier 3 involves pub closures and a ban on household mixing indoors, in private gardens and in most outdoor hospitality venues and ticketed events. Mr Hancock confirmed in the Commons that no decision had been made on moving more regions to Tier 3, but added ""we need to make rapid progress"". Meanwhile, the NHS Test and Trace system in England recorded its worst week for reaching community contacts since the middle of June. Data showed some 62% of non-household contacts of people who tested positive in the community were reached through the system in the week ending 7 October. This is the lowest success rate since 24 June, down from 67% last week. Asked about the latest data, the PM's spokesman said tests were being provided on an ""unprecedented scale"" and No 10 was still workingto raise capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Circuit-breaker lockdown 'likely for Wales' Scotland 'will not return to normal' when pubs reopen London rules 'put 250,000 hospitality jobs at risk' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has defended his call for a nationwide ""circuit-breaker"" - a short limited lockdown - to stem rising infection rates, saying""no region will be immune"" from Covid-19. Speaking to the BBC, he said the alternative was ""weeks and months of prolonged agony"" in a tiered system. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told MPs in the Commons that a full national lockdown ""stretching for weeks and weeks"" would ""be disastrous for society"", but that a lockdown of between two and three weeks could help ""take back control of the virus"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS providers, said he also favoured this move to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, Labour mayor Sadiq Khan told London's City Hall there was ""simply no other option"" than introducing the new restrictions. He said he will continue to press the government for more financial support, but added that ""we've got a difficult winter ahead"". Concerns have been raised about the impact the restrictions will have on businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector. London has 3,640 pubs and 7,556 restaurants, according to real estate adviser Altus Group, but they will not be eligible for government support available to premises which have been ordered to close. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan says there is ""simply no other option"" as London moves to Tier 2 restrictions The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), the trade association for Britain's brewing and pub sector, said Tier 2 restrictions without a ""proper package of support"" would ""decimate"" pubs. Emma McClarkin, BBPA chief executive, said pubs were already struggling due to the current restrictions, with the new measures leaving ""most pubs fighting for their very survival"". Nickie Aiken, Tory MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, urged the government to set out an ""exit plan"" for ensuring London is placed back into Tier 1. She said she remained ""deeply concerned about the impact further lockdown will have on the capital's hospitality, leisure and retail businesses"". Robert Halfon, Conservative MP for Harlow in Essex, said he welcomed Tier 2 measures for the county but would call on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to prevent businesses suffering financially. Liverpool is consideringa two-week half-term break for schoolsas part of its ""battle with Covid-19"". Under the plan, backed by a teaching union, pupils would be taught remotely at home for the second week of the break.

The page was written by Joseph Lee,  Sophie Williams, Joshua Cheetham and Alex Kleiderman, and edited by Paulin Kola, Emma Owen and John Hand. We're wrapping our coverage up now, but here are some of today's biggest global developments: It's been a day of fast-moving developments in the UK as the government imposed additional restrictions on some regions to control a rise in cases. By James Wong Some images of the Covid-19 pandemic will last generations â deserted city streets, football games played in empty stadia or world leaders in face masks. For many of us, the most vivid memories may be a little closer to home: queues at the shops, talking to loved ones on mobile screens and bare aisles in the supermarket. I live in the UK where in the early days of the pandemic, grocery store shelves emptied long before we were told to stop going to the pub, schools closed and face masks became mandatory. The severity of what was approaching only hit home for some people when the rice and pasta ran out. Other people around the world were far less fortunate than I was. In Africa,73 million people across 36 countries are deemed acutely food-insecureas a result of Covid-19 by the World Food Programme, compared to half a million in Europe. The pandemic has highlighted how fragile our food chain â from field to fork â really is. But have we learned anything from the experience about food security? And how might we be better prepared next time? Read more here. Earlier we reported an announcement by Grant Shapps that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. The transport secretary also said those returning from the Greek island of Crete will now not need to quarantine. So where can you go without having to self-isolate on return? Check our guide,here.  The latest government figures show the total number of people to have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK has now reached 673,622. And the number of people dying within 28 days of testing positive stands at 43,293. The graphs here show how cases have been rising again in recent weeks - with daily hospital admissions now at a seven-day average of 730.  Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent Israeli police have made arrests at an
ultra-Orthodox wedding which descended into chaos as guests were dragged away
and officers said glass bottles of cooking oil were thrown at them. The celebration broke Covid-19 rules as
it involved âdozensâ of guests, according to police. It took place in a private house in
the settlement of Givat Zeâev in the occupied West Bank. Videos posted on social media,externalshowed
scuffles between officers and guests. One man with a bloodied face was detained
while another was shown bleeding on the ground. Israeli media reported that
people slipped on the cooking oil and fell on broken glass. Family members accused police of
attacking the brideâs brother. The incident comes amid a growing
row between secular and ultra-religious communities over the response to
lockdown rules in Israel, which is starting to turn the tide on a dramatic
surge in the virus. Some ultra-Orthodox politicians
strongly criticised officers for heavy-handed tactics. But police slammed
attacks on their officers saying they were stopping a âgross violationâ of the
rules. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged local leaders to ""set aside party politics"" so that ""people come together so we can control this virus"". He was speaking after the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said he and other representatives in the region were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of Tier 3 restrictions. Mr Hancock said the leaders should ""work with us to put in place the measures that are needed in Greater Manchester - across the North West, so that we can deal with this virus and support people through it"". He said: ""This is a time for people to come together so that we can control this virus."" When asked if there would be a more generous financial package for the area he said ""there has been an unprecedented package of support"", pointing to measures already announced. And when asked if a national circuit-breaker was necessary he said ""what we want to do is take a regional, a local approach because there are different levels of virus in different parts of the country"". With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. Footballer Marcus Rashford helped force a U-turn from the government on providing on free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils in England over the summer holidays - but hislatest appeal to ministersappears to have been turned down. During the coronavirus lockdown the government helped families whose children qualify for free meals. They insisted this would not continue outside of term time - but changed their mind after the England and Manchester United striker's campaign. Now the footballer has launched a petition calling on ministers to go further in tackling child hunger - including providing meals over the Christmas break. It comes as meals are being made available during the breaks to eligible children in Wales. But Downing Street has now indicated that free school meals will not be given to children in England during the holidays. Rashford, who was made an MBE in last week's honours list on the back of his work for vulnerable children,,hit back on Twitter,,externalwriting: ""Merry Christmas kids... It's also not for food banks to feed millions of British children but here we are... This is not going away anytime soon and neither am I..."" As cases and hospital admissions continue to rise across Europe, several countries are rolling out restrictions to ease the stress on healthcare systems and economies. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments on the continent: UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has announced that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. As a result, anyone travelling to the UK from any of the states must quarantine for 14 days. The new measure will come into effect from 04:00 BST on Sunday 18 October. Mr Shapps has also announced that anyone arriving in the UK from the Greek island of Crete will no longer need to follow the 14-day isolation rule. Nicola Sturgeon said she could not ""rule out"" having to take further measures At an earlier virtual meeting of the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Welsh-style ban on people travelling from Covid hotspots in other parts of the UK ""is being considered"". ""Although we have put in place tough measures, we cannot rule out having to go further in the future,"" she said. The travel ban for Wales is expected to come into force at 18:00 BST tomorrow, and affects people living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions of England - which will cover half the population by the weekend - as well as the whole of Northern Ireland and the central belt of Scotland. A further 18,980 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to the latest data. Thegovernment's dashboard,externalalso show another 138 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The figures compare with 19,724 cases and 137 deaths recorded on Wednesday. This video can not be played Over the last few months weâve been told how important it is to wash our hands regularly â for at least 20 seconds â to protect against coronavirus. But with so many different soaps to choose from, how do we work out whatâs best? To mark Global Handwashing Day, Dr Michelle Wong â a beauty blogger with a PhD in chemistry â explains how to find the best soap for your skin when cleaning our hands more regularly, and a trick to get children to wash their hands. Listen toBBC CrowdSciencefor more about how soap works. Authorities in Italy have registered 8,804 new cases during the last 24 hours, beating the previous official high of 7,332 set yesterday. Italy's health ministry also reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths, jumping from 43 on Wednesday, but far less than the peak of the country's outbreak in March and April, when daily death tolls reached more than 900. It comes as infections continue to soar around Europe, prompting the rollout of restrictions in countries like neighbouring France. While Burnham was talking in Manchester, there was news of a likely development in Wales. The BBC has been told that the Welsh Governmentis expected to announce a limited ""circuit breaker"" lockdown in the next few days. A circuit-breaker a short period of time where tighter restrictions are brought in to break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising. It is not yet clear when the announcement will be made, for how long a limited shutdown would last, or which sectors would close. But what is known  is that Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has written to First Minister Mark Drakeford asking him to give businesses time to prepare for such a move.  The Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham concludes his comments by revealing that government ministers suggested there is ""no money left"" for the kind of financial package the local leaders say is necessary before their areas are put into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Burnham, who spoke to health ministers earlier today, said he had been told ""there is no money to put on the table"". He added: ""To be honest with you, I don't believe that for one second. When I look today at some of the fees they are paying to consultants working on the failed test and trace scheme, when I look at the billions that is being thrown at a scheme that isn't working for Greater Manchester, money that has been found for other things this year. ""The argument I am making is... support people right now when they need it because by supporting people  now you will save jobs and businesses that will be able to restart the minute we find a vaccine, the minute the recovery is on."" Burnham says he and other Greater Manchester leaders were told by the deputy chief medical officer  that the ""only certain thing to work is a national lockdown"". But Burnham then points out the government was ""unwilling to do that because of the harm it would do to the national economy"". ""They are willing to sacrifice jobs and businesses here [in north-west England] to try and save them elsewhere,"" Burnham said, adding that they were being treated as ""canaries in the coal mine"" for an ""experimental regional lockdown strategy"". He said the ""very least"" the government needed to do was to offer a furlough scheme with 80% of wages paid, support for the self-employed and help for businesses, the same as that offered to the general population during the first national lockdown from March. Burnham, a former Labour health secretary who has been the Greater Manchester mayor since 2017, said regional leaders had communicated their ""clear and unanimous"" view to the government that it was wrong to put some of poorest parts in England into a ""punishing lockdown"" without adequate support that was ""not certain to control the virus"". Asked whether he thinks the government would impose the Tier 3 restrictions on the region without local agreement, Burnham said: ""We can't simply be treated as second-class citizens. We understand the government's view and wait for further engagement."" He added: ""If the government are convinced this approach will work.... they have to back that properly, fully financially, so it will have a chance of working."" Burnham adds that the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said bringing infection rates down would ""require widespread closures way beyond pubs"". ""They are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts say will not work,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

We're wrapping our coverage up now, but here are some of today's biggest global developments: It's been a day of fast-moving developments in the UK as the government imposed additional restrictions on some regions to control a rise in cases. By James Wong Some images of the Covid-19 pandemic will last generations â deserted city streets, football games played in empty stadia or world leaders in face masks. For many of us, the most vivid memories may be a little closer to home: queues at the shops, talking to loved ones on mobile screens and bare aisles in the supermarket. I live in the UK where in the early days of the pandemic, grocery store shelves emptied long before we were told to stop going to the pub, schools closed and face masks became mandatory.

Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent Israeli police have made arrests at an
ultra-Orthodox wedding which descended into chaos as guests were dragged away
and officers said glass bottles of cooking oil were thrown at them. The celebration broke Covid-19 rules as
it involved âdozensâ of guests, according to police. It took place in a private house in
the settlement of Givat Zeâev in the occupied West Bank. Videos posted on social media,externalshowed
scuffles between officers and guests. One man with a bloodied face was detained
while another was shown bleeding on the ground. Israeli media reported that
people slipped on the cooking oil and fell on broken glass. Family members accused police of
attacking the brideâs brother. The incident comes amid a growing
row between secular and ultra-religious communities over the response to
lockdown rules in Israel, which is starting to turn the tide on a dramatic
surge in the virus. Some ultra-Orthodox politicians
strongly criticised officers for heavy-handed tactics. But police slammed
attacks on their officers saying they were stopping a âgross violationâ of the
rules. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged local leaders to ""set aside party politics"" so that ""people come together so we can control this virus"". He was speaking after the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said he and other representatives in the region were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of Tier 3 restrictions. Mr Hancock said the leaders should ""work with us to put in place the measures that are needed in Greater Manchester - across the North West, so that we can deal with this virus and support people through it"". He said: ""This is a time for people to come together so that we can control this virus."" When asked if there would be a more generous financial package for the area he said ""there has been an unprecedented package of support"", pointing to measures already announced. And when asked if a national circuit-breaker was necessary he said ""what we want to do is take a regional, a local approach because there are different levels of virus in different parts of the country"".

Footballer Marcus Rashford helped force a U-turn from the government on providing on free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils in England over the summer holidays - but hislatest appeal to ministersappears to have been turned down. During the coronavirus lockdown the government helped families whose children qualify for free meals. They insisted this would not continue outside of term time - but changed their mind after the England and Manchester United striker's campaign. Now the footballer has launched a petition calling on ministers to go further in tackling child hunger - including providing meals over the Christmas break. It comes as meals are being made available during the breaks to eligible children in Wales. But Downing Street has now indicated that free school meals will not be given to children in England during the holidays.

As cases and hospital admissions continue to rise across Europe, several countries are rolling out restrictions to ease the stress on healthcare systems and economies. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments on the continent: UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has announced that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. As a result, anyone travelling to the UK from any of the states must quarantine for 14 days. The new measure will come into effect from 04:00 BST on Sunday 18 October. Mr Shapps has also announced that anyone arriving in the UK from the Greek island of Crete will no longer need to follow the 14-day isolation rule. Nicola Sturgeon said she could not ""rule out"" having to take further measures At an earlier virtual meeting of the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Welsh-style ban on people travelling from Covid hotspots in other parts of the UK ""is being considered"". ""Although we have put in place tough measures, we cannot rule out having to go further in the future,"" she said. The travel ban for Wales is expected to come into force at 18:00 BST tomorrow, and affects people living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions of England - which will cover half the population by the weekend - as well as the whole of Northern Ireland and the central belt of Scotland. A further 18,980 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to the latest data.

Italy's health ministry also reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths, jumping from 43 on Wednesday, but far less than the peak of the country's outbreak in March and April, when daily death tolls reached more than 900.

As a result, anyone travelling to the UK from any of the states must quarantine for 14 days. The new measure will come into effect from 04:00 BST on Sunday 18 October. Mr Shapps has also announced that anyone arriving in the UK from the Greek island of Crete will no longer need to follow the 14-day isolation rule. Nicola Sturgeon said she could not ""rule out"" having to take further measures At an earlier virtual meeting of the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Welsh-style ban on people travelling from Covid hotspots in other parts of the UK ""is being considered"". ""Although we have put in place tough measures, we cannot rule out having to go further in the future,"" she said. The travel ban for Wales is expected to come into force at 18:00 BST tomorrow, and affects people living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions of England - which will cover half the population by the weekend - as well as the whole of Northern Ireland and the central belt of Scotland. A further 18,980 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to the latest data. Thegovernment's dashboard,externalalso show another 138 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The figures compare with 19,724 cases and 137 deaths recorded on Wednesday.

But with so many different soaps to choose from, how do we work out whatâs best? To mark Global Handwashing Day, Dr Michelle Wong â a beauty blogger with a PhD in chemistry â explains how to find the best soap for your skin when cleaning our hands more regularly, and a trick to get children to wash their hands. Listen toBBC CrowdSciencefor more about how soap works. Authorities in Italy have registered 8,804 new cases during the last 24 hours, beating the previous official high of 7,332 set yesterday. Italy's health ministry also reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths, jumping from 43 on Wednesday, but far less than the peak of the country's outbreak in March and April, when daily death tolls reached more than 900. It comes as infections continue to soar around Europe, prompting the rollout of restrictions in countries like neighbouring France. While Burnham was talking in Manchester, there was news of a likely development in Wales. The BBC has been told that the Welsh Governmentis expected to announce a limited ""circuit breaker"" lockdown in the next few days. A circuit-breaker a short period of time where tighter restrictions are brought in to break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising. It is not yet clear when the announcement will be made, for how long a limited shutdown would last, or which sectors would close. But what is known  is that Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has written to First Minister Mark Drakeford asking him to give businesses time to prepare for such a move.  The Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham concludes his comments by revealing that government ministers suggested there is ""no money left"" for the kind of financial package the local leaders say is necessary before their areas are put into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Burnham, who spoke to health ministers earlier today, said he had been told ""there is no money to put on the table"". He added: ""To be honest with you, I don't believe that for one second. When I look today at some of the fees they are paying to consultants working on the failed test and trace scheme, when I look at the billions that is being thrown at a scheme that isn't working for Greater Manchester, money that has been found for other things this year. ""The argument I am making is... support people right now when they need it because by supporting people  now you will save jobs and businesses that will be able to restart the minute we find a vaccine, the minute the recovery is on."" Burnham says he and other Greater Manchester leaders were told by the deputy chief medical officer  that the ""only certain thing to work is a national lockdown"". But Burnham then points out the government was ""unwilling to do that because of the harm it would do to the national economy"". ""They are willing to sacrifice jobs and businesses here [in north-west England] to try and save them elsewhere,"" Burnham said, adding that they were being treated as ""canaries in the coal mine"" for an ""experimental regional lockdown strategy"". He said the ""very least"" the government needed to do was to offer a furlough scheme with 80% of wages paid, support for the self-employed and help for businesses, the same as that offered to the general population during the first national lockdown from March. Burnham, a former Labour health secretary who has been the Greater Manchester mayor since 2017, said regional leaders had communicated their ""clear and unanimous"" view to the government that it was wrong to put some of poorest parts in England into a ""punishing lockdown"" without adequate support that was ""not certain to control the virus"". Asked whether he thinks the government would impose the Tier 3 restrictions on the region without local agreement, Burnham said: ""We can't simply be treated as second-class citizens. We understand the government's view and wait for further engagement."" He added: ""If the government are convinced this approach will work.... they have to back that properly, fully financially, so it will have a chance of working."" Burnham adds that the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said bringing infection rates down would ""require widespread closures way beyond pubs"". ""They are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts say will not work,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Long Covid 'could be four different syndromes'People with long-lasting effects of coronavirus infection are not being believed or treated, a review says.","Continuing symptoms can affect everything from the brain to the heart and the skin ""Long Covid"" - the long-lasting impact of coronavirus infection - may be affecting people in four different ways, according to a review. And this could explain why some of those with continuing symptoms are not being believed or treated. There could be a huge psychological impact on people living with long-term Covid-19,the National Institute for Health Research report,externalsays. They need more support - and healthcare staff require better information. Most people are told they will recover from mild coronavirus infections within two weeks and from more serious disease within three. But the report says thousands could be living with ""ongoing Covid"". And with coronavirus cases rising across the UK, this number is also likely to increase in the coming months. This video can not be played 'It was so serious that I don't know about it': Michael Rosen was put in a coma to fight Covid-19 Based on interviews with 14 members of a long-Covid support group on Facebook and the most recent published research, the review found recurring symptoms affecting everything from breathing, the brain, the heart and cardiovascular system to the kidneys, the gut, the liver and the skin. These symptoms may be due to four different syndromes: permanent organ damage to the lungs and heart post-intensive-care syndrome post-viral fatigue syndrome continuing Covid-19 symptoms Some of those affected have had a long stay in hospital with severe Covid-19 - but others, who have had a mild infection, have never even been tested or diagnosed. The review says coming up with a ""working diagnosis for ongoing Covid-19"" would help people access support. ""It is becoming clear that, for some people, Covid-19 infection is a long-term illness,"" the report says. ""For some, this is related to their rehabilitation following a hospital admission - but others are reporting life-changing experiences that follow an initial infection that they managed at home, with symptoms becoming more severe over time."" Specialist 'long Covid' clinics to be set up 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering? 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' Report author Dr Elaine Maxwell said she had assumed those who had been seriously ill with Covid-19 would be affected the most and those at low risk of death were also at low risk of living with its long-term effects. But the review found this was not the case. ""We now know that there are people with no record of having Covid who are suffering more than someone who was ventilated for several weeks,"" she said. And these debilitating effects on some people could put a ""significant burden on the NHS"". Jo House and her partner Ash are both experiencing ongoing symptoms Jo House, a lecturer at the University of Bristol, has still not returned to work more than six months after being infected. It started with a bad cough and difficulty breathing, but this turned into crushing fatigue and headaches before heart problems and muscle pain took over. ""The other day I got up, was really dizzy, fainted and ended up in A&E,"" she says. Although her racing heart and shortness of breath have improved a bit, her ongoing symptoms are still having a huge impact on her, and her family's, life. Her partner Ash is also experiencing symptoms that won't go away. As a result, her teenage sons have had to take on all the cooking and cleaning. ""Lots of people are classed as having mild symptoms, but it's really not mild at all. We need support,"" she says. Although Jo had pneumonia, she was never tested for the virus and not admitted to hospital. ""We both made wills when we were very ill. It was scary."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? The report calls for support in the community alongside the recently announcedone-stop hospital clinicsfor long Covid. And it says ongoing Covid is likely to have a disproportionate effect on certain groups, such as black or Asian people as well as those with existing mental health problems or learning difficulties. ""Our aim is that healthcare services and staff will use this review to better understand the experiences patients have to deal with, and provide them with the access to treatment, care and support they need,"" Dr Maxwell added.

Talks continue over new curbs for parts of England,"This video can not be played How do people feel about the new restrictions in Preston? Talks are continuing between the government and local leaders over the expansion of the strictest coronavirus restrictions to more parts of England. Liverpool City Region is the only area in the top tier of restrictions, with pubs and bars not serving meals closed. But Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnhamhas said,externalhe is meeting the PM's team later to discuss the issue. It comes as it was announcedLondon will move into the second highest tier of restrictionsfrom Saturday. Why is Liverpool alone in top tier restrictions? What can and can't you do where you live? How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Greater Manchester and Lancashire could be placed under ""very high alert"" - the highest level of restrictions. MPs in Greater Manchester and London are taking part in ministerial calls on Thursday morning. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will update MPs on the latest measures in a Commons statement later. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the government would still take action to place areas into higher levels of restrictions if local leaders objected to the move, business minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""It's important that we look at how we suppress this virus because the alternative is much worse."" He added: ""Let's wait and see what the health secretary says to Parliament."" Also on the programme, Eamonn O'Brien, leader of Bury Council in Greater Manchester, said officials were ""deeply sceptical"" that Tier 3 would work or that it offered enough financial support to businesses and people affected by the restrictions. He said he had a ""strong impression"" that government will go ahead with the changes later. Earlier, Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson told BBC Breakfast he was ""categorically told"" by the government last weekend that Liverpool City Region would be placed under the highest tier restrictions. ""The fact is that the government will decide who goes into Tier 3 today,"" he said, adding that he expected to see more areas being placed under ""very high alert"" later. Mr Anderson acknowledged that the ""virus is out of control and something has to be done"", but called for ""economic intervention to support people"". In the week up to 11 October,local authority figures showedthere were 660 cases per 100,000 people in Liverpool, 466 per 100,000 in Manchester, and up to 135 per 100,000 in London (in Richmond upon Thames). The average area in England had 89. The new three-tier system sees every area of England classed as being on medium, high or very high alert. Most of the country is onmediumalert, which means areas are subject to the national restrictions currently in force, including the rule of six on indoor and outdoor gatherings and the 22:00 closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants. In addition to these restrictions, in areas onhigh alert- including north-east England, much of the North West and parts of the Midlands, along with West and South Yorkshire - different households are not allowed to mix indoors. Areas onvery high alertface extra curbs, with different households banned from mixing indoors or outdoors in hospitality venues or private gardens. Pubs and bars will be closed unless they are serving substantial meals and there is also guidance against travelling in and out of the area. Further restrictions may be agreed for particular regions in the top tier and in the Liverpool City Region gyms, leisure centres, betting shops and casinos have also been forced to close. In a meeting on Wednesday, health officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) suggested that Greater Manchester along with much of north-east and north-west England and parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands should be moved into the top tier. But the recommendations of the JBC will not necessarily be enforced and discussions are likely to continue between local and national politicians and officials over the coming days.

Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         Labour's Mr Burnham said he had a briefing with the deputy chief medical officer for England, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, on Wednesday and was expecting a further meeting with the prime minister's team later. He has argued against Greater Manchester being put into the top tier, saying that without increased financial support they would prefer a so-called ""circuit-breaker"" - a short, limited lockdown to help bring the virus under control. Mr Burnham said he would consider a legal challenge if the government placed the area under very high alert, adding such a move would be ""by imposition, not consent"". In contrast, Mr Khan said he would back London moving from tier one to two - but called for a package of financial support, including for businesses struggling under the restrictions, despite being allowed to remain open. A final decision to move Greater Manchester and Lancashire into the highest tier of restrictions is one for politicians - and has not yet been made. But there is increasing concern about the spread of the virus in both areas - and a growing belief that tougher measures are likely. Mr Burnham is demanding more support for local businesses, which would be hit hard by a further shutdown of large swathes of hospitality. Local leaders in Lancashire want more support too - but believe new restrictions are all but inevitable. There are still decisions to be made - but if agreed - the further restrictions could cover another four million people. And other parts of north-east and north-west England could follow after a recommendation by health officials on Wednesday. Again, that still has to be approved by politicians. Boris Johnson has defended his three-tier system as the ""right way forward"", saying it would ""avoid the misery of a national lockdown"" -but he did not rule out going further. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is continuing to call for a ""circuit-breaker"". Meanwhile,schools in Northern Ireland will close from Mondayand pubs and restaurants face new restrictions from Friday. Wales is preparing to ban people from parts of the UK that have high rates of coronavirusfrom travelling to the countryfrom 18:00 BST on Friday. And in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has advised Scots against travelling to high risk areas of England,singling out Blackpool as being linked to ""a large and growing number"" of Covid-19 cases in her country. On Wednesday, a further 19,724 coronavirus cases were recorded in the UK, while 137 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus.

Coronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning.,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST. No 10 is to continue talks with regional leadersover bringing more areas of England under the tightest coronavirus restrictions. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, whose region faces that prospect - along with neighbouring Lancashire, is resisting the move. In London, Mayor Sadiq Khan wants tougher restrictions, saying a shift to the second highest tier could happen ""very soon, possibly this week"". Both want more financial support for their area. Long Covid - the long-lasting impact of coronavirus infection - may beaffecting people in four different ways, according to a review. A National Institute for Health Research report says patients could suffer from continuing Covid-19 symptoms, permanent damage to the lungs and heart, and both post-intensive-care and post-viral fatigue syndromes. They need more support, while healthcare staff require better information, its review adds. Staff in some virus hotspots wereunable to access coronavirus tests after a number of NHS trusts wound down their in-house testing, following government assurances about the capacity of centralised systems, a body representing health leaders says. The government says it has increased testing capacity. Much of the country is under the second highest level of restrictions, with many areas facing the prospect of a further clampdown on daily life.

"Marstons to cut up to 2,150 furloughed jobs","Tougher Tier 2 Covid restrictions will put up to 250,000 jobs at risk in London's hospitality sector, according to the industry's trade body. From Saturday, households will not be allowed to mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said that without additional government support thousands of jobs in the capital will go. ""It will be absolutely catastrophic,"" she told the BBC. Ms Nicholls has written to the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning that elevating the capital's coronavirus risk level ""will be incredibly damaging without additional financial support"". Job Support Scheme: What is changing after furlough? 'Pubs and restaurants facing jobs cliff edge' Heineken forced pubs to stock too many of its beers She said hospitality businesses should be excluded from paying for part of the new Job Support Scheme (JSS), which replaces furlough in November. Under JSS, a company pays up to 55% of an employee's wage with the government contributing 22%. To access the scheme, a person will also have to work at least a third of their normal hours. Businesses that have to shut under the more stringent Tier 3 restrictions - such as those in Liverpool - will see the government pay 67% of a worker's wage. The employer does not have to pay towards the salary. Ms Nicholls said: ""It is imperative that the employer contribution of the Job Support Scheme is removed from all hospitality businesses, as all are facing restrictions. ""From 1 November it is really uncertain whether our businesses will be able to access the new Job Support Scheme but in any case that requires businesses to be able to pay 55% of wages and hospitality just can't afford to do that with no revenues. ""So you've got a real squeezed middle in Tier 2 with next to no help, maximum restrictions and no alternative but job losses."" Greene King cuts 800 jobs as pub curfew hits trade Harvester owner consulting on job cuts The hospitality sector has been one of the worst hit by the pandemic and many firms are cutting jobs as the current furlough scheme winds up at the end of October. On Thursday, pub group Marston's said it would axe up to 2,150 furloughed jobs following new restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The company said that since 4 July it had reopened 99% of its pubs and ""consumer confidence increased steadily throughout July, August and into September"". However, it said new restrictions such as the 10pm curfew, table-only service and the closure of pubs in some areas of Scotland had undermined consumer confidence. By Sima Kotecha, BBC business presenter It's inevitable that we'll see more businesses follow in Marston's footsteps in the coming days and weeks. When the government's furlough scheme ends this month, businesses are likely to let people go as they simply can't afford paying their wages without the same level of state support. For those companies in the harshest restriction zones, the government has said it will provide two-thirds of workers' wages if they're forced to shut down. But for Marston's, the less generous offer isn't enough for them to keep many of their staff on their books. No trade for weeks, and now another forced lockdown is destroying not just businesses but the lives of those who once worked for them. Commenting on how restrictions had impacted its business, Marston's said it has 21 pubs in Scotland, of which eight are currently closed. It also has 18 pubs in the ""highest risk"" Liverpool region, the majority of which can serve food so therefore can remain open. ""The additional restrictions which have been applied across the UK most recently present significant challenges to us and will make business more difficult for a period of time,"" said Marston's boss Ralph Findlay. He said he regretted the job cuts, but that they were ""an inevitable consequence of the limitations placed upon our business"". In the 13 weeks since reopening, Marston's said sales were 10% below last year. July recorded the biggest fall, with sales down 26% before turning positive again in August. However, in September, trade dropped by 12%. Mr Findlay also said the company was looking at further reducing its costs and is undergoing a review which will be completed in December. Earlier this week, Mitchells & Butlers said it had begun consultations with some employees about redundancies. Greene King meanwhile has saidit will cut 800 jobsblaming tighter lockdown restrictions.

Thailand passes emergency decree in protest crackdown,"The protesters staged a peaceful sit in at Bangkok's Ratchaprasong shopping district Tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters gathered again in the Thai capital Bangkok on Thursday in mass defiance of the government which had issued a decree banning demonstrations. The protesters cheered and chanted peacefully, eventually dispersing several hours after a new 6pm curfew. They called for the release of at least 20 activists arrested on Thursday in a sweeping crackdown by police. Many made a three-finger salute - a symbol of the protest movement. After peacefully leaving the site of the demonstration at Bangkok's Ratchaprasong Intersection, the protesters vowed to return on Friday at 17:00 local time (10:00 GMT). This week saw the first protests of this movement take place while King Maha Vajiralongkorn was in the country - significantly raising the stakes. The king, who now spends most of his time abroad, has returned from Germany for several weeks. In the early hours of Thursday morning, the government had attempted to curtail the student-led protest movement by issuing an emergency decree banning gatherings of more than four people and arresting about 20 activists - taking the total number of arrests this week to about 40. There were sporadic clashes on Thursday but the protests were largely peaceful The student daring to challenge Thailandâs monarchy Why Thai protesters are willing to break the law Several key protest leaders were among those arrested, including human rights lawyer Anon Nampa, student activist Parit Chiwarak - widely known by his nickname ""Penguin"" - and Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul. In awidely watched livestream video,external, officers were seen reading out charges to Ms Panusaya in a hotel room. Another video showed police putting her into a car as she and her supporters chanted slogans. This video can not be played 'Long live the people': Watch as Thai protest leader is arrested and carried into police car The protest movement they have helped lead began by calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha - a former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup and was appointed premier after controversial elections last year - and has expanded since to call for curbs on the powers of the king. The calls for royal reforms are particularly sensitive in Thailand, where criticism of the monarchy is punishable by long prison sentences. The months of protests leading up to the emergency decree issued on Thursday represent the biggest challenge in years to Thailand's establishment, which is dominated by the military and royal palace. On Wednesday, protesters jeered and held up the three-finger salute as a motorcade passed carrying the queen through Bangkok. Many protesters held their fingers up in a three-finger salute, which has become a symbol of the movement The proximity of the demonstration to the royal convoy was cited by the government in a televised address as one of the reasons for the emergency decree. But the protesters ignored the new rules on Thursday afternoon to once again gather in their thousands. ""Like dogs cornered, we are fighting till our deaths,"" Panupong ""Mike Rayong"" Jadnok, one the high-profile protest leaders who remains free, told the crowd. ""We won't fall back. We won't run away. We won't go anywhere."" Police appealed to the crowd to disperse, eventually setting a 18:00 curfew. ""The people who came know that there is a ban against public gathering of five or more,"" said police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen. ""We will take things step by step."" Few in Thailand will have been surprised to hear of the arrest of the main protest leaders and tougher restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression. Some may even have been relieved that it did not end in bloodshed, as so often before in political crises here. When Anon Nampa, a deceptively mild-looking lawyer, first called for an honest discussion about the monarchy, on 3 August, you could almost hear the collective intake of breath across the country at his boldness. When Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul read out 10 demands for royal reform and accountability from a university stage a week later, Thailand braced itself for a backlash. In a country where every constitution requires the king to ""be held in a position of revered worship"", this was akin to blasphemy. The backlash did not come. A government struggling under the weight of multiple challenges, from the dire economic outlook to a series of scandals, seemed reluctant to risk provoking further public anger. But the persistence of large-scale rallies, where protesters ridiculed the royal institution, could not be tolerated for long, especially now that the king had returned to Thailand for an extended stay. With their leaders locked up outside Bangkok and any public gatherings banned, the movement will find it hard to keep going. The authorities may also go after those they believe have been funding the protests. But what has been said about the monarchy cannot be unsaid. A taboo has been broken. People of all ages, from all parts of the country, aside from die-hard royalists, now agree with the student leaders, that the monarchy is fair game in any overhaul of Thailand's institutions. It is only a matter of time before we see similar protests again. Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest but a new wave began in February after a popular opposition political party was ordered to dissolve. The order followed elections in March last year - the first since the military seized power in 2014 and the first chance to vote for many young people and first-time voters. The elections were seen as an opportunity for change after years of military rule. Prayuth Chan-ocha: Thailand's face of hybrid democracy Thai pro-democracy party dissolved over loan With the all-important support of the military, Prayuth Chan-ocha was re-installed as prime minister. The pro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP), with its charismatic leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, garnered the third-largest share of seats and was particularly popular with young, first-time voters. But in February a court ruled the FFP had received a loan from Thanathorn which was deemed a donation - making it illegal - and the party was forced to disband, prompting thousands of young Thais to join street protests. The protests were halted by Covid-19 restrictions, which banned gatherings, but they began again in June when a prominent pro-democracy activist went missing. Pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit was reportedly snatched off the street in Cambodia Wanchalearm Satsaksit, who had been living in Cambodia in exile since 2014, was reportedly grabbed off the street and bundled off into a vehicle. Protesters accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - a charge police and government officials have denied. The satirist who vanished in broad daylight In recent months, the protesters have challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, which made him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people. There have also been questions over the king's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.

The page was written by Joseph Lee,  Sophie Williams, Joshua Cheetham and Alex Kleiderman, and edited by Paulin Kola, Emma Owen and John Hand. We're wrapping our coverage up now, but here are some of today's biggest global developments: It's been a day of fast-moving developments in the UK as the government imposed additional restrictions on some regions to control a rise in cases. By James Wong Some images of the Covid-19 pandemic will last generations â deserted city streets, football games played in empty stadia or world leaders in face masks. For many of us, the most vivid memories may be a little closer to home: queues at the shops, talking to loved ones on mobile screens and bare aisles in the supermarket. I live in the UK where in the early days of the pandemic, grocery store shelves emptied long before we were told to stop going to the pub, schools closed and face masks became mandatory. The severity of what was approaching only hit home for some people when the rice and pasta ran out. Other people around the world were far less fortunate than I was. In Africa,73 million people across 36 countries are deemed acutely food-insecureas a result of Covid-19 by the World Food Programme, compared to half a million in Europe. The pandemic has highlighted how fragile our food chain â from field to fork â really is. But have we learned anything from the experience about food security? And how might we be better prepared next time? Read more here. Earlier we reported an announcement by Grant Shapps that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. The transport secretary also said those returning from the Greek island of Crete will now not need to quarantine. So where can you go without having to self-isolate on return? Check our guide,here.  The latest government figures show the total number of people to have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK has now reached 673,622. And the number of people dying within 28 days of testing positive stands at 43,293. The graphs here show how cases have been rising again in recent weeks - with daily hospital admissions now at a seven-day average of 730.  Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent Israeli police have made arrests at an
ultra-Orthodox wedding which descended into chaos as guests were dragged away
and officers said glass bottles of cooking oil were thrown at them. The celebration broke Covid-19 rules as
it involved âdozensâ of guests, according to police. It took place in a private house in
the settlement of Givat Zeâev in the occupied West Bank. Videos posted on social media,externalshowed
scuffles between officers and guests. One man with a bloodied face was detained
while another was shown bleeding on the ground. Israeli media reported that
people slipped on the cooking oil and fell on broken glass. Family members accused police of
attacking the brideâs brother. The incident comes amid a growing
row between secular and ultra-religious communities over the response to
lockdown rules in Israel, which is starting to turn the tide on a dramatic
surge in the virus. Some ultra-Orthodox politicians
strongly criticised officers for heavy-handed tactics. But police slammed
attacks on their officers saying they were stopping a âgross violationâ of the
rules. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged local leaders to ""set aside party politics"" so that ""people come together so we can control this virus"". He was speaking after the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said he and other representatives in the region were ""unanimously opposed"" to the introduction of Tier 3 restrictions. Mr Hancock said the leaders should ""work with us to put in place the measures that are needed in Greater Manchester - across the North West, so that we can deal with this virus and support people through it"". He said: ""This is a time for people to come together so that we can control this virus."" When asked if there would be a more generous financial package for the area he said ""there has been an unprecedented package of support"", pointing to measures already announced. And when asked if a national circuit-breaker was necessary he said ""what we want to do is take a regional, a local approach because there are different levels of virus in different parts of the country"". With all the changes you can be forgiven if you are unsure of what the restrictions are where you live. To find out what the rules are in your area you can use our handy postcode checkerhere. Footballer Marcus Rashford helped force a U-turn from the government on providing on free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils in England over the summer holidays - but hislatest appeal to ministersappears to have been turned down. During the coronavirus lockdown the government helped families whose children qualify for free meals. They insisted this would not continue outside of term time - but changed their mind after the England and Manchester United striker's campaign. Now the footballer has launched a petition calling on ministers to go further in tackling child hunger - including providing meals over the Christmas break. It comes as meals are being made available during the breaks to eligible children in Wales. But Downing Street has now indicated that free school meals will not be given to children in England during the holidays. Rashford, who was made an MBE in last week's honours list on the back of his work for vulnerable children,,hit back on Twitter,,externalwriting: ""Merry Christmas kids... It's also not for food banks to feed millions of British children but here we are... This is not going away anytime soon and neither am I..."" As cases and hospital admissions continue to rise across Europe, several countries are rolling out restrictions to ease the stress on healthcare systems and economies. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments on the continent: UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has announced that Italy, San Marino and Vatican City have been removed from the UK's ""travel corridor"" list. As a result, anyone travelling to the UK from any of the states must quarantine for 14 days. The new measure will come into effect from 04:00 BST on Sunday 18 October. Mr Shapps has also announced that anyone arriving in the UK from the Greek island of Crete will no longer need to follow the 14-day isolation rule. Nicola Sturgeon said she could not ""rule out"" having to take further measures At an earlier virtual meeting of the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Welsh-style ban on people travelling from Covid hotspots in other parts of the UK ""is being considered"". ""Although we have put in place tough measures, we cannot rule out having to go further in the future,"" she said. The travel ban for Wales is expected to come into force at 18:00 BST tomorrow, and affects people living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions of England - which will cover half the population by the weekend - as well as the whole of Northern Ireland and the central belt of Scotland. A further 18,980 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to the latest data. Thegovernment's dashboard,externalalso show another 138 people have died within 28 days of a positive test. The figures compare with 19,724 cases and 137 deaths recorded on Wednesday. This video can not be played Over the last few months weâve been told how important it is to wash our hands regularly â for at least 20 seconds â to protect against coronavirus. But with so many different soaps to choose from, how do we work out whatâs best? To mark Global Handwashing Day, Dr Michelle Wong â a beauty blogger with a PhD in chemistry â explains how to find the best soap for your skin when cleaning our hands more regularly, and a trick to get children to wash their hands. Listen toBBC CrowdSciencefor more about how soap works. Authorities in Italy have registered 8,804 new cases during the last 24 hours, beating the previous official high of 7,332 set yesterday. Italy's health ministry also reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths, jumping from 43 on Wednesday, but far less than the peak of the country's outbreak in March and April, when daily death tolls reached more than 900. It comes as infections continue to soar around Europe, prompting the rollout of restrictions in countries like neighbouring France. While Burnham was talking in Manchester, there was news of a likely development in Wales. The BBC has been told that the Welsh Governmentis expected to announce a limited ""circuit breaker"" lockdown in the next few days. A circuit-breaker a short period of time where tighter restrictions are brought in to break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising. It is not yet clear when the announcement will be made, for how long a limited shutdown would last, or which sectors would close. But what is known  is that Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has written to First Minister Mark Drakeford asking him to give businesses time to prepare for such a move.  The Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham concludes his comments by revealing that government ministers suggested there is ""no money left"" for the kind of financial package the local leaders say is necessary before their areas are put into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Burnham, who spoke to health ministers earlier today, said he had been told ""there is no money to put on the table"". He added: ""To be honest with you, I don't believe that for one second. When I look today at some of the fees they are paying to consultants working on the failed test and trace scheme, when I look at the billions that is being thrown at a scheme that isn't working for Greater Manchester, money that has been found for other things this year. ""The argument I am making is... support people right now when they need it because by supporting people  now you will save jobs and businesses that will be able to restart the minute we find a vaccine, the minute the recovery is on."" Burnham says he and other Greater Manchester leaders were told by the deputy chief medical officer  that the ""only certain thing to work is a national lockdown"". But Burnham then points out the government was ""unwilling to do that because of the harm it would do to the national economy"". ""They are willing to sacrifice jobs and businesses here [in north-west England] to try and save them elsewhere,"" Burnham said, adding that they were being treated as ""canaries in the coal mine"" for an ""experimental regional lockdown strategy"". He said the ""very least"" the government needed to do was to offer a furlough scheme with 80% of wages paid, support for the self-employed and help for businesses, the same as that offered to the general population during the first national lockdown from March. Burnham, a former Labour health secretary who has been the Greater Manchester mayor since 2017, said regional leaders had communicated their ""clear and unanimous"" view to the government that it was wrong to put some of poorest parts in England into a ""punishing lockdown"" without adequate support that was ""not certain to control the virus"". Asked whether he thinks the government would impose the Tier 3 restrictions on the region without local agreement, Burnham said: ""We can't simply be treated as second-class citizens. We understand the government's view and wait for further engagement."" He added: ""If the government are convinced this approach will work.... they have to back that properly, fully financially, so it will have a chance of working."" Burnham adds that the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said bringing infection rates down would ""require widespread closures way beyond pubs"". ""They are asking us to gamble our residents' jobs, homes and businesses and large chunk of our economy on a strategy that their own experts say will not work,"" he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

In awidely watched livestream video,external, officers were seen reading out charges to Ms Panusaya in a hotel room. Another video showed police putting her into a car as she and her supporters chanted slogans. This video can not be played 'Long live the people': Watch as Thai protest leader is arrested and carried into police car The protest movement they have helped lead began by calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha - a former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup and was appointed premier after controversial elections last year - and has expanded since to call for curbs on the powers of the king. The calls for royal reforms are particularly sensitive in Thailand, where criticism of the monarchy is punishable by long prison sentences. The months of protests leading up to the emergency decree issued on Thursday represent the biggest challenge in years to Thailand's establishment, which is dominated by the military and royal palace. On Wednesday, protesters jeered and held up the three-finger salute as a motorcade passed carrying the queen through Bangkok. Many protesters held their fingers up in a three-finger salute, which has become a symbol of the movement The proximity of the demonstration to the royal convoy was cited by the government in a televised address as one of the reasons for the emergency decree. But the protesters ignored the new rules on Thursday afternoon to once again gather in their thousands. ""Like dogs cornered, we are fighting till our deaths,"" Panupong ""Mike Rayong"" Jadnok, one the high-profile protest leaders who remains free, told the crowd. ""We won't fall back. We won't run away. We won't go anywhere."" Police appealed to the crowd to disperse, eventually setting a 18:00 curfew. ""The people who came know that there is a ban against public gathering of five or more,"" said police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen. ""We will take things step by step."" Few in Thailand will have been surprised to hear of the arrest of the main protest leaders and tougher restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression. Some may even have been relieved that it did not end in bloodshed, as so often before in political crises here. When Anon Nampa, a deceptively mild-looking lawyer, first called for an honest discussion about the monarchy, on 3 August, you could almost hear the collective intake of breath across the country at his boldness. When Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul read out 10 demands for royal reform and accountability from a university stage a week later, Thailand braced itself for a backlash. In a country where every constitution requires the king to ""be held in a position of revered worship"", this was akin to blasphemy. The backlash did not come. A government struggling under the weight of multiple challenges, from the dire economic outlook to a series of scandals, seemed reluctant to risk provoking further public anger. But the persistence of large-scale rallies, where protesters ridiculed the royal institution, could not be tolerated for long, especially now that the king had returned to Thailand for an extended stay. With their leaders locked up outside Bangkok and any public gatherings banned, the movement will find it hard to keep going. The authorities may also go after those they believe have been funding the protests. But what has been said about the monarchy cannot be unsaid. A taboo has been broken. People of all ages, from all parts of the country, aside from die-hard royalists, now agree with the student leaders, that the monarchy is fair game in any overhaul of Thailand's institutions. It is only a matter of time before we see similar protests again. Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest but a new wave began in February after a popular opposition political party was ordered to dissolve. The order followed elections in March last year - the first since the military seized power in 2014 and the first chance to vote for many young people and first-time voters. The elections were seen as an opportunity for change after years of military rule. Prayuth Chan-ocha: Thailand's face of hybrid democracy Thai pro-democracy party dissolved over loan With the all-important support of the military, Prayuth Chan-ocha was re-installed as prime minister. The pro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP), with its charismatic leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, garnered the third-largest share of seats and was particularly popular with young, first-time voters. But in February a court ruled the FFP had received a loan from Thanathorn which was deemed a donation - making it illegal - and the party was forced to disband, prompting thousands of young Thais to join street protests. The protests were halted by Covid-19 restrictions, which banned gatherings, but they began again in June when a prominent pro-democracy activist went missing. Pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit was reportedly snatched off the street in Cambodia Wanchalearm Satsaksit, who had been living in Cambodia in exile since 2014, was reportedly grabbed off the street and bundled off into a vehicle. Protesters accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - a charge police and government officials have denied. The satirist who vanished in broad daylight In recent months, the protesters have challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, which made him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people. There have also been questions over the king's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand.

Sturgeon 'unlikely' to ease household visit rules,"Pubs and restaurants in Scotland's central belt are currently closed,but could reopen from 26 October Nicola Sturgeon has warned that Scotland will not return to normal when the current restrictions on pubs and restaurants expire later this month. Licensed premises across the central belt were temporarily closed last week, with tough restrictions placed on those elsewhere in the country. The rules are due to expire on 26 October - but Ms Sturgeon said this would not signal a return to normality. The ban on visiting other people's homes will also remain in place. And the Scottish government is to introduce a multi-tier system of alert levels similar to that now in force in England, which could potentially see venues in areas with coronavirus outbreaks remain closed. Ms Sturgeon was giving a video statement to MSPs as she announced that a further 1,351 cases of Covid-19 and 13 deaths were registered in Scotland. She said the country was in a ""precarious"" position and facing a ""critical moment"" in the battle to contain the virus, with ""tough decisions"" needed from government. All existing restrictions and guidance are to remain in place for now, and the first minister warned that even the expiry of ""tough temporary restrictions"" on the hospitality trade would not signal a major change. She said: ""It is important to stress that given the ongoing challenge of Covid, that will not herald a return to complete normality. ""The restrictions on household gatherings for example will remain in place until it is considered safe to ease them. ""And more generally we intend to replace the temporary restrictions with a more strategic approach to managing the pandemic"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was in a ""precarious"" position The government is drawing up a system similar to that newly in force in England, with ""different tiers of levels of interventions"". It will include plans to ""strengthen and improve the effectiveness"" of existing measures, and improve compliance with rules particularly around self-isolation. Ms Sturgeon also said she could not rule out ""having to go further in future"". The Welsh government is introducing a system of travel restrictions to stop people moving from areas of the UK with higher rates of Covid-19 into areas with lower prevalence of the virus. Ms Sturgeon said that ""needs to be considered"" in Scotland, and has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for ""urgent talks"". New regulations have also been tabled tightening the rules around face coverings. The new rules will make it mandatory for workers to wear them while moving around in offices or in staff canteens. However one rule has been eased, with an exemption introduced to allow couples to take part in marriage and civil partnership ceremonies without wearing masks. The first minister has written to Boris Johnson urging him to adopt a ""four nations"" approach to travel restrictions Ms Sturgeon's speech took place in an entirely virtual meeting, with Holyrood currently in recess, and connection issues meant Ruth Davidson's question was largely inaudible. The Scottish Conservative group leader called on the government to introduce more testing in hospitals to stop the virus from spreading there. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie echoed this, and called for ""regular weekly testing on a much bigger scale"". The first minister said hospital acquired infections were ""a concern"", and that opposition party leaders would be consulted as part of an ongoing review of the testing strategy. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said measures had been introduced ""with no engagement of those affected"", which had resulted in ""ambiguity and confusion"". Ms Sturgeon rejected his claims she had ""ignored scientific advice"", saying: ""I will make no apology, given the nature of the threat we are dealing with right now, of being prepared to take quick, firm and decisive action if we deem that is necessary to save lives."" Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie pressed the first minister on delays in the contact tracing system, saying it was ""alarming"" and ""dangerous"" that in the past week 567 people had waited more than two days to get a call from Test and Protect. Ms Sturgeon said the system was ""working incredibly well"" but accepted that ""the turnaround time is not as quick as we want it to be"".

EU leaders weigh up hard choices over Brexit trade deal,"Both sides have been calling on the other to compromise on key issues The threat was implicit. On the eve of their two-day summit in Brussels, the prime minister reminded EU leaders of his words back in early September. A trade deal had to have been agreed between the two sides by 15 October for it to be in force by the end of the year, he'd said. If not, he added: ""I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on."" In other words - end negotiations and walk away. Yet, Boris Johnson moved the goalpost himself on Wednesday evening. In a call with the European Commission president and the European Council president he said he would wait for EU leaders to finish their summit discussions on Friday before deciding the UK's next steps. EU diplomats I spoke to were unimpressed. ""Boris Johnson swore before he'd die in a ditch. He's set deadlines again and again and they have come and gone,"" a seasoned EU figure told me. But Brussels is far from sanguine about the prospect of failing to agree a UK deal. Leaders like the Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte have said the Covid-19 pandemic makes it all the more important to have an agreement. The economic fallout of no-deal come the end of the year would provoke additional political and economic headaches EU politicians would far prefer to avoid. They assume Boris Johnson feels the same way. Why France is raising the stakes over fishing What trade deals has the UK done so far? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Yet EU leaders are not yet all on the same page when it comes to how much they should give up or give in to get a deal. Brussels keeps calling on the UK to make concessions but a successful outcome will require compromises on both sides. And that is the real significance of this week's summit. It's not all about Brexit. EU leaders plan to discuss Covid-19, the environment and EU-Africa relations as well. But this is very likely the last time they'll be face to face before negotiations with the UK end. It's also the first time in a long time that EU leaders hold a detailed discussion on Brexit. For much of this year the Covid-19 pandemic has sucked the political oxygen across Europe. Why does the UK need another Brexit deal? Jargon-busting guide to Brexit So, how much is a deal worth to them? Will France's Emmanuel Macron relinquish his hard-line position about keeping current fishing quotas in UK waters? He'll have to, to get a UK deal. Will Germany's Angela Merkel give way on some demands on competition regulations (aka the level playing field) yet still grant the UK zero tariff, zero quota access to the single market? EU leaders must agree all this amongst themselves and it won't be straightforward. A trade agreement with the UK impacts the bloc's global reputation, EU businesses (especially those in countries with high trade volumes with the UK, like Germany and the Netherlands) and political fortunes. Angela Merkel is thinking of her legacy as she prepares to step down as chancellor next year. She wants to maintain close ties with the UK for geopolitical as well as economic reasons. She also keen to avoid any major internal EU disagreements over the deal. Emmanuel Macron meanwhile, is looking over his shoulder at his arch political rival, the Eurosceptic nationalist Marine Le Pen. He hopes to demonstrate in negotiations with the UK that leaving the EU is fraught with difficulty. He also wants to be seen fighting for French interests - hence the hard line on fish. And on competition regulations. Mr Macron and other EU leaders don't want to grant the UK advantageous access to their single market if the UK is then free to undercut European businesses by slashing regulations and/or boosting UK enterprises with government subsidies that Brussels doesn't allow its members. Fishing is a major sticking point in negotiations between the UK and the EU So how much will the EU curb its desire to keep the UK attached to its competition rules and standards in order to reach a deal? The UK says it's left the bloc, is now a sovereign nation and must be recognised by Brussels as such. EU diplomats suggest it would help them ease up on their level-playing-field demands if the UK signed up to a dispute mechanism with teeth - meaning if either side breached the terms of their trade deal, then swift and hefty legal action could be taken. One diplomat close to the negotiations rather patronisingly described this potential EU compromise position by comparing the UK to a toddler that doesn't want to eat its vegetables. He said the EU was now looking for alternative arrangements to get the UK to sign up to a deal. He described it as mixing things up to hide the vegetables from the toddler. This video can not be played Boris Johnson urges UK businesses to exploit Brexit So will the UK sign up to a vegetable mush? To an aggressive dispute mechanism and to high-level common principles on state aid, for example, as well as a strong national regulator? There are indications it might, but working out the technical details is ""not to be underestimated"" as a UK source put it. British negotiators say they're frustrated that the EU has so far refused to start working on joint legal texts that can be sent backwards and forwards between the two sides as negotiations progress. The most likely outcome from this week's EU summit as far as Brexit is concerned is that leaders will call for negotiations to step up in pace and intensity (if you think you've heard all this before, you are absolutely right). France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says EU-UK talks between now and mid-November will be decisive. If the prime minister signs up to them.

Nine Brexit moments you may have missed,"With the world gripped by the coronavirus pandemic it's been easy to lose track of what's happening with Brexit. Big changes will happen from 1 January, but the UK and the EU are running out of time to agree the new rules. Here are nine significant moments from this year. At 23:00 GMT on 31 Januarythe UK officially left the EU- nearly four years after the public vote took place. Brexit supporters celebrated in London's Parliament Square, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to bring the country together and ""take us forward"". But the UK did not immediately cut all of its EU ties. The UK went into atransition periodthat meant continuing to follow EU rules until 31 December 2020. The transition was to allow both sides some breathing space while further UK-EU talks take place. The outcome of these negotiations will determine the rules for the new UK-EU relationship - including on trade -  which will start on 1 January 2021. What is the transition period? The new negotiations got under way in Brussels on 2 March. Leading the talks for the UK was David Frost, who arrived with 100 advisers and government officials. At the opposite end of the table was Michel Barnier - the EU's chief Brexit negotiator. The biggest issue was a trade deal - everything from lorries crossing borders to financial services rules. But there was plenty of other stuff to discuss - security co-operation and medicine safety being examples. Both sides say they want to avoid tariffs, which are taxes on goods that cross a border. But the UK wants to set all of its own rules and the EU says it doesn't want changes to the rules that mean the UK has an unfair advantage. With the coronavirus crisis taking centre stage, little progress was made with the trade talks. Two major sticking points emerged: Fishing:Both sides disagreed on how much access EU boats should have to UK waters. State aid:Under current EU rules, countries are not allowed to give money to save failing companies. The UK argued it should be allowed (now that it's not in the EU) to spend state aid money on whatever it wants. However, the EU said the UK should follow the current rules so that its businesses would not gain an unfair advantage over EU competitors. Frustration was growing on both sides and on 21 August Mr Barnier told a press conference thatthe chance of an EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal ""seems unlikely""while Lord Frost said the EU had made things ""unnecessarily difficult"". In a further sign that talks were in trouble, Lord Frost told the Mail on Sunday thatthe UK was not scared to walk awayand urged the EU to ""take our position seriously"". If talks do fail then charges - known as tariffs - would be applied to most goods which UK businesses send to the EU. That could make UK goods more expensive in the EU. Tariffs on EU goods coming into the UK would also be introduced. Full border checks would also be needed and businesses have voiced their fears thatthis would cause long lorry queues at portsand lead to significant trade disruption around the country. Both sides want to continue to trade with zero tariffs and not bring in too many extra checks - but that will require a trade deal. The UK also wants services - everything from accountancy to education - included in any deal. Brexit: a simple guide What are the sticking points? In September, the UK government proposed changes that it acknowledged would break international law in a ""specific and limited way"". The Brexit deal negotiated in 2019 - known as the withdrawal agreement - established new checks on goods travelling from Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This was to prevent checks from having to take place along the Irish border after the transition ends. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis said Northern Ireland customs rules legislation would âbreak international law in a very specific and limited wayâ However, the UK government said it wanted to make changes to the previously-agreed arrangement in order to bring clarity and avoid disruption from 1 January. In response,the EU announced it had started legal proceedings against the UK. Despite this, the EU said it would not walk away from the trade talks. What changes is the government planning? What is the Northern Ireland protocol? A ""historic moment"" was how International Trade Secretary Liz Truss described thesigning of the UK's first major trade deal since it left the EU. Brexit supporters said the Japan agreement showed that the UK could negotiate better deals than the EU and that further ones would follow. Critics, however, said it was more important to remain close to the EU and that the Japan deal largely replicated the deal the EU already had. US presidential candidate Joe Biden said he would not allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit"". In the tweet sent on 16 September, Mr Biden also said there would be no future US-UK trade deal if border checks returned. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With no breakthrough in the trade talks, the UK government unveiled how it would handle a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" where queues of 7,000 trucks could clog up roads around the port of Dover and Channel Tunnel from 1 January. To avoid this, the government said it would introducea new permit systemfor lorries entering Kent. This would be to prevent lorries without the right paperwork from travelling into the county and attempting to ferry goods to the EU. Seven things that will change on 1 January 2021 With less than 100 days before the new relationship was due to begin,Mr Johnson said that a deal was ""all there""and that it was up to the EU to get it across the line. The EU said while agreement had been reached in a number of technical areas, such as aviation safety, there were still some serious differences to overcome. If a trade deal doesn't happen then contingency measures, in areas like medicine safety, could be introduced. This would be to try to cushion some of the worst disruption that could begin on 1 January. What happens now that a deal's been done? What trade deals has the UK done so far?

PM 'disappointed' with pre-summit trade progressBoris Johnson has previously set Thursday's EU meeting as the deadline for a post-Brexit trade deal.,"Boris Johnson will decide on the ""next steps"" for post-Brexit trade talks after an EU summit later this week, Downing Street has said. No 10 said the PM expressed ""disappointment"" at recent progress in a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday. Mr Johnson has previously set Thursday's meeting of EU leaders as the deadline for a deal. Mrs von der Leyen said the EU wanted a deal, ""but not at any price"". Both sides are calling on the other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and limits on government subsidies to businesses. They are locked in talks over striking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in December. Brexit: Time for trade deal getting short, PM warns Nine moments that explain where Brexit has got to What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? A No 10 spokesperson said Mr Johnson ""noted the desirability of a deal"" during his pre-summit call with Mrs von der Leyen. However, the PM also ""expressed his disappointment that more progress had not been made over the past two weeks,"" they added. ""The prime minister said that he looked forward to hearing the outcome of the European Council and would reflect before setting out the UK's next steps."" Earlier, a No 10 spokesman said fishing rights remained the ""starkest"" point of difference ahead of Thursday's two-day EU leaders' summit. The government's chief Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost was seen going into Downing Street on Thursday morning. Backbench Conservative Peter Bone told MPs Lord Frost was briefing the prime minister ""on whether to continue the negotiations or whether to call it a day and prepare for a no-trade deal Brexit"". Speaking after her call with the prime minister, Mrs von der Leyen said: ""The EU is working on a deal, but not at any price."" She added that ""conditions must be right"" on fishing, post-Brexit competition rules and how a deal is enforced for the EU to sign an agreement. She added: ""Still a lot of work ahead of us."" European Council President Charles Michel also joined the call with Mrs von der Leyen and the Mr Johnson on Wednesday evening. In a letter to EU leaders ahead of Thursday's meeting, Mr Michel said reaching a deal before December was ""in the interests of both sides"". He added that as well as fishing rights, ""key issues"" for a deal included post-Brexit rules on competition and how a deal would be enforced. EU leaders are not yet all on the same page when it comes to how much they should give up or give in to get a deal. Brussels keeps calling on the UK to make concessions but a successful outcome will require compromises on both sides. Will France's Emmanuel Macron relinquish his hard-line position about keeping current fishing quotas in UK waters? He'll have to, to get a UK deal. Will Germany's Angela Merkel give way on some demands on competition regulations (aka the level playing field) yet still grant the UK zero tariff, zero quota access to the single market? EU leaders must agree all this amongst themselves and it won't be straightforward. Read more from Katya here. Over the summer, both the UK and EU seemed to agree the end of October was the final date to get a deal done - allowing enough time for it to be ratified before 31 December. But come 7 September, Boris Johnson decided to shorten the deadline. Hesaid,externalif a deal wasn't reached by 15 October, ""then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on"". Thursday is that day - but Downing Street appears to have moved back from it as a hard deadline. Formal negotiations ended at the start of October, but Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen pledged to ""intensify talks"" over the coming weeks. Pressed on whether the UK would walk away on 15 October, the government's chief negotiator Lord Frost said it was his job to ""advise the prime minister"" on whether a deal was on the cards by then. Speaking on Tuesday, France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian suggested EU leaders do not see this week as a hard deadline for a breakthrough. ""The date of 15 October, it's Prime Minister Boris Johnson who announced that, it is not the position of the European Council,"" he told French MPs. He added that ""everything should be played out"" between October 15 and ""mid-November"". He warned that the prospect of no deal was ""unfortunately very likely,"" but the EU was ""prepared for all eventualities"". By remaining in the bloc's single market and customs union, the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules during its post-Brexit transition period. This 11-month period is due to end in December, and the UK has ruled out seeking an extension. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, initially via video link before in-person discussions resumed over the summer. If a deal is not done, the UK will trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the World Trade Organization.
