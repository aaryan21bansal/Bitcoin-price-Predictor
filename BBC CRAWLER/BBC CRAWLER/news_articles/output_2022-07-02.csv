Ukraine and Russia both claim control over city,"The fighting in Lysychansk sent plumes of smoke rising to the sky Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk is at the centre of competing claims, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces saying they are in control. Ukraine says its forces are enduring intense Russian shelling there but insists the city has not been seized. However, Russian-backed separatists say they have successfully entered the city and reached its centre. Russian media showed videos of separatist or Russian forces apparently parading through the streets. Russian sources have also tweeted video of the Soviet flag allegedly being placed on the city's ruined administrative centre, but that has not been verified. It is the last Ukrainian-held city in Luhansk, part of the industrial Donbas region. Russia captured the nearby city of Severodonetsk last month. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been no let-up in the assault on Lysychansk, with Russian forces approaching the besieged city from all sides. Rodion Miroshnik, ambassador to Russia of the pro-Moscow breakaway Luhansk People's Republic, told Russian television that Lysychansk had been ""brought under control"" but was ""not yet liberated"". Images of Chechen Russian soldiers inside the city were shared by defence blogger Rob Lee. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Since Russia invaded on 24 February, claiming it wanted to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine after it moved closer to Nato,thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed or wounded, whileat least 12 million people have fled their homes. Western states have responded by arming Ukraine and placing unprecedented sanctions on Russia, a nuclear superpower and global energy supplier. Can we say how many people have died in Ukraine? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Why Russia couldn't hold Snake Island In another development, railway tracks and electricity lines in the northern city of Kharkiv were damaged in a series of attacks. No casualties were reported. The southern city of Mykolaiv - on a key route to the port city of Odesa - was shaken by several explosions. The Russian defence ministry said its air force had destroyed five Ukrainian command posts and several ammunition dumps, but that claim has not been independently verified. The blasts came a day after the Russians were accused of killing more than 20 people in a missile strike on a block of flats near Odesa. Later on Saturday, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said his country's air defences had shot down Ukrainian missiles, though he did not specify where. He is a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin and allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine from Belarus in February. ""They are provoking us...  Three days ago, maybe a bit more, an attempt to strike military facilities on Belarusian territory was made from the territory of Ukraine,"" he said. ""But, thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles."" He added that ""we are not seeking to fight in Ukraine"". In its latest intelligence update, the UK Defence Ministry accuses Russia of using Soviet-era anti-ship missiles ""in a secondary land attack role"" - not what they were designed for. The Kh-22 and Kh-32 missiles were ""likely"" the ones that killed many civilians in Kremenchuk and Odesa, the ministry says. Slovyansk, a major Donbas city held by Ukrainian forces, has also been shelled again by the Russians. Its mayor Vadym Lyakh said banned Russian cluster munitions killed four people there - another claim the BBC was unable to verify.

What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?,"US officials say President Biden has given Ukraine permission to fire long-range ATACMS missiles into Russian territory. It is thought that the UK and France could follow suit by saying that Storm Shadow missiles can also be used against targets inside Russia. Western nations have now donated more than $100bn (Â£79bn) of military aid to Ukraine. The US has been the biggest source of military aid to Ukraine, including weapons, equipment and financial assistance. Between February 2022 and the end of August 2024, it gave $61.1bn (Â£48.4bn),according to German think tank the Kiel Institute,external. Germany has given $11.4bn (Â£9bn) in military aid, the UK $10.1bn (Â£8bn), Denmark $7bn (Â£5.6bn), and the Netherlands $5.5bn (Â£4.4bn). However, the Kiel Institute warnsthere could be a ""significant fall"" in aid to Ukraine in 2025,external, suggesting that President Trump could cut the US contribution when he returns to the White House in January. Germany is expectedto cut its military aid to Ukraine in 2025 by roughly half. What $61bn US aid boost could mean for Ukraine Nato pledges more advanced air defences to Ukraine Missiles and artillery Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have used artillery and guided missiles extensively, to prevent enemy forces advancing and to attack supply depots and command centres. Ukrainehas been using US-made ATACMS missiles against Russian forces inside Ukraine. These missiles have a range of about 190 miles (300km). It had not been allowed to fire them into Russian territory, for fear that doing so might drag the US and other Nato countries into the war. However,US officials say President Biden has lifted the ban, allowing ATACMS to be used to help Ukraine defend territory it occupies in the Russian Kursk region. The UK and France have supplied Ukraine withStorm Shadow or Scalp missiles, which have a maximum range of around 155 miles (250km). Both countries have banned Ukrainian forces from firing them into Russia, although Ukraine has also long asked to be allowed to do so. Ukraine's allies have also sent itmore than 80 multiple-launch rocket systems,,externalaccording to the Kiel Institute. These include the Himars system from the US and the M270 missile system from the UK. The Kiel Institute says they have also sent more than 500 field guns, including the M777 howitzer from the US. However, Russia has an advantage on the battlefield becauseits supply of artillery shells has been much greater than Ukraine's,external, according to the UK-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). Fighter jets At the end of July, Ukraine's President Zelensky said its air forcehad taken delivery of the first batch of F-16 fighter jets from the West. He said many more were needed. Nato countries, including Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway, have pledged to give Ukraine 65 or more of the US-made planes, which they had been planning to retire from their air forces. In August 2023, the US gave permission for F-16s to be sent to Ukraine. Since then, Western nations have been training Ukrainian pilots to fly them. Phillips O'Brien, Professor of Strategic Studies at St Andrews University says: ""Ukraine will be using the F-16s mostly for defence against air attacks."" The US-based Center for Strategic and International Studiessays they could eventually be given extra roles,external, such as attacking Russian air defence systems, command centres and supply depots, and engaging Russian aircraft in Ukrainian airspace. Air defence systems To counter Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's cities and infrastructure, Western nations have sent it several types of air defence system. These range from the UK's short-range anti-aircraft weapon, Starstreak, to the Patriot missile system. Patriots are expensive to operate -one missile costs about $3m. The US and Norway have also provided the Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) for air defence, and Germany has offered the Iris-T. Munitions In July 2023, the US saidit had supplied cluster bombs to Ukraineto help dislodge Russian troops from defensive positions. These weapons, delivered mostly in artillery shells, scatter multiple bomblets,and are banned by more than 100 countries because of the risk they pose to civilians. Tanks In early 2023, Western nations agreed to send tanks to Ukraine. It was hoped they would enable its forces to breach Russian defensive lines in a counter-offensive. The UK provided 14 Challenger 2s. European nations have sent more than 200 German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 tanks, according tofigures from the Kiel Institute,external. The US sent 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks, which are thought to be the most advanced in the world. Anti-tank weapons Western countries first responded to Russia's invasion in February 2022 by supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons to counter the enemy's armoured brigades. The US and UK supplied thousands of Javelin and Nlaw anti-tank missiles. These were considered crucial in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv. Drones Drones have been used extensively throughout the war, for surveillance, targeting, launching missiles and as ""kamikaze"" weapons. Turkey supplied missile-firing Bayraktar TB2 drones at the start of the conflict, the US has provided ""Switchblade"" kamikaze drones, and several countries have sent commercial surveillance drones, such as the Chinese-made DJI Mavic 3. In February 2024, the UK government said it would join a coalition of countriessupplying Ukraine with thousands of ""first person view"" drones,external, for observation and target spotting.

Pride returns with 'biggest ever' London parade,"This video can not be played Watch: 'What a milestone' - Pride's 50th anniversary in London More than a million people have taken part in the 50th anniversary of the UK's first Pride parade in London. Hundreds of LGBTQ+ community groups attended the march from Hyde Park Corner to Whitehall Palace earlier. Revellers wearing face paint, glitter, jewels and sequins joined the celebrations as Pride returned for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic. The event, hailed as the most inclusive in history, included performances from Ava Max and Emeli Sande. Thousands gather for Pride in London Seaside resort hosts its first ever Pride event The riots that changed the history of gay rights The parade paid homage to theoriginal 1972 march, organised by the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), and saw revellers pass significant sites from the UK's LGBTQ+ movement. Floats lined Park Lane ahead of the main march through the capital, which was led by GLF activists holding placards reading ""I was there in 1972"". Organisers described the 2022 event as the "" biggest and most inclusive event in history."" Pride in London spokesperson Haven Thorn said: ""It's the return of Pride after a two year Covid induced hiatus, so there's so much pent up demand and energy this year. ""We were expecting record numbers of people - 1.5 million LGBT travellers to come to the capital and celebrate."" Thousands gathered in Trafalgar Square to celebrate The parade paid homage to the 1972 march, passing significant sites from the UK's first LGBTQ+ movement In Trafalgar Square, Dame Kelly Holmes told the crowd she would ""never live behind that curtain again"" after coming out as gay last month. ""For 34 years I have never been able to say those words until two weeks ago, due to the fear of judgement and retribution that was instilled in me since the age of 18 because the laws in the military and being in the public eye,"" the Olympic champion said. Dame Kelly, 52, shared her relief at coming out as gay last month At the front of the parade, the star of Netflix coming-of-age drama Heartstopper, Joe Locke, said it was an honour to be celebrating ""being queer when the world might not be so accepting"". Padraigin Ni Raghillig, who rode her Harley-Davidson at the front of the Pride parade as president of Dykes on Bikes London, said it felt ""fantastic"" to be back after two years. And Kevin, from Uganda, said he was ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London. ""I'm proud to be a gay man,"" he said. This video can not be played London Pride at 50: Veteran meets parade first-timer Pride volunteers add rainbow face paint to each other's faces ahead of the Pride in London parade By Lauren Moss, LGBT and identity correspondent, at the parade In 2022 Pride is most definitely a party. People were dancing in the street, throwing sweets, blowing whistles and having a great time. An enormous rainbow flag billowed out behind the Gay Liberation Front, who organised the first protest in 1972. There's no doubt that it's worlds away from what it was when it started with a few hundred people risking arrest for kissing each other in the street. They're followed by thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago. More than 600 LGBTQ+ community groups joined the march Revellers wore face paint, glitter, jewels and sequins Mohammed Nazir, 24, from Bangladesh, from campaign group Rainbows Across Borders, said he wanted to dedicate this year's pride to those who were still forced to hide their sexuality. ""Pride is about self-affirmation, dignity and equality. It is a way to meet some other LGBTQ people,"" he said. ""Pride is a movement where we're still fighting for our rights."" The Mayor of London said there was still a ""danger"" to the LGBT+ community Angela Rayner and Keir Starmer also joined the parade The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said there was still a ""danger"" to the LGBTQ+ community. ""We saw this time last week an attack in Oslo just hours before that parade, where two people lost their lives and more than 20 were injured,"" the Labour mayor said. ""We're marching today for an open, inclusive accepting world. We're marching today for those in Oslo, for those who haven't made the progress we've made."" Revellers gathered in Trafalgar Square for music and entertainment It is the 50th anniversary of the UK's first Pride parade in London Uniformed officers from the Metropolitan Police did not join this year's parade, as they have done in past events, after organisers asked them not to take part. Organisers said it reflected the ""very real concerns"" of the LGBTQ+ community - in particular over the force's handling of four murders of gay men by serial killer Stephen Port. The force acknowledged concerns from the LGBTQ+ community in the wake of inquests which concluded police failings ""probably"" contributed to the deaths of the young men. It wasn't just London that marked Pride on Saturday. People in Shetland held their first Pride festival, the most northerly celebration of its kind in the UK,complete with burlesque dancers, a samba band and people dressed as Vikings. Clacton, in Essex, also celebrated its first Pride event, after organiser Cheryl Pipersaid she never thought Pride would reach the town.

Flight cancellation plan aims to ease summer chaos,"Passengers faced delays and cancellations during Easter and the May bank holidays Airlines are expected to announce a series of cancellations to UK summer flights this week aimed at minimising disruption in the peak holiday season. A government ""amnesty"" to the rules on airport slots is in place until Friday, allowing airlines to change schedules without facing a potential penalty. Ministers told carriers to review their plans after chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff. British Airways said the move would help provide ""certainty"" to customers. The UK's biggest airline, whose services from Heathrow Airport are likely to bear the brunt of this week's cancellations, said the measures would make it ""easier to consolidate some of our quieter daily flights to multi-frequency destinations well in advance, and to protect more of our holiday flights"". Airport slots provide airlines with the authorisation to take off or land at a specified time on a specified day. In usual circumstances, the carriers risk losing the slots - and taking a hit to their business - if they cancel flights. Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Airlines told to cancel flights to stop travel chaos The Department for Transport (DfT) amnesty will give airlines a short window to hand back the slots in the summer season they are not confident they will be able to operate. A DfT spokesperson said: ""This will help passengers find alternative arrangements ahead of time, rather than face the kind of last-minute cancellations seen over the Easter and half-term holidays."" That earlier disruption prompted the government and the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to write to airlines telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable... based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available"". Heathrow said the slot amnesty would ""enable airlines to make early choices to consolidate their schedules, boosting the resilience of summer operations and giving passengers the confidence they deserve ahead of their journeys"". It added: ""We encourage airlines to take this opportunity to reconsider their summer schedules without penalty and inform passengers as early as possible of any changes."" Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said it followed other measures taken by the sector. ""We will continue to work with ministers and the whole aviation ecosystem to ensure the summer peak runs as smoothly as possible for our passengers,"" he said. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said the move would also allow rival airlines to step in and fly the cancelled routes. He said: ""Carriers must surrender their slots to other airlines if they are unable to fulfil them. This will help reduce cancellations and end the unsustainable practice of airlines flying near-empty planes to retain slots."" Thousands of aviation jobs were lost during the Covid pandemic and many businesses have struggled to recruit enough new staff in time to deal with resurgent demand for travel following the easing of rules. Gatwick said it would be reducing the number of flightsduring summer because of staff shortages even before the airport slots amnesty was first set out by the government on 21 June, Heathrow to date had not announced similar plans although last weekit ordered 30 flights to be cancelled, saying it was expecting more passenger numbers than it could cope with. It comes asManchester Airport warnedit would not be able to return to its pre-pandemic standards until the autumn. Aviation industry consultant Paul Charles predicted thousands of flight cancellations would be announced this week, meaning less last-minute disruption over the summer. But he told BBC News passengers were facing a ""summer of stress"". Staffing levels remained 20-30% lower than they should be, he said, with a rise in Covid cases seeing airline and ground workers calling in sick in recent weeks. Meanwhile, passengers face the prospect of disruption from strikes involving airline staff over summer. Hundreds ofBritish Airways workers at Heathrow Airport- mostly check-in staff - have voted to go on strike in July over pay, andunions are currently consulting engineers and call centre staffat Gatwick, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle on taking action. Unions have also called forEasyJet cabin crew based in Spain to strike for nine daysthis month as part of a dispute over pay.

What should happen to children who kill?,"Craig Mulligan has been named as the 14-year-old boy involved in the killing of Logan Mwangi A ""complete shift"" is needed in the way we deal with children who murder, a campaigner has said. A 14-year-old boy and two adults were given life sentences for murdering five-year-old Logan Mwangi. Dr Tim Bateman wants shorter maximum terms, children held in secure childcare establishments and theage of criminal responsibility,externalraised to 16. The Ministry of Justice said it was committed to triallingsecure schools,externalas a new model of youth custody. Logan's mother Angharad Williamson, 31, his stepfather John Cole, 40, and Craig Mulligan, 14, killed Logan in July 2021, in a""brutal and sustained"" attackat home in Sarn, Bridgend county, leaving him with ""catastrophic"" injuries. His body was dumped in a nearby river. Cole will serve a minimum term of 29 years in prison while Williamson will serve at least 28 years,after being found guilty of murder following a trial at Cardiff Crown Court. Mulligan - who is not the biological son of Cole but was raised by him from the age of nine months - will serve at least 15 years. Jon Venables (left) and Robert Thompson murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993 The age of responsibility In many other countries around the world, Mulligan would not have come to court because his age would prevent him from being prosecuted for any crime, said Dr Bateman, chair of the National Association for Youth Justice. The age at which children are regarded as responsible for their actions in law varies across Europe - from 10 in Wales and England through to 14 in Germany, 15 in the Netherlands and 16 in Portugal. James Bulger was abducted from a shopping centre, tortured and murdered by two 10-year-olds in 1993 The youngest convicted murderers in modern British history are Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, the 10-year-olds who in 1993 abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James Bulger. They were jailed for life but released on licence with new identities in 2001. The year after James' murder, five-year-old Silje Redergard was beaten by two six-year-old boys and left to freeze to death in the snow in Trondheim,Norway. But in Norway, no children under 15 are prosecuted and Silje's killers were left with their families, helped by psychiatrists and social workers and wereback at kindergarten within a week,external. Recalling the public outrage that followed James' murder, Lawrence Lee, the solicitor who represented Venables, said: ""I don't think society could get their heads around how this kind of thing could happen."" He said the scenes outside the court, where people hurled bricks at the prison van, would ""live with me forever"". Hundreds of toys, teddy bears and flowers were left in Pandy Park after Logan's body was found When asked if he thought children should be held responsible for crimes such as murder, he replied: ""Yes, I think, nowadays, more and more... ""Children now are much more aware, they are so aware of their rights... a lot of children are so streetwise they purposely hide behind the veil of anonymity, because they know they're not going to be named."" He believes it is correct to try children in court: ""There's no way that these defendants can go free and they've got to be punished, but they've got to be educated as well if that's possible,"" he said. Mr Bateman said had Venables and Thompson been a few months younger they would not have faced prosecution, but would most likely have been taken into care and placed in a secure children's home for a significant period until they were assessed as safe to release back into the community. ""The same end would have happened without going through the criminal justice process,"" he said. ""The negative connotations of criminal conviction and media identification could be avoided."" Dr Tim Bateman would like to see a shift in the way Wales and England deal with children who commit murder ""We have a rather odd situation in England and Wales in relation to children who commit murder,"" said Dr Bateman. ""For instance, if you think about smoking - an adult can choose whether or not they wish to smoke... if they wish to damage their health [but] we don't take that view in relation to children who can't buy tobacco until the age of 18 because we don't regard them as fully responsible - they can't be trusted to take full account of the long term implications. ""To a large degree, when children break the law those assumptions go out of the window and suddenly we attribute full responsibility to children."" Dr Bateman said he wanted to see ""a complete shift in the way that we deal with children who commit murder"", including releasing them ""when there is still plenty of opportunity for them to make the transition to adulthood in a relatively normalised environment"". He said: ""We're one of the only countries in Europe that has an automatic life sentence for children who commit murder."" Detention during Her Majesty's Pleasure,externalis a mandatory life sentence imposed when a child or young person is convicted or pleads guilty to murder. How CCTV helped police catch Logan's murderers WCalls for tribute to murdered boy Logan Mwangi WDad says world is colder and darker without son The starting point for determining the minimum sentence where the offender is under 18 is 12 years and 15 years for those over 18. ""I would like to see a much shorter maximum sentence available for children, as happens in many other parts of the world,"" he said. But Mr Lee has faith in the current system: ""[We should] trust the parole board that they will not release that child until they are fit for return to society,"" he said. ""There could be serious consequences if they're released too early and they reoffend."" A Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson said: ""While it is for independent judges to decide sentences, we have changed the law for children who commit murder so that judges have a range of starting points that account for the child's age and the severity of the murder."" About 75% of children who receive a custodial sentence go to young offenders institutions which are ""very, very similar to adult prisons"", Dr Bateman said. A smaller number go to privately managed secure training centres and others go to secure children's homes. Logan's mother Angharad Williamson and stepfather John Cole were found guilty of his murder in April There are 14 individually managed secure children's homes throughout Wales and England, which restrict children's liberty to ensure their safety while providing care, education and support. Local authorities can place children there if they are deemed to be a significant risk to themselves or others and the Youth Custody Service can place children who have been remanded to custody or are serving a custodial sentence. L'Jurors should be offered support' LWho are Angharad Williamson and John Cole? Dr Bateman also wants an end to young offenders institutions, and all children who receive a custodial sentence held in childcare establishments. ""There are higher levels of staffing, support is much more thorough, there are opportunities for therapeutic interventions, capacity to work with the child towards their release, engage them in education and training and massively increase prospects for them in later life,"" he said. Mr Lee said that whatever type of facility a child was held in they must have a ""proper education, proper upbringing, so that eventually the chances of him being returned to society in a fit state is enhanced"". An MoJ spokesperson said: ""We are committed to trialling secure schools as a new model of youth custody that embeds education and health at its heart to reduce reoffending."" Solicitor Lawrence Lee represented Jon Venables at the trial for James Bulger's murder in 1993 In the Logan Mwangi murder trial, Judge Mrs Justice Jefford granted anonymity to the 14-year-old defendant throughsection 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act,external. However, these restrictions were challenged by the media at sentencing, and the judge lifted the order, meaning on Thursdayhe could be identified for the first time as Mulligan. At the trial of Venables and Thompson, the judge lifted reporting restrictions, saying: ""The public interest overrode the interest of the defendants."" In 2001, they were granted new identities and lifelong anonymity when they were released on licence. A court order banned anyone from revealing their new identities. In 2015, a judgelifted reporting restrictionson the naming a 15-year-old boy who murdered teacher Anne Maguire in Leeds. Mr Justice Coulson said identifying Will Cornick was in the public interest and would have ""a clear deterrent effect"". Dr Bateman said: ""The fact that we can identify children is something which is out of step internationally."" Logan was found dead in the River Ogmore in Sarn, Bridgend county, last July He said naming could encourage vigilante behaviour, not just against the child defendant but also their siblings and the wider community. He said it could also be detrimental to the defendant's rehabilitation: ""If they wake up and see their picture on the TV, on the front page of the newspaper as a child murderer that will have a significant impact on their development, the way that they see themselves, in my view, is likely to  increase the risk that they will continue to be a danger to others."" He said it would also have a negative impact on them after being released: ""Employers will be much less likely to offer opportunities to children who have been all over the front pages of the newspapers, colleges will be much less likely to offer places to such children."" Mr Lee said he saw both sides of the issue: ""I would have grave misgivings about naming but on the other hand, I'd have grave misgivings about remaining anonymous... ""I could understand a judge saying 'right, well let's name them and if we can save a teacher's life, if you can save any victim's life, it's worth it'. ""On the other hand, they will be thinking 'well if I do name, he is it going to be a target for revenge'."" This video can not be played How Logan Mwangi's killers tried to fool police When asked if Mulligan could ever have a normal life, Dr Bateman said it would be difficult. ""It will be difficult to come of age, to make the transition to adulthood in a custodial institution and not spend your time, as most adolescence do, learning how to deal with the wider world, learning how to be an adult."" Mr Lee is more optimistic: ""It depends on whether or not they're branded evil,"" he said. He said excursions outside prison would be essential towards the end of his sentence: ""If he is kept in custody for 10 years, unless he has the opportunity of dipping his toe into real everyday life, I think his chances of being normal again are very slim.""

LiveLiveRevellers fill London for biggest Pride ever28 minutes ago,"More than a million people packed the capital for Pride's 50th anniversary, the London Mayor's office says It is the first time the event has been held since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic More than 600 LGBTQ+ community groups were expected to be at the march The parade started just after midday from Hyde Park Corner and runs until 18:00, finishing at Whitehall Palace The event, being called the ""most inclusive event in history"", includes performances from Ava Max, Emeli Sande and Samantha Mumba Edited by Dulcie Lee, Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh We're now closing our live coverage of the Pride parade in London. Thanks for joining us. The page was edited by Chris Giles and Dulcie Lee. The writers were Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh.  After a two-year hiatus, Pride in London is back - and it was indeed bigger than ever. While partying continues, we're going to wrap up our live coverage here for today. Before we go, here's a recap of the day: Thanks for joining us. As we near the end of this year's Pride parade - and the beginning of the evening's celebrations - let's take a look at how thousands in London have marked the day: This video can not be played ITV presenters Phillip Schofield, Alison Hammond, Lorraine Kelly and Linda Robson were among the famous faces spotted at today's Pride parade in London. Stylist and fashion expert Gok Wan was also seen celebrating with Dame Kelly Holmes, whorecently came out publicly as gay. Gok Wan and Dame Kelly Holmes were captured mid-laughter during the parade Alison Hammond and Phillip Schofield were pictured smiling in ITV T-shirts Meanwhile, Linda Robson had been busy collecting Pride badges Lorraine Kelly looked delighted as she waved to onlookers It's official â this year's Pride parade was the biggest ever in the capital, the London Mayor's office says. Sadiq Khan's office says more than one million revellers joined the event, with rainbow colours, glitter and sequins galore. Floats lined Park Lane ahead of the main march through London, which was led by Gay Liberation Front activists holding placards saying ""I was there in 1972"". (From left to right) Octavia, Ewan, Esther, Eloisa We've been talking to four friends attending their first Pride in London together. Octavia says it's nice for all her friends ""to be together"" and to ""celebrate Pride after the pandemic"". Ewan adds all four are part of the LGBTQ+ community and it's really good to see ""integration"" in every part of life. ""I'm having a great day,"" Esther chips in. Eloisa is also happy with ""how much love there is"" and says ""it's like we're fighting this together"". Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent In 2022 Pride is most definitely a party. People dancing in the street, throwing sweets, blowing whistles and having a great time. Thereâs no doubt that itâs worlds away from what it was when it started with a few hundred people risking arrest for kissing each other in the street. These days hundreds of organisations march and the number of corporate companies on board make it very shiny and commercial. I even saw a tractor decked out in the rainbow flag!  The colours are representative of bringing everyone together under one umbrella. But some within the community donât feel it represents them, while others think it should be more ofa protest like it was in 1972. Whatever people think of it though, the capitalâs streets were awash with colour today and after a month of Pride celebrations in June, theyâll continue around the country for the next several weeks. Bex and Jameson from Essex and Leytonstone Jameson from Leytonstone says he attended his first gay pride 46 years ago and has been to around 40 events since then. In the past there was ""so much negativity and abuse"", he says. Jameson tells the BBC that 46 years ago there weren't many people, the march was lined by police officers and people who turned up faced verbal abuse and projectiles. ""By the time we'd got down to Piccadilly, I would say a third of us had got arrested,"" he says. Today, however, Jameson is having a ""wonderful"" time at the parade. Stuart Feather (left), in drag, is bundled into a police car during a gay-rights protest, in 1971 Itâs 1972 â the swinging â60s are over, the minersâ strike has turned off the lights and Donny Osmond is topping the charts with Puppy Love. It will be another 20 years before same-sex attraction is declassified as a mental illness and, despite homosexual acts being decriminalised, in 1967, the age of consent remains five years older than for heterosexual couples. But, in a basement room at the London School of Economics, a revolution is brewing. BBC News has brought together some of those original members who attended the first UK Pride march, in 1972, and some LGBT people from the younger generation - to reflect on how much has changed and how much is still to be done. Read more from original members here. Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes,who recently came out publicly as gay, has shared her excitement at being part of the celebrations for Pride in London. She posted 'let's do this' on social media alongside the hashtag #beingme and a picture of herself wearing a multi-coloured outfit. Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history, and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier, to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

It's not just London that is marking Pride today. People in Shetland have been enjoying their first Pride festival - it's the most northerly celebration of its kind in the UK. People from across the community joined thecolourful event in Lerwick. The event has drawn interest from across the world and visiting drag queens travelled by ferry from Aberdeen to be there. Meanwhile Clacton, in Essex, is also hostingits first Pride eventcoinciding with the 50th anniversary of the movement globally. The free event has been planned since September, with organiser Cheryl Piper admitting she never thought Pride would reach the town. ""It's about bringing people together; there should be no stigma,"" she says. (From left to right) Siobhan, Laura and Vanessa Weâve been speaking to revellers celebrating Londonâs first Pride parade for three years. âEveryone is very happy and itâs a good day,â Laura says, adding that sheâs âglad to be backâ. Siobhan describes Pride this year as âamazingâ and âsuch a good vibeâ. Meanwhile it's Vanessaâs first time at the event in the capital. She says she's ""loving it, it's wicked."" She adds it's a âreally importantâ event for the LGBT community to show âeveryone is equal.â Thousands of people are in central London to enjoy this year's Pride parade. Here's some of the images which have caught our eye. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London For the first time since 2019, Londoners and LGBT allies from around the country have been able to turn out for the Pride parade in the capital. Iâm in the middle of the parade at the moment, and there are countless people in front of me and behind me - all marching for what they believe in. Plenty of people are watching from the side as well. Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly and all the way down to Trafalgar Square is lined with hundreds and maybe even thousands of people, all here to support the LGBTQ+ community. Itâs a warm, beautiful, sunny day in London, and people have certainly taken advantage of that. Police have been ""sensitive"" to concerns from the LGBTQ+ community about uniformed officers taking part in this year's Pride parade, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Organisers of Pride in London have said there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ and have asked police officers wearing uniforms not to join. In previous years officers from the Metropolitan Police have taken part in the parade in their work clothing. Khan said ""clearly"" the LGBTQ+ community had concerns around policing, referencing the investigation into the murders of four gay men by serial killer Stephen Port. He added: ""I think the police have been sensitive to the issues raised by the community and there will be uniformed officers in and around Pride to make sure we're all safe, to make sure this parade is a success. ""But, clearly, those taking part in the parade from the police service won't be wearing the uniforms."" In June it was announcedthe police watchdog would reinvestigatethe Metropolitan Police's initial handling of the men murdered by Port. Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent If anyone was in any doubt - Pride is loud and proud and back in 2022. The streets of London are awash with rainbow colours celebrating the LGBT+ community. It set off a little later than planned, but the Gay Liberation Front - who organised the first protest in 1972 of several hundred people - led the way again setting off on a bus from underneath the inflatable archway at Hyde Park Corner. An enormous rainbow flag billows out behind them along with thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London Kevin from Uganda said he was ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London Kevin from Uganda says he's ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London and ""support the LGBT community"". ""I'm proud to be a gay man,"" he says, adding that he is ""really happy"" to be celebrating Pride after two years of cancellations because of the pandemic. Helene from Surbiton, south-west London, said she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade Helene from Surbiton, in south-west London, told the BBC she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade. She says sexual orientation ""is nobody's business but your own"". Fifty years ago about 2,000 people took part in London's first official Lesbian and Gay Pride event, as part of a protest against how the police treated that community. The marcheshave continued to this day, but now the hundreds of thousands of people who take to the streets are joined by celebrities, corporate sponsors and politicians. The first Lesbian and Gay Pride marches through central London Police officers weren't allowed to march in uniform at Pride until 2003 Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then London mayor, at the 2008 Pride march Pride in London 2016 was a poignant affair as people remembered those who died in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida a few days before Pride in London has evolved over the years, with some questioning its priorities. However, the message of fairness, equality and inclusivity has been a constant. Read more here Peter Tatchell, pictured wearing a green shirt, took part in an event in central London on Friday marking the 50th anniversary of Pride Police officers wearing uniforms have been asked not to join todayâs annual London Pride march. Organisers say there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ. If follows accusations by campaigners of âvery serious evidence of police homophobia"" within the Met Police, especially over its handling of four murders of gay men by Stephen Port.

Meanwhile Clacton, in Essex, is also hostingits first Pride eventcoinciding with the 50th anniversary of the movement globally. The free event has been planned since September, with organiser Cheryl Piper admitting she never thought Pride would reach the town. ""It's about bringing people together; there should be no stigma,"" she says. (From left to right) Siobhan, Laura and Vanessa Weâve been speaking to revellers celebrating Londonâs first Pride parade for three years. âEveryone is very happy and itâs a good day,â Laura says, adding that sheâs âglad to be backâ. Siobhan describes Pride this year as âamazingâ and âsuch a good vibeâ. Meanwhile it's Vanessaâs first time at the event in the capital. She says she's ""loving it, it's wicked."" She adds it's a âreally importantâ event for the LGBT community to show âeveryone is equal.â Thousands of people are in central London to enjoy this year's Pride parade. Here's some of the images which have caught our eye. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London For the first time since 2019, Londoners and LGBT allies from around the country have been able to turn out for the Pride parade in the capital. Iâm in the middle of the parade at the moment, and there are countless people in front of me and behind me - all marching for what they believe in. Plenty of people are watching from the side as well. Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly and all the way down to Trafalgar Square is lined with hundreds and maybe even thousands of people, all here to support the LGBTQ+ community. Itâs a warm, beautiful, sunny day in London, and people have certainly taken advantage of that. Police have been ""sensitive"" to concerns from the LGBTQ+ community about uniformed officers taking part in this year's Pride parade, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Organisers of Pride in London have said there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ and have asked police officers wearing uniforms not to join. In previous years officers from the Metropolitan Police have taken part in the parade in their work clothing. Khan said ""clearly"" the LGBTQ+ community had concerns around policing, referencing the investigation into the murders of four gay men by serial killer Stephen Port. He added: ""I think the police have been sensitive to the issues raised by the community and there will be uniformed officers in and around Pride to make sure we're all safe, to make sure this parade is a success. ""But, clearly, those taking part in the parade from the police service won't be wearing the uniforms."" In June it was announcedthe police watchdog would reinvestigatethe Metropolitan Police's initial handling of the men murdered by Port. Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent If anyone was in any doubt - Pride is loud and proud and back in 2022. The streets of London are awash with rainbow colours celebrating the LGBT+ community. It set off a little later than planned, but the Gay Liberation Front - who organised the first protest in 1972 of several hundred people - led the way again setting off on a bus from underneath the inflatable archway at Hyde Park Corner. An enormous rainbow flag billows out behind them along with thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London Kevin from Uganda said he was ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London Kevin from Uganda says he's ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London and ""support the LGBT community"". ""I'm proud to be a gay man,"" he says, adding that he is ""really happy"" to be celebrating Pride after two years of cancellations because of the pandemic. Helene from Surbiton, south-west London, said she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade Helene from Surbiton, in south-west London, told the BBC she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade. She says sexual orientation ""is nobody's business but your own"". Fifty years ago about 2,000 people took part in London's first official Lesbian and Gay Pride event, as part of a protest against how the police treated that community. The marcheshave continued to this day, but now the hundreds of thousands of people who take to the streets are joined by celebrities, corporate sponsors and politicians. The first Lesbian and Gay Pride marches through central London Police officers weren't allowed to march in uniform at Pride until 2003 Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then London mayor, at the 2008 Pride march Pride in London 2016 was a poignant affair as people remembered those who died in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida a few days before Pride in London has evolved over the years, with some questioning its priorities. However, the message of fairness, equality and inclusivity has been a constant.

Flight cancellations aim to ease summer chaos,"Passengers faced delays and cancellations during Easter and the May bank holidays Airlines are expected to announce a series of cancellations to UK summer flights this week aimed at minimising disruption in the peak holiday season. A government ""amnesty"" to the rules on airport slots is in place until Friday, allowing airlines to change schedules without facing a potential penalty. Ministers told carriers to review their plans after chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff. British Airways said the move would help provide ""certainty"" to customers. The UK's biggest airline, whose services from Heathrow Airport are likely to bear the brunt of this week's cancellations, said the measures would make it ""easier to consolidate some of our quieter daily flights to multi-frequency destinations well in advance, and to protect more of our holiday flights"". Airport slots provide airlines with the authorisation to take off or land at a specified time on a specified day. In usual circumstances, the carriers risk losing the slots - and taking a hit to their business - if they cancel flights. Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Airlines told to cancel flights to stop travel chaos The Department for Transport (DfT) amnesty will give airlines a short window to hand back the slots in the summer season they are not confident they will be able to operate. A DfT spokesperson said: ""This will help passengers find alternative arrangements ahead of time, rather than face the kind of last-minute cancellations seen over the Easter and half-term holidays."" That earlier disruption prompted the government and the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to write to airlines telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable... based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available"". Heathrow said the slot amnesty would ""enable airlines to make early choices to consolidate their schedules, boosting the resilience of summer operations and giving passengers the confidence they deserve ahead of their journeys"". It added: ""We encourage airlines to take this opportunity to reconsider their summer schedules without penalty and inform passengers as early as possible of any changes."" Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said it followed other measures taken by the sector. ""We will continue to work with ministers and the whole aviation ecosystem to ensure the summer peak runs as smoothly as possible for our passengers,"" he said. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said the move would also allow rival airlines to step in and fly the cancelled routes. He said: ""Carriers must surrender their slots to other airlines if they are unable to fulfil them. This will help reduce cancellations and end the unsustainable practice of airlines flying near-empty planes to retain slots."" Thousands of aviation jobs were lost during the Covid pandemic and many businesses have struggled to recruit enough new staff in time to deal with resurgent demand for travel following the easing of rules. Gatwick said it would be reducing the number of flightsduring summer because of staff shortages even before the airport slots amnesty was first set out by the government on 21 June, Heathrow to date had not announced similar plans although last weekit ordered 30 flights to be cancelled, saying it was expecting more passenger numbers than it could cope with. It comes asManchester Airport warnedit would not be able to return to its pre-pandemic standards until the autumn. Aviation industry consultant Paul Charles predicted thousands of flight cancellations would be announced this week, meaning less last-minute disruption over the summer. But he told BBC News passengers were facing a ""summer of stress"". Staffing levels remained 20-30% lower than they should be, he said, with a rise in Covid cases seeing airline and ground workers calling in sick in recent weeks. Meanwhile, passengers face the prospect of disruption from strikes involving airline staff over summer. Hundreds ofBritish Airways workers at Heathrow Airport- mostly check-in staff - have voted to go on strike in July over pay, andunions are currently consulting engineers and call centre staffat Gatwick, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle on taking action. Unions have also called forEasyJet cabin crew based in Spain to strike for nine daysthis month as part of a dispute over pay.

Heavy fighting in Ukraine-held city of LysychanskUkrainian forces say they are being pounded by Russian heavy artillery as they battle to keep the city.Europe,"The fighting in Lysychansk sent plumes of smoke rising to the sky Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk is at the centre of competing claims, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces saying they are in control. Ukraine says its forces are enduring intense Russian shelling there but insists the city has not been seized. However, Russian-backed separatists say they have successfully entered the city and reached its centre. Russian media showed videos of separatist or Russian forces apparently parading through the streets. Russian sources have also tweeted video of the Soviet flag allegedly being placed on the city's ruined administrative centre, but that has not been verified. It is the last Ukrainian-held city in Luhansk, part of the industrial Donbas region. Russia captured the nearby city of Severodonetsk last month. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been no let-up in the assault on Lysychansk, with Russian forces approaching the besieged city from all sides. Rodion Miroshnik, ambassador to Russia of the pro-Moscow breakaway Luhansk People's Republic, told Russian television that Lysychansk had been ""brought under control"" but was ""not yet liberated"". Images of Chechen Russian soldiers inside the city were shared by defence blogger Rob Lee. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Since Russia invaded on 24 February, claiming it wanted to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine after it moved closer to Nato,thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed or wounded, whileat least 12 million people have fled their homes. Western states have responded by arming Ukraine and placing unprecedented sanctions on Russia, a nuclear superpower and global energy supplier. Can we say how many people have died in Ukraine? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Why Russia couldn't hold Snake Island In another development, railway tracks and electricity lines in the northern city of Kharkiv were damaged in a series of attacks. No casualties were reported. The southern city of Mykolaiv - on a key route to the port city of Odesa - was shaken by several explosions. The Russian defence ministry said its air force had destroyed five Ukrainian command posts and several ammunition dumps, but that claim has not been independently verified. The blasts came a day after the Russians were accused of killing more than 20 people in a missile strike on a block of flats near Odesa. Later on Saturday, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said his country's air defences had shot down Ukrainian missiles, though he did not specify where. He is a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin and allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine from Belarus in February. ""They are provoking us...  Three days ago, maybe a bit more, an attempt to strike military facilities on Belarusian territory was made from the territory of Ukraine,"" he said. ""But, thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles."" He added that ""we are not seeking to fight in Ukraine"". In its latest intelligence update, the UK Defence Ministry accuses Russia of using Soviet-era anti-ship missiles ""in a secondary land attack role"" - not what they were designed for. The Kh-22 and Kh-32 missiles were ""likely"" the ones that killed many civilians in Kremenchuk and Odesa, the ministry says. Slovyansk, a major Donbas city held by Ukrainian forces, has also been shelled again by the Russians. Its mayor Vadym Lyakh said banned Russian cluster munitions killed four people there - another claim the BBC was unable to verify.

Thanks for joining us. The page was edited by Chris Giles and Dulcie Lee. The writers were Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh.  After a two-year hiatus, Pride in London is back - and it was indeed bigger than ever. While partying continues, we're going to wrap up our live coverage here for today. Before we go, here's a recap of the day: Thanks for joining us. As we near the end of this year's Pride parade - and the beginning of the evening's celebrations - let's take a look at how thousands in London have marked the day: This video can not be played ITV presenters Phillip Schofield, Alison Hammond, Lorraine Kelly and Linda Robson were among the famous faces spotted at today's Pride parade in London. Stylist and fashion expert Gok Wan was also seen celebrating with Dame Kelly Holmes, whorecently came out publicly as gay. Gok Wan and Dame Kelly Holmes were captured mid-laughter during the parade Alison Hammond and Phillip Schofield were pictured smiling in ITV T-shirts Meanwhile, Linda Robson had been busy collecting Pride badges Lorraine Kelly looked delighted as she waved to onlookers It's official â this year's Pride parade was the biggest ever in the capital, the London Mayor's office says. Sadiq Khan's office says more than one million revellers joined the event, with rainbow colours, glitter and sequins galore. Floats lined Park Lane ahead of the main march through London, which was led by Gay Liberation Front activists holding placards saying ""I was there in 1972"". (From left to right) Octavia, Ewan, Esther, Eloisa We've been talking to four friends attending their first Pride in London together. Octavia says it's nice for all her friends ""to be together"" and to ""celebrate Pride after the pandemic"". Ewan adds all four are part of the LGBTQ+ community and it's really good to see ""integration"" in every part of life. ""I'm having a great day,"" Esther chips in. Eloisa is also happy with ""how much love there is"" and says ""it's like we're fighting this together"". Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent In 2022 Pride is most definitely a party. People dancing in the street, throwing sweets, blowing whistles and having a great time. Thereâs no doubt that itâs worlds away from what it was when it started with a few hundred people risking arrest for kissing each other in the street. These days hundreds of organisations march and the number of corporate companies on board make it very shiny and commercial. I even saw a tractor decked out in the rainbow flag!  The colours are representative of bringing everyone together under one umbrella. But some within the community donât feel it represents them, while others think it should be more ofa protest like it was in 1972. Whatever people think of it though, the capitalâs streets were awash with colour today and after a month of Pride celebrations in June, theyâll continue around the country for the next several weeks. Bex and Jameson from Essex and Leytonstone Jameson from Leytonstone says he attended his first gay pride 46 years ago and has been to around 40 events since then. In the past there was ""so much negativity and abuse"", he says. Jameson tells the BBC that 46 years ago there weren't many people, the march was lined by police officers and people who turned up faced verbal abuse and projectiles. ""By the time we'd got down to Piccadilly, I would say a third of us had got arrested,"" he says. Today, however, Jameson is having a ""wonderful"" time at the parade. Stuart Feather (left), in drag, is bundled into a police car during a gay-rights protest, in 1971 Itâs 1972 â the swinging â60s are over, the minersâ strike has turned off the lights and Donny Osmond is topping the charts with Puppy Love. It will be another 20 years before same-sex attraction is declassified as a mental illness and, despite homosexual acts being decriminalised, in 1967, the age of consent remains five years older than for heterosexual couples. But, in a basement room at the London School of Economics, a revolution is brewing. BBC News has brought together some of those original members who attended the first UK Pride march, in 1972, and some LGBT people from the younger generation - to reflect on how much has changed and how much is still to be done. Read more from original members here. Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes,who recently came out publicly as gay, has shared her excitement at being part of the celebrations for Pride in London. She posted 'let's do this' on social media alongside the hashtag #beingme and a picture of herself wearing a multi-coloured outfit. Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history, and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier, to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent If anyone was in any doubt - Pride is loud and proud and back in 2022. The streets of London are awash with rainbow colours celebrating the LGBT+ community. It set off a little later than planned, but the Gay Liberation Front - who organised the first protest in 1972 of several hundred people - led the way again setting off on a bus from underneath the inflatable archway at Hyde Park Corner. An enormous rainbow flag billows out behind them along with thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago.

Thanks for joining us. The page was edited by Chris Giles and Dulcie Lee. The writers were Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh.  After a two-year hiatus, Pride in London is back - and it was indeed bigger than ever. While partying continues, we're going to wrap up our live coverage here for today. Before we go, here's a recap of the day: Thanks for joining us. As we near the end of this year's Pride parade - and the beginning of the evening's celebrations - let's take a look at how thousands in London have marked the day: This video can not be played ITV presenters Phillip Schofield, Alison Hammond, Lorraine Kelly and Linda Robson were among the famous faces spotted at today's Pride parade in London. Stylist and fashion expert Gok Wan was also seen celebrating with Dame Kelly Holmes, whorecently came out publicly as gay. Gok Wan and Dame Kelly Holmes were captured mid-laughter during the parade Alison Hammond and Phillip Schofield were pictured smiling in ITV T-shirts Meanwhile, Linda Robson had been busy collecting Pride badges Lorraine Kelly looked delighted as she waved to onlookers It's official â this year's Pride parade was the biggest ever in the capital, the London Mayor's office says. Sadiq Khan's office says more than one million revellers joined the event, with rainbow colours, glitter and sequins galore. Floats lined Park Lane ahead of the main march through London, which was led by Gay Liberation Front activists holding placards saying ""I was there in 1972"". (From left to right) Octavia, Ewan, Esther, Eloisa We've been talking to four friends attending their first Pride in London together. Octavia says it's nice for all her friends ""to be together"" and to ""celebrate Pride after the pandemic"". Ewan adds all four are part of the LGBTQ+ community and it's really good to see ""integration"" in every part of life. ""I'm having a great day,"" Esther chips in. Eloisa is also happy with ""how much love there is"" and says ""it's like we're fighting this together"". Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent In 2022 Pride is most definitely a party. People dancing in the street, throwing sweets, blowing whistles and having a great time. Thereâs no doubt that itâs worlds away from what it was when it started with a few hundred people risking arrest for kissing each other in the street. These days hundreds of organisations march and the number of corporate companies on board make it very shiny and commercial. I even saw a tractor decked out in the rainbow flag!  The colours are representative of bringing everyone together under one umbrella. But some within the community donât feel it represents them, while others think it should be more ofa protest like it was in 1972. Whatever people think of it though, the capitalâs streets were awash with colour today and after a month of Pride celebrations in June, theyâll continue around the country for the next several weeks. Bex and Jameson from Essex and Leytonstone Jameson from Leytonstone says he attended his first gay pride 46 years ago and has been to around 40 events since then. In the past there was ""so much negativity and abuse"", he says. Jameson tells the BBC that 46 years ago there weren't many people, the march was lined by police officers and people who turned up faced verbal abuse and projectiles. ""By the time we'd got down to Piccadilly, I would say a third of us had got arrested,"" he says. Today, however, Jameson is having a ""wonderful"" time at the parade. Stuart Feather (left), in drag, is bundled into a police car during a gay-rights protest, in 1971 Itâs 1972 â the swinging â60s are over, the minersâ strike has turned off the lights and Donny Osmond is topping the charts with Puppy Love. It will be another 20 years before same-sex attraction is declassified as a mental illness and, despite homosexual acts being decriminalised, in 1967, the age of consent remains five years older than for heterosexual couples. But, in a basement room at the London School of Economics, a revolution is brewing. BBC News has brought together some of those original members who attended the first UK Pride march, in 1972, and some LGBT people from the younger generation - to reflect on how much has changed and how much is still to be done. Read more from original members here. Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes,who recently came out publicly as gay, has shared her excitement at being part of the celebrations for Pride in London. She posted 'let's do this' on social media alongside the hashtag #beingme and a picture of herself wearing a multi-coloured outfit. Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history, and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier, to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

It's not just London that is marking Pride today. People in Shetland have been enjoying their first Pride festival - it's the most northerly celebration of its kind in the UK. People from across the community joined thecolourful event in Lerwick. The event has drawn interest from across the world and visiting drag queens travelled by ferry from Aberdeen to be there. Meanwhile Clacton, in Essex, is also hostingits first Pride eventcoinciding with the 50th anniversary of the movement globally. The free event has been planned since September, with organiser Cheryl Piper admitting she never thought Pride would reach the town. ""It's about bringing people together; there should be no stigma,"" she says. (From left to right) Siobhan, Laura and Vanessa Weâve been speaking to revellers celebrating Londonâs first Pride parade for three years. âEveryone is very happy and itâs a good day,â Laura says, adding that sheâs âglad to be backâ. Siobhan describes Pride this year as âamazingâ and âsuch a good vibeâ. Meanwhile it's Vanessaâs first time at the event in the capital. She says she's ""loving it, it's wicked."" She adds it's a âreally importantâ event for the LGBT community to show âeveryone is equal.â Thousands of people are in central London to enjoy this year's Pride parade. Here's some of the images which have caught our eye. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London For the first time since 2019, Londoners and LGBT allies from around the country have been able to turn out for the Pride parade in the capital. Iâm in the middle of the parade at the moment, and there are countless people in front of me and behind me - all marching for what they believe in. Plenty of people are watching from the side as well. Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly and all the way down to Trafalgar Square is lined with hundreds and maybe even thousands of people, all here to support the LGBTQ+ community. Itâs a warm, beautiful, sunny day in London, and people have certainly taken advantage of that. Police have been ""sensitive"" to concerns from the LGBTQ+ community about uniformed officers taking part in this year's Pride parade, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Organisers of Pride in London have said there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ and have asked police officers wearing uniforms not to join. In previous years officers from the Metropolitan Police have taken part in the parade in their work clothing. Khan said ""clearly"" the LGBTQ+ community had concerns around policing, referencing the investigation into the murders of four gay men by serial killer Stephen Port. He added: ""I think the police have been sensitive to the issues raised by the community and there will be uniformed officers in and around Pride to make sure we're all safe, to make sure this parade is a success. ""But, clearly, those taking part in the parade from the police service won't be wearing the uniforms."" In June it was announcedthe police watchdog would reinvestigatethe Metropolitan Police's initial handling of the men murdered by Port. Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent If anyone was in any doubt - Pride is loud and proud and back in 2022. The streets of London are awash with rainbow colours celebrating the LGBT+ community. It set off a little later than planned, but the Gay Liberation Front - who organised the first protest in 1972 of several hundred people - led the way again setting off on a bus from underneath the inflatable archway at Hyde Park Corner. An enormous rainbow flag billows out behind them along with thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London Kevin from Uganda said he was ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London Kevin from Uganda says he's ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London and ""support the LGBT community"". ""I'm proud to be a gay man,"" he says, adding that he is ""really happy"" to be celebrating Pride after two years of cancellations because of the pandemic. Helene from Surbiton, south-west London, said she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade Helene from Surbiton, in south-west London, told the BBC she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade. She says sexual orientation ""is nobody's business but your own"". Fifty years ago about 2,000 people took part in London's first official Lesbian and Gay Pride event, as part of a protest against how the police treated that community. The marcheshave continued to this day, but now the hundreds of thousands of people who take to the streets are joined by celebrities, corporate sponsors and politicians. The first Lesbian and Gay Pride marches through central London Police officers weren't allowed to march in uniform at Pride until 2003 Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then London mayor, at the 2008 Pride march Pride in London 2016 was a poignant affair as people remembered those who died in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida a few days before Pride in London has evolved over the years, with some questioning its priorities. However, the message of fairness, equality and inclusivity has been a constant.

LiveLiveRevellers fill London for 50th anniversary of Pride6 minutes ago,"More than a million people packed the capital for Pride's 50th anniversary, the London Mayor's office says It is the first time the event has been held since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic More than 600 LGBTQ+ community groups were expected to be at the march The parade started just after midday from Hyde Park Corner and runs until 18:00, finishing at Whitehall Palace The event, being called the ""most inclusive event in history"", includes performances from Ava Max, Emeli Sande and Samantha Mumba Edited by Dulcie Lee, Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh We're now closing our live coverage of the Pride parade in London. Thanks for joining us. The page was edited by Chris Giles and Dulcie Lee. The writers were Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh.  After a two-year hiatus, Pride in London is back - and it was indeed bigger than ever. While partying continues, we're going to wrap up our live coverage here for today. Before we go, here's a recap of the day: Thanks for joining us. As we near the end of this year's Pride parade - and the beginning of the evening's celebrations - let's take a look at how thousands in London have marked the day: This video can not be played ITV presenters Phillip Schofield, Alison Hammond, Lorraine Kelly and Linda Robson were among the famous faces spotted at today's Pride parade in London. Stylist and fashion expert Gok Wan was also seen celebrating with Dame Kelly Holmes, whorecently came out publicly as gay. Gok Wan and Dame Kelly Holmes were captured mid-laughter during the parade Alison Hammond and Phillip Schofield were pictured smiling in ITV T-shirts Meanwhile, Linda Robson had been busy collecting Pride badges Lorraine Kelly looked delighted as she waved to onlookers It's official â this year's Pride parade was the biggest ever in the capital, the London Mayor's office says. Sadiq Khan's office says more than one million revellers joined the event, with rainbow colours, glitter and sequins galore. Floats lined Park Lane ahead of the main march through London, which was led by Gay Liberation Front activists holding placards saying ""I was there in 1972"". (From left to right) Octavia, Ewan, Esther, Eloisa We've been talking to four friends attending their first Pride in London together. Octavia says it's nice for all her friends ""to be together"" and to ""celebrate Pride after the pandemic"". Ewan adds all four are part of the LGBTQ+ community and it's really good to see ""integration"" in every part of life. ""I'm having a great day,"" Esther chips in. Eloisa is also happy with ""how much love there is"" and says ""it's like we're fighting this together"". Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent In 2022 Pride is most definitely a party. People dancing in the street, throwing sweets, blowing whistles and having a great time. Thereâs no doubt that itâs worlds away from what it was when it started with a few hundred people risking arrest for kissing each other in the street. These days hundreds of organisations march and the number of corporate companies on board make it very shiny and commercial. I even saw a tractor decked out in the rainbow flag!  The colours are representative of bringing everyone together under one umbrella. But some within the community donât feel it represents them, while others think it should be more ofa protest like it was in 1972. Whatever people think of it though, the capitalâs streets were awash with colour today and after a month of Pride celebrations in June, theyâll continue around the country for the next several weeks. Bex and Jameson from Essex and Leytonstone Jameson from Leytonstone says he attended his first gay pride 46 years ago and has been to around 40 events since then. In the past there was ""so much negativity and abuse"", he says. Jameson tells the BBC that 46 years ago there weren't many people, the march was lined by police officers and people who turned up faced verbal abuse and projectiles. ""By the time we'd got down to Piccadilly, I would say a third of us had got arrested,"" he says. Today, however, Jameson is having a ""wonderful"" time at the parade. Stuart Feather (left), in drag, is bundled into a police car during a gay-rights protest, in 1971 Itâs 1972 â the swinging â60s are over, the minersâ strike has turned off the lights and Donny Osmond is topping the charts with Puppy Love. It will be another 20 years before same-sex attraction is declassified as a mental illness and, despite homosexual acts being decriminalised, in 1967, the age of consent remains five years older than for heterosexual couples. But, in a basement room at the London School of Economics, a revolution is brewing. BBC News has brought together some of those original members who attended the first UK Pride march, in 1972, and some LGBT people from the younger generation - to reflect on how much has changed and how much is still to be done. Read more from original members here. Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes,who recently came out publicly as gay, has shared her excitement at being part of the celebrations for Pride in London. She posted 'let's do this' on social media alongside the hashtag #beingme and a picture of herself wearing a multi-coloured outfit. Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history, and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier, to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

It's not just London that is marking Pride today. People in Shetland have been enjoying their first Pride festival - it's the most northerly celebration of its kind in the UK. People from across the community joined thecolourful event in Lerwick. The event has drawn interest from across the world and visiting drag queens travelled by ferry from Aberdeen to be there. Meanwhile Clacton, in Essex, is also hostingits first Pride eventcoinciding with the 50th anniversary of the movement globally. The free event has been planned since September, with organiser Cheryl Piper admitting she never thought Pride would reach the town. ""It's about bringing people together; there should be no stigma,"" she says. (From left to right) Siobhan, Laura and Vanessa Weâve been speaking to revellers celebrating Londonâs first Pride parade for three years. âEveryone is very happy and itâs a good day,â Laura says, adding that sheâs âglad to be backâ. Siobhan describes Pride this year as âamazingâ and âsuch a good vibeâ. Meanwhile it's Vanessaâs first time at the event in the capital. She says she's ""loving it, it's wicked."" She adds it's a âreally importantâ event for the LGBT community to show âeveryone is equal.â Thousands of people are in central London to enjoy this year's Pride parade. Here's some of the images which have caught our eye. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London For the first time since 2019, Londoners and LGBT allies from around the country have been able to turn out for the Pride parade in the capital. Iâm in the middle of the parade at the moment, and there are countless people in front of me and behind me - all marching for what they believe in. Plenty of people are watching from the side as well. Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly and all the way down to Trafalgar Square is lined with hundreds and maybe even thousands of people, all here to support the LGBTQ+ community. Itâs a warm, beautiful, sunny day in London, and people have certainly taken advantage of that. Police have been ""sensitive"" to concerns from the LGBTQ+ community about uniformed officers taking part in this year's Pride parade, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Organisers of Pride in London have said there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ and have asked police officers wearing uniforms not to join. In previous years officers from the Metropolitan Police have taken part in the parade in their work clothing. Khan said ""clearly"" the LGBTQ+ community had concerns around policing, referencing the investigation into the murders of four gay men by serial killer Stephen Port. He added: ""I think the police have been sensitive to the issues raised by the community and there will be uniformed officers in and around Pride to make sure we're all safe, to make sure this parade is a success. ""But, clearly, those taking part in the parade from the police service won't be wearing the uniforms."" In June it was announcedthe police watchdog would reinvestigatethe Metropolitan Police's initial handling of the men murdered by Port. Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent If anyone was in any doubt - Pride is loud and proud and back in 2022. The streets of London are awash with rainbow colours celebrating the LGBT+ community. It set off a little later than planned, but the Gay Liberation Front - who organised the first protest in 1972 of several hundred people - led the way again setting off on a bus from underneath the inflatable archway at Hyde Park Corner. An enormous rainbow flag billows out behind them along with thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London Kevin from Uganda said he was ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London Kevin from Uganda says he's ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London and ""support the LGBT community"". ""I'm proud to be a gay man,"" he says, adding that he is ""really happy"" to be celebrating Pride after two years of cancellations because of the pandemic. Helene from Surbiton, south-west London, said she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade Helene from Surbiton, in south-west London, told the BBC she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade. She says sexual orientation ""is nobody's business but your own"". Fifty years ago about 2,000 people took part in London's first official Lesbian and Gay Pride event, as part of a protest against how the police treated that community. The marcheshave continued to this day, but now the hundreds of thousands of people who take to the streets are joined by celebrities, corporate sponsors and politicians. The first Lesbian and Gay Pride marches through central London Police officers weren't allowed to march in uniform at Pride until 2003 Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then London mayor, at the 2008 Pride march Pride in London 2016 was a poignant affair as people remembered those who died in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida a few days before Pride in London has evolved over the years, with some questioning its priorities. However, the message of fairness, equality and inclusivity has been a constant. Read more here Peter Tatchell, pictured wearing a green shirt, took part in an event in central London on Friday marking the 50th anniversary of Pride Police officers wearing uniforms have been asked not to join todayâs annual London Pride march. Organisers say there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ. If follows accusations by campaigners of âvery serious evidence of police homophobia"" within the Met Police, especially over its handling of four murders of gay men by Stephen Port. The Met said it recognised some incidents had ""damaged trust and confidence in policing"". Read more on this story.

Heavy fighting in Ukraine-held city of LysychanskUkrainian forces say they are being pounded by Russian heavy artillery as they battle to keep the city.,"The fighting in Lysychansk sent plumes of smoke rising to the sky Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk is at the centre of competing claims, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces saying they are in control. Ukraine says its forces are enduring intense Russian shelling there but insists the city has not been seized. However, Russian-backed separatists say they have successfully entered the city and reached its centre. Russian media showed videos of separatist or Russian forces apparently parading through the streets. Russian sources have also tweeted video of the Soviet flag allegedly being placed on the city's ruined administrative centre, but that has not been verified. It is the last Ukrainian-held city in Luhansk, part of the industrial Donbas region. Russia captured the nearby city of Severodonetsk last month. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been no let-up in the assault on Lysychansk, with Russian forces approaching the besieged city from all sides. Rodion Miroshnik, ambassador to Russia of the pro-Moscow breakaway Luhansk People's Republic, told Russian television that Lysychansk had been ""brought under control"" but was ""not yet liberated"". Images of Chechen Russian soldiers inside the city were shared by defence blogger Rob Lee. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Since Russia invaded on 24 February, claiming it wanted to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine after it moved closer to Nato,thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed or wounded, whileat least 12 million people have fled their homes. Western states have responded by arming Ukraine and placing unprecedented sanctions on Russia, a nuclear superpower and global energy supplier. Can we say how many people have died in Ukraine? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Why Russia couldn't hold Snake Island In another development, railway tracks and electricity lines in the northern city of Kharkiv were damaged in a series of attacks. No casualties were reported. The southern city of Mykolaiv - on a key route to the port city of Odesa - was shaken by several explosions. The Russian defence ministry said its air force had destroyed five Ukrainian command posts and several ammunition dumps, but that claim has not been independently verified. The blasts came a day after the Russians were accused of killing more than 20 people in a missile strike on a block of flats near Odesa. Later on Saturday, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said his country's air defences had shot down Ukrainian missiles, though he did not specify where. He is a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin and allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine from Belarus in February. ""They are provoking us...  Three days ago, maybe a bit more, an attempt to strike military facilities on Belarusian territory was made from the territory of Ukraine,"" he said. ""But, thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles."" He added that ""we are not seeking to fight in Ukraine"". In its latest intelligence update, the UK Defence Ministry accuses Russia of using Soviet-era anti-ship missiles ""in a secondary land attack role"" - not what they were designed for. The Kh-22 and Kh-32 missiles were ""likely"" the ones that killed many civilians in Kremenchuk and Odesa, the ministry says. Slovyansk, a major Donbas city held by Ukrainian forces, has also been shelled again by the Russians. Its mayor Vadym Lyakh said banned Russian cluster munitions killed four people there - another claim the BBC was unable to verify.

What should happen to children who kill?Logan Mwangi was killed by his mother and stepfather and a 14-year-old boy and dumped in a river.Wales,"Craig Mulligan has been named as the 14-year-old boy involved in the killing of Logan Mwangi A ""complete shift"" is needed in the way we deal with children who murder, a campaigner has said. A 14-year-old boy and two adults were given life sentences for murdering five-year-old Logan Mwangi. Dr Tim Bateman wants shorter maximum terms, children held in secure childcare establishments and theage of criminal responsibility,externalraised to 16. The Ministry of Justice said it was committed to triallingsecure schools,externalas a new model of youth custody. Logan's mother Angharad Williamson, 31, his stepfather John Cole, 40, and Craig Mulligan, 14, killed Logan in July 2021, in a""brutal and sustained"" attackat home in Sarn, Bridgend county, leaving him with ""catastrophic"" injuries. His body was dumped in a nearby river. Cole will serve a minimum term of 29 years in prison while Williamson will serve at least 28 years,after being found guilty of murder following a trial at Cardiff Crown Court. Mulligan - who is not the biological son of Cole but was raised by him from the age of nine months - will serve at least 15 years. Jon Venables (left) and Robert Thompson murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993 The age of responsibility In many other countries around the world, Mulligan would not have come to court because his age would prevent him from being prosecuted for any crime, said Dr Bateman, chair of the National Association for Youth Justice. The age at which children are regarded as responsible for their actions in law varies across Europe - from 10 in Wales and England through to 14 in Germany, 15 in the Netherlands and 16 in Portugal. James Bulger was abducted from a shopping centre, tortured and murdered by two 10-year-olds in 1993 The youngest convicted murderers in modern British history are Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, the 10-year-olds who in 1993 abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James Bulger. They were jailed for life but released on licence with new identities in 2001. The year after James' murder, five-year-old Silje Redergard was beaten by two six-year-old boys and left to freeze to death in the snow in Trondheim,Norway. But in Norway, no children under 15 are prosecuted and Silje's killers were left with their families, helped by psychiatrists and social workers and wereback at kindergarten within a week,external. Recalling the public outrage that followed James' murder, Lawrence Lee, the solicitor who represented Venables, said: ""I don't think society could get their heads around how this kind of thing could happen."" He said the scenes outside the court, where people hurled bricks at the prison van, would ""live with me forever"". Hundreds of toys, teddy bears and flowers were left in Pandy Park after Logan's body was found When asked if he thought children should be held responsible for crimes such as murder, he replied: ""Yes, I think, nowadays, more and more... ""Children now are much more aware, they are so aware of their rights... a lot of children are so streetwise they purposely hide behind the veil of anonymity, because they know they're not going to be named."" He believes it is correct to try children in court: ""There's no way that these defendants can go free and they've got to be punished, but they've got to be educated as well if that's possible,"" he said. Mr Bateman said had Venables and Thompson been a few months younger they would not have faced prosecution, but would most likely have been taken into care and placed in a secure children's home for a significant period until they were assessed as safe to release back into the community. ""The same end would have happened without going through the criminal justice process,"" he said. ""The negative connotations of criminal conviction and media identification could be avoided."" Dr Tim Bateman would like to see a shift in the way Wales and England deal with children who commit murder ""We have a rather odd situation in England and Wales in relation to children who commit murder,"" said Dr Bateman. ""For instance, if you think about smoking - an adult can choose whether or not they wish to smoke... if they wish to damage their health [but] we don't take that view in relation to children who can't buy tobacco until the age of 18 because we don't regard them as fully responsible - they can't be trusted to take full account of the long term implications. ""To a large degree, when children break the law those assumptions go out of the window and suddenly we attribute full responsibility to children."" Dr Bateman said he wanted to see ""a complete shift in the way that we deal with children who commit murder"", including releasing them ""when there is still plenty of opportunity for them to make the transition to adulthood in a relatively normalised environment"". He said: ""We're one of the only countries in Europe that has an automatic life sentence for children who commit murder."" Detention during Her Majesty's Pleasure,externalis a mandatory life sentence imposed when a child or young person is convicted or pleads guilty to murder. How CCTV helped police catch Logan's murderers WCalls for tribute to murdered boy Logan Mwangi WDad says world is colder and darker without son The starting point for determining the minimum sentence where the offender is under 18 is 12 years and 15 years for those over 18. ""I would like to see a much shorter maximum sentence available for children, as happens in many other parts of the world,"" he said. But Mr Lee has faith in the current system: ""[We should] trust the parole board that they will not release that child until they are fit for return to society,"" he said. ""There could be serious consequences if they're released too early and they reoffend."" A Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson said: ""While it is for independent judges to decide sentences, we have changed the law for children who commit murder so that judges have a range of starting points that account for the child's age and the severity of the murder."" About 75% of children who receive a custodial sentence go to young offenders institutions which are ""very, very similar to adult prisons"", Dr Bateman said. A smaller number go to privately managed secure training centres and others go to secure children's homes. Logan's mother Angharad Williamson and stepfather John Cole were found guilty of his murder in April There are 14 individually managed secure children's homes throughout Wales and England, which restrict children's liberty to ensure their safety while providing care, education and support. Local authorities can place children there if they are deemed to be a significant risk to themselves or others and the Youth Custody Service can place children who have been remanded to custody or are serving a custodial sentence. L'Jurors should be offered support' LWho are Angharad Williamson and John Cole? Dr Bateman also wants an end to young offenders institutions, and all children who receive a custodial sentence held in childcare establishments. ""There are higher levels of staffing, support is much more thorough, there are opportunities for therapeutic interventions, capacity to work with the child towards their release, engage them in education and training and massively increase prospects for them in later life,"" he said. Mr Lee said that whatever type of facility a child was held in they must have a ""proper education, proper upbringing, so that eventually the chances of him being returned to society in a fit state is enhanced"". An MoJ spokesperson said: ""We are committed to trialling secure schools as a new model of youth custody that embeds education and health at its heart to reduce reoffending."" Solicitor Lawrence Lee represented Jon Venables at the trial for James Bulger's murder in 1993 In the Logan Mwangi murder trial, Judge Mrs Justice Jefford granted anonymity to the 14-year-old defendant throughsection 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act,external. However, these restrictions were challenged by the media at sentencing, and the judge lifted the order, meaning on Thursdayhe could be identified for the first time as Mulligan. At the trial of Venables and Thompson, the judge lifted reporting restrictions, saying: ""The public interest overrode the interest of the defendants."" In 2001, they were granted new identities and lifelong anonymity when they were released on licence. A court order banned anyone from revealing their new identities. In 2015, a judgelifted reporting restrictionson the naming a 15-year-old boy who murdered teacher Anne Maguire in Leeds. Mr Justice Coulson said identifying Will Cornick was in the public interest and would have ""a clear deterrent effect"". Dr Bateman said: ""The fact that we can identify children is something which is out of step internationally."" Logan was found dead in the River Ogmore in Sarn, Bridgend county, last July He said naming could encourage vigilante behaviour, not just against the child defendant but also their siblings and the wider community. He said it could also be detrimental to the defendant's rehabilitation: ""If they wake up and see their picture on the TV, on the front page of the newspaper as a child murderer that will have a significant impact on their development, the way that they see themselves, in my view, is likely to  increase the risk that they will continue to be a danger to others."" He said it would also have a negative impact on them after being released: ""Employers will be much less likely to offer opportunities to children who have been all over the front pages of the newspapers, colleges will be much less likely to offer places to such children."" Mr Lee said he saw both sides of the issue: ""I would have grave misgivings about naming but on the other hand, I'd have grave misgivings about remaining anonymous... ""I could understand a judge saying 'right, well let's name them and if we can save a teacher's life, if you can save any victim's life, it's worth it'. ""On the other hand, they will be thinking 'well if I do name, he is it going to be a target for revenge'."" This video can not be played How Logan Mwangi's killers tried to fool police When asked if Mulligan could ever have a normal life, Dr Bateman said it would be difficult. ""It will be difficult to come of age, to make the transition to adulthood in a custodial institution and not spend your time, as most adolescence do, learning how to deal with the wider world, learning how to be an adult."" Mr Lee is more optimistic: ""It depends on whether or not they're branded evil,"" he said. He said excursions outside prison would be essential towards the end of his sentence: ""If he is kept in custody for 10 years, unless he has the opportunity of dipping his toe into real everyday life, I think his chances of being normal again are very slim.""

Energy price hikes come into effect in Northern Ireland,"Energy price hikes are coming into effect across Northern Ireland from Friday which will put further pressure on the cost of living. The increases - which will add as much as Â£375 onto typical annual bills - will mean tens of thousands of customers will have to pay more for their gas and electricity. The wholesale cost of energy has soared over the last 12 months because of volatility on global energy markets. That is being passed on to customers. Increases, which have been previously announced, include: SSE Airtricity is increasing gas prices 42.7% in Greater Belfast, adding Â£372 on to the typical household's annual bill, affecting about 187,000 homes Firmus energy is putting gas prices up in Greater Belfast by 24.5%, adding about Â£300 to the typical household bill. It will affect 49,000 domestic and small business customers Power NI is increasing domestic prices by 27.5%, adding Â£204 to the typical annual household bill, affecting more than 450,000 households Click Energy is putting prices up 11%, adding about Â£100 to the typical annual household bill, affecting about 26,000 customers Experts say there is no sign of any downward movements, and these higher energy prices could be with us for some time. Aodhan O'Donnell, from energy comparison site Power to Switch, said that when comparing to this time last year, ""the average electricity deal was Â£400-500, now it's Â£800 so there's a significant increase there"". ""When you look at gas, the average deal from today is about Â£1,300,"" Mr O'Donnell said. ""This time last year it would have been around Â£600, so that's the impact these increases are having when you look at a year-to-year basis. ""Alongside that, the home heating oil price has also been above Â£1 a litre for some time now. ""I think people might not feel the full effect of that for some time now because it's July, but as soon as it comes into September, into the colder months, we'll certainly be finding people will struggle and prices are likely to stay high."" Gas prices have risen sharply In April,BBC News NI spoke to Lee Martin and his mum Caroline Wheelerin Enniskillen. Lee has a rare genetic disorder and relies on machines to help him breathe. His bed, toilet, CPat machine and nebuliser - everything in his home requires electricity. Why are energy bills going up? Why are prices rising so quickly? Why are gas prices so high? His mum Caroline said the latest increase was adding to the pressure. ""It's scary to even think of what's to come down the line,"" she said. ""Lee is on Economy 7 here and got a little reprieve when the weather turned good that he could switch off a couple of heaters. Caroline Wheeler has said her son can no longer afford to do the things that give him quality of life ""But because he suffers with a lot of kidney infections he needs to keep the heat up, but to think what's going to come down the line at Christmas or winter if there's a cold snap. ""It's already Â£100 a week. To hike it again, you're talking about Â£20-30. ""That's going to cut into his benefits. He already has to pay for his care Â£103 a week, so he is already well past the breadline, so he is in the red now and it's life-threatening. ""Anybody who needs this much equipment to stay alive, there should be more done for them."" The Consumer Council said it was currently speaking to consumers every day ""who are upset and worried about the winter ahead"". Its director of infrastructure and sustainability, Peter McClenaghan, said the price increases taking effect on Friday ""will impact more than half of Northern Ireland's households"". ""We urge anyone who is struggling to pay their energy bills or to top-up their meter, to contact their supplier directly for help with payment plans for bill pay / direct debit and prepayment meters,"" he said. Mr McClenaghan also issued some advice overthe financial support recently announced by the Chancelloraimed at helping pensioners, people with disabilities, and those on qualifying benefits. ""We know people are desperate for that support and we would ask those who will receive these funds, if you can, plan for heating your home this winter when deciding how to use the money you receive in July,"" he said.

After a two-year hiatus, Pride in London is back - and it was indeed bigger than ever. While partying continues, we're going to wrap up our live coverage here for today. Before we go, here's a recap of the day: Thanks for joining us. As we near the end of this year's Pride parade - and the beginning of the evening's celebrations - let's take a look at how thousands in London have marked the day: This video can not be played ITV presenters Phillip Schofield, Alison Hammond, Lorraine Kelly and Linda Robson were among the famous faces spotted at today's Pride parade in London.

Eloisa is also happy with ""how much love there is"" and says ""it's like we're fighting this together"". Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent In 2022 Pride is most definitely a party. People dancing in the street, throwing sweets, blowing whistles and having a great time. Thereâs no doubt that itâs worlds away from what it was when it started with a few hundred people risking arrest for kissing each other in the street. These days hundreds of organisations march and the number of corporate companies on board make it very shiny and commercial. I even saw a tractor decked out in the rainbow flag!  The colours are representative of bringing everyone together under one umbrella. But some within the community donât feel it represents them, while others think it should be more ofa protest like it was in 1972. Whatever people think of it though, the capitalâs streets were awash with colour today and after a month of Pride celebrations in June, theyâll continue around the country for the next several weeks. Bex and Jameson from Essex and Leytonstone Jameson from Leytonstone says he attended his first gay pride 46 years ago and has been to around 40 events since then. In the past there was ""so much negativity and abuse"", he says. Jameson tells the BBC that 46 years ago there weren't many people, the march was lined by police officers and people who turned up faced verbal abuse and projectiles. ""By the time we'd got down to Piccadilly, I would say a third of us had got arrested,"" he says. Today, however, Jameson is having a ""wonderful"" time at the parade. Stuart Feather (left), in drag, is bundled into a police car during a gay-rights protest, in 1971 Itâs 1972 â the swinging â60s are over, the minersâ strike has turned off the lights and Donny Osmond is topping the charts with Puppy Love. It will be another 20 years before same-sex attraction is declassified as a mental illness and, despite homosexual acts being decriminalised, in 1967, the age of consent remains five years older than for heterosexual couples. But, in a basement room at the London School of Economics, a revolution is brewing. BBC News has brought together some of those original members who attended the first UK Pride march, in 1972, and some LGBT people from the younger generation - to reflect on how much has changed and how much is still to be done. Read more from original members here. Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes,who recently came out publicly as gay, has shared her excitement at being part of the celebrations for Pride in London. She posted 'let's do this' on social media alongside the hashtag #beingme and a picture of herself wearing a multi-coloured outfit. Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history, and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier, to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

It's not just London that is marking Pride today. People in Shetland have been enjoying their first Pride festival - it's the most northerly celebration of its kind in the UK. People from across the community joined thecolourful event in Lerwick. The event has drawn interest from across the world and visiting drag queens travelled by ferry from Aberdeen to be there. Meanwhile Clacton, in Essex, is also hostingits first Pride eventcoinciding with the 50th anniversary of the movement globally. The free event has been planned since September, with organiser Cheryl Piper admitting she never thought Pride would reach the town. ""It's about bringing people together; there should be no stigma,"" she says. (From left to right) Siobhan, Laura and Vanessa Weâve been speaking to revellers celebrating Londonâs first Pride parade for three years. âEveryone is very happy and itâs a good day,â Laura says, adding that sheâs âglad to be backâ. Siobhan describes Pride this year as âamazingâ and âsuch a good vibeâ. Meanwhile it's Vanessaâs first time at the event in the capital. She says she's ""loving it, it's wicked."" She adds it's a âreally importantâ event for the LGBT community to show âeveryone is equal.â Thousands of people are in central London to enjoy this year's Pride parade. Here's some of the images which have caught our eye. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London For the first time since 2019, Londoners and LGBT allies from around the country have been able to turn out for the Pride parade in the capital. Iâm in the middle of the parade at the moment, and there are countless people in front of me and behind me - all marching for what they believe in. Plenty of people are watching from the side as well. Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly and all the way down to Trafalgar Square is lined with hundreds and maybe even thousands of people, all here to support the LGBTQ+ community. Itâs a warm, beautiful, sunny day in London, and people have certainly taken advantage of that. Police have been ""sensitive"" to concerns from the LGBTQ+ community about uniformed officers taking part in this year's Pride parade, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Organisers of Pride in London have said there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ and have asked police officers wearing uniforms not to join. In previous years officers from the Metropolitan Police have taken part in the parade in their work clothing. Khan said ""clearly"" the LGBTQ+ community had concerns around policing, referencing the investigation into the murders of four gay men by serial killer Stephen Port. He added: ""I think the police have been sensitive to the issues raised by the community and there will be uniformed officers in and around Pride to make sure we're all safe, to make sure this parade is a success. ""But, clearly, those taking part in the parade from the police service won't be wearing the uniforms."" In June it was announcedthe police watchdog would reinvestigatethe Metropolitan Police's initial handling of the men murdered by Port. Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent If anyone was in any doubt - Pride is loud and proud and back in 2022. The streets of London are awash with rainbow colours celebrating the LGBT+ community. It set off a little later than planned, but the Gay Liberation Front - who organised the first protest in 1972 of several hundred people - led the way again setting off on a bus from underneath the inflatable archway at Hyde Park Corner. An enormous rainbow flag billows out behind them along with thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London Kevin from Uganda said he was ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London Kevin from Uganda says he's ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London and ""support the LGBT community"". ""I'm proud to be a gay man,"" he says, adding that he is ""really happy"" to be celebrating Pride after two years of cancellations because of the pandemic. Helene from Surbiton, south-west London, said she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade Helene from Surbiton, in south-west London, told the BBC she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade. She says sexual orientation ""is nobody's business but your own"". Fifty years ago about 2,000 people took part in London's first official Lesbian and Gay Pride event, as part of a protest against how the police treated that community. The marcheshave continued to this day, but now the hundreds of thousands of people who take to the streets are joined by celebrities, corporate sponsors and politicians. The first Lesbian and Gay Pride marches through central London Police officers weren't allowed to march in uniform at Pride until 2003 Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then London mayor, at the 2008 Pride march Pride in London 2016 was a poignant affair as people remembered those who died in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida a few days before Pride in London has evolved over the years, with some questioning its priorities.

UK 'not even handed' over protocol - Varadkar,"This video can not be played UK government ""not even handed"" over Northern Ireland Protocol, argues Leo Varadkar The UK government has not been ""even handed"" when it comes to resolving the row over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Leo Varadkar has said. The tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy PM) accused Number 10 of ""siding"" with unionists in seeking to scrap parts ofthe deal agreed in 2019. The DUP has said the protocol damages Northern Ireland's place in the union. But Mr Varadkar said the UK government's bid to unilaterally change the protocol was a ""strategic mistake"". His comments come just days after MPs gave their initial approval to the government's Northern Ireland Protocol Bill. The proposed piece of legislation would allow ministers to change the part of the UK-EU 2019 deal - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - that introduced post-Brexit checks on goods sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Those were designed to avoid checks at the UK's border with the Republic of Ireland, but are unpopular among unionists in Northern Ireland. This week, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the protocol had ""many practical problems"", and had created ""a growing sense that the rights and aspirations of some parts of the community are being undermined"". In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Northern Ireland's The View programme, Mr Varadkar said the EU would ""not be threatened"" by the UK's approach to the ongoing stand-off. ""The British government had given commitments in the past that it would be even handed,"" he said. ""I don't think that's the case when it comes to this government. ""That's a strategic mistake for people who want to maintain the union - to continue to impose things that a clear majority of people don't want means more people will turn away from the union. ""That's a peculiar policy coming from a government that purports to want to defend the union."" He also cited a letter written by assembly members (MLAs) at Stormont to the British government urging it not to proceed withthe controversial protocol bill, saying Number 10 was ignoring the ""democratic"" views of a majority of parties. Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? How will NI protocol plans affect businesses? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Mr Varadkar was previously Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) when the initial Brexit negotiations took place. He is due to resume the role at the end of this year,under an arrangement that created the current coalition government in Dublin. The tÃ¡naiste said that in his political lifetime, he had ""never seen relations as bad"" with UK ministers. ""We have a British government that doesn't want to work hand in glove with the Irish government, it's not even handed, it's a government that wants to continue to have rows with the EU even though they've left,"" he added. Mr Varadkar rejected suggestions from Ms Truss that the EU had left the UK with no option but to move forward with the protocol bill. ""I think trust needs to be restored, the best way they can do that is by de-escalating this. ""Even if you have difficulties trusting someone, you still have to try to come to an agreement. If we can't with this government, then a future government."" The full interview with Leo Varadkar will be broadcast on The View tonight at 22:40 BST on BBC One Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead, when goods arrive in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement because the Irish border is a sensitive issue due to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Emotional Adele makes live comeback in Hyde Park,"This video can not be played Watch: Adele performs first public concert in five years at London's Hyde Park Adele told fans she was ""so happy"" to be back on stage as she briefly became overwhelmed at the start of her first public concert for five years. The pop superstar's composure momentarily cracked as she took in the huge audience in London's Hyde Park during the opening lines of Hello. She quickly resumed singing and went on to play a crowd-pleasing two-hour set for the 65,000 fans in her home city. ""It's so strange to be in front of a crowd again,"" she told them. This would not have been her live comeback if a Las Vegas residency that was scheduled to start in January had gone ahead. But she postponed it 24 hours before the first show, tearfully informing ticket-holders it ""ain't ready"". She told Friday's show that she would announce the rearranged US dates ""very, very soon"", and that she was waiting for one more piece of equipment to be ready. Adele promises Vegas shows will happen this year Tearful Adele postpones entire Las Vegas residency Review: Adele's 30 finds her emotionally bewildered Her initial show of her feelings was a display of the down-to-earth persona that is a big part of her appeal. It soon became obvious that the glammed-up girl next door can still push emotional buttons few other pop stars can reach. She appeared overwhelmed again as she watched the crowd belt out the chorus to Someone Like You, and few of the 18 bittersweet torch songs she performed were not accompanied by heartfelt sing-alongs. Some 130,000 people will watch Adele over two nights this weekend As well as those flashes of emotion, she appeared visibly relieved, too, at being back on a big stage. She did perform two television specials to promote her latest album 30 in November, but this was her first proper ticketed gig. ""I get so nervous before each show but I love being up here,"" she said on Friday. Lots of those who were due to see her in Vegas will wonder why she couldn't have got on stage there too. She clearly feels guilty about that debacle. She told the London crowd she knew lots of people felt let down, ""which is mortifying for me"". But she said she ""had to"" take that decision. She has still not quite explained why. Her set-up for the BST Hyde Park festival wasn't especially complicated. She stood in front of a six-piece band and three backing singers, who were arranged on two 2ft steps. Adele's last full concert was at Wembley in 2017 Above them were layered fringes of tastefully-coloured tassels, which lifted up part-way through the show to reveal the middle part of a wraparound screen that filed the backdrop of the stage. At one point, she and a grand piano appeared at the end of a catwalk that extended into the crowd. There was a bit of confetti, some flame-throwing pyrotechnics, and fireworks at the end. Those bells and whistles barely felt necessary, and the fans would have been more than happy if the only added extra was her trademark between-song north London banter. She asked if it was anybody's birthday, giving out dedications like a local radio DJ. Someone in the front rows had a wedding anniversary. ""27 years? Oi oi!"" Then she asked: ""Do we have any divorce parties here tonight?"" As the crowd roared, so did she: ""You liars! Ha ha!"" Seconds after launching into her James Bond theme Skyfall, she stopped to alert stewards to someone needing help in the crowd, only restarting when they had been seen to. At the end of the song, she spotted another possible casualty and her voice turned urgent again. ""Do you need help? Are you waving or do you need help? Oh, you're waving!"" She dissolved into laughter once more. At one point, she asked if there were any Stranger Things fans present, and for a moment it sounded like she might be about to bring out Kate Bush, whose Running Up That Hill has gone back to number one after becoming the show's unofficial theme. But no. Adele just wanted to bond with the crowd over the latest series, the second half of which was released on the day of her gig. ""I'm going to be knackered tomorrow, gobbling up part two all night,"" she joked. Those going to see her on Saturday will hope she got enough sleep to be on form again for her second night in Hyde Park. After that, she has no more concerts in the diary - until, presumably, Vegas. As she puts the finishing touches to those plans, this show proved that her deeply-felt songs, piercing voice and sincere presence can be enough to leave the biggest crowd with a warm glow.

LiveLiveRevellers fill London for 50th anniversary of Pride5 minutes ago,"More than a million people packed the capital for Pride's 50th anniversary, the London Mayor's office says It is the first time the event has been held since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic More than 600 LGBTQ+ community groups were expected to be at the march The parade started just after midday from Hyde Park Corner and runs until 18:00, finishing at Whitehall Palace The event, being called the ""most inclusive event in history"", includes performances from Ava Max, Emeli Sande and Samantha Mumba Edited by Dulcie Lee, Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh We're now closing our live coverage of the Pride parade in London. Thanks for joining us. The page was edited by Chris Giles and Dulcie Lee. The writers were Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh.  After a two-year hiatus, Pride in London is back - and it was indeed bigger than ever. While partying continues, we're going to wrap up our live coverage here for today. Before we go, here's a recap of the day: Thanks for joining us. As we near the end of this year's Pride parade - and the beginning of the evening's celebrations - let's take a look at how thousands in London have marked the day: This video can not be played ITV presenters Phillip Schofield, Alison Hammond, Lorraine Kelly and Linda Robson were among the famous faces spotted at today's Pride parade in London. Stylist and fashion expert Gok Wan was also seen celebrating with Dame Kelly Holmes, whorecently came out publicly as gay. Gok Wan and Dame Kelly Holmes were captured mid-laughter during the parade Alison Hammond and Phillip Schofield were pictured smiling in ITV T-shirts Meanwhile, Linda Robson had been busy collecting Pride badges Lorraine Kelly looked delighted as she waved to onlookers It's official â this year's Pride parade was the biggest ever in the capital, the London Mayor's office says. Sadiq Khan's office says more than one million revellers joined the event, with rainbow colours, glitter and sequins galore. Floats lined Park Lane ahead of the main march through London, which was led by Gay Liberation Front activists holding placards saying ""I was there in 1972"". (From left to right) Octavia, Ewan, Esther, Eloisa We've been talking to four friends attending their first Pride in London together. Octavia says it's nice for all her friends ""to be together"" and to ""celebrate Pride after the pandemic"". Ewan adds all four are part of the LGBTQ+ community and it's really good to see ""integration"" in every part of life. ""I'm having a great day,"" Esther chips in. Eloisa is also happy with ""how much love there is"" and says ""it's like we're fighting this together"". Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent In 2022 Pride is most definitely a party. People dancing in the street, throwing sweets, blowing whistles and having a great time. Thereâs no doubt that itâs worlds away from what it was when it started with a few hundred people risking arrest for kissing each other in the street. These days hundreds of organisations march and the number of corporate companies on board make it very shiny and commercial. I even saw a tractor decked out in the rainbow flag!  The colours are representative of bringing everyone together under one umbrella. But some within the community donât feel it represents them, while others think it should be more ofa protest like it was in 1972. Whatever people think of it though, the capitalâs streets were awash with colour today and after a month of Pride celebrations in June, theyâll continue around the country for the next several weeks. Bex and Jameson from Essex and Leytonstone Jameson from Leytonstone says he attended his first gay pride 46 years ago and has been to around 40 events since then. In the past there was ""so much negativity and abuse"", he says. Jameson tells the BBC that 46 years ago there weren't many people, the march was lined by police officers and people who turned up faced verbal abuse and projectiles. ""By the time we'd got down to Piccadilly, I would say a third of us had got arrested,"" he says. Today, however, Jameson is having a ""wonderful"" time at the parade. Stuart Feather (left), in drag, is bundled into a police car during a gay-rights protest, in 1971 Itâs 1972 â the swinging â60s are over, the minersâ strike has turned off the lights and Donny Osmond is topping the charts with Puppy Love. It will be another 20 years before same-sex attraction is declassified as a mental illness and, despite homosexual acts being decriminalised, in 1967, the age of consent remains five years older than for heterosexual couples. But, in a basement room at the London School of Economics, a revolution is brewing. BBC News has brought together some of those original members who attended the first UK Pride march, in 1972, and some LGBT people from the younger generation - to reflect on how much has changed and how much is still to be done. Read more from original members here. Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes,who recently came out publicly as gay, has shared her excitement at being part of the celebrations for Pride in London. She posted 'let's do this' on social media alongside the hashtag #beingme and a picture of herself wearing a multi-coloured outfit. Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history, and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier, to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

It's not just London that is marking Pride today. People in Shetland have been enjoying their first Pride festival - it's the most northerly celebration of its kind in the UK. People from across the community joined thecolourful event in Lerwick. The event has drawn interest from across the world and visiting drag queens travelled by ferry from Aberdeen to be there. Meanwhile Clacton, in Essex, is also hostingits first Pride eventcoinciding with the 50th anniversary of the movement globally. The free event has been planned since September, with organiser Cheryl Piper admitting she never thought Pride would reach the town. ""It's about bringing people together; there should be no stigma,"" she says. (From left to right) Siobhan, Laura and Vanessa Weâve been speaking to revellers celebrating Londonâs first Pride parade for three years. âEveryone is very happy and itâs a good day,â Laura says, adding that sheâs âglad to be backâ. Siobhan describes Pride this year as âamazingâ and âsuch a good vibeâ. Meanwhile it's Vanessaâs first time at the event in the capital. She says she's ""loving it, it's wicked."" She adds it's a âreally importantâ event for the LGBT community to show âeveryone is equal.â Thousands of people are in central London to enjoy this year's Pride parade. Here's some of the images which have caught our eye. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London For the first time since 2019, Londoners and LGBT allies from around the country have been able to turn out for the Pride parade in the capital. Iâm in the middle of the parade at the moment, and there are countless people in front of me and behind me - all marching for what they believe in. Plenty of people are watching from the side as well. Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly and all the way down to Trafalgar Square is lined with hundreds and maybe even thousands of people, all here to support the LGBTQ+ community. Itâs a warm, beautiful, sunny day in London, and people have certainly taken advantage of that. Police have been ""sensitive"" to concerns from the LGBTQ+ community about uniformed officers taking part in this year's Pride parade, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Organisers of Pride in London have said there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ and have asked police officers wearing uniforms not to join. In previous years officers from the Metropolitan Police have taken part in the parade in their work clothing. Khan said ""clearly"" the LGBTQ+ community had concerns around policing, referencing the investigation into the murders of four gay men by serial killer Stephen Port. He added: ""I think the police have been sensitive to the issues raised by the community and there will be uniformed officers in and around Pride to make sure we're all safe, to make sure this parade is a success. ""But, clearly, those taking part in the parade from the police service won't be wearing the uniforms."" In June it was announcedthe police watchdog would reinvestigatethe Metropolitan Police's initial handling of the men murdered by Port. Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent If anyone was in any doubt - Pride is loud and proud and back in 2022. The streets of London are awash with rainbow colours celebrating the LGBT+ community. It set off a little later than planned, but the Gay Liberation Front - who organised the first protest in 1972 of several hundred people - led the way again setting off on a bus from underneath the inflatable archway at Hyde Park Corner. An enormous rainbow flag billows out behind them along with thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London Kevin from Uganda said he was ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London Kevin from Uganda says he's ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London and ""support the LGBT community"". ""I'm proud to be a gay man,"" he says, adding that he is ""really happy"" to be celebrating Pride after two years of cancellations because of the pandemic. Helene from Surbiton, south-west London, said she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade Helene from Surbiton, in south-west London, told the BBC she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade. She says sexual orientation ""is nobody's business but your own"". Fifty years ago about 2,000 people took part in London's first official Lesbian and Gay Pride event, as part of a protest against how the police treated that community. The marcheshave continued to this day, but now the hundreds of thousands of people who take to the streets are joined by celebrities, corporate sponsors and politicians. The first Lesbian and Gay Pride marches through central London Police officers weren't allowed to march in uniform at Pride until 2003 Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then London mayor, at the 2008 Pride march Pride in London 2016 was a poignant affair as people remembered those who died in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida a few days before Pride in London has evolved over the years, with some questioning its priorities. However, the message of fairness, equality and inclusivity has been a constant.

Whatever people think of it though, the capitalâs streets were awash with colour today and after a month of Pride celebrations in June, theyâll continue around the country for the next several weeks. Bex and Jameson from Essex and Leytonstone Jameson from Leytonstone says he attended his first gay pride 46 years ago and has been to around 40 events since then. In the past there was ""so much negativity and abuse"", he says. Jameson tells the BBC that 46 years ago there weren't many people, the march was lined by police officers and people who turned up faced verbal abuse and projectiles. ""By the time we'd got down to Piccadilly, I would say a third of us had got arrested,"" he says. Today, however, Jameson is having a ""wonderful"" time at the parade. Stuart Feather (left), in drag, is bundled into a police car during a gay-rights protest, in 1971 Itâs 1972 â the swinging â60s are over, the minersâ strike has turned off the lights and Donny Osmond is topping the charts with Puppy Love. It will be another 20 years before same-sex attraction is declassified as a mental illness and, despite homosexual acts being decriminalised, in 1967, the age of consent remains five years older than for heterosexual couples. But, in a basement room at the London School of Economics, a revolution is brewing. BBC News has brought together some of those original members who attended the first UK Pride march, in 1972, and some LGBT people from the younger generation - to reflect on how much has changed and how much is still to be done. Read more from original members here. Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes,who recently came out publicly as gay, has shared her excitement at being part of the celebrations for Pride in London. She posted 'let's do this' on social media alongside the hashtag #beingme and a picture of herself wearing a multi-coloured outfit. Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history, and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier, to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

It's not just London that is marking Pride today. People in Shetland have been enjoying their first Pride festival - it's the most northerly celebration of its kind in the UK. People from across the community joined thecolourful event in Lerwick. The event has drawn interest from across the world and visiting drag queens travelled by ferry from Aberdeen to be there. Meanwhile Clacton, in Essex, is also hostingits first Pride eventcoinciding with the 50th anniversary of the movement globally. The free event has been planned since September, with organiser Cheryl Piper admitting she never thought Pride would reach the town. ""It's about bringing people together; there should be no stigma,"" she says. (From left to right) Siobhan, Laura and Vanessa Weâve been speaking to revellers celebrating Londonâs first Pride parade for three years. âEveryone is very happy and itâs a good day,â Laura says, adding that sheâs âglad to be backâ. Siobhan describes Pride this year as âamazingâ and âsuch a good vibeâ. Meanwhile it's Vanessaâs first time at the event in the capital. She says she's ""loving it, it's wicked."" She adds it's a âreally importantâ event for the LGBT community to show âeveryone is equal.â Thousands of people are in central London to enjoy this year's Pride parade. Here's some of the images which have caught our eye. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London For the first time since 2019, Londoners and LGBT allies from around the country have been able to turn out for the Pride parade in the capital. Iâm in the middle of the parade at the moment, and there are countless people in front of me and behind me - all marching for what they believe in. Plenty of people are watching from the side as well. Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly and all the way down to Trafalgar Square is lined with hundreds and maybe even thousands of people, all here to support the LGBTQ+ community. Itâs a warm, beautiful, sunny day in London, and people have certainly taken advantage of that. Police have been ""sensitive"" to concerns from the LGBTQ+ community about uniformed officers taking part in this year's Pride parade, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Organisers of Pride in London have said there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ and have asked police officers wearing uniforms not to join. In previous years officers from the Metropolitan Police have taken part in the parade in their work clothing. Khan said ""clearly"" the LGBTQ+ community had concerns around policing, referencing the investigation into the murders of four gay men by serial killer Stephen Port. He added: ""I think the police have been sensitive to the issues raised by the community and there will be uniformed officers in and around Pride to make sure we're all safe, to make sure this parade is a success. ""But, clearly, those taking part in the parade from the police service won't be wearing the uniforms."" In June it was announcedthe police watchdog would reinvestigatethe Metropolitan Police's initial handling of the men murdered by Port. Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent If anyone was in any doubt - Pride is loud and proud and back in 2022. The streets of London are awash with rainbow colours celebrating the LGBT+ community. It set off a little later than planned, but the Gay Liberation Front - who organised the first protest in 1972 of several hundred people - led the way again setting off on a bus from underneath the inflatable archway at Hyde Park Corner. An enormous rainbow flag billows out behind them along with thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London Kevin from Uganda said he was ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London Kevin from Uganda says he's ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London and ""support the LGBT community"". ""I'm proud to be a gay man,"" he says, adding that he is ""really happy"" to be celebrating Pride after two years of cancellations because of the pandemic. Helene from Surbiton, south-west London, said she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade Helene from Surbiton, in south-west London, told the BBC she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade. She says sexual orientation ""is nobody's business but your own"". Fifty years ago about 2,000 people took part in London's first official Lesbian and Gay Pride event, as part of a protest against how the police treated that community. The marcheshave continued to this day, but now the hundreds of thousands of people who take to the streets are joined by celebrities, corporate sponsors and politicians. The first Lesbian and Gay Pride marches through central London Police officers weren't allowed to march in uniform at Pride until 2003 Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then London mayor, at the 2008 Pride march Pride in London 2016 was a poignant affair as people remembered those who died in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida a few days before Pride in London has evolved over the years, with some questioning its priorities. However, the message of fairness, equality and inclusivity has been a constant. Read more here Peter Tatchell, pictured wearing a green shirt, took part in an event in central London on Friday marking the 50th anniversary of Pride Police officers wearing uniforms have been asked not to join todayâs annual London Pride march. Organisers say there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ. If follows accusations by campaigners of âvery serious evidence of police homophobia"" within the Met Police, especially over its handling of four murders of gay men by Stephen Port.

"Emotional Adele makes live comeback in Hyde ParkThe singer tells the crowd at her first public concert in five years she is ""so happy"" to be back.","This video can not be played Watch: Adele performs first public concert in five years at London's Hyde Park Adele told fans she was ""so happy"" to be back on stage as she briefly became overwhelmed at the start of her first public concert for five years. The pop superstar's composure momentarily cracked as she took in the huge audience in London's Hyde Park during the opening lines of Hello. She quickly resumed singing and went on to play a crowd-pleasing two-hour set for the 65,000 fans in her home city. ""It's so strange to be in front of a crowd again,"" she told them. This would not have been her live comeback if a Las Vegas residency that was scheduled to start in January had gone ahead. But she postponed it 24 hours before the first show, tearfully informing ticket-holders it ""ain't ready"". She told Friday's show that she would announce the rearranged US dates ""very, very soon"", and that she was waiting for one more piece of equipment to be ready. Adele promises Vegas shows will happen this year Tearful Adele postpones entire Las Vegas residency Review: Adele's 30 finds her emotionally bewildered Her initial show of her feelings was a display of the down-to-earth persona that is a big part of her appeal. It soon became obvious that the glammed-up girl next door can still push emotional buttons few other pop stars can reach. She appeared overwhelmed again as she watched the crowd belt out the chorus to Someone Like You, and few of the 18 bittersweet torch songs she performed were not accompanied by heartfelt sing-alongs. Some 130,000 people will watch Adele over two nights this weekend As well as those flashes of emotion, she appeared visibly relieved, too, at being back on a big stage. She did perform two television specials to promote her latest album 30 in November, but this was her first proper ticketed gig. ""I get so nervous before each show but I love being up here,"" she said on Friday. Lots of those who were due to see her in Vegas will wonder why she couldn't have got on stage there too. She clearly feels guilty about that debacle. She told the London crowd she knew lots of people felt let down, ""which is mortifying for me"". But she said she ""had to"" take that decision. She has still not quite explained why. Her set-up for the BST Hyde Park festival wasn't especially complicated. She stood in front of a six-piece band and three backing singers, who were arranged on two 2ft steps. Adele's last full concert was at Wembley in 2017 Above them were layered fringes of tastefully-coloured tassels, which lifted up part-way through the show to reveal the middle part of a wraparound screen that filed the backdrop of the stage. At one point, she and a grand piano appeared at the end of a catwalk that extended into the crowd. There was a bit of confetti, some flame-throwing pyrotechnics, and fireworks at the end. Those bells and whistles barely felt necessary, and the fans would have been more than happy if the only added extra was her trademark between-song north London banter. She asked if it was anybody's birthday, giving out dedications like a local radio DJ. Someone in the front rows had a wedding anniversary. ""27 years? Oi oi!"" Then she asked: ""Do we have any divorce parties here tonight?"" As the crowd roared, so did she: ""You liars! Ha ha!"" Seconds after launching into her James Bond theme Skyfall, she stopped to alert stewards to someone needing help in the crowd, only restarting when they had been seen to. At the end of the song, she spotted another possible casualty and her voice turned urgent again. ""Do you need help? Are you waving or do you need help? Oh, you're waving!"" She dissolved into laughter once more. At one point, she asked if there were any Stranger Things fans present, and for a moment it sounded like she might be about to bring out Kate Bush, whose Running Up That Hill has gone back to number one after becoming the show's unofficial theme. But no. Adele just wanted to bond with the crowd over the latest series, the second half of which was released on the day of her gig. ""I'm going to be knackered tomorrow, gobbling up part two all night,"" she joked. Those going to see her on Saturday will hope she got enough sleep to be on form again for her second night in Hyde Park. After that, she has no more concerts in the diary - until, presumably, Vegas. As she puts the finishing touches to those plans, this show proved that her deeply-felt songs, piercing voice and sincere presence can be enough to leave the biggest crowd with a warm glow.

Raducanu and Leicester fuel Boulter's Wimbledon bidKatie Boulter is taking inspiration from Leicester's 2015/16 Premier League title victory and Emma Raducanu's 2021 US Open win to fuel her Wimbledon run.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Katie Boulter come from a set down to beat Karolina Pliskova Katie Boulter is taking inspiration from Leicester's 2016 Premier League title victory and Emma Raducanu's 2021 US Open win to fuel her Wimbledon run. The 25-year-old takes on France's Harmony Tan, who knocked out seven-time singles champion Serena Williams, at 11:00 BST for a place in the last 16. ""I hope I can take a leaf out of their book,"" said Boulter of Leicester before Saturday's match. ""They were something else. Maybe I can hopefully create that this year."" Leicester defied 5,000-1 pre-season odds to clinch the title ahead of the top-flight's established powerhouses, while Raducanu, ranked 150 in the world at the time, became the the first player to come through qualifying and clinch a Grand Slam title in an astonishing run at Flushing Meadows last year. Emma Raducanu and Leicester City have both inspired Boulter before her meeting with Tan Raducanu was knocked out of this year's Wimbledon on Wednesday, overpowered by Caroline Garcia of France. But Boulter says her Davis Cup team-mate's run in New York has made her reimagine what is possible. ""She came out, she surprised everyone, and she played some fearless tennis,"" said Boulter, ranked 118 in the world. ""That's what's so impressive. I hope I can go out there and do the same thing. I'd love to do what she's done. You never know, one day it might happen."" Norrie 'embracing and enjoying' Wimbledon run Injury lows to Wimbledon highs - who is Katie Boulter? No Grand Slams but Isner aces the records Saturday's order of play Liam Broady is another Briton aiming to join compatriot Heather Watson in the fourth round. The 28-year-old from Stockport defeated 12th seed Diego Schwartzman in five sets and, like Boulter, is competing in the third round of a Grand Slam event for the first time. However, Broady admits that he would understand if, for once, he didn't get his compatriot's support, given he is playing Boulter's boyfriend, Australian 19th seed Alex De Minaur. ""I won't judge her if she sits in 'Demon's' box. She kind of has to, doesn't she?,"" Broady said. ""I know his game pretty well. He's a fantastic player. He's very good on the grass. ""But I fancy myself against anybody, to be honest."" Swiatek is well clear of her rivals in the rankings, with almost twice as many points as world number two Ons Jabeur Top seed Iga Swiatek could extend her winning streak to 38 matches, a total unmatched since German legend Steffi Graf won 66 in a row in 1989-90, if she beats Alize Cornet to make the fourth round. The Polish 21-year-old's last defeat came in Dubai back in February. She has dropped only six sets in her streak since. A two-time French Open champion and an Australian Open semi-finalist earlier this year, Swiatek would equal her best run at Wimbledon by beating French world number 37 Cornet on Court One. But she admitted she is still getting to grips with grass. ""I guess you can see that I'm not playing maybe as efficiently as on other surfaces,"" she said. ""I would play well on grass if I would have kind of more time to just play on this surface. Every year it [the grass court season] is only like four weeks, so I feel it's not enough to learn properly."" In one of the most eagerly anticipated matches of the day, Australian Nick Kyrgios will take on fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas. Kyrgios is ranked 35 places lower the Greek Tsitsipas, but,since memorably knocking out world number one Rafael Nadal on his debut Wimbledon campaign as a teenager, has always carried considerable threat on grass. He also frequently comes with controversy. Kyrgios was fined $10,000 (Â£8,200) for his behaviour in his first-round win where he spat at a spectator and called a line judge a ""snitch"". This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Nick Kyrgios make a series of outbursts during first-round win over Paul Jubb Tsitsipas has seen Kyrgios' antics up close. At the grass-court warm-up event in Halle in June,Kyrgios smashed up his racquet and got into an argument with the umpire over his alleged time-wasting during their match. ""I feel like everyone here knows who Nick is,' Tsitsipas said. ""We have had many great matches against each other. I respect him for his game and the way he fights â¦ when he wants to."" Kyrgios has won three of the pair's four previous meetings.

Dame Deborah death prompts more bowel checksThe NHS website has had thousands more visits this week after the campaigner's death.,"Deborah James inspired people to make potentially life-saving checks after featuring in a BBC cancer podcast Thousands more people visited their bowel-cancer symptoms page this week following the death of Dame Deborah James, according to NHS figures. The number of page visits rose from 2,000 on Tuesday to 23,000 on Wednesday, after the family announced her death on Tuesday evening. Dame Deborah, who was 40, had bowel cancer since 2016. She dedicated the latter years of her life to talking about cancer and urging people to check for symptoms. NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard called her ""an inspiration to us all"". ""People often don't feel comfortable speaking about their cancer diagnosis and treatment but Deborah bravely speaking out about her personal journey has prompted thousands more people to check the symptoms,"" she added. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said Dame Deborah had left ""an incredible legacy"". ""These figures reflect the powerful and life-saving impact she has had - inspiring countless people across the country to get informed, get checked and speak up,"" he said. Bowel cancer: How to check your poo Are we failing young people with cancer? Tailored cancer care - Dame Deborah's fundraising legacy Dame Deborah, whose damehood was delivered personally by Prince William at her parents' home in May, became a cancer blogger and podcaster after her diagnosis. The former deputy head teacher was one third of the BBC You, Me and the Big C podcast and announced in May she was receiving end-of-life care. This video can not be played Watch: Dame Deborah James saved countless lives raising awareness, says Bowel Cancer UK CEO She raised more than Â£7m for Cancer Research and regularly shared information about bowel cancer and how to spot it. Other high-profile figures, including reality TV star Jade Goody, who died in 2009, have helped spread the message about checking for cancer. Ms Goody's death, from cervical cancer,led to a 12% increasein women getting NHS smear tests. Referrals to breast-cancer clinics also more thandoubled in the UKafter actress Angelina Jolie, who was considered at high risk, announced she had had a double mastectomy. There are three main things to look out for: blood in your poo that happens for no obvious reason - it may be bright red or dark red a change in how you poo - such as going to the toilet more often or your poo becoming runnier or harder feeling lower-tummy pain or bloating, when your belly feels full and tight There may be other symptoms too, such as: losing weight feeling you haven't emptied your bowel properly after going to the toilet feeling more tired or dizzy than usual Regular bowel-cancer screening is available to everyone aged 60-74. This programme is expanding gradually over four years to include everyone aged 50-59 in England. The expansion began in April last year. People in England aged 60-74 who are registered with a GP are automatically sent an NHS bowel-cancer screening kit every two years. In Scotland, screening starts from the age of 50. In Wales you will be invited to take part in bowel-cancer screening if you're aged between 58 and 74. In Northern Ireland people over the age of 60 are invited to take part. If you are outside this age group, you should still be aware of what bowel-cancer symptoms are and visit your GP if you have any concerns.

Thanks for joining us. The page was edited by Chris Giles and Dulcie Lee. The writers were Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh.  After a two-year hiatus, Pride in London is back - and it was indeed bigger than ever. While partying continues, we're going to wrap up our live coverage here for today. Before we go, here's a recap of the day: Thanks for joining us. As we near the end of this year's Pride parade - and the beginning of the evening's celebrations - let's take a look at how thousands in London have marked the day: This video can not be played ITV presenters Phillip Schofield, Alison Hammond, Lorraine Kelly and Linda Robson were among the famous faces spotted at today's Pride parade in London. Stylist and fashion expert Gok Wan was also seen celebrating with Dame Kelly Holmes, whorecently came out publicly as gay. Gok Wan and Dame Kelly Holmes were captured mid-laughter during the parade Alison Hammond and Phillip Schofield were pictured smiling in ITV T-shirts Meanwhile, Linda Robson had been busy collecting Pride badges Lorraine Kelly looked delighted as she waved to onlookers It's official â this year's Pride parade was the biggest ever in the capital, the London Mayor's office says. Sadiq Khan's office says more than one million revellers joined the event, with rainbow colours, glitter and sequins galore. Floats lined Park Lane ahead of the main march through London, which was led by Gay Liberation Front activists holding placards saying ""I was there in 1972"". (From left to right) Octavia, Ewan, Esther, Eloisa We've been talking to four friends attending their first Pride in London together. Octavia says it's nice for all her friends ""to be together"" and to ""celebrate Pride after the pandemic"". Ewan adds all four are part of the LGBTQ+ community and it's really good to see ""integration"" in every part of life. ""I'm having a great day,"" Esther chips in. Eloisa is also happy with ""how much love there is"" and says ""it's like we're fighting this together"". Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent In 2022 Pride is most definitely a party. People dancing in the street, throwing sweets, blowing whistles and having a great time. Thereâs no doubt that itâs worlds away from what it was when it started with a few hundred people risking arrest for kissing each other in the street. These days hundreds of organisations march and the number of corporate companies on board make it very shiny and commercial. I even saw a tractor decked out in the rainbow flag!  The colours are representative of bringing everyone together under one umbrella. But some within the community donât feel it represents them, while others think it should be more ofa protest like it was in 1972. Whatever people think of it though, the capitalâs streets were awash with colour today and after a month of Pride celebrations in June, theyâll continue around the country for the next several weeks. Bex and Jameson from Essex and Leytonstone Jameson from Leytonstone says he attended his first gay pride 46 years ago and has been to around 40 events since then. In the past there was ""so much negativity and abuse"", he says. Jameson tells the BBC that 46 years ago there weren't many people, the march was lined by police officers and people who turned up faced verbal abuse and projectiles. ""By the time we'd got down to Piccadilly, I would say a third of us had got arrested,"" he says. Today, however, Jameson is having a ""wonderful"" time at the parade. Stuart Feather (left), in drag, is bundled into a police car during a gay-rights protest, in 1971 Itâs 1972 â the swinging â60s are over, the minersâ strike has turned off the lights and Donny Osmond is topping the charts with Puppy Love. It will be another 20 years before same-sex attraction is declassified as a mental illness and, despite homosexual acts being decriminalised, in 1967, the age of consent remains five years older than for heterosexual couples. But, in a basement room at the London School of Economics, a revolution is brewing. BBC News has brought together some of those original members who attended the first UK Pride march, in 1972, and some LGBT people from the younger generation - to reflect on how much has changed and how much is still to be done. Read more from original members here. Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes,who recently came out publicly as gay, has shared her excitement at being part of the celebrations for Pride in London. She posted 'let's do this' on social media alongside the hashtag #beingme and a picture of herself wearing a multi-coloured outfit. Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history, and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier, to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

Here's some of the images which have caught our eye. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London For the first time since 2019, Londoners and LGBT allies from around the country have been able to turn out for the Pride parade in the capital. Iâm in the middle of the parade at the moment, and there are countless people in front of me and behind me - all marching for what they believe in. Plenty of people are watching from the side as well. Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly and all the way down to Trafalgar Square is lined with hundreds and maybe even thousands of people, all here to support the LGBTQ+ community. Itâs a warm, beautiful, sunny day in London, and people have certainly taken advantage of that. Police have been ""sensitive"" to concerns from the LGBTQ+ community about uniformed officers taking part in this year's Pride parade, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has said. Organisers of Pride in London have said there are âvery real concernsâ within the LGBTQ+ community about âpolice homophobiaâ and have asked police officers wearing uniforms not to join. In previous years officers from the Metropolitan Police have taken part in the parade in their work clothing. Khan said ""clearly"" the LGBTQ+ community had concerns around policing, referencing the investigation into the murders of four gay men by serial killer Stephen Port. He added: ""I think the police have been sensitive to the issues raised by the community and there will be uniformed officers in and around Pride to make sure we're all safe, to make sure this parade is a success. ""But, clearly, those taking part in the parade from the police service won't be wearing the uniforms."" In June it was announcedthe police watchdog would reinvestigatethe Metropolitan Police's initial handling of the men murdered by Port. Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent If anyone was in any doubt - Pride is loud and proud and back in 2022. The streets of London are awash with rainbow colours celebrating the LGBT+ community. It set off a little later than planned, but the Gay Liberation Front - who organised the first protest in 1972 of several hundred people - led the way again setting off on a bus from underneath the inflatable archway at Hyde Park Corner. An enormous rainbow flag billows out behind them along with thousands of people who want to make their voices heard at the place where Pride was born 50 years ago. Paul Murphy-KaspBBC London Kevin from Uganda said he was ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London Kevin from Uganda says he's ""so, so, so happy"" to come to Pride in London and ""support the LGBT community"". ""I'm proud to be a gay man,"" he says, adding that he is ""really happy"" to be celebrating Pride after two years of cancellations because of the pandemic. Helene from Surbiton, south-west London, said she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade Helene from Surbiton, in south-west London, told the BBC she plans to high-five everyone supporting the parade. She says sexual orientation ""is nobody's business but your own"". Fifty years ago about 2,000 people took part in London's first official Lesbian and Gay Pride event, as part of a protest against how the police treated that community. The marcheshave continued to this day, but now the hundreds of thousands of people who take to the streets are joined by celebrities, corporate sponsors and politicians. The first Lesbian and Gay Pride marches through central London Police officers weren't allowed to march in uniform at Pride until 2003 Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then London mayor, at the 2008 Pride march Pride in London 2016 was a poignant affair as people remembered those who died in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida a few days before Pride in London has evolved over the years, with some questioning its priorities.

LiveLiveThousands gather for Pride in London4 minutes ago,"More than a million people packed the capital for Pride's 50th anniversary, the London Mayor's office says It is the first time the event has been held since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic More than 600 LGBTQ+ community groups were expected to be at the march The parade started just after midday from Hyde Park Corner and runs until 18:00, finishing at Whitehall Palace The event, being called the ""most inclusive event in history"", includes performances from Ava Max, Emeli Sande and Samantha Mumba Edited by Dulcie Lee, Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh We're now closing our live coverage of the Pride parade in London. Thanks for joining us. The page was edited by Chris Giles and Dulcie Lee. The writers were Jack Burgess and Aoife Walsh.  After a two-year hiatus, Pride in London is back - and it was indeed bigger than ever. While partying continues, we're going to wrap up our live coverage here for today. Before we go, here's a recap of the day: Thanks for joining us. As we near the end of this year's Pride parade - and the beginning of the evening's celebrations - let's take a look at how thousands in London have marked the day: This video can not be played ITV presenters Phillip Schofield, Alison Hammond, Lorraine Kelly and Linda Robson were among the famous faces spotted at today's Pride parade in London. Stylist and fashion expert Gok Wan was also seen celebrating with Dame Kelly Holmes, whorecently came out publicly as gay. Gok Wan and Dame Kelly Holmes were captured mid-laughter during the parade Alison Hammond and Phillip Schofield were pictured smiling in ITV T-shirts Meanwhile, Linda Robson had been busy collecting Pride badges Lorraine Kelly looked delighted as she waved to onlookers It's official â this year's Pride parade was the biggest ever in the capital, the London Mayor's office says. Sadiq Khan's office says more than one million revellers joined the event, with rainbow colours, glitter and sequins galore. Floats lined Park Lane ahead of the main march through London, which was led by Gay Liberation Front activists holding placards saying ""I was there in 1972"". (From left to right) Octavia, Ewan, Esther, Eloisa We've been talking to four friends attending their first Pride in London together. Octavia says it's nice for all her friends ""to be together"" and to ""celebrate Pride after the pandemic"". Ewan adds all four are part of the LGBTQ+ community and it's really good to see ""integration"" in every part of life. ""I'm having a great day,"" Esther chips in. Eloisa is also happy with ""how much love there is"" and says ""it's like we're fighting this together"". Lauren MossBBC LGBT & Identity Correspondent In 2022 Pride is most definitely a party. People dancing in the street, throwing sweets, blowing whistles and having a great time. Thereâs no doubt that itâs worlds away from what it was when it started with a few hundred people risking arrest for kissing each other in the street. These days hundreds of organisations march and the number of corporate companies on board make it very shiny and commercial. I even saw a tractor decked out in the rainbow flag!  The colours are representative of bringing everyone together under one umbrella. But some within the community donât feel it represents them, while others think it should be more ofa protest like it was in 1972. Whatever people think of it though, the capitalâs streets were awash with colour today and after a month of Pride celebrations in June, theyâll continue around the country for the next several weeks. Bex and Jameson from Essex and Leytonstone Jameson from Leytonstone says he attended his first gay pride 46 years ago and has been to around 40 events since then. In the past there was ""so much negativity and abuse"", he says. Jameson tells the BBC that 46 years ago there weren't many people, the march was lined by police officers and people who turned up faced verbal abuse and projectiles. ""By the time we'd got down to Piccadilly, I would say a third of us had got arrested,"" he says. Today, however, Jameson is having a ""wonderful"" time at the parade. Stuart Feather (left), in drag, is bundled into a police car during a gay-rights protest, in 1971 Itâs 1972 â the swinging â60s are over, the minersâ strike has turned off the lights and Donny Osmond is topping the charts with Puppy Love. It will be another 20 years before same-sex attraction is declassified as a mental illness and, despite homosexual acts being decriminalised, in 1967, the age of consent remains five years older than for heterosexual couples. But, in a basement room at the London School of Economics, a revolution is brewing. BBC News has brought together some of those original members who attended the first UK Pride march, in 1972, and some LGBT people from the younger generation - to reflect on how much has changed and how much is still to be done. Read more from original members here. Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes,who recently came out publicly as gay, has shared her excitement at being part of the celebrations for Pride in London. She posted 'let's do this' on social media alongside the hashtag #beingme and a picture of herself wearing a multi-coloured outfit. Dame Kelly became only the third woman in history, and the first Briton since Albert Hill 84 years earlier, to win the 800m and 1500m Olympic double at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

It's not just London that is marking Pride today. People in Shetland have been enjoying their first Pride festival - it's the most northerly celebration of its kind in the UK. People from across the community joined thecolourful event in Lerwick. The event has drawn interest from across the world and visiting drag queens travelled by ferry from Aberdeen to be there. Meanwhile Clacton, in Essex, is also hostingits first Pride eventcoinciding with the 50th anniversary of the movement globally. The free event has been planned since September, with organiser Cheryl Piper admitting she never thought Pride would reach the town.

Raducanu and Leicester fuel Boulter's Wimbledon bid,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Katie Boulter come from a set down to beat Karolina Pliskova Katie Boulter is taking inspiration from Leicester's 2016 Premier League title victory and Emma Raducanu's 2021 US Open win to fuel her Wimbledon run. The 25-year-old takes on France's Harmony Tan, who knocked out seven-time singles champion Serena Williams, at 11:00 BST for a place in the last 16. ""I hope I can take a leaf out of their book,"" said Boulter of Leicester before Saturday's match. ""They were something else. Maybe I can hopefully create that this year."" Leicester defied 5,000-1 pre-season odds to clinch the title ahead of the top-flight's established powerhouses, while Raducanu, ranked 150 in the world at the time, became the the first player to come through qualifying and clinch a Grand Slam title in an astonishing run at Flushing Meadows last year. Emma Raducanu and Leicester City have both inspired Boulter before her meeting with Tan Raducanu was knocked out of this year's Wimbledon on Wednesday, overpowered by Caroline Garcia of France. But Boulter says her Davis Cup team-mate's run in New York has made her reimagine what is possible. ""She came out, she surprised everyone, and she played some fearless tennis,"" said Boulter, ranked 118 in the world. ""That's what's so impressive. I hope I can go out there and do the same thing. I'd love to do what she's done. You never know, one day it might happen."" Norrie 'embracing and enjoying' Wimbledon run Injury lows to Wimbledon highs - who is Katie Boulter? No Grand Slams but Isner aces the records Saturday's order of play Liam Broady is another Briton aiming to join compatriot Heather Watson in the fourth round. The 28-year-old from Stockport defeated 12th seed Diego Schwartzman in five sets and, like Boulter, is competing in the third round of a Grand Slam event for the first time. However, Broady admits that he would understand if, for once, he didn't get his compatriot's support, given he is playing Boulter's boyfriend, Australian 19th seed Alex De Minaur. ""I won't judge her if she sits in 'Demon's' box. She kind of has to, doesn't she?,"" Broady said. ""I know his game pretty well. He's a fantastic player. He's very good on the grass. ""But I fancy myself against anybody, to be honest."" Swiatek is well clear of her rivals in the rankings, with almost twice as many points as world number two Ons Jabeur Top seed Iga Swiatek could extend her winning streak to 38 matches, a total unmatched since German legend Steffi Graf won 66 in a row in 1989-90, if she beats Alize Cornet to make the fourth round. The Polish 21-year-old's last defeat came in Dubai back in February. She has dropped only six sets in her streak since. A two-time French Open champion and an Australian Open semi-finalist earlier this year, Swiatek would equal her best run at Wimbledon by beating French world number 37 Cornet on Court One. But she admitted she is still getting to grips with grass. ""I guess you can see that I'm not playing maybe as efficiently as on other surfaces,"" she said. ""I would play well on grass if I would have kind of more time to just play on this surface. Every year it [the grass court season] is only like four weeks, so I feel it's not enough to learn properly."" In one of the most eagerly anticipated matches of the day, Australian Nick Kyrgios will take on fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas. Kyrgios is ranked 35 places lower the Greek Tsitsipas, but,since memorably knocking out world number one Rafael Nadal on his debut Wimbledon campaign as a teenager, has always carried considerable threat on grass. He also frequently comes with controversy. Kyrgios was fined $10,000 (Â£8,200) for his behaviour in his first-round win where he spat at a spectator and called a line judge a ""snitch"". This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Nick Kyrgios make a series of outbursts during first-round win over Paul Jubb Tsitsipas has seen Kyrgios' antics up close. At the grass-court warm-up event in Halle in June,Kyrgios smashed up his racquet and got into an argument with the umpire over his alleged time-wasting during their match. ""I feel like everyone here knows who Nick is,' Tsitsipas said. ""We have had many great matches against each other. I respect him for his game and the way he fights â¦ when he wants to."" Kyrgios has won three of the pair's four previous meetings.

Pauw reveals rape and assault in Dutch football,"Vera Pauw thanked the Football Association of Ireland for their support in her statement Warning: This story contains some descriptions of sexual assault Republic of Ireland manager Vera Pauw says she was raped and sexually assaulted by three different men involved in Dutch football. The 59-year-old, who played for the Netherlands and managed them for six years, has been the Irish boss since 2019. In a statement released on Twitter, she said: ""For 35 years I have kept a secret from the world, from my family, from my team-mates, my players, my colleagues and, I can now accept, from myself."" She says she was raped by a ""prominent football official"" when she was a young player - and later sexually assaulted by two other men. All three were employed in Dutch football at the time of the incidents, her statement said. In response, the Dutch FA said it had launched an independent investigation in the past, with Pauw's co-operation, and admitted it had made mistakes. ""We acknowledge the errors identified in the report and it should not have happened to her. It is unacceptable that Vera did not experience the safe working environment to which she was entitled at the time,"" it said. Pauw added that she was exposed to systematic sexual abuse, abuse of power, bullying and intimidation in her time in the Dutch set-up as a player and manager. ""For these past 35 years I have kept the abuse private. I have allowed the memory of it to control my life, to fill me with daily pain and anguish, to dominate my inner feelings,"" she said. ""To many I am seen as a brash and loud football coach and manager, a tough woman who has risen to the top in a man's world. Nothing could be further from the truth."" She says she filed five reports to the Dutch FA without getting a satisfactory response so has recently reported the offences to the Dutch police. The Dutch FA said: ""At the KNVB we are very shocked by the experiences from a not recent past that Vera Pauw told us about in a conversation last year."" An independent investigation ""showed that the KNVB should have approached a number of issues differently"". It found that Pauw had been subject to errors and harmful comments from Dutch FA employees and that the KNVB did not respond sufficiently to Vera's first ""first signals in 2011 about sexually transgressive behaviour"" or have the right policies in place. It said that, in a further 2017 conversation about Pauw's experiences, she ""explicitly"" asked them not to take any action. Pauw said: ""That [going to the police] already feels like the beginning of the end for me but I know there will be more heartache to come. Stories may appear in the Dutch media of my horrific ordeal and I know claims may be made against me in an effort to tarnish my story,"" she said. She says she hopes others who have had similar experiences ""will now feel brave enough to come forward and share their stories"". Her statement also asked for ""what is left of my privacy"" and thanked the Football Association of Ireland for its support. ""I have always felt safe and continue to feel safe and supported in Ireland and I cannot tell you how good that feels,"" she said. ""This is who I am, I don't have to hide any more. I hope I can continue my life in freedom."" An FAI statement read: ""The FAI has offered her all the backing she may need on a personal and professional level. ""The FAI is absolutely aware of the impact these revelations will have on Vera's well-being and have assured her of the ongoing full support of the FAI board and all her colleagues at the association."" The Dutch FA said it will take action following the recommendations of the report.

'How could I let this happen to my children?',"Karen Italian Caballero, the mother of two Honduran victims, wipes away tears as she speaks to local media It was 25 June when Karen Caballero was seized by an ""unexplained heaviness"" in her chest. Her children had not been in touch. Two days later, around 8pm, she received a news alert on her cell phone. Dozens of migrants had died of heat inside the back of an abandoned lorry near the city of San Antonio, Texas, a bit over a hundred miles from the US-Mexico border. Panicked, Ms Caballero searched Google and Facebook for the phone numbers of Honduran consulates in the US, hospitals and police stations, to find out if her two sons and daughter-in-law could be among the victims. It was at 2am and no-one was answering. It has since emerged that Margie Paz Grajera, 24; Alejandro Andino Caballero, 23; and Fernando Redondo Caballero, 18 - Ms Caballero's relatives - were among the 53 migrants who died inside the lorry transporting 62 people from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. They died locked inside a trailer with no ventilation as temperatures reached a sweltering 100F (40C). Speaking to the BBC, Ms Caballero asked: ""How, being such an over-protective mother, could I let this happen to my children?"" ""If my children did not return at 8pm at night, I was capable of walking out to look for them until I brought them home."" She has not even had the time to cry, she says, overwhelmed by phone calls from so many family members, friends and journalists. Magdalena Tepaz - whose son Wilmer Tulul, 14, died in Monday's accident - arrives at the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry to recover his body But ""anyone who thinks: 'This woman does not hurt, this woman does not suffer',"" is wrong, she said. ""The truth is that I have to stay strong because I have to figure this out. As a mother, I still have to bring my children home."" Since the gruesome discovery of the worst migrant smuggling tragedy in modern US history earlier this week, the identities of some of the 53 dead in a truck in San Antonio have started to trickle out. They paint a picture of mostly impoverished people from across the region looking to start afresh and seek new opportunities. Mexican authorities said Wednesday that a total of 67 migrants were inside the lorry, while prosecutors in San Antonio have put the number at 64. This video can not be played Migrants honoured at makeshift Texas memorial On Wednesday, the Bexar County medical examiner's office said it had ""potential identifications"" for most of the 53 victims from Monday's incident. The victims have so far included 27 Mexican citizens, as well as 14 Hondurans, seven Guatemalans and two Salvadorans. But because it must work with consulates and other foreign entities, the medical examiner's office said it has so far not made any ""conclusive identifications"". ""A false identification has consequences,"" Tom Peine, a spokesman for the office, told the BBC. ""We are taking great care of this process."" Fernando Redondo Caballero, Alejandro Andino Caballero and Margie Paz were among those who perished Of those who died, 40 were male and 13 were female. Ms Caballero's son Alejandro, his wife Margie and his brother Fernando, left for the US together from Las Vegas, in north-western Honduras. The young couple met when they studied together at an Adventist school in Las Vegas de Santa BÃ¡rbara, a town 125 miles from the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, Ms Caballero said. ""They got married in the school wedding, with paper rings. They were 17 and 18 years old,"" she said. Margie went on to study economics at the Autonomous University of Honduras, and Alejandro enrolled in marketing at the University of San Pedro Sula. Every day they traveled more than 60 miles (100km) from their village to San Pedro Sula, several hours away by bus, to get to the first lessons on time. They stayed in San Pedro Sula to look for jobs, but the best they could find was working as operators in a call centre, Ms Caballero said. She recalled how the young couple celebrated when they bought their first refrigerator. Each appliance, each piece of furniture, reinforced the conviction that they had made the right decision to study at university and dedicate themselves to building a professional career, she said. However, salaries diminished amid economic difficulties driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, and they could not cover rent. They ""had dreams as a couple, they had goals,"" but were unable to find work despite receiving academic degrees, she said. Margie Paz Grajeda studied economics in San Pedro Sula. The family's finances worsened, and Ms Caballero's youngest son, Fernando, was forced to drop out of school amid the lockdown. He told her: ""Imagine, mummy, if there are no jobs here for those who study, what will become of me having not studied?"" He had determined that he would go to the US, she said. Initially, he planned to travel alone, but his older brother and sister-in-law agreed to accompany him. The three collected money from family and looked for people who could get them to the US, as they had no visa, though Ms Caballero would not reveal further details of their planning. She took a taxi to Guatemala with her sons and daughter-in-law to say goodbye. They toured the city of Antigua before continuing on to Mexico. For 20 days they communicated with Ms Caballero through WhatsApp to update her on the news of the trip before losing touch. Questions remain over the identities and circumstances surrounding the deaths of the migrants smuggled alongside Ms Caballero's kin. Three people have been arrested in connection to the operation, and a US federal investigation is under way. Among those who have been provisionally identified among the victims is another Honduran national, Adela Betulia Ramirez, 28, who left the small beach town of Omoa on 26 May, according to her cousin. Family members of Melvin Guachiac, a 13-year-old Guatemalan who died She planned to travel to Los Angeles, where her fiancÃ©, mother and siblings live. Two Guatemalan boys, aged 13 and 14, were also among those to have perished, officials from their home country announced on Wednesday. Pascual Melvin Guachiac and Juan Wilmer Tulul were cousins who left home two weeks ago in order to escape poverty, Pascual's mother was quoted in Guatemalan media as saying. On Monday, just hours before the lorry was discovered abandoned, the teenage relatives had told their family they were headed for San Antonio. Among those who narrowly survived the deadly voyage was Jose Luis Vasquez Guzman, a 31-year-old who began his journey to the US from Cerro Verde, a remote farming community in southern Oaxaca state, in Mexico. An army vet, Mr Guzman suffered dehydration inside the lorry discovered in San Antonio on Monday. He is now being treated at a local hospital. Oaxaca's government is said to be seeking a humanitarian visa for Mr Guzman's mother so she can be by her son's bedside in hospital. Migrants die daily in lorries hot as 'gates of hell' Smuggling 'big business' along US-Mexico border Suspected truck driver in Texas tragedy charged The injured migrant is said to have travelled to the US border with his cousin, Javier Flores Lopez, whose whereabouts are not currently known. The Cerro Verde region has little to no mobile phone service, and family members typically must travel to the town of Nochixtlan, some 37 miles away, to seek information on migrant relatives. Pascual Melvin Guachiac and Juan Wilmer Tulul, who were cousins from Guatamala Mr Lopez called on 19 June to say he had crossed into the US and was hiding in a house in Texas, but he has not been heard from since. Some expressed surprise at their relatives' fates, despite the well-known dangers of the border. Among them was Noel DÃ­az, a US-based Mexican who on Wednesday was at the Mexican consulate in San Antonio working to repatriate his brother's remains to their native Oaxaca. ""The people who were bringing him lied to us,"" Mr Diaz told Mexico's El Universal outlet. ""They never said that he was there [in the truck], but with the news we imagined it. He was supposed to come more comfortably."" JosuÃ© DÃ­az leaves behind a wife and son. Ms Caballero still does not know when the bodies of her sons and daughter-in-law will be repatriated to Honduras. While talking to the BBC, she received a call. ""It's from the presidential palace,"" she said. ""I'll call you back.""

Smuggling 'big business' along US-Mexico border,"A truck crossing the US-Mexico border at Laredo, Texas in January The lure of easy money from human traffickers is sometimes impossible to resist for US truckers operating near the border, according to one ""heartbroken"" Mexican-American driver. ""David"" - who asked to remain anonymous due to the subject's sensitive nature -  said that smuggling migrants ""is a big business"" in southern US states along the border. And he said that that death is a constant in the daily smuggling of migrants across that boundary. One such trip this week ended in tragedy, with 53 migrants found dead in San Antonio, Texas, many of heatstroke and dehydration, after being shut inside a truck in blistering heat without any water. These deaths, David believes, are unlikely to stop. In an interview with the BBC World Service's OS, David - whose own father came to the US illegally from Mexico - said truckers who find themselves ""in a hard place"" in lifeoften accept offers to transport migrants. ""They have to pay for stuff. They have to take care of their families. Sometimes it gets to drastic measures,"" he said. ""Sometimes...it's people that come from Central America. They come to the US and are based here, [but] then the only way they can make money is by transporting people."" Map of possible route David said that he has himself been repeatedly approached with offers - and that he understands the temptation. ""You see when your friends make money, and see how people are on vacation. You wonder why you're so broke,"" he said. ""You start looking around for opportunities and sometimes you get offered a lot of money to do something that is dangerous. Something horrendous, at times. Of course, I'll never take that. I'd never want to risk anybody personal harm."" Migrants die daily in lorries hot as 'gates of hell' 'They'd rather die than return to Nicaragua' In David's case, the recent deadly incident in San Antonio hit particularly close to home. His father was an immigrant who crossed into the US illegally, eventually being given amnesty in the 1980s during the administration of then-US President Ronald Reagan. ""My father cries when he speaks about it. He didn't eat for four days. He ran from border patrol a bunch of times. He had to hide in a garbage bin for nights. It's something very emotional,"" he said. ""He had to go through so much to just get here."" The US border crisis - in four graphs These experiences, David added, are still shared by migrants crossing the border every day. ""It's just horrible, the stuff that happens. People die all the time,"" he said. ""People die of starvation sometimes. People crossing [the Rio Grande,a river that separates the US and Mexico] drown. These people think it's easy to cross over. They come from Guatemala, El Salvador, Bolivia, Mexico. They travel for days and days to get to the border and think it's easy to cross."" According to statistics from the International Organization for Migration, at least 650 migrants died crossing the US-Mexico border in 2021 - the most since it began tracking deaths in 2014. While the recent incident in San Antonio is the deadliest smuggling attempt on record, it is by far not the only mass casualty event at the border. In 2003, for example, 19 people were found dead in a dairy truck. Authorities later said that temperatures rose to 78 C (173 F) in the unventilated vehicle. Survivors later testified that they were forced to crowd around holes they punched in the side of the truck to breathe, and kicked out a signal light in a bid to try get the attention of nearby motorists.  The driver - who they said repeatedly ignored the screams for help and banging - was eventually sentenced to 34 years in prison without the possibility of parole. In another incident in 2017, 39 people were found trapped in a lorry parked near a Walmart in San Antonio. Eight people were found dead at the scene, with another two dying in hospital soon after.

Raducanu & Leicester fuel Boulter before Tan match,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Katie Boulter come from a set down to beat Karolina Pliskova Katie Boulter is taking inspiration from Leicester's 2016 Premier League title victory and Emma Raducanu's 2021 US Open win to fuel her Wimbledon run. The 25-year-old takes on France's Harmony Tan, who knocked out seven-time singles champion Serena Williams, at 11:00 BST for a place in the last 16. ""I hope I can take a leaf out of their book,"" said Boulter of Leicester before Saturday's match. ""They were something else. Maybe I can hopefully create that this year."" Leicester defied 5,000-1 pre-season odds to clinch the title ahead of the top-flight's established powerhouses, while Raducanu, ranked 150 in the world at the time, became the the first player to come through qualifying and clinch a Grand Slam title in an astonishing run at Flushing Meadows last year. Emma Raducanu and Leicester City have both inspired Boulter before her meeting with Tan Raducanu was knocked out of this year's Wimbledon on Wednesday, overpowered by Caroline Garcia of France. But Boulter says her Davis Cup team-mate's run in New York has made her reimagine what is possible. ""She came out, she surprised everyone, and she played some fearless tennis,"" said Boulter, ranked 118 in the world. ""That's what's so impressive. I hope I can go out there and do the same thing. I'd love to do what she's done. You never know, one day it might happen."" Norrie 'embracing and enjoying' Wimbledon run Injury lows to Wimbledon highs - who is Katie Boulter? No Grand Slams but Isner aces the records Saturday's order of play Liam Broady is another Briton aiming to join compatriot Heather Watson in the fourth round. The 28-year-old from Stockport defeated 12th seed Diego Schwartzman in five sets and, like Boulter, is competing in the third round of a Grand Slam event for the first time. However, Broady admits that he would understand if, for once, he didn't get his compatriot's support, given he is playing Boulter's boyfriend, Australian 19th seed Alex De Minaur. ""I won't judge her if she sits in 'Demon's' box. She kind of has to, doesn't she?,"" Broady said. ""I know his game pretty well. He's a fantastic player. He's very good on the grass. ""But I fancy myself against anybody, to be honest."" Swiatek is well clear of her rivals in the rankings, with almost twice as many points as world number two Ons Jabeur Top seed Iga Swiatek could extend her winning streak to 38 matches, a total unmatched since German legend Steffi Graf won 66 in a row in 1989-90, if she beats Alize Cornet to make the fourth round. The Polish 21-year-old's last defeat came in Dubai back in February. She has dropped only six sets in her streak since. A two-time French Open champion and an Australian Open semi-finalist earlier this year, Swiatek would equal her best run at Wimbledon by beating French world number 37 Cornet on Court One. But she admitted she is still getting to grips with grass. ""I guess you can see that I'm not playing maybe as efficiently as on other surfaces,"" she said. ""I would play well on grass if I would have kind of more time to just play on this surface. Every year it [the grass court season] is only like four weeks, so I feel it's not enough to learn properly."" In one of the most eagerly anticipated matches of the day, Australian Nick Kyrgios will take on fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas. Kyrgios is ranked 35 places lower the Greek Tsitsipas, but,since memorably knocking out world number one Rafael Nadal on his debut Wimbledon campaign as a teenager, has always carried considerable threat on grass. He also frequently comes with controversy. Kyrgios was fined $10,000 (Â£8,200) for his behaviour in his first-round win where he spat at a spectator and called a line judge a ""snitch"". This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Nick Kyrgios make a series of outbursts during first-round win over Paul Jubb Tsitsipas has seen Kyrgios' antics up close. At the grass-court warm-up event in Halle in June,Kyrgios smashed up his racquet and got into an argument with the umpire over his alleged time-wasting during their match. ""I feel like everyone here knows who Nick is,' Tsitsipas said. ""We have had many great matches against each other. I respect him for his game and the way he fights â¦ when he wants to."" Kyrgios has won three of the pair's four previous meetings.

Young addict fear as 17-year-old can't stop vaping,"A 17-year-old girl says she smokes up to three disposable vapes as week, equivalent to 135 cigarettes A 17-year-old girl has said she is addicted to vaping and ""can't stop buying them"". Selling e-cigarettes to under-18s is illegal in Wales but the girl, who wanted to remain anonymous, said ""most shops don't ask me for ID"". Charities and trading standards bodies are worried about young people getting addicted and want better enforcement of the rules. The Welsh government said it was ""monitoring"" what more could be done. E-cigarettes are seen as ahealthier alternative,externalfor people who are trying to quit smoking. But there are concerns people can become addicted because they contain high levels of nicotine. One disposable vape is the equivalent of 45 cigarettes, or 20 milligrams of nicotine, the highest legal amount in the UK. How safe are e-cigarettes? How many people vape? Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results The 17-year-old girl said she uses them ""nearly every day if I have one... maybe three or four a week"". ""I would say I'm addicted to them because I can't stop buying them,"" she added. Anti-smoking campaigners say young people are targeted by vape promotions ""I feel quite lightheaded while I smoke them but it goes after a while,"" the 17-year-old said. ""I buy them from corner shops, most shops don't ask me for ID."" The way disposable vapes are marketed towards young people is a problem, according to Suzanne Cass, chief executive of tobacco control action group Ash Cymru. ""This comes down to the marketing of the product and it comes down to enforcement,"" she said. ""So we need more support around enforcement activity around underage sales and we need to take a tighter grip on the marketing of these products to young people."" One disposable vape is the equivalent of 45 cigarettes Ms Cass said vapes were supposed to be ""a smoking cessation tool"", so ""to see them marketed towards young people is a disappointment to us."" The problem has also reached schools in Wales, according to a deputy head teacher in Swansea. Mark Bridgens of Ysgol Gymraeg Bryn Tawe, is worried about what he believes is an increase in young people using disposable vapes. ''In the old days you could smell cigarettes or tobacco,"" he said. ""If you light a cigarette it takes a certain amount of time to disappear. ""With these [vapes] you can have one quick puff, you can keep it in your pocket, you can keep it on you all day and you can't smell it.'' Sixth-form students at the school said vapes were difficult to avoid. Mirain said disposable vapes are young people are getting addicted to vapes Mirain, 17, said: ""You don't question it anymore. If you see someone vaping it's just an extension of their hand. ""It is a fad, but people need to understand that people are getting addicted to them,"" she added. ""They're in people's pockets, they're small, they're in people's pencil cases.'' ''I don't think people realise how much they use them,"" said Dylan, 17. Dylan says many pupils are using disposable vapes ""They can just be thrown away easily and you can buy another one really cheap,"" he added. ""I've seen people as young as 10, maybe 11 years old use vapes,"" said Angharad, 17. ""It's really easy for people to get them."" Angharad said children as young as 10 are vaping A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The sale of e-cigarettes to under-18s has been banned in Wales since 2015 and it is also an offence for anyone to buy e-cigarettes on behalf of a person under 18. ""We continue to monitor trends on the use of e-cigarettes in Wales as well as what more can be done to prevent their use by young people and non-smokers,"" they added. Underage teens sold e-cigarettes and vape liquid E-cigarettes may be offered on NHS in world first 'Young people vape less but still smoke' Underage teens being sold vaping products Vaping on buses 'should be considered' E-cigarettes 'more harmful than we think' Vaping nearly killed me, says British teenager Children 'choose e-cigs over tobacco' Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

Teen murderer turned on Logan's mum after arrest,"This video can not be played The moments Logan Mwangi's killers were arrested. Footage: The Murder of Logan Mwangi - ITV Hub A teenager who was one of three people who murdered Logan Mwangi turned on the boy's mother in a police interview after his arrest, footage has shown. John Cole, 40, Angharad Williamson, 31, and 14-year-old Craig Mulligan were givenlife sentences for murdering five-year-old Logan. His body was found in the River Ogmore, near his home in Sarn, Bridgend county, in July 2021. Some police officers said it was ""one of the worst cases they had worked on"". Mum, stepdad and teen sentenced for boy's murder Why Logan Mwangi's teenage killer can now be named Juror's nightmares after child murder trial Logan was murdered by his mother Williamson, stepfather Cole, andMulligan, who was raised by Cole since he was nine months old. He died after suffering a ""brutal and sustained"" attack at home, which left him with 56 ""catastrophic"" injuries, before his body was dumped like ""fly-tipped rubbish"". Logan Mwangi was a previously ""smiling, cheerful little boy"", the court heard Police footage of Mulligan has come from ITV Hub's The Murder of Logan Mwangi. It shows the teenager - who had moved in with Cole and Williamson just four days before Logan was killed - being interviewed by South Wales Police officers. It showed Mulligan, who was 13 at the time of his arrest, swearing and lying to officers. When interviewed by the police, Mulligan lied and swore at them repeatedly When questioned about theCCTV that showed him and Colewalking in the middle of the night to dump Logan's body in the River Ogmore, Mulligan said: ""I woke up in the middle of the night, then dad [Cole] came into the living room with me. ""I know we weren't meant to do it, but we grabbed some of the rubbish in the back garden and we chucked it in the river - it was all in black bags."" Mulligan told police he didn't know what was in the bags, but that 20 minutes later, he and Cole went back to check whether they had ""gone down"". Logan's body was found 250m from the flat he shared with his family He added: ""We were trying to be as quiet as we could, because we didn't want to wake Logan or Angharad, I don't know whether Logan was there, because we didn't look."" Mulligan then swore repeatedly at officers when referring to Williamson blaming him and Cole for everything, stating they had not done anything and she was saying anything she could to be released. At Cardiff Crown Court, the judge, Mrs Justice Jefford, said Mulligan did not see Logan as a brother and when he was in foster care, he referred to Logan as ""the 5-year-old"" and on more than one occasion said he wanted to kill him. She said there was no doubt this was because Logan was with the family and Mulligan was not. Williamson continued to lie to police, saying if she knew about the injuries she would have taken Logan to hospital Police interview footage also showed the moment Williamson cracked, when asked about the pyjama top officers found, and the damage to it appearing consistent with the struggle and Logan's injuries. Williamson said: ""I don't know about his injuries, if I did I would have taken him to the hospital."" After officers told her they wanted to find the truth, Williamson then said Cole had hit Logan. ""Jay [Cole] hit him three or four times in the stomach because he wouldn't talk, he said the only way this boy understands is pain. I was like 'no, it isn't just stop'. ""He was laughing, saying 'that's a good one isn't it?'. ""Craig hit Logan as well, he swept him, and pushed him to the floor, and he banged his head, Jay [Cole] said he had to do it to get him to listen,"" she said. Hundreds of toys, teddy bears and flowers were left in Pandy Park after Logan's body was found The footage has been made available as police officers spoke of the trauma they experienced while investigating Logan's murder. Response officers had been called to the area by Williamson, who claimed Logan had gone missing. But the call was later revealed to be part of a plot by Williamson, Cole and Mulligan to cover up his killing. The trial earlier this year saw members of South Wales Police give evidence, with some breaking down in tears while recalling the distressing scenes they witnessed. Those who found Logan, including PC Lauren Keen who carried his body out of the river, and paramedics who treated him at the scene were said to be deeply disturbed by what was described by Det Insp Lianne Rees as ""the most traumatic scenes imaginable"". This video can not be played Police found Logan Mwangi's body in a river near his home - he was wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top Investigator and family liaison officer Det Con Clare Edwards recalled how she had gone to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend where Logan had been taken to get a first account from Williamson. She said she took her in to see Logan in a room in the hospital and began to cry as she described seeing a bruise above his left eye. Det Sgt Ed Griffith said it was one of the worst cases he had worked on. He said: ""10 out of 10 on the scale, to be honest, this will live with me forever."" Angharad Williamson, 31, Craig Mulligan, 14, and John Cole, 40, have been sentenced for Logan's murder Iwan Jenkins, deputy chief crime prosecutor for CPS Cymru Wales, said the situation was very traumatic. ""When you see a cold, calculated murder of this nature, it does impact on people, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""This was quite a horrific case with the injuries caused, the planning to dispose the body, the lying to the police previously. ""And while we are pleased that we've been able to bring some form of justice to the situation, the matter remains that we cannot bring Logan back."" Cole was sentenced to a minimum term of 29 years in prison, Williamson will serve at least 28 years, and Mulligan will be detained for at least 15 years.

UK and New Zealand expand working holiday visas,"The UK and New Zealand will allow more younger people to live and work in both countries for longer. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Kiwi counterpart Jacinda Ardern agreed to extend the Youth Mobility and Working Holiday schemes. The age limit for applicants will go up from 30 to 35, and the maximum length of time people can stay in the host country will now be three years. It follows similar deal to allow young people towork and travel in Australia. The UK-New Zealand scheme was previously open to 18-30 year olds. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the move ""will give even more young Brits and New Zealanders the opportunity to develop their skills, make life-long connections and contribute to their host country"". Boris Johnson and Jacinda Ardern met for talks at Downing Street Ms Ardern, who is in London for talks with Mr Johnson, said New Zealand had long advocated for improvements to working holiday visas. The NZ Labour Party leader previously lived in London when she worked in Whitehall as a senior policy adviser before entering politics. ""I was one of many Kiwis to enjoy living and working in the UK, and we look forward to offering Brits the same wonderful experience in New Zealand,"" she added.

Ukraine demands seizure of Russian-flagged grain ship,"A cargo ship carrying grain from a Russian-occupied region of Ukraine has been detained by Turkish customs authorities, according to Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey. Vasyl Bodnar says ""We have full co-operation. The ship is currently standing at the entrance to the port, it has been detained by the customs authorities of Turkey"". We've tracked the Russian-flagged ship, the Zhibek Zholy, on its route from the Ukrainian port of Berdyansk, to Karasu on the Turkish Black Sea coast. It is not clear where its cargo came from or how it was obtained, but Russia has been accused of stealing grain from areas of Ukraine it controls - allegations Russia denies. Tracking where Russia is taking Ukraine's stolen grain Berdyansk is in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, on the Sea of Azov. News of the ship's departure from Berdyansk was announced on social media app Telegram by Yevhen Balytskyi, who was recently appointed by Russia as governor of the occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia. Mr Balytskyi said 7,000 tonnes of grain would be sent to ""friendly"" countries. He added that ships from Russia's Black Sea Fleet would be ""ensuring the security"" of the journey, and that the port had been cleared of sea mines. A Russian Shmel-class gunboat was pictured escorting the Zhibek Zholy He later edited the post, taking out references to the ship's cargo and destination. A video news report about the departure of the ship has also been shared on several pro-Kremlin Telegram channels showing it along with a Russian naval vessel in a harbour, which was identified as Berdyansk by the reporter. A video news report, published on Telegram, shows the Zhibek Zholy before its voyage to Turkey Comparing the video footage with satellite imagery of the port, we have been able to confirm that it was filmed in Berdyansk. The weather conditions in the video and the angle of the shadows along the harbour suggest it was filmed on the morning of 28 June. Some features along the ship's hull, such as its name, were blurred out in the video. But we have confirmed that the ship that left Berdyansk is the same one now lying off the Turkish coast, based on images from the Telegram posts as well as eyewitness accounts given to a Ukrainian shipping expert. The Zhibek Zholy pictured in Berdyansk We have also been able to track the earlier movements of the Zhibek Zholy as it made its way towards Ukraine to pick up its cargo. On 22 June it travelled from Turkey, dropping off its cargo at the Russian port of Novorossiysk.  As it then approached the Ukrainian coast, its tracking signal was lost - suggesting it had been switched off. The signal only reappeared on 29 June as it headed back south away from the Ukrainian coast. This tracker also reports the depth at which the ship lies in the water - and it indicated that the ship had taken on cargo. Michelle Bockmann, a markets editor at Lloyd's List Intelligence, believes this is ""suspicious"" behaviour. She says many cargo ships turn off their trackers for part of their journeys in the Sea of Azov, but most resume their transmissions when they reach their intended port. It's not clear whether the ship intends to unload its cargo in the Turkish port of Karasu or continue its journey south through the Bosphorus Strait to an, as yet, unknown destination. The registered owner of the Zhibek Zholy, a Kazakh-based company called KTZ Express, has told the Reuters news agency that the ship has been chartered by a Russian company. It added that it was consulting the parties involved and would abide by all sanctions and restrictions.
