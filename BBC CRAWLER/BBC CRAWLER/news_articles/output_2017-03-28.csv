'Making my invisible illness visible',"Victoria poses in an backless ball gown revealing her surgery scars ""It's not easy to stand on stage in a bikini in pageants. I have a 25-inch scar that runs down my spine. ""And people can see it... like, really see it."" Victoria Graham, a 22-year-old student from Manchester in the US state of Maryland, had an untraditional journey into the glitzy world of US beauty pageants. She may look like any other contestant at first glance, but Victoria has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) - a rare genetic condition that affects her connective tissues. Recalling her first competition, she says: ""I walked into orientation in a neck-brace, surrounded by all of these gorgeous sky-tall women. ""I looked to my Dad and asked 'What in the world am I doing here?'... It was comical."" This video can not be played Watch: As part of her role, Victoria visits children in hospital Victoria wasn't always so open about her condition. ""Until I left school at 19, I hid my illness from others,"" she says. ""I would rather have my legs dislocate than someone see me in a knee brace."" But she's since realised that speaking out makes her feel empowered - and enables her to help others in the same situation. Victoria grew up practising gymnastics and was told she was ""too flexible"" by her coaches. She became aware something was really wrong after a gymnastics accident when she was 10. ""I'd get injuries that weren't normal - things weren't adding up,"" she says. Victoria's platform is 'But you don't look sick? Making invisible illnesses visible' EDS is notoriously difficult to diagnose, and she spent three years seeing different specialists, trying to pin down the problem. Eventually her family found a geneticist who gave her a diagnosis aged 13. ""It was weird because although there's no treatment and no cure, we were ecstatic because we finally had a name for what was going on,"" she says. It then became apparent that Victoria's condition was inherited - only then did her mother, brother and other family members find out they also had lesser forms of EDS. ""My grandmother lived with EDS for nearly 70 years without knowing and my Mom had it 40 years. ""Nobody should have to live that long before finding out what's going on with them,"" she says. Through her diagnosis, it emerged her mum, Mary Beth, also had a less severe form of the condition Over a two-year period from 2014, Victoria had to undergo 10 operations on her brain and spine. ""I'm fused from skull to my bum -  all the way down,"" she says. ""Because I was able to move so much before, the vertebrae were dislocating themselves. ""I have a limited range of motion now, but I need to be stiff so my brain stem isn't under pressure and my spinal cord isn't being crushed."" Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is the name for a group of rare inherited conditions that affect connective tissue Connective tissues act like a 'glue' to support the skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones Victoria has a severe form of EDS which means she has cranial and spinal instability She also lives with dietary limitations because of how her condition affects her internal organs For more information go visit theEhlers-Danlos Society website,external Victoria's EDS affects a lot of aspects of her body, including blood flow. She says she has to take 20-25 tablets every two hours. Some are for pain relief, but others are supplements to ensure her body keeps functioning correctly. ""I know plenty of girls who are in a near similar situation as me medically who are bed-bound, but I believe lifestyle has a lot to do with your attitude and how you view your situation."" Despite her condition, Victoria has been able to live an ordinary lifestyle Despite the severity of her condition, Victoria finds herself often dismissed and discriminated against because of the invisible nature of her illness. At school she consistently struggled with teachers' unwillingness to make accommodations. And she says she often gets shouted at in public for using a disability parking pass. As part of her efforts to raise awareness and educate people, Victoria now performs a monologue about her condition at pageant competitions. She says she entered her first competition as part of a 'bucket list' deal with a friend after an operation. Victoria talks about her condition at the competitions She won her first local title just months later and now holds Miss Frostburg - a local title within the Miss America Organization. Through this platform she has been able to meet and support other people with EDS. ""Its not always easy, sometimes you want to be normal -  you don't want to be that girl with those scars on stage,"" she says. Despite being only 22, Victoria now runs her own non-profit EDS support group called 'The Zebra Network,external'. ""I was seeing people who were struggling - doctors were often recommended through word of mouth. ""I saw a dire need for a network of sufferers and for someone to dedicate their life to that"" she says. She says her group's goal is to have a global EDS support system ""I know I'm young and its a bold decision to make without a college degree -  but if someone else wasn't doing it, I would be that someone."" She explains the network's name: ""In medical school, doctors are trained to think of the common thing when diagnosing through the phrase, 'When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras.' ""So if a kid has runny nose or a cough they most likely have a cold rather than a rare form of cancer. But those rare things do happen and are often called 'medical zebras'. ""So we say, 'Think zebras, because zebras do exist'."" Despite her confidence now, its been a fraught journey to this point for Victoria. Victoria had to undergo ten major operations within two years At Eastern University in Philadelphia, she was on the soccer and lacrosse teams, but was forced to move colleges to a more flexible programme because of her operations. She says she also lost friends as she went through so many procedures. ""Maybe my illness is something they can't deal with or put up with,"" she says. ""I don't know what the reason is."" She also describes having relationships with boyfriends suffer. Victoria played soccer and lacrosse throughout school and college. ""I try to be very understanding and not take it personally,"" she says. ""You have to think of the other side of things. I think that's one of the ways I've been able to combat the negativity. ""If people are able to be empathetic to my situation in the same way - by recognising some illnesses aren't as obvious as others - it would make it a lot easier."" Video by Maria Chiu.

London attack: Your questions answered,"The attack in Westminster, on Wednesday, 22 March, left four victims dead, dozens injured and millions of people around the world asking why. In the aftermath ofKhalid Masood's assaulton London, the BBC received a number of questions from people concerned about safety and security on our streets. Here, BBC London's home affairs correspondent Nick Beake answers the most popular. Why don't the unarmed police officers at Westminster have protective body gear, stab- or bulletproof vests? And do they carry Tasers? Nick Beake:PC Keith Palmer was an unarmed officer protecting the Palace of Westminster, but Scotland Yard says he was wearing a protective vest at the time of the attack. The force said during the post-mortem examination ""the pathologist could find no obvious evidence of damage or penetration other than the vest having been cut off during emergency first aid at the scene"". Armed officers working at Parliament carry a primary weapon, a sidearm and a Taser. And an unspecified number of armed response vehicles - three firearms specialists in an unmarked car - are on constant patrol in central London. Will the pavement safety barriers removed from nearby London Bridge be restored? Nick Beake:The use of safety barriers varies from location to location. The police, local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public. The mayor of London's office says it is currently considering where more barriers could be installed. Why not build a 6in [15cm] concrete barrier on the bridge pavements to protect pedestrians from the traffic? Nick Beake:An independent review commissioned by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of London to protect pedestrians from a Nice- or Berlin-style attack, where lorries were driven into crowds. The report author, Lord Harris of Haringey, also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events. What is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack? Nick Beake:The current terrorist threat is rated as ""severe"", which means an attack is highly likely. The latest advice from the government is to run away from the danger, hide if that is not possible, and then tell the authorities: ""Run, hide, tell."" More information can be found on thegov.uk website,external. What should we do if we see something suspicious? Nick Beake:If you spot something suspicious, ring the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789 321. And call 999 if you think there is an immediate threat. How do we know if something that seems suspicious is actually terrorism-related? Nick Beake:It can be hard for experienced police and other investigators to establish quickly if a threat is terrorist-related, but the authorities would rather the public contact them with their genuine concerns however small they may be. It's better to be safe than sorry.

A week of beginnings,"Nicola Sturgeon reopened the Holyrood debate, which was halted after the terror attack at Westminster Perhaps it was the gravity of the topic. Perhaps it was the reflection that this resumed debate had been postponed last week because of the terror attack on Westminster. Either way, thedebate on an independence referendumat Holyrood was marked, mostly, by a respectful, modest tone. On Nicola Sturgeon's part, that was a deliberate choice. Ms Sturgeon can mix it with the best. On this occasion, she urged Parliament to pursue its business with ""openness, respect, honesty and understanding"". She went further, quoting the Church of Scotland on the topic of decent discourse. The Kirk, she said, had called for debate which ""informs and inspires"". Not the contrary. In making this pitch, Ms Sturgeon was also borrowing material from a recent party conference address. But since it was her own speech, she can be forgiven. Mind you, there was a touch of steel here too. The first minister's speech featured an oblique warning to the prime minister. Oblique in that the details remain undisclosed. Nicola Sturgeon met Theresa May in a Glasgow hotel yesterday, the Crowne Plaza colloquy. She noted today that she had wished the PM all the very best in pursuing a Brexit deal. Then the sting. If the PM worked with the wishes of the Scottish government (and, after tonight's vote, parliament), then there would be co-operation. If not, then she would return after the Easter recess with an alternative approach. Broadly, what might be involved? A party campaign can be presumed. Motions and debates in Holyrood and Westminster can be taken as read. And more? Ministers reckon that the UK government may need Holyrood consent and support at sundry points during the Brexit process. Presumably, said support will be absent or grudging if UK ministers continue with their refusal even to countenance an independence referendum. Nicola Sturgeon and Theresa May met at a hotel in Glasgow You might call it a work to rule. But would it be effective?  Depends upon the position of the voters.  Scottish ministers believe that their collective endeavour will win public support - and hence UK acquiescence.  UK ministers believe their approach - stick to the Brexit talks, put indyref2 on hold - will win public support and hence defray the SG endeavour. Back to the debate. It was not all honey and ambrosia. As noted, there was an edge to the FM's remarks. And several opposition MSPs, most notably Labour's Johann Lamont, castigated the SNP's ""obsession"", as they saw it, with independence. Many claimed that the ""day job"" - education, the NHS, the economy - was being neglected. Ruth Davidson, leading for the Tories, was perhaps the most openly acerbic.  She said that the Scottish people would find the SG recipe unpalatable. ""It stinks"", she said bluntly. There were expressions of horror in the chamber, some of them genuine, when Ms Davidson declined to accept a repeat intervention from the FM, advising her to ""sit down.""  Perhaps aware this was a little blunt, Ms Davidson then explained she had already permitted Ms Sturgeon to intervene - and had heard quite enough. But then Ms Davidson also argued that blunt comment was by no means confined to her party.  She recalled that the Tory benches had been harangued by a Scottish minister when the session was suspended last week. For her part, Labour's Kezia Dugdale mirrored the FM in calling for ""civility and decency"", chiding the Conservative leader in the by-going. Ms Dugdale's approach was pained and passionate.  A referendum was wrong, she argued, adding: ""We are divided enough"". Andy Wightman of the Greens noted that there was a section of the Scottish public which viewed the prospect of indyref2 with dismay. But he argued that Brexit without Scottish consent, particularly hard Brexit, changed the terms and merited support for a further independence referendum. Alex Cole-Hamilton of the Liberal Democrats opened with a confession. His attempt at an ad lib - ok, rehearsed - speech last week had been less than successful. He had dried, as the news of the Westminster terror attack filtered through. Resorting studiously to notes on this occasion, he delivered an encomium for two Unions, that of the EU and that of the UK.  He would fight to reverse Brexit.  But, he argued, one did not fix Brexit by breaking the UK. This is a week of beginnings. The start of Britain's extended departure from the UK on Wednesday. The publication on Thursday of a White Paper presaging the Bill which will repatriate legal powers to the UK, and thence to the devolved administrations. Of which, more later. And the start today at Holyrood of a campaign to persuade and press the prime minister to concede a referendum upon Scottish independence.

'I was sterilised against my will',"After an emergency caesarean, Victoria Vigo found she had been sterilised - despite not having given her consent. Like many others who endured the same treatment, she is demanding justice. ""I wanted to have more children, but that choice was taken away from me without my permission - that was my decision to make not theirs."" In April 1996, mother-of-two Victoria Vigo was living in the hot, coastal city of Piura in north-western Peru. ""I was 32 weeks pregnant and I wasn't feeling very well, so I went to see my doctor,"" she says. ""He sent me to hospital where I ended up in accident and emergency. They evaluated me and decided to carry out an emergency caesarean."" Vigo's baby was born with breathing difficulties, his premature lungs weren't properly developed and he died soon after. ""There was a doctor trying to console me saying: 'Don't worry, you are still young, you can have another baby.'"" But Vigo, who was then aged 32, then overheard another doctor say: ""No, she can't have any more children, we've sterilised her."" Vigo is just one of around 300,000 people estimated to have been sterilised against their will in Peru between 1996 and 2000, when then-president Alberto Fujimori embarked on a family planning programme known as Voluntary Surgical Contraception, part of an anti-poverty drive. In 1997, Vigo began her fightback against the authorities. ""It wasn't just about my rights, I soon realised that this was part of a national policy and there were many other women involved,"" she says. ""This was going on all over Peru with doctors making decisions without properly consulting the women involved."" After years of legal disputes Vigo eventually won her case and was awarded damages of approximately Â£2,000 in 2003. She is the only person in Peru who has received any form of compensation after being forcibly sterilised. The men and women targeted under the sterilisation programme were usually poor, indigenous Quechua-speakers, many of whom signed a piece of paper written in Spanish that they didn't understand. Fujimori had said it would be a progressive plan offering a wide range of contraceptive methods, including surgical sterilisation, which had previously been illegal in Peru. ""But the truth is that instead of promoting a range of contraceptive methods there were targets, quotas and numbers of sterilisations that the health personnel had to achieve,"" says Rosemarie Lerner, director of theQuipu project,external, which collects and shares the testimonies of people like Vigo who were forcibly sterilised in 1990s Peru. Quipus were an ancient recording system of threads and knots used by the Incas and ancient Andean cultures to keep records. ""We have chosen the Quipu to symbolise this project because we too are recording oral information, prompting our collective memory to ensure that the sterilisations are not forgotten,"" the project's website says. Under the Quipu project, people across Peru can use a free telephone line to share their stories, listen to the testimonies of others and record responses. Once recorded, the messages are translated into Quechua, Spanish and English and uploaded to the project's website where they can be listened to from anywhere in the world. This video can not be played 'I woke up hours later. There was a cut across my belly' - hear one woman's testimony Lerner's team have been running workshops around the country to show people how to use the Quipu project website and telephone line to submit their stories. The team are currently collecting testimonies in the Amazon jungle. Last year they were in remote Andean communities. ""Most of the stories have a common structure,"" she says. ""How the sterilisation campaign started, how the nurses or medical personnel came looking for women in their houses, then the actual moment of the operation and how traumatic it was - some women were even sterilised while pregnant."" There are testimonies from women who describe being coerced into being sterilised in return for food or medicine. Many say the often botched operations - some of which were carried out without general anaesthetic - have left them so badly injured they are unable to work. Offered no aftercare, the women describe feeling marginalised because they can no longer work and believe they have no societal value since they can no longer bear children. Many describe how their relationships have deteriorated or fallen apart. Talking about the forced sterilisations is still considered taboo for many in Peru, but Lerner hopes that the Quipu project will help challenge attitudes. ""We want the women who take part in the Quipu project to understand that they're not alone,"" she says. ""Thousands of them went through the same experience and they deserve to be heard."" In 2003, three years after Fujimori was forced from power, Peruvian prosecutors began investigating allegations of forced sterilisations. Since then a number of investigations have been opened and then shelved - the most recent was shelved for a second time in December 2016 when the court said there wasn't enough evidence to proceed. The former president is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence for embezzlement and human rights abuses committed during his decade-long time in office. Hear more about the Quipu project onOutlookon the BBC World Service Get the Outlook podcast But most of those who were sterilised are still waiting for justice. Vigo acknowledges that she probably succeeded in suing for damages because unlike most of the other people who were sterilised against their will she is middle class, educated and speaks Spanish. Despite the compensation she has already received, Vigo says that she and the others still need recognition. ""We want to get proper compensation, but it's not just about the money. We need proper justice for what has happened,"" she says. ""It was racist to think you can target the poorest and most vulnerable members of society and make decisions for them. How is it possible to treat women like that in the 21st Century? They violated our human rights and our right to decide our future for ourselves.""

Rescue dog's journey from stray to saviour,"This video can not be played Katie the stray has found her vocation as a therapy dog Katie's start was as rough as they get. She spent a year as a stray in the Irish countryside and was seriously emaciated by the time she was rescued. But now Katie is making a huge difference to people recovering from injuries in hospital. They get better faster, out of hospital sooner and are less likely to need social care, according to the team at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust in London. So how is she doing it? And should every hospital have a pet pooch? The first thing you notice is Katie is like a glamorous celebrity. When she walks on to the ward at St Michael's Primary Care Centre in London, the patients only have eyes for her. Everyone here is having occupational and physiotherapy to help them deal with fractures, surgery, early stages of dementia or multiple sclerosis. The sessions are aimed at increasing their range of movement - how far they can walk, how many steps they can make, how far they can reach. Kathleen is being helped to get back on her feet after breaking three bones Kathleen Edwards is a charismatic 92-and-a-half-year-old with nerve damage and numbness in her feet. She tripped and broke three bones. ""I didn't enjoy myself at all,"" she told me. When she's not craftily sneaking mints to Katie - ""she loves them"" - Kathleen's sessions are aimed at getting her on her feet again. She said: ""I just did some walking, and she [Katie] walked with me, she makes me feel quite happy, it's just fun. ""She's a beauty she really is, I just love her, we never had dogs, and she makes you feel 'Aah.' ""I shall want to take her home."" Martin Ross strokes and brushes Katie to help his stroke recovery Katie has a similar effect on Martin Ross, 58, who is regaining movement after a stroke. His sessions are aimed at arm movement and reaching down, which will eventually help with putting on socks and shoes. His sessions involve stroking and brushing Katie. He said other recovery clinics were ""more like work, and this isn't as you're actually enjoying yourself"". He said: ""I was stretching a lot more and not even realising what I was doing and just enjoying time with the dog. ""Spending time with Katie makes you happy."" Kathleen and Martin illustrate the two main benefits Katie brings - she makes people happy, more social and makes them push themselves further. Katie is helping occupational therapists help their patients Marianne Welsh, senior occupational therapist, said: ""It's lovely, we see a lot of physical improvements, but also you can see she lifts the mood. ""Rehab is hard for our patients, they've got pain and often anxieties about not being at home or they're fearful for the future. ""She enables them to progress without realising, so they'll spend more time reaching forward, bending down further, mobilising further because they're focused on Katie."" And this is important - recovering the movements that let them get washed, dressed, out of bed or go to the toilet allows people to live independently. ""That helps us reduce the referrals to social services for care,"" said Marianne, who is also Katie's owner. Katie had needed a lot of tender loving care herself after she had first been rescued, but had also been a ""very adoptable dog"", Marianne said. And she had immediately thought Katie had the temperament to train for Pets as Therapy. It's a long journey from being a stray in Ireland and ""when the patients hear her history, there's a bit of an affinity there"", Marianne added. The personal experience of the medical staff suggests Katie is helping. ""Pet-assisted therapy has made a huge difference in trying to get patients out of hospital,"" said Kavita Shastri, a senior physical therapist. The clinic has been interviewing patients, and their answers also suggest having Katie around is boosting their recovery. But what is still lacking is concrete scientific proof. Kavita told me: ""It's unfortunate that the research around this is not that huge. ""Unfortunately in the UK there's not a lot of randomised clinical trials and specific research to objectify this and I think that's what's really required."" But at St Michael's Primary Care Centre at least, they're all convinced dogs could have a big role in NHS care.

Reality Check: Will the UK pay a â¬60bn 'divorce bill'?,"The claim:The UK's ""divorce bill"" from the European Union could be as high as â¬60bn (Â£52bn). Reality Check verdict:Yes, it could. Is that likely to be the final figure? Almost certainly not. The battle over the money will begin with legal arguments but will end with hard-nosed politics. To get to any potential figure you have to work out a value for all the EU's liabilities - the money it owes - at the point that the UK is likely to leave. Then you subtract the value of the EU's assets, and decide what percentage of the balance is the responsibility of the UK. One way of calculating this percentage is to use the UK's average share of EU budget contributions, which is roughly 12%. Alternatively, the European Commission might argue that the UK's share should reflect the size of its economy, which gives a figure closer to 15%. The commission's negotiating team has made no public comment on how it intends to calculate the cost of the divorce agreement, but there is certainly a way to get to a figure of â¬60bn. Some officials have said this is likely to be the initial figure that the commission will put on the negotiating table. If they do put forward that figure, the biggest part of the bill would be made up of the UK's share of what is known as the reste a liquider (RAL), which is, in effect, the EU's credit card bill. This is money that has already been committed by the EU, for which the bills have not yet been paid. By the end of 2018, it is estimated, the RAL will be more than â¬240bn, so the UK's share would be substantial. Another large chunk of the potential bill is made up of money due to be spent over the next few years, much of it on big infrastructure projects in poorer EU countries. In the commission's view, the UK has already made a legally binding promise to fund this investment, even if it happens after the UK has left. The third big item on the agenda is the cost of pension benefits for EU officials. The current total liability is â¬63.8bn, and the commission will expect the UK to pay its share. But if the UK has to take its share of liabilities, it is also entitled to a share of the EU's various assets, which were worth â¬153.7bn at the end of 2015. Some of those could be used to offset the liabilities, including EU buildings, satellites, and even a rather nice wine cellar. Some Brexit supporters, not in government, say that the UK should pay nothing, and they point to legal opinion that backs them up. AHouse of Lords report,externalconcluded that Article 50 allowed the UK to leave the EU without being liable for outstanding financial obligations under the EU budget, in the event of no deal. And the campaign groupLawyers for Britain argues,externalthat it is hard to see any credible basis upon which the UK would be obliged to make net payments towards EU pensions or ongoing budget programmes. Instead, it says, the UK should seek the return of money it has paid to the European Investment Bank, which is worth â¬9bn. All the figures in the divorce negotiations are likely to be contentious and contested. Speaking on a special edition of BBC Question Time, Brexit secretary David Davis said he had seen no explanation for the â¬60bn figure. He said the UK would ""meet our international obligations, but we expect also our rights to be respected too"". ""I don't think we're going to be seeing that sort of money change hands."" The figure of â¬60bn may be politically unrealistic, but the rest of the EU will not agree a deal under which the UK  walks away without paying anything. The UK could, of course, leave without any deal, although that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has said: ""If we do have any bills that fall to be paid we will obviously deal with them in the proper way."" If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years (as pensions become payable for example), the amounts involved may not be that significant economically. But this is an issue that has the potential to cause bitter political fights. Read more from Reality Check UK 'not obliged' to pay Brexit bill Reality Check: A nasty divorce from EU?

The man who breathed life back into Broadway,"A Chorus Line remains one of musical theatre's most popular shows It's 30 years since director and choreographer Michael Bennett, the man behind Broadway classic A Chorus Line, died aged 44. Donna McKechnie, a star of the show who went on to marry Bennett, recalls the unusual way he created the musical - and how it breathed life back into Broadway. Still an admired Broadway dancer, McKechnie has been in London singing and dancing in the musical The Wild Party.  She's delighting audiences at an age when her contemporaries have swapped dancewear for something more comfortable. Asked to recall the very beginnings of A Chorus Line under director Michael Bennett, she laughs. ""Michael said he wanted to do a show about dancers. I told him he needed to hurry and get the thing done if I was going to be in it - my career wasn't going to last forever and I didn't want to be on a walking cane!  At the time I was around 32."" Donna McKechnie carries on performing and is in London for The Wild Party McKechnie was involved in A Chorus Line from the beginning. ""And if it isn't quite like any other show, that's because the way we developed it was so original. And 'we' means Michael and the dancers: it was always totally a dancers' show."" McKechnie and Bennett married in 1976, the year after A Chorus Line opened to huge acclaim and box office success. Although the marriage didn't last, she still talks of him with affection and huge admiration for his talent. ""Michael knew he wanted to be in charge. A Chorus Line was his big directorial project, taking a realistic look at the dancer's life he knew so well. ""Originally it was based on two extraordinary sessions of interviews with dancers all recorded on an old-fashioned tape-recorder.  Those sessions changed all our lives."" Michael Bennett was widely seen as the great Broadway choreographer of his generation A Chorus Line is high-energy on stage but McKechnie recalls its unglamorous origins.  The first of the late-night recordings were made at an exercise studio on 3rd Avenue Manhattan. ""We sat around in a circle and we talked about our lives, starting with Michael.  There were three essential questions: say your name, say where you were born and why did you start dancing?  And that set everybody off on their stories."" Some of McKechnie's own explanation of how she became a dancer is still in the show in the song The Music And The Mirror. ""When I hear it performed now I still recognise things I said more than 40 years ago.  My father had been away in the military and at home as a young girl I used to dance around with my arms in the air as I thought of him. Donna McKechnie (right) had a reunion with fellow original cast members Priscilla Lopez (left) and Baayork Lee (centre) ""I used to envision dancing with an Indian chief and my mother saw me and decided to send me to dance class to be a ballerina.  I loved it: Detroit wasn't exactly full of culture so those classes saved my life I think."" McKechnie says she didn't find taping the interviews difficult.  ""For anyone like me who'd been in analysis it felt quite familiar. ""I'd undertaken group therapy and in a way the whole thing was therapeutic.  In fact when I went along I didn't expect to participate. I thought I was just there to help Michael feel comfortable. ""But as we all started to talk it was so exciting.  I realised we didn't know the half of what friends were holding inside or dealing with. ""And the amazing thing is that Michael then took the tapes to the Public Theater in New York to see if the boss Joe Papp thought we had a show.  And after he'd heard only a few minutes Joe said yes.  It really fit his agenda for the theatre - and he smelt a hit."" McKechnie fought her way back from career-threatening rheumatoid arthritis Michael Riedel is theatre columnist for the New York Post.  When he wrote about Broadway history in his book Razzle Dazzle he listened to some of the original Chorus Line tapes. ""At the start you hear Michael Bennett say he didn't yet know if the project would be a play or a movie or a TV series.  But even then he had the title A Chorus Line - which actually was the discarded name of a play he directed earlier."" Riedel says Bennett's show came at a crucial time for New York.  ""By the mid-1970s Broadway was starting to flounder and so was the city. ""The 1960s rock revolution had changed everything and new musicals were mostly doing mediocre business or they simply tanked.  Times Square had become the preserve of pimps and prostitutes and drug-pushers. ""Many theatres were dark and the Shubert Organisation, which dominated the industry, was on the verge of bankruptcy.  Then this huge hit - which eventually ran 15 years - emerged from a small non-commercial theatre downtown. ""Somehow it caught the moment and when it transferred to the Shubert Theatre on Broadway people started to flock back to Times Square.  It was the Hamilton of its day.  I don't think any show has ever been so vital to the New York economy."" McKechnie says in rehearsal the atmosphere remained intense.  ""Everybody on stage just gave and gave and gave.  We were like siblings: there was a lot of resistance and a lot of competition, with Michael shaping and guiding. ""Even people who'd been in the workshops had to audition for Joe Papp and for the composer Marvin Hamlisch.  Some of us were reading back our own lines so that was a strange moment! ""So finally we come to the first preview and the audience is faced with a very confessional show on a bare stage with just one white line across.  It's only at the end that the incredible lighting and the thrilling music created an irresistible climax as big hidden mirrors emerged from black velour. ""At the end there was near silence from the audience and we all thought they hated us. But they were choked with emotion and suddenly they just exploded. ""The show was hard to play both physically and emotionally: it was like running a marathon.  There's a line in the script which came from one of Michael's original questions - what would you do if you can't dance any more? ""No-one had an answer because most dancers are in denial about that and just don't want to go there. ""It was an amazing thing to be part of but it became Chorus Line fever after a while and I knew I needed to get out and do something else."" After the marriage break-up, McKechnie was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, which threatened to end her career.  She struggled back to health and in 1986 even rejoined the cast of A Chorus Line.  She considers that her greatest personal victory. The following year Bennett died of Aids.  He'd been widely seen as the great Broadway choreographer of his generation and McKechnie thinks he could have gone on to even greater things. ""But I learned on Chorus Line to relish the moment you're in as a performer because it can end any moment - especially for a dancer. ""I've done good shows before and since but to have been intimately involved in creating a classic and to have performed in it night after night - that's what the little girl in Detroit, Michigan dreamed of.""

British expats fear for their rights post-Brexit,"The majority of British expats in Finland live in Helsinki The triggering of Article 50 sets Britain on course to quit the European Union - but where does that leave Britons currently working in EU countries such as Finland? Let's start with a few facts about Finnish grammar (hang on in there, the relevance is coming). Finnish has 15 different cases, meaning that there is a different word for ""building"" according to whether you are on your way to it, coming from it, or perhaps stuck inside it. Finnish is also fiendishly difficult for foreigners to pronounce, with a subtle difference between for example ""tuli"" meaning fire, and ""tuuli"" meaning wind. ""I tried learning it, but gave up after two years,"" one British resident of Helsinki tells me. Another had persisted longer, and proudly explained he was now able to argue with his father-in-law. ""But I couldn't pass an exam in Finnish - no way."" Yet facing an exam is now a distinct possibility for the estimated 5,000 British people who have made Finland their home. Invoking Article 50 triggers the UK's withdrawal from the EU Until now, they have been able to live and work freely in the country, as members of the European Union. But with the triggering of Article 50, the UK appears to be on an irreversible path to quitting, leaving the status of British expats unclear. Long-term residents, particularly those with Finnish husbands or wives, can apply for Finnish citizenship. But that requires them to pass a language exam. And those with fewer ties feel their situation to be even more precarious. ""We don't know what the future is,"" Paul tells me. He's been in Finland since 1999, and works in IT. ""Do we need to get a visa to work in Europe? Nobody knows."" We are speaking in The Woolshed, a bar in central Helsinki frequented by the local British population. And when I raise the topic of Brexit, the pub high spirits swiftly disappear. Graham Mackie, from Peterhead, near Aberdeen, has just passed the 10-year mark as a resident here and is in a fiery mood. ""I am shocked and stunned. I've had no guarantee for me to stay,"" he says. ""We are being used as bargaining chips."" Mr Mackie is referring to the British government, and its apparent ""commitment issues"". The people who will negotiate Brexit Brexit: All you need to know What is Article 50? A guide to what happens now The prime minister has refused to say whether foreign EU citizens will be allowed to remain in the UK after Brexit. Theresa May has made it clear she thinks it would be foolish to offer any such guarantees, unless other EU states make a reciprocal promise to let Britons stay. The ties between the UK and Finland go back a long way. It was in the 14th Century that tar derived from Finnish pine trees was bought by Britain to use in its burgeoning shipbuilding industry. That commercial relationship continues, with several billion euros' worth of goods traded every year, particularly healthcare products, chemicals and machine tools. Yet until future trade negotiations are settled between Britain and the EU, it is also a matter of conjecture whether imports and exports can continue so easily. Garry Parker, who chairs the British and Commonwealth Chamber of Commerce in Helsinki, says there will be a cost to business It has been left to Garry Parker, who chairs the British and Commonwealth Chamber of Commerce in Helsinki, to offer local business people advice. ""They need to plan ahead,"" he says. ""What do they do with contracts? What do they do with employment?"" Asked what the prospects are, Mr Parker is disarmingly frank. ""There'll be a massive cost to business. I'd like to say I'm optimistic, but when it comes to the negotiators and who we've got, I'm not so sure."" Britain's decision to leave the EU has been greeted by many Finns with bewilderment. Their own country's accession to membership in 1995 was seen as a decisive shift away from Russian influence and into Western Europe's embrace. Finns Party minister Pirkko Mattila doesn't see why British people should have to leave if they love Finland Yet the country does have its eurosceptics, notably the Finns Party, which is a member of the current coalition government. When I speak to one of the party's ministers, Pirkko Mattila, she insists Britons currently resident in Finland have nothing to fear. ""I don't see why they should leave after Brexit, if they love Finland."" But when pushed on what would happen if Britain does not let EU citizens stay, her reassurances sound a little more qualified. ""It depends on the case. If a person in Finland has a job, then we cannot force them to leave."" Janet Ahola has no desire to leave Finland. Married to a Finn, with a son, a dog and a large house in the suburbs, she looks very much at home as she serves me a traditional Finnish cake - along with a very English cup of tea. What scares Janet is that if she did have to return to the UK, her son and husband might face difficulties of their own. Both have Finnish passports, and so they in turn might not be allowed to work. ""Everyone talks about trade, but what about the little people and what will happen? ""I'm just one tiny person in an enormous deal that's being done. ""Nothing is a given, and nobody can tell us.""

Japan turns to Basil Fawlty for Olympic English,"Fawlty Towers is helping prepare Japan for English-speaking Olympic visitors Japan is struggling to make sure it has enough proficient English speakers when it hosts the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020. And the classic BBC comedy series Fawlty Towers is being deployed by some teachers in an attempt to give Japanese students an example of spoken English - rather than focusing on written language and grammar. Japan's government and businesses want to use the Olympics to boost tourism and global trade and to present a positive image of Japan to the world. So the government needs to ensure a supply of English speakers to be Olympic volunteers and work in the accommodation, tourism, and retail industries. There is also a demand for professionals, such as doctors and nurses, to speak to visitors or competitors in English. The Olympics in Tokyo will require many more English speakers to help visitors Japan's government has been working to bridge this English language gap. The subject is now taught in school from when students are eight or nine years old and remains compulsory for the next seven years. University students and school teachers have been sent on trips abroad to learn English, and many universities are giving language lessons to prospective Olympic volunteers. There are even proposals to create an ""English village"" in Tokyo, populated entirely by English-speakers, where learners could immerse themselves in the language. But early indications are that progress has been slow, and the country still comes surprisingly far down global rankings of English proficiency. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. The BBC'sEnglish language learning services are available here. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. Japan is 40th out of 48 countries on the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC), and last year it fell from ""moderate proficiency"" to ""low proficiency"" on EF's English Proficiency Index. So why is learning English so difficult for the Japanese? Megumi Tada, an education expert at Hirosaki University, said the main reason is ""the lack of teachers who can effectively use the language"". When the Kyoto Board of Education asked middle school English teachers to take the TOEIC, fewer than one in four teachers reached the threshold for language skills good enough for most social demands and limited work requirements. Japan has been investing in improving its language skills at school and for adults Ms Tada said that although the government has now introduced English in primary schools, most of the teachers in these schools are not qualified to teach the language. She said a better way to improve English teaching would be to increase the number of trained teachers in primary and secondary schools, and to train them for longer. There are also questions about the way English is taught in schools. The focus tends to be on grammar, vocabulary and writing, which are repeatedly tested in high-pressure exams. As a result, English is rarely spoken in Japanese classrooms. Junnosuke Nakamura, who leads the education company EF in Japan, has said that ""too often in our schools, a Japanese national is teaching English in Japanese, and English must be taught in English"". He said the government's reforms ""have not actually changed anything at a fundamental level"". Helen Bentley says learners in Japan are more confident writing rather than speaking English Helen Bentley, from communications firm Finsbury, worked on Tokyo's Olympic bid. ""There are relatively few opportunities to use spoken English in Japan,"" she said. ""As a result, many Japanese are much stronger at reading and writing than they are at speaking."" There are teachers trying a more imaginative approach to getting students to speak English - such as setting them comedies to watch for homework. Teachers in Fukuoka Prefecture have been using Fawlty Towers and Red Dwarf to get students used to hearing spoken English. It raises the prospect of a generation of Japanese students sounding like Basil, Sybil or even Manuel. Is the culture of perfectionism in Japan a barrier to learning languages There is also a barrier from a culture of perfectionism in Japanese education, with a belief that there is a ""right"" way to do something. Students do not want to make mistakes and they will not attempt something until they are sure they can get it right. This might be a good thing for literacy and numeracy - Japan comes consistently near the top of global rankings such as PISA. But it does not work so well for languages, for which speaking and making mistakes are crucial to learning. Language learners have to be ready to make mistakes Fumiko Inoue, who lectures in Japanese language and cross-cultural management at Rotterdam Business School, pointed to the experience of one of her Dutch students who taught English in a school in Tokyo. At first, the new teacher was surprised that students were reluctant to speak English in class, but after a lot of encouragement she got them to chat to each other in the language. That is, until she was observed by a senior teacher who criticised her students for making too many grammatical mistakes. ""If you don't say anything, you don't make any mistakes either, of course,"" said Prof Inoue. This teaching style can have lifelong effects on how Japanese people approach the English language. ""We Japanese have a strong psychological barrier to speaking English,"" said Kumiko Iwasaki, a professor of psychology and education at the Open University of Japan. ""We have an obsession that we have to speak English perfectly.""

'My baby died while we slept on the sofa',"This video can not be played Dawn Barclay's daughter, Fern, died in 2014 As many as half of all babies in England have slept in the same bed as their parents by the time they are six months old. In some instances, including cases where parents have fallen asleep on a sofa, it has resulted in tragedy. TheVictoria Derbyshire programmehas discovered that many parents who co-sleep are so fearful about being judged they are not telling health visitors about it. Experts say they are concerned that as a result guidance on how to minimise the risks of co-sleeping is not being passed on. Dawn Barclay, from Forfar, recalls the first few weeks of her baby Fern's life. It was 2014, and Dawn says lying next to Fern was the only way her daughter would sleep. ""I'd do it the safest way possible. I would remove the pillows, she would be on her back, with my hand on her chest. ""No-one else - husband or other child - in the bed with us. To have her close was just the most natural thing in the world."" Tragically, Dawn took a nap one morning with her eight-week-old daughter on the sofa. She woke to find Fern had stopped breathing. ""She woke up and had a feed, and we both had fallen back asleep, but we were lying on the couch."" Dawn cried for help as soon as she knew something was wrong. Fern's death was attributed to ""sudden unexpected death in infancy associated with co-sleeping"" ""The fear that I had done something to her was one of the first things to go through my mind, I didn't understand what else was going on apart from the fact that I thought I'd killed my baby. ""I remember lifting her up and just running through to Andy, and screaming that she was gone."" Dawn said her husband started doing CPR. ""I thought he'd managed to bring her back. He managed to get the colour to come back in her cheeks,"" she says. But Andy was unable to resuscitate Fern. ""I just remember falling to the ground and just screaming,"" Dawn says. Nine months later, following a coroner's report, it was discovered that Fern had suffered damage on her brain from birth that might have stopped her breathing. Her death certificate was changed from inconclusive to ""sudden unexpected death in infancy associated with co-sleeping"" - a ruling Dawn still believes is unfair. Co-sleeping with babies is a sensitive subject, with many parents feeling it is natural, or that the only way to get their children to sleep is by lying in the same bed with them. However, the official advice is that there is an increased risk of infant death while sharing a bed. In the UK, just under 300 babies die of sudden infant death syndrome (Sids) in their sleep every year,according to the NHS,external. Potential dangers include babies falling out of bed, getting overheated under a duvet, or being suffocated by their parents, pillows or loose bedding. The Department of Health recommends the safest place for a baby to sleep in the first six months is in a cot in the same room as the parent or carer. And in 2014, NICE updated its recommendations about co-sleeping, to say that although Sids is rare, it does happen more often when parents co-sleep. The NCT antenatal group,externalsays parents who co-sleep should make sure their baby cannot fall out of the bed, or become trapped in any way. They should use sheets and blankets rather than a thick duvet, and make sure bedding never covers a baby's face or head. Babies should be kept away from pillows, and experts say parents should never fall asleep with a baby on a sofa or armchair. Shona Haigh, a first-time mother, co-sleeps with her four-month-old daughter Ava. She says her friends encourage her to get her daughter to sleep in a cot - but Ava simply cries when she is left alone. ""She starts kind of choking herself and coughing and she's clearly not happy. I'd much rather my baby be happy in my arms while I'm awake and happy with me in bed while we're sleeping."" She say Ava sleeps in a sleeping bag with her mum and dad on either side of her. ""It is completely natural for us to want our babies next to us and for our babies to want to be next to their mothers,"" she says. She says she has been given ""no advice"" about how to co-sleep safely. ""It was a brushed-off conversation,"" she says. ""I had no information from my health visitor and midwife. She told me that they wouldn't give me any information because they don't want you doing it."" Shona co-sleeps with her four-month-old daughter Ava Elaine McInnes, who advised NICE, says advice on co-sleeping is not reaching parents. She says some parents still feel ""judged"" about co-sleeping and often lie to health visitors if they are doing it. As a result, she said, guidance about how to minimise the risks of co-sleeping isn't getting across. The problem is exacerbated by falling numbers of health visitors working in the UK, she adds. Meanwhile, Dawn - who has since had a baby girl named Faye - says her ""entire chest aches"" every time she thinks about Fern's death. Her death led Dawn to isolate herself from her friends and the majority of her family. She hopes speaking out about co-sleeping will raise awareness. ""It can happen to anyone,"" she explains. ""Anyone can get a leaflet with guidelines about how your baby should sleep, but I think putting a face to it [makes people realise] it does happen, it's still tearing families apart.""

How an ambulance became a place for safe sex,"A second-hand ambulance has been converted into a place where sex workers can meet their clients in Copenhagen. The aim is to help people at risk of violence and exploitation and it is the latest in a long list of ideas by a Danish social entrepreneur. Michael Lodberg Olsen invites me into an old ambulance, long out of service. ""So what happens in here?"" I ask. ""Sex,"" he quickly answers, eyes flashing with laughter. It's not very inviting as I step inside. It still looks very medical - grey walls, blue seat. And it's cold - it's -1C and snowing outside. But this old ambulance - called ""Sexelance"" - is a safe space for Copenhagen's sex workers. They can bring clients here with the knowledge that volunteers are around to step in if things get ugly. And the stats show that often things do. ""Sex workers in Denmark are violated or threatened 45% of the time, but at a brothel this figure is only 3%,"" Michael says, using figures from the Danish National Centre for Social Research. Social entrepreneur Michael Lodberg Olsen has started numerous projects It's the sex workers plying their trade on the streets - who cannot afford to use an illegal brothel - that Michael aims to help. Sexelance is free to use, as while prostitution has been legal in Denmark since 1999, it is still against the law for sex workers to rent rooms or hire any help for their business. As well as human volunteers for protection, inside there is a notice on the wall saying police will be called at the first sign of violence and another encouraging sex workers to get in contact if they are victims of human trafficking. And there are other items to help too. Wipes for cleaning after sex, three condom options, lube, even a heater run on electricity from a generator outside. All these suggestions came straight from sex workers. ""These people are my neighbours and friends so I listen to them, they have the best ideas for what they need,"" Michael says. For instance, the sex workers told him they often get sore knees. ""So we came up with this"", he says, waving a rainbow-coloured chunk of polystyrene at me. When Sexelance started operating in November 2016, Michael wasn't sure it would work. People were initially reluctant to use it, particularly clients. But now it has been used 45 times and Michael says people are becoming more comfortable with the idea. ""If the sex workers think it's a good idea then they will ask the customers to come here and tell them, 'It's a safe place, there are all the condoms we need, and there's heat!'"" Michael laughs. He offers his ideas with a light, humorous touch, like his description of how sex workers would like to ""pimp"" up the ambulance with curtains, mirrors and red carpet on the walls. But in his actions Michael is entirely serious. It's not the first time he has used an old ambulance to help what he calls Copenhagen's ""street minorities"", and his first initiative got people listening. It was similar to Sexelance - a repurposed old ambulance, this time a German one from the 1990s called Fixelance. It provided drug addicts with a space to take drugs, with an on-site doctor and nurse, equipped with clean needles and Naxalone, an antidote for heroin overdose. Unlike Sexelance, uptake for this one was quick. Eight people used it to inject heroin in the first three hours. Also unlike Sexelance, Michael encountered a lot of resistance from the authorities. Two separate plans for permanent drug rooms were stopped by the authorities. But it went ahead in 2011 with 100 volunteers involved and despite nerves on the first day, Fixelance achieved what Michael wanted. Fixelance was used to target areas known by drug users It spurred the government to change Danish drug policy in 2012 and there are now five permanent facilities - ""fixerums"" or ""fix rooms"" - across Denmark. One based in Copenhagen is the largest in the world and the original Fixelance ambulance is now exhibited at the National Museum of Denmark. There have been no fatal overdoses reported in any organised ""fix room"" anywhere the world. World Hacks is a new BBC team looking at global problems. We meet the people fixing the world. Get the World Hacks podcast Check out our Facebook page,external As well as the two ambulance schemes, Michael created a magazine called Illegal! which hit the streets in Copenhagen in 2013. It's sold by drug addicts and in fact the explicit aim of the magazine, produced by volunteers, is to provide money to the addicts so that they can get their fix. It's an idea that again met resistance from some citizens, Michael says. His aim with the magazine is to challenge what he says are people's preconceived ideas that drug users are just people who should be locked up for their habit. ""The consequences of our current political system is that drug users often have to steal to fund their habits,"" he says. ""We are trying to make these people, who have addictions, less criminal. Yes, they may buy drugs with the money but that is real life."" The aim is to give the sellers more dignity by providing a magazine that people actually want to buy. The production quality therefore is very high, the art all original and the sellers take $2.50 (Â£2) commission. Rikke Lauritzen from the municipality in Copenhagen says Illegal! is doing an important job on the streets of of the city. ""It's naive to think people will stop using drugs. What's important is that the authorities offer help and treatment for those who want to stop using. The only way we can do that is to see the human, not the addiction,"" she said. And Copenhagen police support her stance saying they do not have a problem with the magazine, as long as it is legal. Illegal! was sold in east London too for the first time two years ago, and there are plans for a bigger rollout in the UK's capital. But the Metropolitan Police said they ""discourage anyone from giving money to someone that states they want to use it to commit crime."" And if he wasn't busy enough,  Michael has also dedicated his time to making life easier for Copenhagen's bottle collectors. There is a return scheme in most cities in Denmark where deposits are paid on bottles and cans to encourage recycling - consumers return the containers to supermarkets to collect their money. Like in many places with container deposit schemes, homeless people and struggling pensioners rummage through through bins to get cans and bottles that others - who don't care about collecting the small deposit - have thrown away. Michael's simple idea was to place shelves on bins. They're now on 1,000 bins out of 5,000 in Copenhagen and the idea has spread to four other cities in Denmark. Again, this idea is to give dignity back to Copenhagen's ""street minorities"", Michael explains. ""Instead of thinking of these people as poor or homeless, we think of them as environmental workers who do an important job,"" he says. So far there hasn't been any negative reaction to Sexelance - the police are engaging with Michael to suggest the best places to park it - and he hopes ultimately that the idea will go the same way as Fixelance, a permanent facility manned by doctors and nurses for Copenhagen's sex workers. ""It's about safety first and foremost, but it's also about better health and dignity,"" Michael says. ""You can see how cold it is outside, and think normally these women are seeing clients on a bench, or in a car. It's not right that they should be out there with no support.""

Corrie's Ken in classic whodunnit,"There are several characters with a motive to harm Ken Coronation Street fans were left with a classic soap cliffhanger on Monday after Ken Barlow (William Roache) was found at the bottom of his stairs unconscious. And fans were left wondering if he fell or if he was pushed. The long-running Street resident suffered a stroke in the autumn, so many wondered if he was ill again. But with Barlow having rubbed up family members, neighbours and acquaintances the wrong way in recent weeks, could he have been shoved? We take a look back at some of the best TV whodunnits from over the past few years. The original Dallas ran from 1978 to 1991 Who could forget this long-running saga involving the Dallas oil baron we all loved to hate? It took eight months for viewers to discover that it was JR's sister-in-law and former mistress, Kristin Shepard. But not before JR's long-suffering wife Sue Ellen got the blame first and was jailed. T-shirts printed with the slogans ""Who Shot JR?"" and ""I Shot JR"" flew off the shelves in the summer of 1980. The storyline became one of television's first big water-cooler moments and prompted pretty much every soap going to get in on the cliffhanger act. Everyone was guessing who shot Phil in Albert Square So it didn't have the glamorous Dallas backdrop but the British answer to the JR mystery was, of course, who shot Phil Mitchell? The EastEnders bad boy came under fire in 2001 but fans only had to wait a month to find out who it was, although many suspects had come under the spotlight during that time, including Mark Fowler, Ian Beale, Steve Owen and Dan Sullivan. But in April 2001, it transpired that Phil's ex, Lisa, had pulled the trigger. She confessed to Phil himself - while also admitting that she still loved him. EastEnders followed up its successful storyline with several other whodunnits, including ""Who killed Lucy Beale?"" and ""Who killed Archie Mitchell?"". The identity of the father of Michelle Fowler's baby kept EastEnders' viewers gripped Another twist on the whodunnit, this device was first used by EastEnders back in 1985. This time, the mystery surrounded teenager Michelle Fowler who had become pregnant. But who was the father? There were several suspects, including Tony Carpenter and Ali Osman but of course, we all now know that it was Dirty Den, her best friend's dad. 'Scandi noir' has grown in popularity in the UK Of course, it's not just soaps and their fans who love a good old whodunnit. Many crime dramas have centred entire series on finding an elusive killer. Scandinavian drama The Killing (2007) saw Sophie Grabol's detective Sarah Lund investigating the rape and murder of teenager Nanna Birk Larsen, whose body was found in the boot of a car submerged in a lake. Under suspicion on this occasion were Copenhagen mayoral candidate Troels Hartmann, along with his campaign manager Morten Weber, while Larson's teacher Rama also found himself on Lund's radar. In the end, it turned out to be family friend Vagn Saerbaek - and it wasn't the first time he had killed either, having also murdered Lund's partner and a former girlfriend, too. Laura Palmer's death gripped the town of Twin Peaks David Lynch's cult 1990s hit series, Twin Peaks, was entirely based on this question. Was it Laura's psychiatrist Dr Lawrence Jacoby who was infatuated with the teen? Her boyfriend Bobby? What about Benjamin Horne, who had hired Laura as a prostitute? Drug dealers Leo Johnson and Jaques Renault also came under the spotlight. But it was Laura's father who murdered her, while possessed by the demon Killer Bob. Now fans are excited about series three arriving in May, 27 years after the first season aired. Watch this space. The third and final series of Broadchurch has focused on a rape storyline The first series of Broadchurch in 2013 was a huge hit for ITV, as crime-fighting duo DI Hardy and DS Miller tried to solve the mystery of who murdered a local schoolboy. Viewers were addicted to the twists and turns of the plotline as Danny's dad and the local vicar were among those under investigation. The moment when DS Miller (Olivia Colman) discovered her husband was the murderer was one of television's scenes of the year. Series two couldn't quite match the original's dizzy heights but the current third and final series is gripping viewers once again as Hardy (David Tennant) and Miller try to catch a serial rapist.

Triumph to troubles: Tiger's masterclass 20 years on,"Podcast: Listen to ""Tiger's Masterclass"" from BBC Radio 5 live It was standing room only. Reporters hung on every word uttered by sport's newest sensation as he charmed everyone in that crammed interview tent. This was at Congressional Country Club, Bethesda, Maryland - the site of the 1997 US Open, the first major since the golfing world had been shaken up like never before. Along with many members of the media contingent that week, it was my first encounter with Tiger Woods. That day, at just 21 years of age, he demonstrated an uncanny maturity, an engaging demeanour, refreshing candour and the ability to look in the eye of every one of his inquisitors. He talked about race relations, death threats, God and how he could no longer buy a sandwich in peace. There were a few questions about golf as well - he had, after all, recently won the Masters by a record 12 shots. Not only that, he had become the first black man to triumph in the white-dominated environs of the Augusta National in Georgia. ""As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white and caddies will be black,"" the club's co-founder Clifford Roberts had once infamously said. Roberts died 20 years before Woods became the youngest to don a Green Jacket. He did so with the lowest score in the history of what had become golf's most glamorous major. It feels extraordinary to think that thisseismic victory happened 20 years ago.,externalThe occasion is recalled, as part of our build-up to this year's opening major of the season, ina BBC Radio 5 live specialon Wednesday, 29 March at 21:00 BST - Tiger's Masterclass, 20 Years On. At 21, Tiger Woods became the youngest winner of the Masters in 1997 So did he change the face of golf? ""Yes, absolutely,"" three times Masters winner Sir Nick Faldo tells the programme. ""Tiger helped so many parts of golf, he got people to sit up and take notice. He brought a lot of attention to it and a lot of clever people. ""And that's why it's moved on to where we are which is pretty amazing, the game of golf now,"" he added. Look at the players who dominate the game today - Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day - they possess the kind of athleticism that Woods first brought to the game. The vast riches for which they compete are also thanks to the Tiger impact which fuelled inflated and lucrative television and sponsorship contracts. Remembering 1997, Faldo provides notable insight because, as defending champion, he was drawn to play with Woods in the first round of that Masters. ""It was the start of a monumental week,"" the Englishman recalled. ""Media attention was off the charts, we'd never known or seen anything like that. He had already been able to orchestrate that he was different. ""That particular week it was constant media questioning. You were very lucky to get through one question about you before they wanted to start talking about Tiger. ""Everybody wanted to know about him."" Woods receives the Masters Green Jacket from 1996 champion Nick Faldo By the Sunday, the Englishman was slipping the Green Jacket onto the American's youthful shoulders. ""I was trying to be funny and I said 'one word of advice, a red shirt clashes terribly with a green jacket',"" Faldo said. ""I whispered that in his ear but obviously the red shirt went on to become nearly as famous as the green jacket."" Yet the tournament began inauspiciously for Woods as both he and Faldo struggled during the front nine of their opening rounds. ""I remember we looked at each other and raised eyebrows on the fifth green because the golf course was completely different,"" said Faldo. ""Boy, you went from green practice facilities and green greens and suddenly they were biscuit coloured. ""They were brutally hard and fast. And we didn't see much of each other because we were both in the trees, probably left and right. ""We both shot 40 on the front nine so that was a pretty sombre sort of thing."" On his way to the 10th tee, Woods, who had been joint favourite going into his first professional major, assessed what was going wrong. He vowed to shorten his backswing and his ball-striking suddenly became more reliable. Woods birdied the 10th and chipped in for another at the short 12th. Another followed at the 13th and he reduced the par-five 15th to a short approach and successful eagle putt from three feet. Faldo was the closest witness as Woods recorded that two-under-par round of 70. ""He came back in 30 and that was the start,"" said the six times major champion. ""And then we didn't see him for dust for about the next 12 years."" Woods followed up with rounds of 66, 65 and 69 to finish 18 under par. He took the lead on the 13th hole of his second round and was never caught. He ended up 12 strokes ahead of Tom Kite in second place. It was the manner of the victory that was incredible. He averaged 323 yards off the tee and the longest club he hit into any of the par-four holes was a seven iron.  It heralded the era of 'Tiger-proofing' at the world's greatest courses, Augusta included. Not that this hampered the young phenomenon. Woods stunned the golfing world by winning the Masters just eight months after turning professional The Masters of 1997 yielded the first of four Green Jackets [the same as Arnold Palmer, with only Jack Nicklaus ahead on six] and among 14 major titles for Woods, with the last coming at the 2008 US Open at Torrey Pines. He won it on one leg before taking the familiar journey to the operating table as knee and back injuries savagely blighted his 30s and now early 40s. There was alsothe scandal of his numerous extra-marital affairs,externalthat came to light on Thanksgiving night in 2009. It was an epic fall from grace, but long before then Woods had become guarded and suspicious of the media and all who threatened his privacy. Looking back at that 1997 news conference at Congressional, it is hard to reconcile the reclusive, wary figure of today with the youthful engagement he demonstrated on that occasion. ""My life is different for a 21 year old,"" he stated. ""But, then again, there are some perks to being who I am. I get to travel all around the world. ""I get to play golf every day, and doing the things I like to do. And I wouldn't trade that for the world."" But there were signs of how the burden of becoming the world's most famous sportsman would weigh heavy. ""What do I miss most? I guess playing a practice round in peace,"" he said. ""Going out to dinner and people are bugging you. People want an autograph when you have food in your mouth. ""Where I was raised, that was very rude to bug someone while they eat. In our society now, it is different."" Woods went on to say: ""Another thing that's changed dramatically in my life is, I guess, the nitpicking of what I do, all the actions that I take. People look at them and they critique them. ""And, sometimes that's good. Sometimes that's bad."" Woods has not played since withdrawing from the Dubai Desert Classic with back spasms in February Now, scrutiny surrounds his fitness and faltering recovery from multiple back surgeries which has limited him to just three competitive rounds this year. He pulled out of the Arnold Palmer invitational earlier in March saying he had""no timetable""for his return. This year's Masters starts on Thursday, 6 April. Woods is now 41 years old, and in athletic terms, an elderly 41. ""He's obviously really struggling now,"" Faldo observed. ""His thoracic spine is just not mobile enough and it probably does not have the residual strength to last.  I think he is a long way off coming back to winning again. Majors are well and truly out of the window. ""It would be an unbelievable achievement if he could rebuild."" He faces physical challenges that may prove insurmountable, but from the very start, Woods found ways to defy the odds. The events at Augusta 20 years ago and their impact will never be forgotten.

The gangland school which is top of the class,"Manenberg in Cape Town, South Africa, is infamous for its high crime rate, but it is now being associated with academic excellence, writes the BBC's Mo Allie. Looking from the outside at The Leadership College (TLC) with its basic structure and its small classrooms, surrounded by sandy waste ground, it is hard to imagine that this is the same school that has managed consistently to deliver top-class results since its inception seven years ago. Yet last year the school achieved a 92% pass rate in South Africa's national school-leaving examinations - far higher than the national average. That performance is in stark contrast with a finding of the report by the Johannesburg-based Centre for Development and Enterprise (CDE), which suggests large proportions of South Africa's graduating students are ""functionally illiterate and innumerate"". The report found that South Africa - one of the continent's richest countries - was performing worse than many far poorer African nations in terms of educating its children. TLC's school-leaving exam pass rate: 92% in 2016 National average: 72.5% Average pass rate in Manenberg: 71% But what makes TLC's achievements even more remarkable is that it is located in Manenberg, a run-down area just 15 minutes from Cape Town's international airport, often in the news for the crime, gang violence and drug dealing that stalks its streets. ""The community itself and the township keep you down if you get into its lifestyle,"" says former head girl Thania Abrahams, who achieved five distinctions in last year's Matric exams. ""For me to rise above that, I had to focus on my goals."" Thania's results were good enough to get her enrolled for a degree in medicine at Stellenbosch University, one of the best tertiary institutions in South Africa. She wasn't the only TLC student to win a place at Stellenbosch: Imraan Ismail got six distinctions and a place to study chartered accounting. Of the 71 distinctions produced in Manenberg last year, all but three came from TLC. Many South African schools leave their students ""functionally illiterate"" TLC is a private school, run by the 2 Oceans Education Foundation, which counts Yusuf Islam, the singer previously known as Cat Stevens, among its patrons. Thanks to its government and charitable funding, the area's academically gifted students can attend for free - even down to school excursions. Many of TLC's learners come from tough backgrounds, broken homes together with a variety of socio-economic problems that plague the townships in which they live. In 2015, no child accepted to TLC came from a household which earned more than 8,000 rand ($640; Â£510) a month. About 90% of the students are Muslim but the founders stress it is open to all races and denominations. But TLC does not just offer the opportunity to excel in the classroom. The school serves as an oasis of tranquillity as it provides a safe space for the pupils who have free access there to psychologists and occupational therapists - something these children would never otherwise have access to. The health professionals play a key role in helping the learners overcome their often traumatic circumstances which include witnessing murders, armed robberies, abusive relationships or simply a lack of affection at home. Ashra Norton, TLC director: ""What I am particularly pleased about is that learners are now thinking about doing courses in areas like actuarial science, health, physical sciences and engineering."" However, one of the main reasons behind the success of TLC is the strict discipline coupled with the hard work put in by both pupils and teachers. The school's navy and light blue uniform, which is given free of charge to each of the pupils, plays an important part in creating an identity and sense of togetherness in a community where gangs have filled that vacuum for many youngsters. Meanwhile, the school organizes extra lessons in maths and science, as well as in any other subjects that pupils find problematic, over weekends and sometimes during the week for those in their final year. ""Although I'm very happy, I'll feel even better if all the other schools in Manenberg could get similar results,"" says TLC director Ashra Norton, who grew up in the area. The school is doing its part here as well, however: TLC hosts joint tuition programmes with other schools in the area in an effort to help pupils keep up with their work. The school delivers a top-class education despite basic facilities The 2 Oceans Education Foundation is involved with six other schools in Cape Town, most of them in the poorer townships. Its most recent involvement is with Langa High School, located in Cape Town's oldest black township, which had a Matric pass rate of just 34% last year. ""There is no quick fix solution,"" Mrs Norton says. ""It requires hard work and determination to survive against extraordinary odds. We have a very strong intervention programme in the school starting from their first year in grade eight."" The programme includes providing daily sandwiches or meals that are sometimes provided by sponsors to nearly half of the 625 pupils who come from economically deprived homes. The school has managed to raise the bar for pupils who are now aiming much higher than their parents could ever have dreamed of. ""What I am particularly pleased about is that learners are now thinking about doing courses in areas like actuarial science, health and physical sciences and engineering which was unheard of a few years ago,"" says Mrs Norton.

Eight crucial people who will negotiate Brexit,"The nature of Brexit will ultimately be decided by the governments of the 27 remaining EU nations and the UK. But the figures who negotiate the detail of the deal will be hugely important. Many would argue that Germany's Angela Merkel and the UK's Theresa May are the two most important people in the Brexit negotiations. But here are eight figures who will also be crucial to what happens. Of the four from the UK, three are within the Exiting the EU department. On the EU side, the figures represent the Commission (the EU's executive cabinet), the Council (the leaders of each member state) and the parliament of elected MEPs, who will have to approve the final deal. A seasoned master of French and EU diplomacy, chief negotiatorMichel Barnierwill go head-to-head with UK Brexit Secretary David Davis. They used to be sparring partners in the 1990s, when they were rival Europe ministers with contrasting visions of the EU. Like Mr Davis, Mr Barnier does not owe his current status to his country's elite club of politicians. He did not attend the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, incubator of French political high-flyers. He has already given a clear indication of the tough stance he will take in negotiations - from guaranteeing the rights of Polish students and Romanian nurses in the UK, and British pensioners living in Spain. He is also adamant that the ""sequencing"" of the talks is key - the UK won't get to negotiate a trade deal until separation terms are agreed that preserve the integrity of the EU single market, and the UK settles its outstanding bills. Michel Barnier made his mark in French politics by organising the 1992 Winter Olympic Games in the French Alps. And for a long time he was regarded as a provincial - some called him ""the ski instructor"". He served as France's Europe minister and was briefly foreign minister. He stems from the Gaullist tradition. It was Charles De Gaulle who famously said ""Non"" to the UK joining the Common Market. Since 2010, Mr Barnier has been big in Brussels. As internal market commissioner he had oversight of the City of London at a sensitive time - in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. That role caused jitters in UK business circles, as Mr Barnier pushed through financial reforms. While some in the City disapproved of new EU regulations on bank capital reserves and bankers' bonuses, other officials found him more accommodating to City interests later on. And his opposite numbers in the Brexit talks will hope for the same pragmatism. Who is Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier? Sabine Weyand- one of ""the Commission's best and brightest"", according to its president, Jean-Claude Juncker - was picked as Mr Barnier's deputy chief negotiator in September. She studied at Cambridge University in the 1980s, and knows well the country whose exit from the EU she will be helping to engineer. But this German national is best known as a veteran at representing the Commission and its interests. And that makes her a formidable opposite number. She has 23 years' experience in trade relations and more than a decade at the Commission itself. One Brussels lobby group predicted Ms Weyand was unlikely to give much ground in trade talks on any UK hopes of a la carte access to the EU, particularly any weakening of the EU single market ideal of free movement. Those who have seen Ms Weyand in action speak highly of her as being far from a faceless cog in the Brussels machinery. Cecile Toubeau, whose group campaigns for sustainable transport inside Europe, came into contact with her at the time the VW emissions scandal blew up in 2015. ""She was very straightforward, she got to the point quickly, she understood the issues that we were bringing,"" says Ms Toubeau. ""She was open to what we said but I felt she was able to say, 'That's politically not something we can consider'. ""She was no-nonsense and honest - she really knew her stuff. She didn't need to look to her assistants for guidance."" In its list of the most influential women in Brussels, the politico.eu website put Ms Weyand at number eight, calling her a ""Commission problem-solver"". She served in the cabinet of French former EU trade chief Pascal Lamy from 1999 to 2004, and later helped steer the EU's climate policies. She also monitored national governments' economic and financial performance in the Commission's Secretariat-General. In the run-up to the Brexit vote,Donald Tuskdid all he could to find a deal to keep the UK in the EU. He was apocalyptic when he warned that the UK leaving could end ""in the destruction of not only the EU but also Western political civilisation in its entirety"". His efforts came to nothing and as the result emerged he tried to calm the waters in Brussels, saying ""what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger"". But in the wake of PM Theresa May's re-election without a parliamentary majority, he warned the UK to make up for lost negotiating time,tweeting,external: ""We don't know when Brexit talks start. We know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations'."" As president of the European Council, his challenge is to keep Europe's leaders united as they negotiate Britain's exit. Mr Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, is loathed by Poland's nationalist government that tried and failed to unseat him. But he has the respect of other European leaders for his handling of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the migrant crisis and the Greek debt negotiations. He has warned the UK not to expect to cherry-pick its way out of the EU and he has rejected British threats to walk away without a deal. But he has spoken of his aspiration for a ""smooth divorce"" with the two sides breaking up as ""good friends"". Mr Tusk is from Poland's Kashubian minority and grew up in Gdansk, the Baltic port city where anti-communist demonstrations, led by the Solidarity trade union, erupted in the 1980s. He was active in Solidarity while studying history at the University of Gdansk. As prime minister, Mr Tusk led Civic Platform (PO), which espoused free market policies. His government cut jobs in the state sector, pursued privatisation, cut taxes to woo foreign investors and tried to persuade Poles abroad to come home. Didier Seeuws, a hard-working diplomat with an eye for detail, was quickly tapped by Donald Tusk to head the Council's task force for the Brexit negotiations. While the Barnier-Weyand Commission task force will do the ""heavy lifting"" in the negotiations - dealing with the technical detail of Britain's exit from the EU - the Council team will be tasked with keeping the remaining 27 national governments happy and shaping the EU's longer term strategic relationship with the UK. Mr Seeuws will also have to bear in mind the views of MEPs - the European Parliament will have to approve the final deal. Mr Seeuws's team is said to have been meeting twice a week in preparation for negotiations - prompting unhappy comparisons with the UK side's state of preparation in some of the media. Mr Seeuws is respected for his role in handling the Greek debt negotiations - working through the night until dawn and overcoming divisions between heads of state to achieve a deal. From 2007 to 2010, the 51-year-old technocrat from the Flemish city of Ghent was Belgium's deputy ambassador to the EU, where he is said to have negotiated a breakthrough on the European patent system - following a 30-year deadlock. The ambassador he served under, Jean De Ruyt, told the BBC his political instincts were ""always spot on"" and that he ""trusted his judgement and recommendations completely"". ""Apparently modest and obliging, he is capable of mastering the most complex of technical issues and understanding immediately the political stakes, but at the same time able to explain in simple words what has been discussed or decided. ""I have no doubt that Didier will often be able to reach a fair compromise when, as expected, difficult negotiations will reach a stalemate."" Prior to this, Mr Seeuws served for several years as spokesman for the Belgian prime minister, none other than Guy Verhofstadt, the man chosen as chief Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament. Eventually, Mr Seeuws took up a job as right-hand man to Donald Tusk's predecessor at the European Council, Herman van Rompuy. He has since worked at the Council as head of transport, telecommunication and energy. Olly Robbinsis the top UK official at the Brexit talks. At the start of the process, he was the top civil servant in David Davis's Exiting the EU department. But he has now moved to the Cabinet Office to work more directly for the prime minister, following reports of tensions with Mr Davis. The move was seen as a sign of Theresa May taking more control of Brexit negotiations. He cut his teeth at Gordon Brown's Treasury, helping to co-ordinate public spending policy, before going on to serve in senior behind-the-scenes roles for both Tony Blair and Mr Brown in Downing Street. By civil service standards, his rise was meteoric - he was Mr Blair's principal private secretary by the age of 31. He gained a reputation for being a skilled mediator in the frequent disputes between No 10 and the Treasury. ""In all my dealings with him, he really embodied the essence of the impartial civil service, and he's very popular,"" former Olympics minister Lady Jowell, toldwebsite Politico.,external After a spell as director of the civil service and as David Cameron's deputy national security adviser, Robbins became the senior civil servant in charge of immigration policy at Theresa May's home office. When Mrs May became prime minister she drafted Robbins in as her senior EU adviser, prompting speculation the government wanted to put the free movement of people at the heart of Brexit negotiations. Robbinsgenerated some headlines in 2016,externalwhen he was ejected from a Home Affairs select Committee hearing by then chairman Keith Vaz for failing to give information about the UK Border Force's budget on time. He wasalso caught on camera ""grinning sheepishly"",externalas Mrs May handed her handbag to him at an EU summit in Malta. A career diplomat, with a reputation as a low-key but solid operator,Sir Tim Barrowwas drafted into the role of UK ambassador to the EU following the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers, who had accused the government of ""muddled thinking"" over Brexit. Sir Tim was Britain's ambassador in Moscow between 2011 and 2015, a turbulent period in relations between the two nations, and previously served as Britain's ambassador to Ukraine. The diplomat started his foreign office career in 1986 at the UK embassy in Brussels before going on to serve as a private secretary to Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook, advising on the EU, Russia and Middle East. ""It's the toughest negotiation in our lifetimes and I think he is up to it,"" Britain's former ambassador to Lebanon Tom Fletcher told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I have seen him in Brussels. He knows the corridors, he knows the characters. But actually more importantly I saw him in Moscow where he was incredibly resilient as ambassador there, dealing with Putin in a very testing time in our relationship and Tim had a reputation of being bulletproof out there."" BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Sir Tim was less likely to be criticised by Brexit supporters than some other potential candidates for the job, as it ""would be very hard to say that Sir Tim Barrow is an out-and-out pro-European"". A fluent Russian speaker, Sir Tim was educated at Arnold Lodge in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and Oxford University. As director general of the Department for Exiting the EU,Sarah Healeyis, in effect, second-in-command of the civil service machine tasked with delivering Brexit. She comes fresh from a similar role at the culture department and also led cross-government efforts to promote more women into senior civil service roles through job-sharing arrangements. Her previous claim to fame was as a contestant on University Challenge - she won the BBC Two quiz in 1998 and twice competed in the Champions of Champions competition for Magdalen College, Oxford. Healey studied modern history and English at Oxford and gained a postgraduate degree in social policy from the London School of Economics before embarking on a career in the civil service. Her former boss at the culture department, Tory MP Ed Vaizey, told the Times she was ""incredibly sharp and intelligent"", adding ""there are no flies on her at all"". She worked briefly for Iain Duncan Smith, when he was work and pensions secretary, and, before that, was director of strategy and funding at the education department under Michael Gove. She recently told a think tank conference that, as a student of history, freedom of information was an issue ""close to my heart"". ""One of the things I reflected on when I took this job was that my children, if they were to take history degrees, would write essays on what we were doing so it was terribly important that they do have access to the archives of the time,"" she said.

How will Brussels react to Article 50 being triggered?,"The first cliche of the Brexit process is about to bite the dust. For months European officials have batted away questions about the financial and political implications of the UK's departure from the EU with the mantra ""no negotiation without notification."" Well, now we are about to have notification, so at least we can look forward to not hearing that form of words again. That doesn't mean of course that you should expect to see a long queue of Brussels insiders giving their views on the EU's red lines in the coming days. Prepare instead for days, if not weeks, of consultation between the European Commission - which will take the lead in negotiations for Brussels - and the 27 ""remainer"" states, together with the European Council, which represents them. Frenchman Michel Barnier will lead the EU Commission's negotiating team This is, of course, exactly the kind of long-winded, bureaucratic obscurantism that is the curse of European politics if you're a Brexiteer: or the kind of careful, consensual consultation we're going to miss if you're not. The commission's chief negotiator is the former French cabinet minister Michel Barnier, who has been quietly preparing for this moment for several months, visiting the 27 capitals and hammering out common negotiating positions where possible. Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has been on the case too. So Brussels has some sort of consultation document almost ready to go. When the European side has seen the detail in the UK's Article 50 letter, it will, no doubt, wish to tweak that document. The expectation in Brussels was always that the British letter of notification would be a fairly substantial document, rather than a one-line declaration of intent, so there might be quite a bit of tweaking to be done. Katya Adler asks if the EU can survive the biggest challenge in its history What is Article 50? A guide to what happens now Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU The revised document will then be dispatched to the 27 capitals for further consultation, and the result of all that consultation, in theory at least, will be an agreed EU negotiating position with agreed red lines. The UK will see fairly quickly what the opening position of the Barnier team will be. And, of course, it's been working hard behind the scenes to try to calculate what the bottom line might be. The initial sense of hurt and shock in Brussels has given way to a kind of resignation about Brexit. Most MEPs you talk to still consider it an act of almost suicidal self-harm and feel that the UK has consciously uncoupled itself from one of modern history's most important drivers of peace and prosperity. And you do hear irritation at some British attitudes. Foremost among the resentments is the idea that a large, rich, European power is walking away from financial commitments to poorer partners. Individual EU nations have their own greatly differing aims for the Brexit negotiations But at least one diplomat has pointed out that the UK championed the eastward expansion of the EU into the old Soviet empire and is now leaving the expanded union in part because of the pressure of migration from those new member states. Still, the romantic notion persists that Brexit might one day be reversed, somehow: the EU Commission's President, Jean-Claude Juncker, has said publicly that he'd ""like to see the British climbing back into the boat one day"". Lots of officials would agree with their British counterparts that it is now important to seek a deal that is good for both the EU and the UK. But make no mistake, the mission of Team Barnier is to clinch a deal that is good for the 27. Those 27 states have wildly differing interests. The Baltic states see the UK as a European leader on security, Poland sees it as a vital source of overseas work and remittances and Spain has to balance the interests of its huge expatriate British population against a historic opportunity to make some diplomatic progress on Gibraltar. And things might get very tough, very quickly. The EU side wants to split the talks into two different strands: the terms of the ""divorce"" settlement and, only after that is settled, the terms of a future relationship. The status of migrants within the EU and the UK will be central to the talks The UK clearly feels that it would be possible to take those two strands in parallel. I wouldn't expect the two sides to fall out over process and timetabling, but nothing is impossible. The most ""do-able"" deal, perhaps, would be on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British passport holders sprinkled through the various members states (more than 500 in Estonia alone, apparently). It's in no-one's interests to throw a shadow of uncertainty over so many lives - there are about a million Poles in the UK for example - and it's the closest Brexit will come to raising a genuine humanitarian issue. Expect more problems over money, one of the reasons everyone keeps coming back to the divorce analogy. The EU says it's made spending plans, to which the UK was a willing party, which stretch for several years into the future and that the UK has a responsibility, whether legal, moral or political, to carry on funding those commitments, perhaps until 2021. And, beyond that, there are pension liabilities for current EU staff that stretch decades into the future. A large part of the ""divorce"" negotiations will concern money British sources have told us that there's no legal basis on which the UK can be made to pay and, at the very least, if it's presented with a bill for 60bn euros (Â£52bn) it's going to require a line-by-line itemisation and not just a figure apparently plucked from the air. The lesson of politics is that you can always do a deal about money, and so it's likely to prove again here. But if there is an issue that's going to spark walkouts and breakdowns before a deal is struck, then this is probably it. Much more complex will be the issue of future trade relationships, whether they're discussed in parallel with the divorce talks or have to wait until later. A red line for many in the EU parliament is that the UK shouldn't have a deal which even comes close to being as good as being in the single market itself. And the relationship with the EU's customs union threatens to be difficult too. What if a Japanese-owned car maker is assembling vehicles in the UK using components made in Germany and then selling the vehicle in Belgium? Would tariffs be paid on the car parts as they left Germany, or when the completed vehicle left the UK? Or neither? Or both? Will Dutch trawlers be allowed to catch halibut in UK territorial waters in the North Sea? Or Spanish boats take mackerel in the Irish Sea? What about the Irish border, which is open because of the peace process: is it now to be closed because of the different customs regimes? What kind of relationship will the UK have with the EU's single market and customs union following Brexit? What about Scotland, especially if it ceases to be a region of the UK and becomes a unitary state half way through the talks? All these difficulties and more have to be resolved. And once Article 50 is triggered, it will be two years to the day before the UK is out of the European Union for good. It would be possible, of course, for the two sides to agree an extension to that talks deadline, during which some kind of transitional arrangement with the UK could remain in force, under which things might be pretty much as they are now. But the UK can't be sure that the EU would agree to such an extension when the alternative might be to have the British negotiating while over a barrel and against the clock. For most of us, this will be the biggest and most important diplomatic negotiation of our lifetimes, and the outcome is shrouded in uncertainty. We know when it will start, more or less, and when it will finish. Everything that happens in between will have the capacity to surprise and, every now and then, to shock.

Vaughan and Root back new T20 plans,"This video can not be played T20 tournament 'future-proofs' county game - ECB chief tells BBC's Dan Roan A new Twenty20 tournamentplanned by the England and Wales Cricket Board ""will be a roaring success"", says former England captain Michael Vaughan. The competition is set to start in 2020 and will involve eight new city-based teams playing 36 games in 38 days. ""Cricket needs that moment in this country that changes the way we talk and think about it,"" said Vaughan. He also said that he believes the ECB's aim for ""significant"" free-to-air coverage is key to the proposal. ECB chief executive Tom Harrison called free-to-air ambitions an ""aspiration which reaches at the heart of our proposition going forward"". He hopes the new competition will rival the Indian Premier League and Big Bash in Australia as the leading T20 tournaments in the world. On Tuesday, the ECB announced its board had given its unanimous support to trigger the formal process. The Big Bash draws average crowds of more than 28,000 whereas Vaughan labelled the attendance of the current T20 Blast competition in the English county game as ""nothing better than division three football"". ""Everyone can see every ball of the Big Bash,"" said Vaughan, who was speaking on hisBBC Radio 5 live showwith ex-England spinner Phil Tufnell. ""Cricket is there for everyone to see. I love the thought and talk of terrestrial partners and the game seen. ""But I don't think that is the be-all and end-all. I think it is important, but I think cricket has to do so much more. ""The only thing in terms of a county perspective is this new tournament will be a massive juggernaut, get loads of marketing and the county game may say: 'Why didn't we get that support?' ""Would the Blast have had more success if there was a terrestrial partner in play or had that kind of support? I guess the answer is yes."" He added: ""I think the white ball game, in particular, and T20 is exactly the brand of cricket required to expand the game."" Current England captain Joe Root believes the plans for the new competition are a ""good idea"" and that ""it is very important the public are given an opportunity to see cricket at a national level, on free-to-air TV"". Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, the Yorkshireman added: ""It will be interesting to see how things pan out and what decisions are made."" Root are Vaughan both progressed from Yorkshire to play for England Squads of the eight T20 teams will be made up of 15 players and include three overseas players. That will leave 96 players being selected from the 18 counties, which averages out at just over five apiece. ""If you picked 96 players out of county cricket now, the standard is remarkable,"" said Vaughan. ""Pick five-and-a-half players from each county and you add in the world-class overseas stars and you are going to get some terrific teams."" Vaughan played down concerns over fans not wanting to support certain city-based teams because of their county allegiance. ""Supporters will say I won't support Leeds or Manchester but I don't think they're going to be called the towns,"" said Vaughan who also addressed worries about the weather and the tournament being played when families travel abroad during the lengthy school summer holidays. ""The weather is nonsense because we might as well say 'we're not going to play because it might rain so let's cancel all cricket',"" he said. ""In terms of holidays, the programme is six weeks long and I don't know anybody who goes away for six weeks. They might go for two weeks and they don't all go at the same time.  Again, that is nonsense."" However, Essex chairman John Faragher is ""uncomfortable"" with the plans. ""I have concerns,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I keep hearing this will be played in city centres at places like Lancashire and Yorkshire. Why not Essex? Why couldn't we make Chelmsford one of these eight city centres? ""People think these decisions have already been taken, but I'm not just going to just roll over and accept it. If we believe that the right thing for cricket is to go against this, that's what we'll do."" Following a period of consultation, the ECB highlighted a ""focus on recruiting the next generation of fans, in particular promoting attendance to a diverse, young, family audience"". ""Where the Big Bash has had huge success is they made sure the fan experience is key,"" said Vaughan. ""The cricket was almost secondary. ""It's around 50/50 of men and women in the crowd which is remarkable. ""They go back the week after because all the kids and all the families had a terrific night out."" On Monday, the ECB presented a detailed overview of its proposals for a new Twenty20 competition to its 41 members. These included: Eight new teams playing 36 games over a 38-day summer window, with four home games per team All games televised, with significant free-to-air exposure No scheduling overlap with the existing T20 Blast competition An Indian Premier League-style play-off system to give more incentive for finishing higher up the league A players' draft, with squads of 15 including three overseas players Counties guaranteed Â£1.3m A referendum is expected to be dispatched on Tuesday inviting stakeholders to sanction a tournament including eight teams, rather than the 18 counties who traditionally contest the main competitions domestically. The ECB is made up of 41 stakeholders, which includes the 18 first-class counties, the MCC, the Minor Counties Cricket Association and the recreational boards, and a minimum of 31 will need to vote in favour for the plans to progress. ""I will ask the ECB board to trigger a change in our Articles of Association to enable the introduction of the proposed new T20 competition,"" said ECB chairman Colin Graves. ""We face a ground-breaking opportunity in the weeks and months ahead - and if our members embrace it, the ECB will work with everyone in the game to ensure this huge potential and the investment that will come with this delivers an even stronger future for the game.""

City-based Twenty20 to 'rival IPL',"This video can not be played T20 tournament 'future-proofs' county game - ECB chief tells BBC's Dan Roan A new eight-team, city-based Twenty20 tournament could ""absolutely rival the Indian Premier League"" says England and Wales Cricket Board chief Tom Harrison. The competition, proposed to begin in 2020, moved a step closer on Monday as further details were revealed. ECB chief executive Harrison said it was ""not a gamble"" for the 18 first-class counties. ""What we are doing here is future-proofing county cricket,"" Harrison told BBC sports editor Dan Roan. ""I don't think it's so much a gamble, it's about saying, 'What do we want our business and our game to look like?'"" The IPL - and Australia's Big Bash tournament - enjoy huge success, attracting the world's best limited-overs players and drawing large crowds. A referendum is expected to be dispatched on Tuesday inviting stakeholders to sanction a tournament including eight teams, rather than the 18 counties who traditionally contest the main competitions domestically. On Monday, the ECB presented a detailed overview of its proposals for a new Twenty20 competition to its 41 members. These included: Eight new teams playing 36 games over a 38-day summer window, with four home games per team All games televised, with significant free-to-air exposure No scheduling overlap with the existing T20 Blast competition An Indian Premier League-style play-off system to give more incentive for finishing higher up the league A players' draft, with squads of 15 including three overseas players Counties guaranteed Â£1.3m It says cricket has the chance to be part of ""mainstream conversation"" and believes the new competition can make the sport ""relevant to a whole new audience"". Following a period of consultation including more than 10,000 interviews, the ECB decided on three key principles: To have a major positive impact on driving participation To focus on recruiting the next generation of fans, in particular promoting attendance to a diverse, young, family audience To ensure complete differentiation from existing cricket tournaments to protect and support the future of the county game ""What we absolutely need to do, is start appealing to a younger audience,"" said Harrison. ""We know that by doing things differently, by building new teams, we can be relevant to a whole new audience and bring this very diverse, multicultural Britain in to our stadiums in a way perhaps we haven't been successful in doing."" This will be the first time in the history of domestic cricket that first-class counties are not represented, hence the need for a change to the ECB's articles and constitutions. It was confirmed on Monday that all 18 clubs have signed ""media rights deeds"" to allow the governing body to include the new Twenty20 in their forthcoming broadcast portfolio. Asked if the move to a city-based format signalled the end of the county system, Harrison said: ""Not at all. I think what we are doing here is future-proofing county cricket. ""Cricket has been a sport which has always had the ability to evolve and change where it's needed to, and its shown itself to be incredibly adaptable. ""We are the sport which came up with short formats through T20, and other sports have been trying to find the T20 equivalent of their own. ""So we have demonstrated we are capable of it, we've got the format, we now just need to create the competition which enables these new fans to get involved. ""It's a hugely exciting moment."" Chris Gayle has spent the past two Twenty20 Blast seasons with Somerset The ECB says the proposed competition can rival the incredible success of the Indian Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, whichdraws average crowds of more than 28,000.,external Questions remain around where the tournament will fit into the schedule, and which of the world's best players will be available. The ECB insists it will not impact on the T20 Blast, which last season featured the likes of West Indies star Chris Gayle and New Zealand's Brendon McCullum. ""We think there's a lot of room for growth in the Blast,"" said Harrison. ""It's done a tremendous job at bringing in a county cricket audience. ""But the evidence we have suggest cricket exists in a bubble and we've got to get outside this bubble."" The ECB's aim for ""significant"" free-to-air coverage is an ""aspiration which reaches at the heart of our proposition going forward"", according to Harrison. ""We are hoping very much as part of that is a whole new calibration of our reach, so a whole new way of looking at access to our sport whether that's digitally whether it's through social media or whether it's through traditional TV channels,"" he added. ""But we also understand it has to be the right mix of revenue and reach and promotion of the game which is ultimately what we're searching for."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Radio 5 live Cricket needs that moment in this country that changes the way we talk and think about the game. It's got to be good for the game. The key to the Big Bash is being seen. Every single person in Australia can see every single ball. Cricket is now the number one sport in Australia. Where the Big Bash has had huge success is they make sure the fan experience is key, and almost the cricket is secondary. The fans, and it's about 50-50 between men and women, and the kids, they all go home having had a great time. The only thing in terms of a county perspective is this new tournament will be a massive juggernaut, get loads of marketing and the county game may say: 'Why didn't we get that support?' This board of the ECB, I feel, are very visionary. You are going to get some terrific teams. I believe it will be a roaring success. England Test captain Joe Root on BBC Radio 5 live It would make a huge difference. I think it's very important that the public are given an opportunity to see cricket on a national level on free to air TV so it will be interesting to see how things pan out and what decisions are made. I think it's a very good idea. It's great to see it's been given some thought.

Do these 29 white men run America?,"This photo of Mike Pence meeting with the Freedom Caucus drew attention to the group's lack of diversity. A group of about three dozen men stopped President Trump's healthcare bill cold. Who are they, and how much power do they have? President Donald Trump's first major legislative push came to a halt last week as the American Health Care Act (AHCA) failed to be given a vote. Much of the blame for the bill's failure was placed on the Freedom Caucus, a secretive group of Republicans who refused to get in line behind Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Mr Trump. The Freedom Caucus emerged in 2015, in response to complaints that then-Speaker of the House John Boehner tried to jam through legislation in defiance of House rules - specifically, legislation they thought wasn't conservative enough. The caucus is ""concerned about procedure, but also concerned about procedure because they're concerned about policy,"" said Dr Laura Blessing, a senior fellow at the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. The group formed to restore power to the rank-and-file Republicans, and lead the charge in opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Popular ideals among Freedom Caucus members include balanced budgets and shrinking the size of government. How disastrous for Trump is healthcare collapse? During the Obama administration, members drummed up so much resistance to Mr Boehner's approach to budget cuts and legislation that the speaker chose to resign rather than face a bitter intra-party battle. Knowing exactly who is in the Freedom Caucus and how they will vote is tough. Joining the caucus is an invitation-only affair with a secret membership. This video can not be played Healthcare bill 'first real test for Trump' They assemble in closed-door meetings. Individual members often refuse to commit to a vote before consulting the rest of the caucus. ""These folks really do stick together,"" Dr Blessing said. ""You don't really have any moderate Republicans left in the Republican conference, but these folks are markedly more conservative than their colleagues."" Mark Meadows leads the Freedom Caucus Therein lies their power. The Freedom Caucus has about three dozen members, or a little more than 15% of House Republicans. As a voting block, it's enough to upset the 237-193 advantage Republicans have over Democrats. Assuming a bill gets no Democratic support, Ryan cannot afford to lose a mere 23 Republican votes. That means the Freedom Caucus can make or break a bill. Though the Caucus itself took no official position on the Trump-endorsed AHCA, meaning members could vote how they chose on the bill, most members of the Caucus wanted a full repeal of the existing healthcare law known as Obamacare. When they didn't get it - or what they felt was a good-faith negotiation from President Trump - they refused to vote for the AHCA. Moving forward, Dr Blessing expects to see turbulence between the Republican leadership and the Freedom Caucus on issues like tax reform, the federal budget and infrastructure spending - a costly endeavor that won't sit well with a group in favour of austerity. That leaves Paul Ryan, tasked with drumming up support for his party's bills, facing a difficult choice. ""If he tries to get Democrats' votes, he's going to pay a price within his conference,"" Dr Blessing said. Courting the Freedom Caucus may have fewer political consequences, but ""he's going to face the challenge of negotiating with people who haven't had a history of negotiating much"". There's not much incentive for Freedom Caucus members to start negotiating now. Many moderates also disliked the bill, but weren't so public - or unified - in their opposition. The Freedom Caucus is facing much of the blame for the failure of the healthcare act, and they lost one member, Ted Poe, who said that their obstinacy was counterproductive. ""Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do,"" he said. However, individual members are polling well, and the president is not.
