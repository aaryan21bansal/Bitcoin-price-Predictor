UN staff suspended over sex-act in car,"The UN has been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct in recent years The United Nations has placed two of its workers on unpaid leave over allegations of sexual misconduct in an official car in Israel. The men were filmed in a UN-marked vehicle on a main street by Tel Aviv's seafront. In the video, a woman in a red dress is seen straddling a man in the back seat of the car. The UN launched an investigation into the 18-second video after it was shared widely on social media last month. StÃ©phane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN's secretary general,said he was ""shocked and deeply disturbed"" by the footage. Now the UN says the men in the video have been identified as staff members of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), UN military observers based in Israel. The two staff members have been suspended without pay until the investigation into the incident has concluded. Mr Dujarric told the BBC on Thursday their suspension was appropriate ""given the seriousness of the allegations of failing to observe the standards of conduct expected of international civil servants"". ""UNTSO has re-engaged in a robust awareness-raising campaign to remind its personnel of their obligations to the UN Code of Conduct,"" Mr Dujarric said. Third of UN workers sexually harassed UN peacekeepers sexual abuse cases rise The UN has strict policies against sexual misconduct by its staff members. Staff may be disciplined if they are found to be in breach of conduct rules. They may be repatriated or banned from UN peacekeeping operations, but it is the responsibility of their home nation to take further disciplinary or legal action. The UN says it has ""zero tolerance"" for sexual misconduct within its ranks The UN has long been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct by its peacekeepers and other staff. There have been frequent allegations in recent years. In 2019, there were 175 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse against UN staff members,a report said,external. Of those allegations, 16 were substantiated, 15 were unsubstantiated and all others were still being investigated. Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has pledged to take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to sexual misconduct within the UN's ranks.

Hundreds arrested as crime chat network cracked,"This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Symonds is shown how a customised Android phone with EncroChat installed works A top-secret communications system used by criminals to trade drugs and guns has been ""successfully penetrated"", says the National Crime Agency. The NCA worked with forces across Europe on the UK's ""biggest and most significant"" law enforcement operation. Major crime figures were among over 800 Europe-wide arrests after messages on EncroChat were intercepted and decoded. More than two tonnes of drugs, several dozen guns and Â£54m in suspect cash have been seized, says the NCA. While the NCA was part of the investigation, it was initiated and led by French and Dutch police, and also involved Europol - the EU agency for law enforcement cooperation. Wil van Gemert, deputy executive director of Europol, told a press conference in the Hague that the hacking of the network had allowed the ""disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports"". Armed raids on properties resulted in more than 800 arrests across Europe The NCA says the Europe-wide operation, which lasted over three months and involved police forces across the UK, has had the biggest impact on organised crime gangs it has ever seen, with 746 UK arrests, including two law enforcement officers. UK organised crime 'chronic and corrosive' Police arrest 13 over UK's 'biggest drug conspiracy' The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, whose force made 171 arrests and seized Â£13.3m in cash, described it as a ""game changer"". She said: ""This is just the beginning. We will be disrupting organised criminal networks as a result of these operations for weeks and months and possibly years to come."" Nikki Holland, NCA director of investigations, said the operational team had described it ""as akin to cracking the enigma code"". ""They see this as that significant in terms of getting that inside information, effectively having a person inside an organised crime group telling us what they're up to,"" she said. An estimated 60,000 people, among them up to 10,000 in Britain, subscribed to France-based EncroChat, which has now been taken down. The system operated on customised Android phones and, according to its website, provided ""worry-free secure communications"". Customers had access to features such as self-destructing messages that deleted from the recipient's device after a certain length of time. Bank notes seized by Essex Police during the operation There was also panic wipe, where all the data on the device could be deleted by entering a four-digit code from the lock-screen. The NCA says the messaging system has been used as a ""criminal marketplace"" to co-ordinate the supply of Class A drugs across the world, and import weapons including assault rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, pistols and hand grenades. Law enforcement agencies began getting data from the site on 1 April after the encryption code is believed to have been cracked in March. Gangs are also believed to have used the handheld devices to plot attacks on rival groups, plan ways of enforcing drug debts and arrange for money to be laundered. Threats to life detailed on the site included acid attacks and threats to chop off limbs. Dozens of organised crime groups have been dismantled, says the NCA, with the bulk of arrests in London and north-west England. Lockdown ""worked in our favour"", says the agency, in that many more suspects were at home when they were raided. Many of those arrested are said to form the ""middle tier"" of crime gangs while some are described as the ""Mr and Mrs Bigs"" of the underworld. Analysis by BBC technology reporter David Molloy EncroChat sold encrypted phones with a guarantee of anonymity, with a range of special features to remove identifying information. The phones themselves cost roughly Â£900 (â¬1,000) each, with a subscription costing Â£1,350 (â¬1,500) for six months. Europol said that French police had discovered some of EncroChat's servers were located in the country, and that it was possible to put a ""technical device"" in place to access the messages. In June,rumours,externalbegan to swirl about EncroChat being compromised by law enforcement. The Netherlands' National Police said that users began to throw away their phones once the company became aware that messages were being intercepted - ""but it was too late"". Police had already intercepted millions of messages, some of which have been acted on already - and others that may be used in the future. In London, those targeted in the Met operation, codenamed ""Eternal"",  are alleged to include members of ""high-harm"" organised crime networks with longstanding links to violent crime and drug dealing. Dame Cressida said: ""These people are in business to make enormous amounts of money. Many of them lead a very respectable lifestyle - and definitely a high-end lifestyle in fancy houses with big cars going to... clubs and restaurants, splashing the cash sometimes, but sometimes being very discreet about it."" The Met said that in June, its detectives identified a plot by an international drugs and firearms gang to shoot dead a member of a rival network. According to the force, it managed to prevent the shooting by arresting an individual for conspiracy to murder and seizing a loaded pistol, which was believed to be the planned murder weapon.

PM: 'Act responsibly' as England's lockdown eased,"Staff are cleaning the bar ahead of Saturday's reopening Boris Johnson is urging people to act ""safely and sensibly"" on Saturday when lockdown is eased in England. Many businesses - including restaurants, pubs, hairdressers and cinemas - will be allowed to open their doors for the first time since March. But at a press conference on Friday, the PM will warn ""we are not out of the woods yet"" when it comes to the virus. The pub industry said the re-opening was ""fantastic"" but urged customers to respect staff and changes in practices. Pub-goers are being encouraged to book tables in advance, while live gigs and standing at the bar will not be allowed. The PM's press conference will take place at 17:00 BST (16:00 GMT) andyou can follow the updates on our coronavirus live page. What are the new rules when pubs reopen? Coronavirus lockdown: All you need to know about new measures Greater Manchester Police leave cancelled for pubs reopening InNorthern Ireland, pubs, bars, hotels and cafes are re-opening on Friday while, in Scotland, hospitality venues with outdoor space will open their doors on Monday. No date has yet been set in Wales. The 35,000 or so pubs and small bars trading in England have been closed since 20 March. The majority of them will be opening up again on Saturday, after the prime minister announced a significant relaxation of lockdown measures last week, along with an easing of social distancing rules from 2m to ""one metre plus"". Speaking on LBC Radio, Mr Johnson rejected suggestions that opening pubs on a Saturday was a recipe for trouble, suggesting it would have made little difference to wait until Monday. ""I hope people will do this safely and sensibly...My message is let's not blow it now folks"". Dubbed ""Super Saturday"" in some quarters, there may be nerves in Number 10 as they look to see how people respond to a further easing of lockdown. Hence, later on Friday, Boris Johnson will urge people to be ""responsible"". Messaging and tone are important in a public health crisis; and Labour's accused the prime minister of getting his messaging and tone wrong before crowds flocked to Bournemouth beach in June. Of course, in all directions, there are risks. Yes, there's the risk of seeing the virus spread but there are also the risks that come with keeping the economy in the deep freeze. But another reason ministers will want to avoid any scenes of disorder or disarray; no government wants to look like it's losing control. At a No 10 briefing later, Mr Johnson will be joined by chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. The PM is expected to say the move to ease lockdown is about ""supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country"". ""Just as when we first locked down, we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that."" The PM will also reiterate that the government ""will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions"" if there is a spike in the virus as a result of the changes. The rule change comes days after a local lockdown was put in place in Leicester because of a spike in cases. Businesses and schools in the city will have to remain closed, with residents advised not to travel. This video can not be played Some pubs are experimenting with an app-ordering system 'We'll be cutting hair from midnight' Emergency service chiefs have also appealed to pub goers to behave responsibly this weekend. In a joint statement, representatives of the police, fire and ambulance services urged people to drink in moderation, to observe social distancing and reassess their plans if conditions are not safe. The BBC's Danny Savage said the emergency services were preparing in the same way they would do for the Friday night before Christmas. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? The British Beer and Pubs Association has urged people to respect the hygiene measures in place and to be supportive of landlords and pub staff. ""If we all work together we can ensure that the reopening of pubs and hospitality is a success and an enjoyable experience for everyone,"" it said. However, there are signs that some people will be reluctant to return. Pollsters Ipsos-Mori said 60% of the 1,000 people they spoke to said they would be uncomfortable going to a bar or restaurant. Each UK nation's lockdown measures differ, including varying rules on the reopening of food and drink outlets. In Northern Ireland,pubs and restaurants are re-opening on Friday. In Scotland, beer gardens and outdoor restaurants will be allowed to reopen from 6 July, and indoor areas can be used from 15 July. The Welsh government has promised talks with the hospitality sector about a ""potential phased"" reopening, but no dates have yet been given.

Japan asks US to extradite two men over Ghosn caseThe ex-soldier and his son are held in the US for allegedly helping the ex-Nissan boss flee Japan.US & Canada,"Carlos Ghosn fled from Japan to Lebanon last December Japan has asked the US to extradite a former special forces soldier and his son for allegedly helping ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn flee Japan last year. Ex-Green Beret Michael Taylor and his son Peter were held in Massachusetts in May, several months after Japan had issued warrants for their arrest. The US authorities confirmed a formal extradition request was submitted. Mr Ghosn, who was detained in Japan on financial misconduct charges in 2018, made a dramatic escape last year. The former Nissan boss denies the charges against him. Despite being under house arrest and monitored 24 hours a day, on 29 December he managed to fly to the Lebanese capital Beirut via Turkey. How did Carlos Ghosn escape from Japan? The fall of the god of cars Ghosn: Decision to flee was hardest of my life Details of the Taylors' alleged involvement in the escape are unclear. But Japanese prosecutors have said the two were in Japan at the time and helped Mr Ghosn evade security checks as he left. In May,prosecutors in Turkey charged seven people over the escape. The suspects - four pilots, two flight attendants, and an airline executive - are also accused of helping Mr Ghosn flee. They go on trial in Istanbul on Friday, with Turkish prosecutors seeking up to eight years in jail for the four pilots and the airline executive. eJet firm: Rogue employee helped Ghosn flee Nissan seeks $90m damages from Carlos Ghosn Full details of the escape have never been fully explained. Mr Ghosn, who holds Brazilian, French and Lebanese nationalities, ran Renault and Nissan as part of a three-way car alliance. He is accused of misreporting his compensation package, but has insisted he can never get a fair hearing in Japan. Since his arrival in Lebanon, he has told reporters he was a ""hostage"" in Japan, where he was left with a choice between dying there or running. How did Carlos Ghosn escape from Japan?

Labour to urge more support to stem job losses,"This video can not be played The shadow chancellor says the reward for workers after the coronavirus pandemic âcannot be a redundancy noticeâ. More targeted economic support is required to prevent job losses in the wake of Covid-19, the shadow chancellor has said. In a speech, Labour's Anneliese Dodds demanded that job retention schemes be extended in parts of the UK hit by local lockdowns. She called on ministers to end a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" on help to shore up jobs. The chancellor is due to outline an economic support package next week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to bring forward infrastructure investment to create ""thousands of high-paid high-skilled jobs"". The government's furlough scheme is paying 80% of the wages of more than nine million workers but is due to be pared back from August, and will finish at the end of October. UK businesses cut more than 12,000 jobs in two days This is the moment to be ambitious â PM UK economy hit by worst contraction in 41 years Ms Dodds' speech came after UK companies announcedthousands of job cutsthis week, with many firms cutting jobs now to reduce costs. From 1 August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for their staff. They will then have to pay 10% of furloughed employees' salaries from September - rising to 20% in October. In her speech, Ms Dodds blamed the latest round of job losses on the government ""refusing to shift from its one-size-fits-all approach"". She added that workers in struggling sectors ""cannot and should not be treated the same way"" as those in sectors ""already back to full capacity"". ""To avoid the same flood of redundancy notices for workers within smaller companies later on this month, government must act now"". She called on the chancellor to ensure projects announced as part of his recovery package are carbon neutral or help reduce emissions. Ms Dodds also said jobs schemes should be extended in areas in localised lockdown, so that spikes in the virus in there ""don't wash away businesses and jobs in their wake"". The owner of Cafe Rouge became the latest UK firm to announce job cuts on Thursday. In an economic statement on Wednesday next week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to set out ""the next stage in our plan to secure the recovery"". In a speech earlier this week, Boris Johnson promised a Â£5bn ""new deal"" to build homes and infrastructure to help aid a post-Covid economic recovery. He also outlined plans for an ""opportunity guarantee"" to ensure every young person had the chance of an apprenticeship or placement. Responding to Ms Dodds' comments, Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling said the government had a ""clear plan to protect and create jobs"". ""Every Labour government has left unemployment higher than when it entered. Sir Keir Starmer would be no different,"" she added. Mr Johnson has insisted the furlough scheme must come to an end in October - saying it would not be ""healthy"" to extend it further. The hospitality sector, including pubs and restaurants, is reopening in Northern Ireland on Friday, with England following on Saturday. In Scotland, beer gardens and outdoor restaurants will be allowed to reopen from 6 July. Indoor areas are due to  follow from 15 July. Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in Wales are due to be able to reopen outdoors from 13 July.

In Scotland, beer gardens and outdoor restaurants will be allowed to reopen from 6 July, and indoor areas can be used from 15 July. The Welsh government has promised talks with the hospitality sector about a ""potential phased"" reopening, but no dates have yet been given.

US firms create record 4.8 million jobs in June,"The US economy created jobs at a record pace in June as firms took on more staff after the coronavirus downturn. Payrolls surged 4.8 million, the most since the Labor Department began keeping records in 1939, helped by the reopening of factories and restaurants. It follows May's jobs rebound, when 2.5 million joined the labour market, and comes after consumer spending data saw a jump in activity. But a recent spike in Covid-19 cases has raised fears for continued growth. June's rise is far higher than the three million jobs that many economists forecast would be created last month. However, separate Labor Department data also showed that in the week ending 27 June, initial claims for unemployment fell only slightly, to 1.43 million, on the previous week. Oxford Economics called it a ""worryingly small decline"". Companies, including in populous states such as California, Florida and Texas, plan to scale back or delay reopening because of the fresh coronavirus outbreaks, which would hold back hiring. This week, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the rebound in activity, saying the economy had ""entered an important new phase"". But he warned that continuing growth would depend on ""our success in containing the virus"". And despite two months in a row of jobs growth, employment is still about 15 million below its pre-pandemic level, with the jobless rate just above 11%. The US Labor Department said the leisure and hospitality sector added more than two million jobs, while retail added 740,000. The resumption of routine medical appointments also helped, with healthcare employment rising 568,000. The reopening of factories meant manufacturing employment continued to rebound, rising by 356,000, driven mostly by a 195,000 gain in the car industry. The surge in job creation in the past two months has been spurred by the government's Paycheck Protection Program, which gives businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for wages. But those funds are drying up. Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said he expects ""the recovery from here will be a lot bumpier and job gains far slower on average"". US President Donald Trump said the job numbers were 'spectacular' According to a report by the Reuters news agency, analysts at investment Goldman Sachs have estimated that US states accounting for half the population have paused or partially reversed their reopening plans, with limits reimposed most often on bars, restaurants and the size of gatherings. Moody's Analytics economist Sophia Koropeckyj said the June jobs surge was ""bittersweet"", as the rise in the number of cases was ""diminishing the likelihood of a continued V-shaped recovery"". She ""expects that the rebound in employment will fizzle and payrolls will flatten out until a vaccine is widely available"". Despite the caution, Wall Street share markets rose at the open, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index jumping more than 1% to a record 10,268.7 points. US President Donald Trump called the job numbers ""spectacular"" and said they proved the economy was ""roaring back"". ""These are historic numbers in a time when a lot of people would have wilted, but we didn't wilt,"" Mr Trump said. However, Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in London, said the resurgence of coronavirus cases in some cities meant it was ""too soon to say for certain that this recovery in employment sounds the all-clear for investors"".

'Serious differences remain' over UK-EU trade deal,"The UK and EU have said serious differences remain over a post-Brexit trade deal, following the latest negotiations in Brussels. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc's position needed to be ""better understood and respected"" by the UK if an agreement is to be found. Boris Johnson said a ""good deal"" was possible but it must recognise UK sovereignty in areas such as fishing. The UK has ruled out extending the December deadline to reach a deal. The prime minister told LBC Radio he was ""more optimistic"" than Mr Barnier about the chances of a deal but, if it did not happen, the UK would happily trade with its neighbour on more limited terms similar to Australia. ""I am not remotely disrespectful of Michel or the EU system that I understand deeply,"" he said. ""But I just don't think that it's right for us to proceed on the basis of the European Court of Justice continuing to arbitrate in the UK or us having to continue to obey EU laws when we are out of the EU."" Face-to-face Brexit trade talks begin in Brussels New momentum needed in trade talks, say UK and EU What are the sticking points in the trade talks? The latest round of talks, the first to be held in person since the Covid-19 crisis struck, came after both sides agreed to ""intensify"" negotiations last month. Negotiations have continued throughout the pandemic via video link. An additional five weeks of in-person talks are planned for July and early August. BBC Europe reporter Gavin Lee said the latest round of talks had broken up a day early, with a discussion between the two chief negotiators tomorrow cancelled. Mr Barnier said ""serious divergences remain"" after the four days of talks, although the EU believed an agreement was still possible. ""The EU engaged constructively, as we had already done during the fourth round of negotiations in June,"" he added. ""The EU expects, in turn, its positions to be better understood and respected in order to reach an agreement. ""We need an equivalent engagement by the United Kingdom."" Analysis by Gavin Lee, Europe reporter Talks started in Brussels on Monday and were due to last until tomorrow afternoon, but finished earlier today. It is understood very little progress was made this week - but discussions in London scheduled for next week will continue as planned. EU officials told the BBC that ""one positive is that the UK now appears to understand our position more clearly on the areas of disagreement"". Officials on both sides were keen to play down the decision to end talks early. One EU official told the BBC that the planned discussion for this afternoon was for ""extra questions to be raised"" and that ""it wasn't a ""huge issue"" that the two negotiators wouldn't meet tomorrow. Mr Barnier underlined that the EU expects ""parallel progress"" in all areas of the negotiations. This is a point of difference with the UK - which wants to negotiate separate agreements in areas such as fisheries, alongside a basic free trade deal. Mr Barnier also reiterated the EU would not agree to a deal without ""robust"" guarantees on the so-called ""level playing field"" for competition between business. He added this would include the area of state support for companies. Just like when it was an EU member, the UK remains tied to the bloc's ""state aid"" rules during the 11-month transition period due to end in December 2020. David Frost (L) is due to take up a role as UK national security adviser in August. The UK has not yet unveiled plans for its post-Brexit state aid regime, but PM Boris Johnson has previously said he wants to make it easier for the UK governmentto provide assistance to struggling firms. The two sides also remain deadlocked over the issue of fishing rights - an area where they had previously pledged to find agreement by last month. The EU wants to uphold its existing access to British waters for vessels from member states, to avoid economic disruption for their fishermen. But the UK wants to hold annual talks with the bloc over access to its waters, as it currently does with nations such as Norway. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?

Katie Price calls for penalties for online abuse,"This video can not be played Katie Price: âThe trolling is so bad, it is ridiculous, something has to be done.â There has to be ""some kind of justice"" for those who are bullied online, ex-model Katie Price has told MPs. Appearing virtually at the Commons Petitions Committee, the reality TV star said trolling was getting worse because there were ""no consequences"". Ms Price spoke about the abuse her disabled son Harvey has received, as part of an inquiry into the issue. The PM has said the government is ""working at pace"" on new legislation against ""online harms"". But Lord Puttnam, chairman of the Lords Democracy and Digital Committee, said earlier this week that the government's landmarkonline protection bill could be delayed for years. The Online Harms Bill may not come into effect until 2023 or 2024, he warned. The government, however, said the legislation would be introduced ""as soon as possible"". When the government first outlined proposals in its ""online harms"" white paper last year, critics raised concerns about risks to freedom of expression. 'Online abuse has increased during lockdown' Lords criticise 'unacceptable' delay to Online Harms law How can governments regulate social media? Ofcom eyes big fines for harmful online content The petitions committee say they want to end online abuse, especially as more people spend time online in lockdown. MPs are calling for evidence as part of their new inquiry, ""Tackling Online Abuse"", from campaigning organisations, legal professionals, social media companies and other experts. Speaking to MPs, Ms Price - who used to be known as Jordan - said: ""Throughout the years I get a lot of trolling and online abuse, the difference is I'm able to speak out myself, but my son Harvey was born with disabilities, he gets a lot of racial abuse, disgusting despicable things. ""He gets memes made about it, TikToks, posters, he gets mocked in such a serious disgusting way, there has to be some kind of justice."" She suggested to MPs that social media companies should carry out ID checks on users and there should also be fines. Her mother, Amy, told the meeting there should be an online register of offenders. Katie Price with her son Harvey in 2018, who was trolled online because of his disabilities ""People think it's funny to show to their friends, there is no penalty, they might get their account closed down but they open it in another name or another email address and carry on,"" Ms Price said. ""Nothing has improved, things have got worse."" Ms Price added: ""There needs to be fines in place, there needs to be consequences... if there are consequences online people will be careful because there will be fines or they will be put on the register, it might not stop everything but it might make people start thinking."" Ms Price first appeared before the Petitions Committee in 2018, after more than 220,000 people signed her petition to make online abuse a criminal offence. Committee chairman Catherine McKinnell said: ""It is clear there is a big problem, it is getting worse, not better and something needs to be done."" She said the government had looked into the issue and a proposal document - a white paper - had been produced. She said the work had stalled because of the coronavirus pandemic but the committee was now attempting to raise profile of the issue and its ""urgency"". The MP said the committee will be taking evidence from social media companies as part of the inquiry. This video can not be played Towie's Bobby Norris sees 'terrifying rise' in online abuse It comes after The Only Way is Essex star, Bobby Norris, spoke to MPs to share his experiences with homophobic abuse. More than 133,000 people signed his petition on tackling trolling. Addressing the issue of ""online harms"" in the Commons last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""There is a real risk that, during the lockdown, terrible things have been going on behind closed doors and closed curtains in this country on the internet. ""We had a summit on the matter in Number 10 recently, and we are working at pace, as he knows, on new legislation against online harms."" But when the government first published its online harms white paper last year, Index on Censorship, a campaigning organisation, said the plans risked damaging freedom of expression in the UK. It said a proposed new statutory duty of care to tackle online ""harms"" and ""substantial fines"" would ""create a strong incentive for companies to remove content"". ""The 'harms' are not clearly defined but include activities and materials that are legal,"" the organisation said. Elsewhere, Ofcom's boss has said the watchdog will not hesitate to impose fines on social media firms who fail to deal with harmful content, if, as expected, it is appointed as regulator. Chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said Ofcom would also consider temporarily suspending platforms in extreme cases of harm.

Zuckerberg: Advertisers will be back 'soon enough'Facebook's chief dismisses claims in leaked comments that the ads boycott poses a financial threat.,"As the ads boycott grows, Mark Zuckerberg shows no sign of backing down. ""My guess is that all these advertisers will be back on the platform soon enough"" the Facebook chief executive has said. Campaigners accuse the tech firm of being too slow and reluctant to remove some hateful content. But Zuckerberg added: ""We're not going to change our policies or approach on anything because of a threat to a small percent of our revenue."" The comments were made to Facebook staff at a private meeting last Friday, and weresubsequently leaked to the Information news site,external. The social network has confirmed they are accurate and also announced a fresh development: its chief executive is to meet the organisers of the boycott - Stop Hate for Profit. It illustrates the concurrent ways Facebook is dealing with the matter. The educational group behind the TV show Sesame Street is among those who have said they will refrain from running ads on Facebook The first is to be publicly conciliatory: offer smaller changes and hit home its message that hate has no place on the platform. The second is to privately play down the impact of the boycott: reassure advertisers and resist any fundamental changes to Facebook's business model. Yesterday the firm's global affairs chief, Sir Nick Clegg, published an open letter to the ad world. He attempted to assuage fears the company hadn't done enough to combat hate. Not surprisingly, he didn't echo his boss and add: ""You'll be back."" Now, of course companies have different internal- and external-facing messages. But this one in particular underlines the delicate tightrope that Facebook is trying to tread. The company is undoubtedly rattled by this boycott. According to a list compiled by its organisers,more than 600 brands are now involved,external. This week Facebook sent an email to companies and ad agencies assuring them it was doing all it could to remove hate speech. ""This work is never finished, and we're proud of how our apps can help people come together, learn, and organize against hate and show their solidarity"" an email to one ad agency said. But the boycott isn't hurting Facebook as much as you might think. In fact, Zuckerberg, in that same employee meeting, called the problem a ""reputational and a partner issue"" rather than a financial one. And he has a point. The vast majority of large companies are still advertising with Facebook. And thousands upon thousands of small-to-medium-sized businesses are doing likewise. One advertising executive sent me an expletive-riddled text yesterday, dismissing the idea its clients would stop advertising on Facebook. It's that kind of message that gives Zuckerberg reason to be bullish. Facebook flaw let 5,000 developers gather personal data Lego pulls ads on Facebook over 'hate speech' Could a boycott kill Facebook? Areeq Chowdhury, from WebRoots Democracy, also believes the companies that have joined the boycott will come back. ""The advertising being offered by these internet giants is unparalleled."" he says. ""The level of targeting they can achieve is not matched anywhere else, so I find it hard to believe that a lot of them will stop advertising in the long run."" That seems to be what the market thinks, too. After a dip in Facebook's share price, it's back to pretty much where it was last week. So, Facebook's strategy so far seems to be working. The far greater worry is contagion - for example, if users started to leave Facebook and Instagram in large numbers in response to the boycott. But once again, there's little evidence of that happening. Mr Zuckerberg last gave testimony to US lawmakers in October 2019 On Wednesday, it was confirmed that Zuckerberg - along with Google's Sundar Pichai, Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos - would testify before Congress in an antitrust hearing later this month. If the boycott continues to gather force, it could be an uncomfortable encounter, however secure Facebook may feel.

"Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend?","After the death of US financier Jeffrey Epstein in jail, his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, came into the spotlight. Her trial on sex trafficking and other charges begins this week in New York City, where she has been jailed since her arrest in July 2020. She faces charges in the US after being arrested by the FBIon suspicion of having assisted Epstein's abuse of minors by helping to recruit and groom victims known to be underage. Four charges relate to the years 1994-97 when she was, according to the indictment, among Epstein's closest associates and also in an ""intimate relationship"" with him. Two other charges - of sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor - came in an amended indictment and relate to the period 2001 and 2004. Another two charges are allegations of perjury in 2016. She has pleaded not guilty on all charges. Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited, without the chance of bail, his trial on sex trafficking charges. Details of the allegations against Ms Maxwell emerged earlierin documents unsealed by a US judge,externalin August 2019 in a 2015 defamation case. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Ghislaine Maxwell 'won't get fair trial' - brother Virginia Giuffre, an alleged victim of Epstein, has accused Ms Maxwell of recruiting her as a masseuse to the financier at the age of 15. She sued Ms Maxwell in 2015 for defamation - a case which has since been settled - after the media heiress, daughter of the late newspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell, said Ms Giuffre was a liar. Ms Maxwell denies any wrongdoing. The daughter of a disgraced newspaper tycoon, Ms Maxwell (R) is a well-connected socialite Another of Epstein's alleged victims, Sarah Ransome, has told BBC Panorama that Ms Maxwell worked closely with him. She said: ""Ghislaine controlled the girls. She was like the madam. She was like the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation."" Ms Ransome said Ms Maxwell would visit Epstein on his private island in the Caribbean ""to make sure that the girls were doing what they were supposed to be doing"". She added: ""She knew what Jeffrey liked. She worked and helped maintain Jeffrey's standard by intimidation, by intimidating the girls, so this was very much a joint effort."" Ms Maxwell has previously denied any involvement in or knowledge of Epstein's abuse. Born on Christmas Day in 1961 outside Paris, Ms Maxwell is Oxford-educated and said to speak several languages, A well-connected socialite, she is said to have introduced Epstein to many of her wealthy and powerful friends, including Bill Clinton and the Duke of York(who was accused in the court papers of touching a woman at Jeffrey Epstein's US home, although the court subsequently struck out allegations against the duke). Buckingham Palace has said that ""any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors"" by the duke was ""categorically untrue"". Friends said that although Ms Maxwell and Epstein's romantic relationship lasted only a few years, she continued to work with him long afterward,the Washington Post reports,external. ""She had an upbringing and taste,externaland knew how to run a house and a boat and how to entertain,"" an acquaintance is quoted by the UK's Daily Telegraph as saying. ""You can't buy that. You can't buy access, either."" In a Vanity Fair profile published in 2003,Epstein said Ms Maxwell was not a paid employee, but rather his ""best friend"",external. In court documents, former employees at the Epstein mansion in Palm Beach describe her as the house manager, who oversaw the staff, handled finances and served as social co-ordinator, the Post reports. Ms Maxwell is the daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell, his ninth and youngest child. She is said to have had a very close relationship with her late father, and he named his luxury yacht - the Lady Ghislaine - after her. Ghislaine was said to be very close to her father, Robert Maxwell, who died nearly 30 years ago It was near this yacht that his body was found in the sea off the Canary Islands in November 1991. Although a verdict of accidental drowning was recorded, the mystery surrounding the circumstances of his death was never cleared up. The strange allure of Robert Maxwell,external He had succeeded in building a global publishing empire, but after his death, it emerged that  he had taken money from pension funds of his Mirror Group Newspapers to keep his companies afloat and boost the share price. Soon after her father's death, Ms Maxwell left the UK to settle in America, where she worked in real estate, and not long after met Jeffrey Epstein. She sold her Manhattan townhouse in 2016, and kept a low profile until she was arrested last July at her secluded mansion in the state of New Hampshire.

Back-to-school plans leaked,"Pupils will face the front, but the safety plans will not be based on social distancing The return-to-school plans for autumn in England will involve entire year groups staying in separate ""bubbles"". A draft of the plans, set to be announced later this week, has beenpublished by the Huffington Post,external. It means that groups of up to 240 pupils could be kept apart within a school, with a separate time for starting and finishing. It could also mean they would all be sent home if there was a Covid-19 case in the group. There will also be a recognition of the need for pupils to catch up after months out of regular lessons, with an emphasis on core subjects such as English and maths. The plans, understood to be draft documents shared as part of a consultation, show the approach to safety in the autumn is an expansion of the ""protective bubble"" approach already used. Penalty fines for missing school next term All pupils back in school full-time in September Â£1bn catch-up tutoring plan for autumn 2 metre distancing would mean schools part-time Rather than relying on social distancing, the aim is to limit the points at which the infection could be spread, by keeping pupils in separate, isolated groups through the school day, with their own breaks and lunchtimes. In primary schools this term, these bubbles have been up to 15 pupils, but in the plans for the autumn they could include a full secondary year group, which if there were eight classes, could be 240 pupils. In primary schools in the autumn, the bubbles are expected to be a whole class of 30 pupils. In secondary school entire year groups could be kept apart in the protective ""bubble"" system If a pupil shows coronavirus symptoms, parents will have to quickly come to collect their child. ""While waiting, the child should be kept 2m away from the supervising teacher,"" says the leaked guidance. ""If that is not possible, in the case of a young child or one with complex needs, staff should wear full PPE - disposable gloves, a disposable apron, a fluid-resistant surgical face mask and in some cases eye goggles."" There will not be any fixed social distancing requirements for pupils in primary school - and in secondary it will be 1m, but only where possible, the leaked documents suggest. But teachers will be expected to maintain social distancing at the front of a class - in classrooms in which pupils will face forward, rather than facing each other around circular tables. On Monday, the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson promised a comprehensive track and trace system would be in place for autumn. That would allow year groups or schools to be closed down if there were Covid-19 cases, or if there were signs of a local upsurge infections. There will be routines of regular hand-washing, but there are not expected to be temperature checks or masks, either for staff or pupils. Pupils will be encouraged to get back on track with their learning when schools return for full-time lessons. Attendance will be compulsory - with confirmation on Monday that penalty fines can once again be issued to parents who do not send their children back to school, at the usual level of Â£60 and then Â£120 for late payment. And there will be a push on helping children to catch up in English and maths, which could include narrowing options in GCSE subjects and repeating work from before the lockdown. An increase in disruptive behaviour is anticipated - but it is expected that Ofsted will not be carrying out routine inspections during the term. In response to the leaked documents, a Department for Education spokesman said there would be continuing consultation, ahead of the full plans being published this week. ""We've said we want to see all children back at school in September - returning to full primary and secondary class sizes in a safe way,"" said the DfE spokesman.

BBC announces cuts to English regional shows,"The BBC is to cut 450 jobs in its English regional TV news and current affairs, local radio and online news. Seven of the 20 presenters on 6.30pm regional TV bulletins will be cut, and some local radio shows will be axed. Inside Out will be replaced by a new investigative journalism programme, which will have six regional editions instead of the previous 11. The cuts are expected to save Â£25m by 2022, and follow news of job losses in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The BBC has previously said it must save Â£125m this year because of financial pressures resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. More than 150 roles are due to be lost in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the corporation announced in June. The proposed cuts are on top of the 450 redundancies previously announced -and subsequently put on hold- by BBC News. The new TV show to replace the magazine programme Inside Out will feature a single 30-minute investigation per episode, and will be made in London, Newcastle, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol and Norwich. That means weekly current affairs programmes will no longer be made in Plymouth, Southampton, Tunbridge Wells, Nottingham and Salford. Regional TV and online news teams will be merged, and there will no longer be an online editorial hub in Birmingham. In the 39 local radio stations, the ""simplified"" schedule that was introduced when the pandemic began in March will be made permanent. The stations previously often had different programme schedules, but each will now have three daytime shows with one presenter. Any shows with two hosts will go down to one. The 11 regional Sunday morning political programmes, which have been replaced during the coronavirus pandemic by a single show, will all return but will undergo a ""creative review"". Regional morning news bulletins, which were cut during the pandemic, will also return. Helen Thomas, the director of BBC England, said the corporation's local and regional services were created more than 50 years ago, and ""have changed very little and need significant reinvention"". Stephen Fry, Fern Britton and Sir Lenny Henry signed a letter protesting against BBC regional cuts She said: ""That has meant taking some difficult decisions. ""We are in the age of the Facebook community group and the WhatsApp neighbourhood chat. We must adapt to better reflect how people live their lives, how they get their news and what content they want. ""We're going to modernise our offer to audiences in England by making digital a central part of everything we do. We'll take forward lessons from Covid-19 that will make us more agile and more in touch with communities while also ensuring we're as efficient as we can be. ""I'm confident we can evolve our local and regional services while improving our impact and better serving our audiences."" Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said: ""These are huge cuts which will inevitably have an impact on the BBC's ability to sustain the breadth and depth of news coverage throughout England which truly reflects the diversity of the nation."" Julian Knight MP, chairman of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, drew attention to a recent BBC statement which said it was ""strongly committed to local and regional journalism"". ""This decision is a strange way of demonstrating that commitment,"" he said, adding that it was ""at odds"" with a pledge to do more journalism outside the south-east. The announcement put the expectation of ""a licence-fee funded quality regional news service"" in ""some doubt"", he said. Labour's shadow minister for media, Chris Matheson, said: ""While not unexpected, these cuts are still very damaging and unwelcome."" The announcement comes two weeks after dozens of broadcasters from Stephen Fry to Sir Lenny Henrysigned a letterasking the BBC not to cut its English regional current affairs programmes. ""Never has in-depth investigative journalism, holding people to account and reflecting the regional diversity of England been more important,"" it said.

PM's father criticised for lockdown trip to Greece,"Stanley Johnson posted pictures of his arriving in Athens on Wednesday Boris Johnson's father has been criticised for travelling to Greece during the coronavirus lockdown. Stanley Johnson shared a number of pictures on his Instagram account on Wednesday, showing him arriving in Athens and at an airport in a mask. He told the Daily Mail,externalhe was in the country ""on essential business"" to ensure a property he rents out was ""Covid-proof"" before holidays restart. But the former Tory MEP has come under fire for breaking lockdown rules. Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone said the incident ""stinks of one rule for them and another rule for the rest of us"". When asked about his father's behaviour, the prime minister told LBC: ""I think you really ought to raise that with him."" The Johnson family dynasty Coronavirus lockdown: All you need to know about new measures Dozens of countries not in UK quarantine The current guidance on air travel from the UK Foreign Office advises against ""all but essential international travel"" because of the virus. Anyone who then returns to the UK has to isolate for 14 days, under the government's existing rules. Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael raised concerns in the Commons, saying the prime minister could ""explain his views on the fact that apparently his own father has jetted off in defiance of the guidance to Greece"". This video can not be played Alistair Carmichael quizzes Jacob Rees-Mogg on the trip Referencing reasons given by Boris Johnson's most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, whenhe was accused of breaking the lockdown rules in March, Mr Carmichael added: ""Maybe, I don't know, he just needed an eye test or something like that, but I think we would all welcome an explanation."" Answering for the government, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""I seem to remember somewhere in the Bible that the sins of the father will be visited on the son, but I don't remember it ever being the other way round. ""I think that the honourable gentleman is really fishing desperately to try and make any criticism of the PM."" People arriving in England from more than 50 countries including France, Spain, Germany and Italy will no longer need to quarantine from 10 July, the Department for Transport has confirmed. The Scottish and Welsh government have yet to announce any changes to regulations, while in Northern Ireland, quarantine remains in place for travellers arriving from outside the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

"Hundreds arrested as crime chat network crackedPolice forces across Europe collaborated on the UK's ""most significant"" law enforcement operation.UK","This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Symonds is shown how a customised Android phone with EncroChat installed works A top-secret communications system used by criminals to trade drugs and guns has been ""successfully penetrated"", says the National Crime Agency. The NCA worked with forces across Europe on the UK's ""biggest and most significant"" law enforcement operation. Major crime figures were among over 800 Europe-wide arrests after messages on EncroChat were intercepted and decoded. More than two tonnes of drugs, several dozen guns and Â£54m in suspect cash have been seized, says the NCA. While the NCA was part of the investigation, it was initiated and led by French and Dutch police, and also involved Europol - the EU agency for law enforcement cooperation. Wil van Gemert, deputy executive director of Europol, told a press conference in the Hague that the hacking of the network had allowed the ""disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports"". Armed raids on properties resulted in more than 800 arrests across Europe The NCA says the Europe-wide operation, which lasted over three months and involved police forces across the UK, has had the biggest impact on organised crime gangs it has ever seen, with 746 UK arrests, including two law enforcement officers. UK organised crime 'chronic and corrosive' Police arrest 13 over UK's 'biggest drug conspiracy' The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, whose force made 171 arrests and seized Â£13.3m in cash, described it as a ""game changer"". She said: ""This is just the beginning. We will be disrupting organised criminal networks as a result of these operations for weeks and months and possibly years to come."" Nikki Holland, NCA director of investigations, said the operational team had described it ""as akin to cracking the enigma code"". ""They see this as that significant in terms of getting that inside information, effectively having a person inside an organised crime group telling us what they're up to,"" she said. An estimated 60,000 people, among them up to 10,000 in Britain, subscribed to France-based EncroChat, which has now been taken down. The system operated on customised Android phones and, according to its website, provided ""worry-free secure communications"".

Bank notes seized by Essex Police during the operation There was also panic wipe, where all the data on the device could be deleted by entering a four-digit code from the lock-screen. The NCA says the messaging system has been used as a ""criminal marketplace"" to co-ordinate the supply of Class A drugs across the world, and import weapons including assault rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, pistols and hand grenades. Law enforcement agencies began getting data from the site on 1 April after the encryption code is believed to have been cracked in March. Gangs are also believed to have used the handheld devices to plot attacks on rival groups, plan ways of enforcing drug debts and arrange for money to be laundered. Threats to life detailed on the site included acid attacks and threats to chop off limbs. Dozens of organised crime groups have been dismantled, says the NCA, with the bulk of arrests in London and north-west England. Lockdown ""worked in our favour"", says the agency, in that many more suspects were at home when they were raided. Many of those arrested are said to form the ""middle tier"" of crime gangs while some are described as the ""Mr and Mrs Bigs"" of the underworld. Analysis by BBC technology reporter David Molloy EncroChat sold encrypted phones with a guarantee of anonymity, with a range of special features to remove identifying information. The phones themselves cost roughly Â£900 (â¬1,000) each, with a subscription costing Â£1,350 (â¬1,500) for six months. Europol said that French police had discovered some of EncroChat's servers were located in the country, and that it was possible to put a ""technical device"" in place to access the messages. In June,rumours,externalbegan to swirl about EncroChat being compromised by law enforcement. The Netherlands' National Police said that users began to throw away their phones once the company became aware that messages were being intercepted - ""but it was too late"". Police had already intercepted millions of messages, some of which have been acted on already - and others that may be used in the future. In London, those targeted in the Met operation, codenamed ""Eternal"",  are alleged to include members of ""high-harm"" organised crime networks with longstanding links to violent crime and drug dealing. Dame Cressida said: ""These people are in business to make enormous amounts of money. Many of them lead a very respectable lifestyle - and definitely a high-end lifestyle in fancy houses with big cars going to... clubs and restaurants, splashing the cash sometimes, but sometimes being very discreet about it."" The Met said that in June, its detectives identified a plot by an international drugs and firearms gang to shoot dead a member of a rival network. According to the force, it managed to prevent the shooting by arresting an individual for conspiracy to murder and seizing a loaded pistol, which was believed to be the planned murder weapon.

We will be back at 09:00 tomorrow with the latest news stories and information. Have a good evening. Anyone travelling by bus, train, ferry or plane in Englandshould wear a face covering,externalto help reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. Therules were introduced,externalto coincide with a further easing of lockdown - including the return to class ofsome secondary school pupilsand the reopening of non-essential shops - which was expected to increase the number of people using public transport.Here are the rules. Nearly all children of legal school age will be expected to return to class full-time in September - including those with special educational needs and disabilities. The government says it wants to ""start to reverse the enormous costs of missed education"". Attendance will be mandatory again from the beginning of the autumn term. If a school has a suspected coronavirus outbreak - with two or more confirmed cases within 14 days, or an overall rise in suspected coronavirus sickness absence - teachers will work with local health protection teams. A mobile testing unit may be dispatched - focusing first on those in the affected child or teacher's class, followed by their year group, and then thewhole school if necessary. With social distancing guidance in England changing to ""one metre plus"" from 4 July, how can you invite friends and family into your home safely? Who will I be able to have in my own home? Many people won't have seen family or friends for weeks but Prof Alison Sinclair, from the University of Sussex, offers words of caution. ""The hardest but most important thing to do is to postpone the visit if anyone in either household has anyCovid-19 symptoms."" The government has announced a further Â£500m to help councils in England facing extra cost pressures as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The money - which can be spent as authorities see fit - comes on top of Â£3.2bn already received. Councils have warned of a funding black hole of up to Â£7.4bn due to increased costs, including social care, coupled with lost income from fees and charges. Labour urged ministers not to make further cuts tolocal services. BBC Match of the Day presenter and ex-England captain Gary Lineker is one of a number of sports stars calling for a big thank you to key workers on Sunday 5 July at 17:00 BST as the NHS marks its 72nd birthday. This video can not be played Sports stars calling for big thank you to key workers on Sunday. Various sporting governing bodies are encouraging the nation to come together for one final round of applause for staff who have been working on the front line during the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to Rachel Burden on BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast, Lineker said: âWe owe so much to so many people that have gone beyond the line in this period.â As Leicester becomes the first city to be subject to a local lockdown, misleading claims are being shared across social media. A number of local councils have come out on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC: ""To use this data in isolation to predict which areas will see significant increases in cases is not appropriate as it does not provide a complete picture of what is happening locally."" Experts at PHE are currently looking at outbreaks in much smaller areas, rather than whole towns or cities, to inform decisions about any future local lockdowns. We've identified posts in Facebook groups that may have led to some ofthe rumours. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Mandatory attendance for all pupils from September - Williamson Education Secretary Gavin Williamson addresses the newly released safety plans for the return to school. Many people in England are still waiting longer than 24 hours for their coronavirus test results, figures show. Four in 10 tests done by mobile units and three in 10 carried out at regional drive-thru centres were taking longer than that, data up to 24 June shows. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he expected such tests to be processed in 24 hours by the end of June. But the data - the first released on 24-hour turn-around times - showssignificant progress has been made. ""Every time my phone rings, I still think it's her,"" says Sarah Bredin-Kemp. Three months ago her friend Rebecca Mack died with suspected coronavirus, aged just 29. Since then Sarah's had to mourn Rebecca in lockdown. ""It's a really, really bizarre feeling of being a bit lost, maybe emotionally stuck,"" Sarah, who's 27, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Many young people don't like talking about grief but the pandemic means thousands now have to,here are some of their stories. Sarah (l), Rebecca (centre) and Alice used to meet for coffee every week The government has published its safety plans for the return to school in September - built on the principle of keeping classes or whole year groups apart in separate ""bubbles"". But it means if there are two confirmed coronavirus cases in 14 days, all the pupils in that group, or even the whole school, may have to be sent home. Primary pupils began to return in June but so far it has been a voluntary choice for parents Schools will have testing kits to give to parents if children show symptoms. Mobile testing units will be sent to schoolsthat have an outbreak. Leicester has become the first place in the UK to be put under a local coronavirus lockdown. Attention has mostly been focused on the city itself, but what of the suburbs on its fringes? Scott Drake thinks people will just ""go down the road"" to avoid lockdown Oadby, a town to the south east of Leicester, has come into closer proximity with the city due to the steady expansion of both and is included in the lockdown area. Do Oadby's residents feel this is justified? Are they optimistic about the future?Do they feel part of the city or look to the county? Circles designed to help shoppers and sunbathers in Newcastle city centre stay socially distanced have been worn or washed away after less than a month. They werepainted on popular patches of grass,including Old Eldon Square and around St Thomas' Church, to help people stay 2m apart. It was done in advance of the city becoming busier as shops reopened and people came out to enjoy the sunny weather. The city council has said it will berepainting them. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit After Leicester, parts of Yorkshire and the north-west of England have recorded the highest rates of new coronavirus infections, according to new data. However, all but two of the top 10 areas for rates of infection in the week ending 28 June saw a fall compared with the week before, Public Health England reported. Leicester, however, remains far ahead of the others, with three times as many new cases per 100,000 people as Bradford. Bedford, the only top 10 place other than Leicester not in the north, has seen its rate of new cases fall by half in a week. The new data combines two sets of coronavirus tests - those done in hospitals and involving care workers and previously unpublished local figures on tests outside of hospitals. From 4 July in England, multi-screen cinemas will stagger film start and end times, to avoid congestion in foyers. There will be hand-sanitising stations and - don't tell the kids - pick 'n' mix stands will be removed. Film-lovers will also find a number of empty seats or rows between themselves and other groups, depending on the size of the cinema. Admit One, which provides ticketing services for cinemas and multiplexes, says it can automatically enable socially distanced seating, creating ""bubbles"" of empty seats around groups when they book. And some cinemas may not let customers choose where they sit, as this could affect their ability to reach maximum capacity. The average seat in cinemas is about 60cm (2ft) wide and 97cm deep, Admit One says. So to meet 2m distancing rules, cinemas would have had to block out 12 seats around a single cinemagoer, or 16 around a couple. Find out more about what social distancing in cinemas, bars and restaurants will look like. School pupils in Leicester are being kept at home once again, after the city was made subject to the UK's first local lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has ordered schools in the city to close to all but a small number of pupils following a surge in coronavirus cases. Magda Raszowska said it was ""like going back to March"" He said although children were at low risk of serious harm from Covid-19, they can spread the infection. Schools had been allowed to welcome back some year groups from 1 June. The tighter restrictions are also affecting schools outside the lockdown area, with pupils told to stay away if they livewithin the affected area. Ben HunteBBC London There has been a significant rise during lockdown in the UK in the number of LGBT people seeking suicide-prevention support. Support group LGBT Hero reports 11,000 people have accessed its suicide-prevention web pages - up over 44% on the first three months of the year. And other LGBT charities have service users who have killed themselves. The government considers LGBT people to be at higher risk of suicide but no national data on LGBT suicides is kept.Read the full story.

The UK's first local lockdown has been introduced in Leicester, following a spike in coronavirus cases. How will they be enforced and how could they be used elsewhere? Residents will have to stay at home as much as they can, while people in other parts of Englandwill have more freedom. Home schooling is causing stress in millions of homes across the UK. BBC newsreader Kate Silverton, who is also a trainee child psychotherapist and a mother-of-two, has like most parents found lockdown a very challenging time. ""Home schooling may have been a success for some but in my overall experience - and that of the parents I have spoken to - those successes have been few and far between,"" she writes. ""Whether at the school gates, or in the counselling arena, mums and dads tell me they cannot cope. I would go so far to say that anyone who thinks working and schooling young children from home has been a success is sadly ill-informed."" ""My husband and I have tried to make the memories of this time more joyful and positive. So we camped in our (courtyard) garden and have had more late nights, cuddled up watching movies than we would have done previously. However, it has inevitably been a very demanding time for everyone. ""When people ask how I am doing, I often joke that I am ""surviving not thriving"". When the work calls start, it is very hard to be there for our children.""Read the full story. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hundreds arrested as crime chat network crackedPolice forces across Europe collaborated on the UK's ""most significant"" law enforcement operation.","This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Symonds is shown how a customised Android phone with EncroChat installed works A top-secret communications system used by criminals to trade drugs and guns has been ""successfully penetrated"", says the National Crime Agency. The NCA worked with forces across Europe on the UK's ""biggest and most significant"" law enforcement operation. Major crime figures were among over 800 Europe-wide arrests after messages on EncroChat were intercepted and decoded. More than two tonnes of drugs, several dozen guns and Â£54m in suspect cash have been seized, says the NCA. While the NCA was part of the investigation, it was initiated and led by French and Dutch police, and also involved Europol - the EU agency for law enforcement cooperation. Wil van Gemert, deputy executive director of Europol, told a press conference in the Hague that the hacking of the network had allowed the ""disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports"". Armed raids on properties resulted in more than 800 arrests across Europe The NCA says the Europe-wide operation, which lasted over three months and involved police forces across the UK, has had the biggest impact on organised crime gangs it has ever seen, with 746 UK arrests, including two law enforcement officers. UK organised crime 'chronic and corrosive' Police arrest 13 over UK's 'biggest drug conspiracy' The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, whose force made 171 arrests and seized Â£13.3m in cash, described it as a ""game changer"". She said: ""This is just the beginning. We will be disrupting organised criminal networks as a result of these operations for weeks and months and possibly years to come."" Nikki Holland, NCA director of investigations, said the operational team had described it ""as akin to cracking the enigma code"". ""They see this as that significant in terms of getting that inside information, effectively having a person inside an organised crime group telling us what they're up to,"" she said. An estimated 60,000 people, among them up to 10,000 in Britain, subscribed to France-based EncroChat, which has now been taken down. The system operated on customised Android phones and, according to its website, provided ""worry-free secure communications"". Customers had access to features such as self-destructing messages that deleted from the recipient's device after a certain length of time. Bank notes seized by Essex Police during the operation There was also panic wipe, where all the data on the device could be deleted by entering a four-digit code from the lock-screen.

Primark presses ahead with new store openings,"Primark is going ahead with plans to open five new stores in the US, France and Poland, despite economic uncertainty over the coronavirus. It comes as otherHigh Street brands cut costs and lay off staff. The latest update from Primark owner AB Foods revealed the full impact of the lockdown on trade, with Primark's sales down 75% in the past quarter. Now though, all but eight of Primark's 375 stores are trading again. Since reopening, Primark shoppers have been buying up children's wear, leisure clothes and night wear. Summer fashion items such as shorts and T-shirts are also in high demand, while sales of men's formalwear and travel-related goods are down. Shantel Brown and her daughter Tee went to Primark's Milton Keynes store the day it reopened Eager customers lined up outside Primark storeson the day they reopened in England in mid-June. That pent-up demand resulted in strong trade at the tills: the company has reported it sold more in the week ending 20 June than it did in the same week last year, across the UK and Ireland. Primark says stores in regional areas and retail parks are doing well, but city centre stores continue to suffer from a lack of tourists and much lower footfall. This video can not be played What's it now like shopping for clothes? Nonetheless, the chain is optimistic about the next few months and has placed orders worth more than Â£800m for the coming autumn/winter season. Primark's new US stores are planned for New Jersey and Florida, although the company says retail restrictions due to Covid-19 may push back their opening dates. The new openings will bring the total number of US stores to 11. In France, Primark will be opening in the Belle Epine and Plaisir shopping centres in Paris. The company is also set to open its first new store in Poland, in the capital, Warsaw. In the coming months, Primark will also expand existing stores in Malaga and Lisbon. Shoppers waited in the rain from 05:30 when Primark reopened in Glasgow on 29 June Primark was hit particularly hard by the lockdownmeasures, as it does not have an online store or offer click-and-collect services for its products. Before the lockdown, it had been generating sales of Â£650m a month. Commenting on the financial results, Emma-Lou Montgomery from Fidelity Personal Investing said: ""Primark's full-year operating profit is expected to be a third of what it was last year, coming in at between Â£300m and Â£350m, but that's really no surprise when all 375 stores had closed by 22 March. ""The absence of an online shopping site didn't help and will have held it back when compared to its competitors. But as we have seen, with queues forming from 05:00 on reopening day - open the stores and shoppers will come,"" she said. Primark's move to expand its global empire is in contrast with moves made by other retailers battling tough economic conditions brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. This week, John Lewis announced it would be closing stores and cutting an unconfirmed number of staff, while Harrods, TM Lewin and Topshop's owner Arcadia announced hundreds of job cuts.

The latest developments are:  We'll be back tomorrow morning to give you the latest updates across Wales. Have a good evening and stay safe and well. A trade union has called for urgent government intervention after the announcement that the majority of 1,730 UKAirbus job cuts will be at Broughton in Flintshire. Peter Hughes, Unite
Wales regional secretary, said the number of jobs being lost was ""far larger than we originally anticipated"". ""Our calls for Boris
Johnsonâs government to intervene in the crisis that is engulfing the aerospace
sector have so far fallen on deaf ears,"" he said. ""They canât hide anymore - the voices of
thousands of workers and their families from across north Wales and north west
England are screaming for help."" Daz Reynolds, Unite
convenor at Airbus Broughton offered support to members following the ""desperate news"". âOur members at Broughton are devastated to hear of the scale of the job losses for our site. ""We are a world class workforce who have built up Broughton to be one of the best manufacturing sites in Europe. ""The workforce recognises the enormous challenges facing Airbus and are prepared to look at every avenue available to mitigate the proposed job losses."" The man in charge of Transport for Wales says passengers are returning to the railways, but there had been ""a complete evaporation of revenue"". Chief executive James Price told the Senedd's economy committee that a predicted 60% reduction in usage quickly turned into a 95% drop. Mr Price said the impact of the fall in passenger numbers was compounded by refunds on tickets. While saying passengers were starting to come back and sticking to social distancing rules, he warned that in England the two-metre rule was being breached ""too frequently for my liking, particularly on commuter services"". Asked about Covid-19 safety on trains in Wales, Mr Price said: ""We have taken all the steps possible to make travelling with us as safe as it is to do anything else in society."" Facial coverings are compulsory on public transport in England, and recommended in Wales This video can not be played People will have to pre-book and have table service when pubs and restaurants reopen, the Welsh Government has said. International Relations Minister Eluned Morgan outlined how businesses in the sector can slowly start to reopen from 13 July. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, she said customers would be limited to outdoor spaces at first. Public Health Wales says another eight deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales have been confirmed, taking the official total to 1,524. This graph shows the total number of deaths for each day according to when they happened, rather than when they were announced. Another eight people with coronavirus in Wales have died, taking the official total to 1,524, This map shows how many of these deaths have been reported in each of the seven Welsh health board areas. Pub chain Wetherspoon says it will not reopen its
beer gardens in Wales on 13 July, despite Welsh Government plans to allow outdoor drinking from that date. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie
Gershon said: âWe are looking forward to opening all of our pubs in Wales as
and when the Welsh Government gives the go-ahead. âWe will not be opening our
beer gardens in advance of that.â Meanwhile SA Brain chief executive Alistair Darby said his firm was only likely to open ""one or two"" of its 104 managed pubs from 13 July. Of its 60 other pubs run by tenants, he expected ""at the very most"" 30 to 40 would open. He said he was ""sceptical about the practicality"", saying ""no-one want to go down the road and expense of things like marquees"". Eight more people with
coronavirus are reported to have died in Wales, taking the total to 1,524. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures also showed there were 41 new cases reported, meaning 15,815 people have tested positive for Covid-19. To date, 141,543 people have
been tested for coronavirus in Wales, with 125,728 testing
negative. A total of 187,350 tests have
been carried out, with some people having been tested more than once. Welsh Conservatives have welcomed the news that self-contained holiday accommodation in Wales could now reopen on Saturday 11 July, two days earlier than originally planned. Darren Millar, member of the Senedd (MS) for Clwyd West and the party's spokeman for Covid recovery, said: âWe are pleased that the Labour-led Welsh Government has again listened to calls to bring forward the opening of self-contained accommodation to rescue another important weekend of trading for the visitor economy. âWe hope that ministers will also look to winding back the reopening of our hospitality industry so that more businesses and livelihoods can also be protected.â It will be ""difficult"" for the hospitality sector to stick to the two-metre social distancing rule, Welsh Government minister Eluned Morgan says. She said the government and the sector were ""working on putting in additional protection measures in place"" and these were ""being checked"" by the Welsh Government's chief medical officer. The comments came as it was confirmed that pubs, cafes and restaurants would be allowed to reopen outdoor areas to customers from 13 July. It will be the responsibility of individual hospitality
businesses to ensure social distancing guidance is followed when they reopen, Welsh Government minister Eluned Morgan says. She said it had been suggested that each business
appoints someone to ensure the rules are followed. Speaking at the daily briefing, Ms Morgan said: âWe're
working with the sector to develop the guidelines, and one of the suggestions
is that there will be a person responsible within each hospitality facility to
be responsible for making sure that they comply with the mitigation rules that
we'll be putting in place. ""That will be the responsibility then of that
person to make sure that compliance is managed and contained according to the
guidelines that we'll be setting out. âSo the owner of the pub will have the responsibility of
making sure that compliance is adhered to. âObviously we'll be speaking in the next few weeks with
the police and local authorities. âThose conversations are already underway, and there will
be obviously rules in place that they undertake at the moment in terms of
compliance, so that will be an extension to what they do at the moment.â Ministers are âworking closelyâ with
Public Health Wales âto make sure that we can trace people who have attended
different hospitality areas,"" Eluned Morgan said. âThere will be an expectation that people will need to
pre-book, and that those names will be taken so all of those measures will be
put in place,â she said. The Welsh Government was âworking out that detail with
Public Health Wales at the moment,â she added. The Welsh Government will take âevery stepâ that it can to make
sure the first phase of reopening the hospitality sector is a success, International Relations Minister Eluned Morgan says. Some pubs and restaurants in Wales will be
able to reopen outdoors from 13 July, provided that coronavirus cases
continue to fall. When asked whether the Welsh
Governmentâs cautious approach in a phased reopening of the sector could put
jobs at risk, she said: âIf we open too quickly as we have
seen in some parts of the world, weâll just simply have to go back into
lockdown and that's not a place we want to be.â She said the Welsh Government was taking a
âstep by stepâ approach and working with the sector. Discussions on how to control drinkers as lockdown eases have taken place between the Welsh Government and representatives from pubs and bars. Answering questions at the daily briefing, minister Eluned Morgan said: ""In our discussions with the sector they've made
it absolutely clear that in terms of controlling the situation if things get
out of hand - that is their bread and butter, that is what they do, day in and day
out."" She added: ""We do
have to look at the balance between managing drinking in a controlled
environment and, as you say, avoiding those scenes that we saw on Ogmore beach
recently. ""Those people who have the experience of running clubs,
understand better perhaps than many, how to control people in that situation
with alcohol."" Airbusâsplans to cut 1,435 jobs at
its Broughton siteis âdevastating newsâ, Ms Morgan said. She said that the figure was âlarger than fearedâ. âThis is clearly devastating news, not just for
Airbus and people who are employed there, but for the entire economy of Wales. âWe have to understand the impact and the contribution that
that company makes to the broader economy of Wales as well. âClearly this is a larger number of jobs than we feared may
happen and of course this will underline our determination to ensure that we
work with the people in that factory, that we work with Airbus, that we work
with the unions, and we make sure that we put those support mechanisms in
place. âCrucially also, we will be working with the UK government
to make sure that we keep on pressing to see if we can get more specific
support for the sector.â Welsh Government minister Eluned Morgan said the health of customers and employees must come first when pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants re-open. She said the first phase would start on Monday 13 July with the reopening of outdoor spaces owned by the business and subject to existing licenses. The reopening depended on coronavirus conditions continuing ""to be favourable"" and was subject to the outcome of next weekâs review of the regulations, Ms Morgan said. She said businesses would have to comply with clear guidelines to reduce the risk of coronavirus, such as pre-booking and table service. The minister added the reopening of indoor services would be considered later, depending on the success of outdoor opening. ""We are intensely aware that the phasing out of furlough will bring increased pressure on the sector by the start of August,"" she said. Self-contained holiday accommodation in Wales may be able to open a week on Saturday, two days ahead of what was previously announced. Welsh Government minister Eluned Morgan said the ""next milestone"" for the tourism sector would be a week today when the decision will be taken. ""If the scientific and medical advice supports re-opening, self-contained accommodation will be able to re-open from 11 July. ""We have brought this forward from 13 July, after discussing this further with the sector, to enable bookings to be taken from the Saturday to Saturday. ""By self-contained, we mean accommodation without any shared facilities."" Outdoor visitor attractions could be allowed to open from next Monday, 6 July, Welsh Government minister Eluned
Morgan has said. Giving the daily coronavirus briefing, she said First Minister Mark Drakeford ""has indicated"" the requirement to stay local will be lifted from Monday if cases of Covid-19 continue to decline in Wales. She said he would be making an announcement about this at his press conference tomorrow. ""If the requirement to stay local is lifted, this will allow all outdoor visitor attractions to open â but, they will have to follow the rules on social distancing and hand hygiene, and they will need follow the guidelines we have set out."" She added: ""But, for the time being, indoor visitor attractions will need to stay closed â this is because coronavirus lives for longer on indoor surfaces, increasing the risk of transmission. ""However, we will continue to work with the sector towards re-opening indoor attractions and options will be considered at the next review of the regulations on 9 July."" Cardiff Castle says it wants to make up for lost time by giving local residents an extra three months of free visits. The attraction already allows people who live or work in Cardiff to apply for a ""castle key"" that gives free admission for three years. Allow Twitter content?

Hundreds arrested as secret crime chat-room busted,"This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Symonds is shown how a customised Android phone with EncroChat installed works A top-secret communications system used by criminals to trade drugs and guns has been ""successfully penetrated"", says the National Crime Agency. The NCA worked with forces across Europe on the UK's ""biggest and most significant"" law enforcement operation. Major crime figures were among over 800 Europe-wide arrests after messages on EncroChat were intercepted and decoded. More than two tonnes of drugs, several dozen guns and Â£54m in suspect cash have been seized, says the NCA. While the NCA was part of the investigation, it was initiated and led by French and Dutch police, and also involved Europol - the EU agency for law enforcement cooperation. Wil van Gemert, deputy executive director of Europol, told a press conference in the Hague that the hacking of the network had allowed the ""disruption of criminal activities including violent attacks, corruption, attempted murders and large-scale drug transports"". Armed raids on properties resulted in more than 800 arrests across Europe The NCA says the Europe-wide operation, which lasted over three months and involved police forces across the UK, has had the biggest impact on organised crime gangs it has ever seen, with 746 UK arrests, including two law enforcement officers. UK organised crime 'chronic and corrosive' Police arrest 13 over UK's 'biggest drug conspiracy' The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, whose force made 171 arrests and seized Â£13.3m in cash, described it as a ""game changer"". She said: ""This is just the beginning. We will be disrupting organised criminal networks as a result of these operations for weeks and months and possibly years to come."" Nikki Holland, NCA director of investigations, said the operational team had described it ""as akin to cracking the enigma code"". ""They see this as that significant in terms of getting that inside information, effectively having a person inside an organised crime group telling us what they're up to,"" she said. An estimated 60,000 people, among them up to 10,000 in Britain, subscribed to France-based EncroChat, which has now been taken down. The system operated on customised Android phones and, according to its website, provided ""worry-free secure communications"". Customers had access to features such as self-destructing messages that deleted from the recipient's device after a certain length of time. Bank notes seized by Essex Police during the operation There was also panic wipe, where all the data on the device could be deleted by entering a four-digit code from the lock-screen. The NCA says the messaging system has been used as a ""criminal marketplace"" to co-ordinate the supply of Class A drugs across the world, and import weapons including assault rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, pistols and hand grenades. Law enforcement agencies began getting data from the site on 1 April after the encryption code is believed to have been cracked in March. Gangs are also believed to have used the handheld devices to plot attacks on rival groups, plan ways of enforcing drug debts and arrange for money to be laundered. Threats to life detailed on the site included acid attacks and threats to chop off limbs. Dozens of organised crime groups have been dismantled, says the NCA, with the bulk of arrests in London and north-west England. Lockdown ""worked in our favour"", says the agency, in that many more suspects were at home when they were raided. Many of those arrested are said to form the ""middle tier"" of crime gangs while some are described as the ""Mr and Mrs Bigs"" of the underworld. Analysis by BBC technology reporter David Molloy EncroChat sold encrypted phones with a guarantee of anonymity, with a range of special features to remove identifying information. The phones themselves cost roughly Â£900 (â¬1,000) each, with a subscription costing Â£1,350 (â¬1,500) for six months. Europol said that French police had discovered some of EncroChat's servers were located in the country, and that it was possible to put a ""technical device"" in place to access the messages. In June,rumours,externalbegan to swirl about EncroChat being compromised by law enforcement. The Netherlands' National Police said that users began to throw away their phones once the company became aware that messages were being intercepted - ""but it was too late"". Police had already intercepted millions of messages, some of which have been acted on already - and others that may be used in the future. In London, those targeted in the Met operation, codenamed ""Eternal"",  are alleged to include members of ""high-harm"" organised crime networks with longstanding links to violent crime and drug dealing. Dame Cressida said: ""These people are in business to make enormous amounts of money. Many of them lead a very respectable lifestyle - and definitely a high-end lifestyle in fancy houses with big cars going to... clubs and restaurants, splashing the cash sometimes, but sometimes being very discreet about it."" The Met said that in June, its detectives identified a plot by an international drugs and firearms gang to shoot dead a member of a rival network. According to the force, it managed to prevent the shooting by arresting an individual for conspiracy to murder and seizing a loaded pistol, which was believed to be the planned murder weapon.

"Airbus to cut 1,730 jobs at UK factories","Almost a quarter of the Airbus jobs in Broughton are being lost A total of 1,730 jobs will be cut at two of aerospace giant Airbus's UK factories, the company has confirmed. It is part ofplans to axe 15,000 jobs worldwidein response to the hit it has taken during the coronavirus pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the 1,435 jobs being cut at Broughton, Flintshire and urged the UK government to ""get to grips"" with the economic crisis. A further 295 jobs will go in Filton, Bristol. Previously, the company said the jobs would go by summer 2021. Airbus, which employs 6,080 workers at Broughton, hopes the majority will come via voluntary redundancies or staff retiring early. But another 500 agency workers who were furloughed will not be returning. It said in a statement: ""This split reflects the significant impact the Covid crisis has had on the UK's commercial aircraft manufacturing activities, which are concentrated in Broughton. ""Airbus will continue to meet regularly with its trade union partners in the UK in order to identify solutions that will help us implement this adaptation while minimising the social impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the company."" Sir Keir told a call with voters in Flintshire on Thursday evening he feared it was the beginning of an economic crisis ""the like of which we haven't seen for many, many years"". ""It's one of the reasons that we've been saying to the [UK] government, it is all very well saying build build buildâ¦ but at the moment the thing that matters more than anything else is preserving jobs and having a laser-like focus on preserving and protecting jobs."" One of Airbus's senior vice presidents admitted ""it's going to be a difficult period,"" but added that the company remained ""confident in the future"" of the Broughton site. Paul McKinlay, head of major component told BBC Wales: ""If we didn't act, the viability and future of Airbus would be at stake. It's set at the right level, we believe, for when - we really hope - that recovery starts to come in two to three years, that we're ready for that brighter future."" He welcomed support given to the industry and company by both the Welsh and UK governments. ""With such devastating news and impact on our industry, any opportunity of support would be welcomed,"" he said. ""But I think if you look at the aviation sector and how much it's been devastated by this dreadful virus then I think there's quite a strong case for why the aviation sector needs support."" Earlier, Eluned Morgan, Wales' international relations minister, called the announcement ""devastating"". Baroness Morgan said it was ""a larger number of jobs than we feared may happen"" and the Welsh Government would be ""working with the UK government to make sure that we keep on pressing to see if we can get more specific support for the sector"". The cuts in Broughton represent almost a quarter of the workforce. Filton currently employs 3,200 people. The job losses in Broughton have been described as ""a hammer blow"" for the area Supports an estimated 6,000 jobs in its supply chain and spending in the local community Helped contribute Â£845m to Wales' GDP in 2015 - equivalent to 1.6% of the Welsh economy Has invested more than Â£2bn over the past 15 years at the Broughton plant Machinery and transport equipment makes up almost half of all goods Wales sells abroad Llyr Gruffydd, North Wales Member of the Senedd, said it was ""gut-wrenching"" that 1,435 jobs were being cut at Broughton. The Unite union described it as ""another act of industrial vandalism"" against the UK aerospace sector. Its regional secretary for Wales, Peter Hughes, said no one ever thought it would be ""this bad."" ""Yesterday when the announcement was 'over 1,700,' we knew that was bad, and then today over 1,400 from here, (it) is just a massive number,"" he said. ""Especially when you think that's probably about a third of the workforce. ""It is catastrophic."" Mr Hughes said the union would be pushing for no compulsory redundancies and called on the UK Government to ""make sure they deliver for Welsh workers."" There would be ""a domino effect"". ""This is going to knock all of the other dominoes down,"" he said. ""There's going to be massive knock-on effects. ""Every one worker here is six in the supply chain, you can do the sums yourself."" Some 134,000 people work for Airbus worldwide, with about 10% of them in the UK. The factory in Broughtonmakes wings for the Airbus A380- the world's largest passenger plane. The Filton site is responsible for wing assembly and equipping the Airbus A400M, a military transport plane. In April, the company warned it was ""bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed"" as it struggled with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. It said on Tuesday that production had dropped by 40% in recent months and it did not expect air traffic to get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 at the earliest. On Tuesday,EasyJet announced it had started consultations on plans to close basesat Stansted, Southend and Newcastle, with Unite saying nearly 1,300 UK crew members faced losing their jobs. The Airbus A400M is equipped at the company's Filton site Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said: ""Airbus is a huge part of north Wales' economy and provides thousands of well-paid, high-skilled jobs. This announcement is a real blow for Broughton and surrounding communities. ""We need to do all we can to support those who face losing their job at this difficult time. I hope both the UK and Welsh governments will respond quickly to put additional support in place."" Delyn MP Rob Roberts called Airbus ""a vital part of the economy in our part of the country, and I am therefore deeply concerned for workers at the plant at Broughton, their families, and our wider community"". In other industrial news: Celsa Steel UK, which employs 800 out of its 1,000-strong workforce in south Wales is to receive an emergency loan from the UK government, which the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said would allow it to continue trading. Unions say they are ""bitterly disappointed"" at the rejection of proposals to keep open the Northwood Hygiene Products tissue factory at Penygroes, Gwynedd,which is set to close with 94 job losses.

"Primark presses ahead with new store openingsAs other retailers look to cut costs, the discount fashion chain plans to open five new shops.BusinessComments","Primark is going ahead with plans to open five new stores in the US, France and Poland, despite economic uncertainty over the coronavirus. It comes as otherHigh Street brands cut costs and lay off staff. The latest update from Primark owner AB Foods revealed the full impact of the lockdown on trade, with Primark's sales down 75% in the past quarter. Now though, all but eight of Primark's 375 stores are trading again. Since reopening, Primark shoppers have been buying up children's wear, leisure clothes and night wear. Summer fashion items such as shorts and T-shirts are also in high demand, while sales of men's formalwear and travel-related goods are down. Shantel Brown and her daughter Tee went to Primark's Milton Keynes store the day it reopened Eager customers lined up outside Primark storeson the day they reopened in England in mid-June. That pent-up demand resulted in strong trade at the tills: the company has reported it sold more in the week ending 20 June than it did in the same week last year, across the UK and Ireland. Primark says stores in regional areas and retail parks are doing well, but city centre stores continue to suffer from a lack of tourists and much lower footfall. This video can not be played What's it now like shopping for clothes? Nonetheless, the chain is optimistic about the next few months and has placed orders worth more than Â£800m for the coming autumn/winter season. Primark's new US stores are planned for New Jersey and Florida, although the company says retail restrictions due to Covid-19 may push back their opening dates. The new openings will bring the total number of US stores to 11. In France, Primark will be opening in the Belle Epine and Plaisir shopping centres in Paris. The company is also set to open its first new store in Poland, in the capital, Warsaw. In the coming months, Primark will also expand existing stores in Malaga and Lisbon. Shoppers waited in the rain from 05:30 when Primark reopened in Glasgow on 29 June Primark was hit particularly hard by the lockdownmeasures, as it does not have an online store or offer click-and-collect services for its products. Before the lockdown, it had been generating sales of Â£650m a month. Commenting on the financial results, Emma-Lou Montgomery from Fidelity Personal Investing said: ""Primark's full-year operating profit is expected to be a third of what it was last year, coming in at between Â£300m and Â£350m, but that's really no surprise when all 375 stores had closed by 22 March. ""The absence of an online shopping site didn't help and will have held it back when compared to its competitors. But as we have seen, with queues forming from 05:00 on reopening day - open the stores and shoppers will come,"" she said. Primark's move to expand its global empire is in contrast with moves made by other retailers battling tough economic conditions brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. This week, John Lewis announced it would be closing stores and cutting an unconfirmed number of staff, while Harrods, TM Lewin and Topshop's owner Arcadia announced hundreds of job cuts.

Schoolchildren kept at home in local lockdown,"Magda Raszowska said it was ""like going back to March"" School pupils in Leicester have been kept at home once again, after the city was made subject to the UK's first local lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has ordered schools in the city to close to all but a small number of pupils following a surge in coronavirus cases. He said although children were at low risk of serious harm from Covid-19, they could spread the infection. Schools had been allowed to welcome back some year groups from 1 June. The tighter restrictions are also affecting schools and nurseries outside the lockdown area in Leicester, with pupils told to stay away if they live within the affected area. The Department for Education has said only vulnerable children and children of key workers could travel across the boundary in either direction for school or appointments with social workers. Paul Galvin, head teacher of St Luke's Primary School in Thurnby, said: ""It might be difficult for families who are inside the lockdown zone - as we are just outside the boundary - especially if they are not children of critical workers. ""There are a small number of children affected at our school. I am deeply sorry for the problems this may cause parents and carers."" He said the school had ""adapted and will keep adapting to changes"" during the pandemic. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says a number of under 18s have tested positive for coronavirus Magda Raszowska, whose five-year-old daughter attends Launde Primary School in Oadby, said it was ""like we're going back to March"". ""I'm sad for my kids and sad for myself but obviously safety comes first,"" she said. Fernvale Primary School, which is outside the boundary, will no longer welcome pupils like seven-year-old Ava who lives inside the boundary. Her parents said they felt sad their daughter was being forced to say goodbye to her friends for a second time.

Schoolchildren kept at home in local lockdownLeicester's schools have closed to all but a small number of pupils just weeks after reopening.Leicester,"Magda Raszowska said it was ""like going back to March"" School pupils in Leicester have been kept at home once again, after the city was made subject to the UK's first local lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has ordered schools in the city to close to all but a small number of pupils following a surge in coronavirus cases. He said although children were at low risk of serious harm from Covid-19, they could spread the infection. Schools had been allowed to welcome back some year groups from 1 June. The tighter restrictions are also affecting schools and nurseries outside the lockdown area in Leicester, with pupils told to stay away if they live within the affected area. The Department for Education has said only vulnerable children and children of key workers could travel across the boundary in either direction for school or appointments with social workers. Paul Galvin, head teacher of St Luke's Primary School in Thurnby, said: ""It might be difficult for families who are inside the lockdown zone - as we are just outside the boundary - especially if they are not children of critical workers. ""There are a small number of children affected at our school. I am deeply sorry for the problems this may cause parents and carers."" He said the school had ""adapted and will keep adapting to changes"" during the pandemic. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says a number of under 18s have tested positive for coronavirus Magda Raszowska, whose five-year-old daughter attends Launde Primary School in Oadby, said it was ""like we're going back to March"". ""I'm sad for my kids and sad for myself but obviously safety comes first,"" she said. Fernvale Primary School, which is outside the boundary, will no longer welcome pupils like seven-year-old Ava who lives inside the boundary. Her parents said they felt sad their daughter was being forced to say goodbye to her friends for a second time. Seven-year-old Ava is not allowed to attend school even though it is staying open Mr Hancock said: ""This virus hardly impacts on children, they're very low risk.

"Gaming loot boxes are gambling, Lords sayLoot boxes, skins and player packs should be regulated immediately, says a Lords committee.Technology","The House of Lords Gambling Committee says video game loot boxes should be regulated under gambling laws. The Lords say they should be classified as ""games of chance"" - which would bring them under the Gambling Act 2005. ""If a product looks like gambling and feels like gambling, it should be regulated as gambling,"" their report says. And they warn that such a change should not wait. ""The government must act immediately to bring loot boxes within the remit of gambling legislation and regulation,"" said a statement accompanying the report. Loot boxes have long been controversial in video games. They offer players a chance at a randomised reward when opened. To further complicate matters, boxes can often be bought for real money, and the rewards can sometimes be traded. Lord Grade, chairman of the committee, told BBC Breakfast that lots of other countries have already started to regulate loot boxes because ""they can see the dangers"" which is teaching ""kids to gamble"". He said the Gambling Act was ""way behind what was actually happening in the market"" but he added that the ""overwhelming majority"" of the report's recommendations ""could be enacted today"" as they don't require legislation. The Lords report says there should be new regulations explicitly stating that loot boxes are games of chance The Lords report is wide-ranging, covering the entire gambling industry, but focuses in part on new forms of gambling, and those targeted towards children. ""There is academic research which proves that there is a connection, though not necessarily a causal link, between loot box spending and problem gambling,"" it says. One expert, Dr David Zendle, explained to the committee that either loot box spending causes problem gambling, due to their similarity - or that people who have gambling problems spend heavily on loot boxes. But he warned that either way, the connection was ""extraordinarily robust"". The Lords report concludes that ministers should make new regulations which explicitly state that loot boxes are games of chance. It also says the same definition should apply to any other in-game item paid for with real money, such as FIFA player packs. Gamers to be warned about âloot boxesâ What happens when you ban loot boxes in gaming? 'My son spent Â£3,160 in one game' The government told the committee that its planned future review of the Gambling Act would focus on loot boxes. But the Lords report warns: ""This issue requires more urgent attention."" The Lords join a range of parents and childrens' groups, as well as a previous report from the digital committee on addictive technologies, in calling on ministers to regulate loot boxes as a form of gambling. Some action has already been taken:in Belgium, loot boxes were banned in 2018due to similar fears. Earlier this year,game-rating agency Pegi said clearer warning labelswould be added. And in the video game industry,some companies have taken the initiative and elected to change the way their systems work. As part of its wider review of the sector, the Lords report also notes that young people are ""most at risk"" of becoming problem gamblers. It says 55,000 problem gamblers are aged between 11-16. As a result, it says, all new online gambling games should be reviewed to see if they appeal to children - and their potential to cause harm should be assessed. The report also highlights the problems with eSports betting as another potential gateway for young people. Researchers told the committee: ""eSports represents the largest growth opportunity for sports gambling and presents a particular worry, as its players and spectators are young."" UK games industry body Ukie said it was working hard to address the concerns raised in the report. ""The majority of people in the UK play video games in one form or another, so we take these concerns seriously. We've worked hard to increase the use of family controls on consoles which can turn off or limit spending and we will be working closely with the DCMS during its review of the Gambling Act later this year,"" chief executive Jo Twist said.

UK citizenship offer to HK,"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson says the new law ""violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy"" Up to three million Hong Kong residents are to be offered the chance to settle in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship, Boris Johnson has said. The PM said Hong Kong's freedoms were being violated by a new security law and those affected would be offered a ""route"" out of the former UK colony. About 350,000 UK passport holders, and 2.6 million others eligible, will be able to come to the UK for five years. And after a further year, they will be able to apply for citizenship. British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong were granted special status in the 1980s but currently have restricted rights and are only entitled to visa-free access to the UK for six months. Under the government's plans, all British Overseas Nationals and their dependants will be given right to remain in the UK, including the right to work and study, for five years. At this point, they will be able to apply for settled status, and after a further year, seek citizenship. UK asylum for consulate worker 'tortured in China' HK arrests dozens as 'anti-protest' law kicks in Political battle looming over UK China relations China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The PM said Tuesday's passing of a new security law by the Hong Kong authorities was a ""clear and serious breach"" of the 1985 Sino-British joint declaration - a legally binding agreement which set out how certain freedoms would be protected for the 50 years after China assumed sovereignty in 1997. ""It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration,"" he said. ""We made clear that if China continued down this path we would introduce a new route for those with British National (Overseas) status to enter the UK, granting them limited leave to remain with the ability to live and work in the UK and thereafter to apply for citizenship. And that is precisely what we will do now."" Foreign Office permanent secretary Sir Simon McDonald expressed the government's ""deep concern"" about the new law to China during a meeting with the country's ambassador Liu Xioming. The UK government has been raising concerns about the national security law and very publicly trying to pressure Beijing into a change heart. That has clearly failed - so ministers are now fulfilling their promise to allow some three million British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. This is a significant move and the government wants to send a strong message. But there will be more pressure now to rethink other elements of our relationship with China - not least the deal to allow Huawei to build parts of the UK's 5G structures. Many Tory MPs have been lobbying against that for some time - and this will only add to their concern. Updating MPs on the details, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there would be no limit on numbers or quotas and the application process would be simple. ""This is a special, bespoke, set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong,"" he said. Speaking to ITV's Peston programme, Mr Raab acknowledged there ""would be little we could do toâ¦cohesively force"" China to allow British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. What is a BNO passport? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests What is behind the Hong Kong citizenship offer? Downing Street said further details of the scheme will be detailed ""in due course"". In the meantime, British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong will be able to travel to the UK immediately, subject to standard immigration checks, the prime minister's official spokesman said. They will also will not face salary thresholds to gain their visas, he added. Hong Kong's new national security law, which targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments up to life in prison, came into effect on Tuesday. By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong I was born in Hong Kong before 1997, the year when Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule. That means I had a British National Overseas (BNO) passport as a child. When the news broke that BNO passport holders were eligible for British citizenship after living and working in the UK for five years, and after spending another year of being granted settled status, many of my friends were excited. They say at least there's a way out for Hong Kongers after the national security law came into force. But many questions remain. Currently there are 350,000 BNO passport holders, but about three million Hong Kong residents are eligible for BNO passports - and that doesn't appear to include dependants born after 1997. Will the UK be ready to take in so many Hong Kong residents? Will there be enough jobs? Will BNO passport holders have recourse to public funds? And will they be covered by the NHS? Some also say it's good that there's a lifeboat, but do they really want to leave their home? Several people have already been arrested under the new powers, including a man carrying a pro-independence flag as police used pepper spray to disperse some protesters gathered to mark 23 years since British rule ended. Critics say it effectively puts an end to the ""one country, two systems"" principle enshrined in the Joint Declaration. China has rejected criticism of its actions, saying they are internal matters. British National Overseas Passports do not confer nationality or the automatic right to live and work in the UK The UK government has come under growing pressure to take a firm line with Beijing from MPs, who are worried about China's increasingly assertive role regionally and the security implications of Chinese firm Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network. This video can not be played Hong Kong residents on controversial security law Mr Raab said he wanted a positive relationship with China but Beijing had ""broken its promise"" to the people of Hong Kong through its ""flagrant assault"" on freedom of speech and right of peaceful assembly. Labour said it welcomed the government's action but said there must be no discrimination on those allowed into the UK on the basis of income or other factors. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the UK also had a responsibility to consider the welfare of those who were not able to re-locate or who wished to stay in Hong Kong. She urged the government to work with its international partners, through the UN, to force an inquiry into police brutality in Hong Kong and also called for the UK to re-examine its commercial relationship with China. ""For too long in relation to China we've had no strategy at home and no strategy abroad. I hope he can give us a commitment today that this marks the start of a very different era,"" she said.

But he warned that either way, the connection was ""extraordinarily robust"". The Lords report concludes that ministers should make new regulations which explicitly state that loot boxes are games of chance. It also says the same definition should apply to any other in-game item paid for with real money, such as FIFA player packs. Gamers to be warned about âloot boxesâ What happens when you ban loot boxes in gaming? 'My son spent Â£3,160 in one game' The government told the committee that its planned future review of the Gambling Act would focus on loot boxes. But the Lords report warns: ""This issue requires more urgent attention."" The Lords join a range of parents and childrens' groups, as well as a previous report from the digital committee on addictive technologies, in calling on ministers to regulate loot boxes as a form of gambling. Some action has already been taken:in Belgium, loot boxes were banned in 2018due to similar fears. Earlier this year,game-rating agency Pegi said clearer warning labelswould be added. And in the video game industry,some companies have taken the initiative and elected to change the way their systems work. As part of its wider review of the sector, the Lords report also notes that young people are ""most at risk"" of becoming problem gamblers. It says 55,000 problem gamblers are aged between 11-16. As a result, it says, all new online gambling games should be reviewed to see if they appeal to children - and their potential to cause harm should be assessed. The report also highlights the problems with eSports betting as another potential gateway for young people. Researchers told the committee: ""eSports represents the largest growth opportunity for sports gambling and presents a particular worry, as its players and spectators are young."" UK games industry body Ukie said it was working hard to address the concerns raised in the report. ""The majority of people in the UK play video games in one form or another, so we take these concerns seriously. We've worked hard to increase the use of family controls on consoles which can turn off or limit spending and we will be working closely with the DCMS during its review of the Gambling Act later this year,"" chief executive Jo Twist said.

Wales pubs and restaurants to open outdoors from 13 July,"Restaurant owner Shibber Ahmed says he faces the ""heartbreaking"" prospect of closing The Blue Elephant for good if he can't reopen within a month. Some pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in Wales will be able to reopen outdoors from 13 July, under new Welsh Government plans. Venues will be able to open in spaces they own and have licences for - as long as coronavirus cases continue to fall. But indoor services will remain closed for now, despite industry pressure. Pub chain Wetherspoon said it would not reopen its beer gardens ahead of pubs being able to open fully. Meanwhile the date for reopening self-contained accommodation has been brought forward to Saturday 11 July. The change from Monday 13 July means accommodation owners can let Saturday to Saturday, but it depends on the state of the pandemic. Outdoor attractions may also be able to open from Monday 6 July, international relations minister Eluned Morgan told the daily Welsh Government press conference. Wales is the only part of the UK without a restart date for indoor hospitality. Drinkers will be expected to book, and Baroness Morgan admitted that it would be ""difficult"" for some pubs to keep to the two-metre social distancing rules. Beer gardens in pubs will be able to open where the premises owns the space Officials are planning a phased reopening, with outdoor spaces owned by businesses and subject to existing licences opening first. A Welsh Government spokesman said that would happen ""if conditions continue to be favourable and subject to the outcome of next week's review of the regulations"". Ministers will consider the reopening of ""indoor services"" later: Depending on the success of outdoor opening The ongoing coronavirus situation in Wales Other measures businesses put in place to reduce the risk of transmission, such as booking, table service only, and even the use of apps. The move will come a week after theplanned end of Wales' travel restrictions- due to happen on Monday 6 July. The Wales TUC said it welcomed the decision, adding: ""Workers' health and safety is paramount, a worker's health cannot be put above a company's profits."" A spokesman said: ""We will continue pushing for bosses to pay proper sick pay should a worker need to self isolate, as statutory sick pay of Â£95 per week is not a viable option, particularly in an industry where fair work and low pay remains a real problem."" Prince William opened the new Brains Brewery in Cardiff Bay in 2019 Shibber Ahmed, owner of The Blue Elephant restaurant in Llandudno, Conwy, said: ""All we see is TBC, that's it. I don't think I can carry on more than a month."" He added he faces the ""heart-breaking"" prospect of going out of business if he is not able to reopen within a month. ""For the last 13 years I've been doing business in this town. If I have to shut down the doors then it will be very, very distressing for me."" Alex Di Iulio, of the Castellamare restaurant in Mumbles, Swansea, said the weather would be a deciding factor. ""If it rains from 13 July on, then I've bought Â£5,000 worth of food - what do I do with it? What do I do with my staff? What do I tell them?"" Gwyn Davies, who runs the Fountain Inn in Builth Wells, Powys, said he had doubts over whether customers would stick to social distancing - and whether they would come at all. ""I don't think it's going to be a perfect scenario. Most beer gardens aren't covered and most Welsh summers are very wet. I don't see how we're going to have the customers,"" he said. ""Most beer gardens are too small for social distancing guidelines and will we see the public come back for drinks anyway? ""Once people have had a few beers will they still care about social distancing?"" He added that he fears ""some people are quite blasÃ© to the virus."" Alistair Darby, chief executive of Brains, Wales' largest domestic pub chain, said it was only likely to open ""one or two"" of its 104 pubs managed by the brewery from 13 July. Brains owns a further 60 premises which are run independently by tenants. ""Many will want to open if they can,"" said Mr Darby, ""but at the very most I would say 30 to 40 will do so"". He said that while many pubs did have outdoor spaces ""no-one wants to go down the road and expense"" of things like marquees and portable toilets. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""We are looking forward to opening all of our pubs in Wales as and when the Welsh Government gives the go-ahead. ""We will not be opening our beer gardens in advance of that."" Shumana Palit, co-founder of the Ultracomida Group - behind two deli-restaurants in Narberth and Aberystwyth, as well as Curado Bar and Vermut in Cardiff, said: ""As the furlough schemes, grants and loans that have helped us to survive are already running out, our main feeling at this point is that this is all too little, too late. ""The news today that it's only outdoor spaces that will be allowed to open from the middle of July is heart-breaking for us, as we don't have much outdoor space at all."" International Relations Minister Eluned Morgan defended the cautious approach at the daily Welsh Government briefing. ""If we open too quickly, as we have seen in some parts of the world, we'll just simply have to go back into lockdown and that's not a place we want to be. A group of restaurant owners, the Wales Independent Restaurant Collective, warned fewer than 50% of independent pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open outside from 13 July and those that do only expect to get 25% of their usual turnover. It gave a ""conservative estimate"" that 10,000 jobs would be lost before the end of summer. Baroness Morgan said she was ""intensely aware"" of the numbers who worked in the hospitality sector and the numbers of people who feel ""very pressurised"" at the moment. The landlord of the Fountain Inn is concerned about people social distancing Ministers were ""working closely"" with Public Health Wales ""to make sure that we can trace people who have attended different hospitality areas"", with names of drinkers taken,"" she said. ""There will be an expectation that people will need to pre-book, and that those names will be taken so all of those measures will be put in place,"" she said. The minister acknowledged it would be ""difficult"" for the hospitality sector to stick to the two-metre social distancing rule and said government and the sector were ""working on putting additional protection measures in place"". Sarah John set up Boss Brewing in her garage Sarah John, who owns Boss Brewery in Swansea, said: ""In our beer garden, if we were to do a two-metre rule, I hate to sound negative but it's probably not going to be commercially viable. I don't see it working for lots of pubs."" Tommy Heaney, who owns Heaney's restaurant in Pontcanna, Cardiff, called it ""positive news"", adding: ""We do have outdoor space but the style of food we do doesn't suit outdoor dining so we'd have to review our offering."" He said two or three weeks would have been good preparation time, calling 10 days ""not ideal"", but said: ""We've been doing takeaways and we've been blown away by the support"".

Restaurants call for more government help What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Fear pubs 'will go bust' because of two-metre rule No date has yet been given for indoor reopening in Wales The hospitality industrywas closed across the UK on 20 Marchbefore the coronavirus lockdown fully came into effect. Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes in Englandare opening from 4 July. They open a day earlierin Northern Ireland. Restrictions in England include changes to shift patterns, mandatory table service and more use of hand sanitiser. In Scotland, beer gardens and outdoor restaurants can reopenfrom 6 July. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to use indoor areas from 15 July. Cafes, restaurants and pubs have been shut since March Leaked minutes of a meeting between Welsh Government and council officials show the government is ""looking at"" allowing 1m (just over 3ft) social distancing for outdoor hospitality. Officials had considered three dates for reopening, according to the minutes, seen by BBC Wales - 6 July and 17 July were also examined. Other measures considered include: Businesses being able to apply for licences to put out furniture and serve on the pavement Play areas in pubs remaining closed Allowing customers a ""dwell time"" in the premises of one hour 45 minutes Pubs, cafes and restaurants employ a significant number of people in Wales and play an important part economically in communities. Those 68,000 people working in the industry include 22,000 full time staff. Factfile for Wales Â£2.1bnworth to the economy of accommodation and food 38,000people working in restaurants, cafes and mobile food service 30,000people working in pubs Â£30,000 a yeargross value added (GVA) per person As well as playing an important role in the wider accommodation and food sector, these businesses are closely linked to tourism and local food production. The supply chains for these are very important economically and socially. However they vary depending on the type of business. Big chains like Frankie and Benny's or Greene King are more likely to buy food from central wholesalers in England or further afield. Independent businesses are much more likely to buy locally and make a feature of that. That is virtually impossible to quantify - so we have anecdotal evidence to rely on at the moment. However we do know that Welsh Government policy for many years has been to link Welsh food to tourism and to encourage local supply chains. The harsh reality is that gross value added (GVA) per person in accommodation and food in Wales in 2018 was approximately Â£30,000 a year. This compared with GVA per person in manufacturing of Â£78,000 a year. So one could argue that manufacturing has more impact but that is just focusing on one measurement. It is important to remember that jobs in pubs, cafes and restaurants also create employment in parts of Wales that manufacturing would set up in. Concerns have also been raised over pubs and restaurants in residential areas, with more security and CCTV needed. Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said a timetable should have been given earlier, calling Welsh ministers ""ad-hoc approach"" to easing restrictions ""problematic"". Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative Covid-19 recovery spokesman, said Thursday's announcement would be ""welcome news for some businesses in the hospitality sector across Wales but without a relaxation of the two-metre social distancing rules, and the ability to use indoor spaces, it still won't be viable for many businesses"". The Welsh Local Government Association said it would continue to work closely with Welsh Government and other partners ""to safely and gradually reopen the hospitality industry in Wales"". Self-contained tourist properties will be able to reopen from 11 July Eluned Morgan used the press conference to set out 9 July as the date that the Welsh Government could sign off on plans to reopen self-contained holiday accommodation - like cottages or caravans - with no shared facilities for 11 July. ""We have brought thisÂ forward from 13 July, after discussing this further with the sector, to enable bookings to be taken from the Saturday to Saturday,"" she said.

We will be back at 09:00 tomorrow with the latest news stories and information. Have a good evening. Anyone travelling by bus, train, ferry or plane in Englandshould wear a face covering,externalto help reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. Therules were introduced,externalto coincide with a further easing of lockdown - including the return to class ofsome secondary school pupilsand the reopening of non-essential shops - which was expected to increase the number of people using public transport.Here are the rules. Nearly all children of legal school age will be expected to return to class full-time in September - including those with special educational needs and disabilities. The government says it wants to ""start to reverse the enormous costs of missed education"". Attendance will be mandatory again from the beginning of the autumn term. If a school has a suspected coronavirus outbreak - with two or more confirmed cases within 14 days, or an overall rise in suspected coronavirus sickness absence - teachers will work with local health protection teams. A mobile testing unit may be dispatched - focusing first on those in the affected child or teacher's class, followed by their year group, and then thewhole school if necessary. With social distancing guidance in England changing to ""one metre plus"" from 4 July, how can you invite friends and family into your home safely? Who will I be able to have in my own home? Many people won't have seen family or friends for weeks but Prof Alison Sinclair, from the University of Sussex, offers words of caution. ""The hardest but most important thing to do is to postpone the visit if anyone in either household has anyCovid-19 symptoms."" The government has announced a further Â£500m to help councils in England facing extra cost pressures as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The money - which can be spent as authorities see fit - comes on top of Â£3.2bn already received. Councils have warned of a funding black hole of up to Â£7.4bn due to increased costs, including social care, coupled with lost income from fees and charges. Labour urged ministers not to make further cuts tolocal services.

This video can not be played Sports stars calling for big thank you to key workers on Sunday. Various sporting governing bodies are encouraging the nation to come together for one final round of applause for staff who have been working on the front line during the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to Rachel Burden on BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast, Lineker said: âWe owe so much to so many people that have gone beyond the line in this period.â As Leicester becomes the first city to be subject to a local lockdown, misleading claims are being shared across social media. A number of local councils have come out on Twitter and Facebook to counter online rumours of imminent lockdowns in their areas - making it clear none have been announced. A rise in cases has been recorded in some local authority areasbut a Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson told the BBC: ""To use this data in isolation to predict which areas will see significant increases in cases is not appropriate as it does not provide a complete picture of what is happening locally."" Experts at PHE are currently looking at outbreaks in much smaller areas, rather than whole towns or cities, to inform decisions about any future local lockdowns. We've identified posts in Facebook groups that may have led to some ofthe rumours.

Many people in England are still waiting longer than 24 hours for their coronavirus test results, figures show. Four in 10 tests done by mobile units and three in 10 carried out at regional drive-thru centres were taking longer than that, data up to 24 June shows. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he expected such tests to be processed in 24 hours by the end of June. But the data - the first released on 24-hour turn-around times - showssignificant progress has been made. ""Every time my phone rings, I still think it's her,"" says Sarah Bredin-Kemp. Three months ago her friend Rebecca Mack died with suspected coronavirus, aged just 29. Since then Sarah's had to mourn Rebecca in lockdown. ""It's a really, really bizarre feeling of being a bit lost, maybe emotionally stuck,"" Sarah, who's 27, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Many young people don't like talking about grief but the pandemic means thousands now have to,here are some of their stories. Sarah (l), Rebecca (centre) and Alice used to meet for coffee every week The government has published its safety plans for the return to school in September - built on the principle of keeping classes or whole year groups apart in separate ""bubbles"". But it means if there are two confirmed coronavirus cases in 14 days, all the pupils in that group, or even the whole school, may have to be sent home. Primary pupils began to return in June but so far it has been a voluntary choice for parents Schools will have testing kits to give to parents if children show symptoms. Mobile testing units will be sent to schoolsthat have an outbreak. Leicester has become the first place in the UK to be put under a local coronavirus lockdown. Attention has mostly been focused on the city itself, but what of the suburbs on its fringes? Scott Drake thinks people will just ""go down the road"" to avoid lockdown Oadby, a town to the south east of Leicester, has come into closer proximity with the city due to the steady expansion of both and is included in the lockdown area. Do Oadby's residents feel this is justified? Are they optimistic about the future?Do they feel part of the city or look to the county? Circles designed to help shoppers and sunbathers in Newcastle city centre stay socially distanced have been worn or washed away after less than a month. They werepainted on popular patches of grass,including Old Eldon Square and around St Thomas' Church, to help people stay 2m apart. It was done in advance of the city becoming busier as shops reopened and people came out to enjoy the sunny weather. The city council has said it will berepainting them. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit After Leicester, parts of Yorkshire and the north-west of England have recorded the highest rates of new coronavirus infections, according to new data. However, all but two of the top 10 areas for rates of infection in the week ending 28 June saw a fall compared with the week before, Public Health England reported. Leicester, however, remains far ahead of the others, with three times as many new cases per 100,000 people as Bradford. Bedford, the only top 10 place other than Leicester not in the north, has seen its rate of new cases fall by half in a week. The new data combines two sets of coronavirus tests - those done in hospitals and involving care workers and previously unpublished local figures on tests outside of hospitals. From 4 July in England, multi-screen cinemas will stagger film start and end times, to avoid congestion in foyers. There will be hand-sanitising stations and - don't tell the kids - pick 'n' mix stands will be removed. Film-lovers will also find a number of empty seats or rows between themselves and other groups, depending on the size of the cinema. Admit One, which provides ticketing services for cinemas and multiplexes, says it can automatically enable socially distanced seating, creating ""bubbles"" of empty seats around groups when they book. And some cinemas may not let customers choose where they sit, as this could affect their ability to reach maximum capacity. The average seat in cinemas is about 60cm (2ft) wide and 97cm deep, Admit One says. So to meet 2m distancing rules, cinemas would have had to block out 12 seats around a single cinemagoer, or 16 around a couple. Find out more about what social distancing in cinemas, bars and restaurants will look like. School pupils in Leicester are being kept at home once again, after the city was made subject to the UK's first local lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has ordered schools in the city to close to all but a small number of pupils following a surge in coronavirus cases. Magda Raszowska said it was ""like going back to March"" He said although children were at low risk of serious harm from Covid-19, they can spread the infection. Schools had been allowed to welcome back some year groups from 1 June. The tighter restrictions are also affecting schools outside the lockdown area, with pupils told to stay away if they livewithin the affected area. Ben HunteBBC London There has been a significant rise during lockdown in the UK in the number of LGBT people seeking suicide-prevention support. Support group LGBT Hero reports 11,000 people have accessed its suicide-prevention web pages - up over 44% on the first three months of the year. And other LGBT charities have service users who have killed themselves. The government considers LGBT people to be at higher risk of suicide but no national data on LGBT suicides is kept.Read the full story.

BBC newsreader Kate Silverton, who is also a trainee child psychotherapist and a mother-of-two, has like most parents found lockdown a very challenging time. ""Home schooling may have been a success for some but in my overall experience - and that of the parents I have spoken to - those successes have been few and far between,"" she writes.

Pubs and restaurants to open outdoors from 13 July,"Restaurant owner Shibber Ahmed says he faces the ""heartbreaking"" prospect of closing The Blue Elephant for good if he can't reopen within a month. Some pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in Wales will be able to reopen outdoors from 13 July, under new Welsh Government plans. Venues will be able to open in spaces they own and have licences for - as long as coronavirus cases continue to fall. But indoor services will remain closed for now, despite industry pressure. Pub chain Wetherspoon said it would not reopen its beer gardens ahead of pubs being able to open fully. Meanwhile the date for reopening self-contained accommodation has been brought forward to Saturday 11 July. The change from Monday 13 July means accommodation owners can let Saturday to Saturday, but it depends on the state of the pandemic. Outdoor attractions may also be able to open from Monday 6 July, international relations minister Eluned Morgan told the daily Welsh Government press conference. Wales is the only part of the UK without a restart date for indoor hospitality. Drinkers will be expected to book, and Baroness Morgan admitted that it would be ""difficult"" for some pubs to keep to the two-metre social distancing rules. Beer gardens in pubs will be able to open where the premises owns the space Officials are planning a phased reopening, with outdoor spaces owned by businesses and subject to existing licences opening first. A Welsh Government spokesman said that would happen ""if conditions continue to be favourable and subject to the outcome of next week's review of the regulations"". Ministers will consider the reopening of ""indoor services"" later: Depending on the success of outdoor opening The ongoing coronavirus situation in Wales Other measures businesses put in place to reduce the risk of transmission, such as booking, table service only, and even the use of apps. The move will come a week after theplanned end of Wales' travel restrictions- due to happen on Monday 6 July. The Wales TUC said it welcomed the decision, adding: ""Workers' health and safety is paramount, a worker's health cannot be put above a company's profits."" A spokesman said: ""We will continue pushing for bosses to pay proper sick pay should a worker need to self isolate, as statutory sick pay of Â£95 per week is not a viable option, particularly in an industry where fair work and low pay remains a real problem."" Prince William opened the new Brains Brewery in Cardiff Bay in 2019 Shibber Ahmed, owner of The Blue Elephant restaurant in Llandudno, Conwy, said: ""All we see is TBC, that's it. I don't think I can carry on more than a month."" He added he faces the ""heart-breaking"" prospect of going out of business if he is not able to reopen within a month. ""For the last 13 years I've been doing business in this town. If I have to shut down the doors then it will be very, very distressing for me."" Alex Di Iulio, of the Castellamare restaurant in Mumbles, Swansea, said the weather would be a deciding factor. ""If it rains from 13 July on, then I've bought Â£5,000 worth of food - what do I do with it? What do I do with my staff? What do I tell them?"" Gwyn Davies, who runs the Fountain Inn in Builth Wells, Powys, said he had doubts over whether customers would stick to social distancing - and whether they would come at all. ""I don't think it's going to be a perfect scenario. Most beer gardens aren't covered and most Welsh summers are very wet. I don't see how we're going to have the customers,"" he said. ""Most beer gardens are too small for social distancing guidelines and will we see the public come back for drinks anyway? ""Once people have had a few beers will they still care about social distancing?"" He added that he fears ""some people are quite blasÃ© to the virus."" Alistair Darby, chief executive of Brains, Wales' largest domestic pub chain, said it was only likely to open ""one or two"" of its 104 pubs managed by the brewery from 13 July. Brains owns a further 60 premises which are run independently by tenants. ""Many will want to open if they can,"" said Mr Darby, ""but at the very most I would say 30 to 40 will do so"". He said that while many pubs did have outdoor spaces ""no-one wants to go down the road and expense"" of things like marquees and portable toilets. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""We are looking forward to opening all of our pubs in Wales as and when the Welsh Government gives the go-ahead. ""We will not be opening our beer gardens in advance of that."" Shumana Palit, co-founder of the Ultracomida Group - behind two deli-restaurants in Narberth and Aberystwyth, as well as Curado Bar and Vermut in Cardiff, said: ""As the furlough schemes, grants and loans that have helped us to survive are already running out, our main feeling at this point is that this is all too little, too late. ""The news today that it's only outdoor spaces that will be allowed to open from the middle of July is heart-breaking for us, as we don't have much outdoor space at all."" International Relations Minister Eluned Morgan defended the cautious approach at the daily Welsh Government briefing. ""If we open too quickly, as we have seen in some parts of the world, we'll just simply have to go back into lockdown and that's not a place we want to be. A group of restaurant owners, the Wales Independent Restaurant Collective, warned fewer than 50% of independent pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open outside from 13 July and those that do only expect to get 25% of their usual turnover. It gave a ""conservative estimate"" that 10,000 jobs would be lost before the end of summer. Baroness Morgan said she was ""intensely aware"" of the numbers who worked in the hospitality sector and the numbers of people who feel ""very pressurised"" at the moment. The landlord of the Fountain Inn is concerned about people social distancing Ministers were ""working closely"" with Public Health Wales ""to make sure that we can trace people who have attended different hospitality areas"", with names of drinkers taken,"" she said. ""There will be an expectation that people will need to pre-book, and that those names will be taken so all of those measures will be put in place,"" she said. The minister acknowledged it would be ""difficult"" for the hospitality sector to stick to the two-metre social distancing rule and said government and the sector were ""working on putting additional protection measures in place"". Sarah John set up Boss Brewing in her garage Sarah John, who owns Boss Brewery in Swansea, said: ""In our beer garden, if we were to do a two-metre rule, I hate to sound negative but it's probably not going to be commercially viable. I don't see it working for lots of pubs."" Tommy Heaney, who owns Heaney's restaurant in Pontcanna, Cardiff, called it ""positive news"", adding: ""We do have outdoor space but the style of food we do doesn't suit outdoor dining so we'd have to review our offering."" He said two or three weeks would have been good preparation time, calling 10 days ""not ideal"", but said: ""We've been doing takeaways and we've been blown away by the support"".

A bronze memorial to the 17th Century slave merchant was torn down in Bristol during a Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June and was dumped in the harbour. Avon and Somerset Police said it would review footage of a ""small group of people"" filmed pulling down the statue with ropes. A 24-year-old has been held on suspicion of criminal damage. The investigation remains ongoing. The statue was pulled from its plinth on 7 June Officers previously appealed for the public's help to identify 15 people they wanted to speak to. ""In the eyes of the law"", the force said, a crime had been committed and the force was ""duty-bound to investigate without fear or favour"". The statue was pulled from its plinth in the city centre and was rolled into the harbour. It was later recovered from the water and is due to be given a new home in a city museum displayed with placards from the Black Lives Matter protest.

"UK businesses cut more than 12,000 jobs in two days","More than 12,000 people in the UK are set to lose their jobs after a raft of firms announced cuts in the past 48 hours. The cuts are mainly being made by High Street retailers and in aviation - two of the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. John Lewis has said it will close stores but has not confirmed how many jobs will go. Topshop owner Arcadia and Harrods said they planned a total of 1,180 job cuts. Other lay-offs that have been announced include: Up to 5,000 job cutsat Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workersat shirtmaker TM Lewin Up to 900 cuts at management consulting firm Accenture 300 staff cuts across Virgin Money, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank 1,700 UK jobsat plane-maker Airbus And1,300 crew and 727 pilotsat EasyJet Have you recently been made redundant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WH Smith, Bensons for Beds, Wrights Pies, tableware-maker Steelite International, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and Norwich Theatre Royal have also announced plans to reduce staff. Businesses have been hit hard since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March, and even though restrictions are gradually being eased, consumer demand remains depressed. The government's furlough scheme will also start to be pared back from August, and firms are cutting jobs to control their costs. James Phillips could be made redundant James Phillips, a mechanical engineer, told the BBC he fears he could be made redundant. He has been on furlough since March but has now been asked to attend a redundancy consultation meeting with his employer. He said: ""I'm three months away from having a baby, and I was about to sign for a mortgage this week on a new property, so it's impacted me massively, really. Everything's been put on hold."" Sue Hudson lost her job as a legal secretary at a solicitors in Bournemouth in April and has not found a job since. ""There are too many people chasing too few jobs,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's very disheartening."" For most businesses, staffing is the highest cost, and many have been using the government's furlough schemes to keep workers on. But the programme - which is paying 80% of the wages of more than 9 million workers - will start to be pared back from next month and will end in October. Upper Crust owner SSP has announced 5,000 job cuts As firms have to consult for 30-45 days when making redundancies, some will feel that now is the time to act. ""There is already a cost to the employer from just a month's time,"" said BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz. ""Larger employers, planning bigger layoffs, will be eyeing that escalating wage bill and maybe thinking the sooner they move the better."" In an email to staff, Harrods' managing director Michael Ward said the department store was making its cuts with a heavy heart. ""Due to the ongoing impacts of this pandemic, we as a business will need to make reductions to our workforce."" He said it would take a ""drastic improvement in external conditions"" for Harrods to recover and return to growth. John Lewis, which was already looking to ""right size"" its business before the crisis, said it had not decided which shops would close. ""The reality is that we have too much store space for the way people want to shop now,"" the company said in a statement. Topshop owner Arcadia, which is slashing a fifth of its head office staff, also blamed the pandemic for its cuts. ""Due to the impact of Covid-19 on our business including the closure for over three months of all our stores and head offices, we have today informed staff of the need to restructure our head offices,"" it said. The reason the government has thrown tens of billions of pounds at trying to hold back the waves of unemployment is they realise that it does long-lasting damage to demand in the economy. There is no doubt that the furlough scheme helped delay the impact, but this barrage of job cut announcements suggests the government is now struggling to turn the tide. Boris Johnson described the virus as ""still circling like a shark in our waters"". It was an odd metaphor to use, considering the PM has previously praised the Mayor in Jaws for keeping the beaches open. One thing seems certain: to combat the huge economic shock whose repercussions are being felt in airlines, factories and now high streets, the government will need a bigger boat than the Â£5bn of previously announced spending accelerated yesterday. The pressure is now on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Read more Harrods said the ""devastation in international travel"" had meant it had lost ""key customers"" Retailers were already struggling before the coronavirus due to changes in shopping habits as consumers buy more online, as well as rising wages and business rates. But the coronavirus crisis has placed huge pressure on an already weakened sector. The vast majority of shops were told to shut in March when the UK went into lockdown, prompting a sharp fall in sales. And while demand rebounded 12% in May,retail it remains well below pre-lockdown levels. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90%, as airlines were hit hard by global lockdown measures and travel restrictions. And normal levels of demand are not expected to return for up to three years. While planes aren't flying, airlines aren't making money, but they still have funds flying out of the door. And firms that rely on airlines flying, such as commercial aerospace businesses, have decreased production. Along with cuts at Airbus, Ryanair and EasyJet, British Airways has announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs - almost a quarter of its workforce. Meanwhile, engineering giant Rolls-Royce, which makes jet engines, will cut 3,000 jobs across the UK.

Covid-19's economic hit,"The worldwide economic impact of the coronavirus has been seismic and the job losses are starting to crash on the shores of the UK with increasing frequency and severity. The 1,700 job losses at Airbus had a grim inevitability to them, given the destruction of demand in the aviation industry. Demand for air travel in April and May was down more than 90% and normality is not expected to return for up to three years - maybe never for the more lucrative business class travel. BA, Easyjet, Ryanair and Rolls Royce have already announced 20,000 job losses between them, so Airbus was never going to emerge unscathed. The travel wipeout has seen SSP, the owner of stalwart transport hub tenants Upper Crust and CafÃ© Ritazza, cut 5,000 posts. We already know that the number of workers on UK payrolls shrank more than 600,000 between March and May, according to the ONS. That looks like the thin end of a very big wedge as the government's unprecedented job support scheme tapers off, with employers being asked to share the burden of the cost from the end of July to its withdrawal at the end of October. The European head of a large investment bank told me this morning that one of their key concerns was the ""fraying of the social fabric in the UK"", thanks to a toxic cocktail of mass redundancies which will hit the low-wage jobs the UK has excelled in creating. Employers are discovering that with increased use of technology, they can do many things with fewer people. The march towards a more automated world has been accelerated by the virus - and the UK, with its high levels of employment in lower-skilled work, has further to fall compared to others, he said. The divide between the digital skills ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" will widen. The chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, has provided some relief to the gloom by saying the hit will not be as bad as expected and the recovery faster, but it's fair to say that his is not a mainstream view. The reason the government has thrown tens of billions of pounds at trying to hold back the waves of unemployment is they realise that it does long-lasting damage to demand in the economy. There is no doubt that the furlough scheme helped delay the impact, but this barrage of job cut announcements suggests the government is now struggling to turn the tide.

John Lewis could close stores,"John Lewis has warned it could close shops as a plunge in profits forced it to cut staff bonuses to their lowest level in almost 70 years. The retailer, which also owns Waitrose, has launched a review of the business which it said would involve ""right sizing"" its stores across both brands. The review would involve store closures ""where necessary"" as well as space reduction in existing stores, it said. The conclusions of the review are expected to be announced in September. New chairwoman Sharon White - who took over last month - said the changes would kick-start a ""vital new phase"" for the partnership, and said she had ""no doubt"" the business would be stronger as a result. ""We need to reverse our profit decline and return to growth so that we can invest more in our customers and in our partners. ""This will require a transformation in how we operate as a partnership and could take three to five years to show results."" The group announced that three Waitrose stores would close later this year at Helensburgh, Four Oaks and Waterlooville as part of the overhaul. John Lewis also said as fears about coronavirus continued to spread, it had see increased demand ""particularly this week"" for some food items as well as things such as hand sanitiser, soap and loo roll. John Lewis's finance director, Patrick Lewis, said it was working ""very hard with suppliers on an hourly basis"" to keep up with demand. Sharon White took the helm at John Lewis last month The John Lewis Partnership is owned by its staff - known as partners - who usually receive a bonus each year. This year, staff bonuses have been set at 2%, the lowest since 1953 when it paid no bonus. Profits at the partnership dived by 23% last year,externalto Â£123m - the third year in a row that profits have fallen - as it continued to struggle with the slowdown in consumer spending. The John Lewis department stores saw ""significantly reduced profitability"" following weaker sales of home and electrical goods, although profits rose at Waitrose after a ""solid performance"", the company said. John Lewis axes third of top jobs in restructuring 'Worst year for retail in 25 years' Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the fall from grace for John Lewis had been ""spectacular"", and warned that if Ms White could not turn around the business ""the fallout could be much worse"". ""Once the envy of the retail industry, the company has suffered dismal trading performances over the past few years, demonstrating that the retail race is so fast that even those seemingly on an unstoppable march one year can be vulnerable the next. ""This goes to show that no retailer is safe."" Catherine Shuttleworth, the chief executive of retail analysts Savvy, said store closures appeared inevitable. ""I think the business is going to have to be slimmed down,"" she told the BBC. ""It's very difficult to close some of the department stores down because they're on really long leases, but certainly I think where there are opportunities to close stores that aren't performing they will look at that."" She added that Ms White did not have much time to turn the business around. ""She's talking about changes taking three-to-five years, I don't think there are three-to-five years in retail at the minute where there isn't going to be an enormous amount of change. She hasn't got that much time on her side. John Lewis have been 'strategically reviewing' things for quite a while - we need some action."" Retail analyst Richard Hyman told the BBC the firm's staff bonus scheme was an ""absolutely fundamental"" part of its ethos. ""The key competitive edge John Lewis has is customer service, that is delivered by its staff. If you take away part of their remuneration then your customer service levels are likely to be impacted. ""And I think that over the past few years as that bonus has gone down we've been seeing a bit of that. It's a really difficult dilemma they have.""
