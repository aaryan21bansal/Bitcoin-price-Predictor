Sewage hits dozens of UK beaches after heavy rain,"Pollution warnings are in place for dozens of beaches in England and Wales after untreated sewage was discharged into the sea around the coast. Official data shows there have been a number of discharges since Monday, which Southern Water says are to protect homes and businesses. The pollution follows a period of heavy rain across southern England, after a spell of extremely dry weather. Warnings from the Safer Seas and Rivers Service are based on water firms' data. The service is run by charity Surfers Against Sewage. Sewage regularly dumped illegally in England and Wales rivers Environment Agency seeks jail for polluting water bosses Many of the beaches contaminated are popular resorts and include: Bognor Regis, West Sussex Newquay, Cornwall East Looe, Cornwall Heacham, Norfolk Rest and Sandy Bay (Porthcawl), Bridgend Morecambe North, Lancashire Cowes, Isle of Wight Robin Hoods Bay, North Yorkshire Sidmouth Town, Devon Shoreham Beach, West Sussex Southend-on-Sea, Essex The majority are along England's south coast. Near Bath is a popular swimming spot along the River Avon called Warleigh Weir which runs through an area belonging to landowner Johnny Palmer. Untreated sewage has been released just upstream. Mr Palmer has been working for years to make the water clean enough to gain bathing water status. ""I think it's a disgrace. You've got children swimming. And you know, you can't tell your kids to not drink the water. So you've literally got children drinking sewage, which is the kind of thing you might expect in parts of Africa or India, but, you know, Western Europe,"" he said. ""Rivers are a central part of our landscape and our ecology and our natural environment. They are a resource that everyone can and should use - and does use."" Hundreds of people were bathing in this river near Bath last weekend Southern Water is one of the water companies responsible for those regions, along with Wessex Water and South West Water. In a statement, Southern Water said: ""There were thunderstorms accompanied by heavy rain the night before last and [Tuesday]. Storm releases were made to protect homes, schools and businesses from flooding. The release is 95-97% rainwater and so should not be described as raw sewage. ""We know customers do not like that the industry has to rely on these [discharges] to protect them, and we are pioneering a new approach."" Last year Southern Waterwas fined a record Â£90mafter admitting deliberately dumping vast amounts of sewage into the sea across the south coast. Under EU law, these kinds of sewage dischargesare legal only in ""exceptional"" circumstances.,externalThey happen mostly after heavy rain, when there is a risk that pipes that carry storm-water, along with sewage, may overflow. However,in 2020and2021,there were almost 400,000 such events. In a statement, the Environment Agency said that sewage pollution could be ""devastating to human health, local biodiversity and our environment"". It said it would not ""hesitate to act to eliminate the harm sewage discharges cause to the environment"". It has previously calledfor the top executives of England's water companies to face jail when serious incidents of pollution occur. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: ""Our rivers and beaches are once again being treated as open sewers. Years of underinvestment is now in plain sight."" The government has saidit intends to produce a plan,externalby September this year to reduce storm overflows. This was made a legal requirement by the Environment Act 2021.

Heavy rain brings flash floods to southern England,"This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows flash flooding across southern England Thunderstorms and flash floods have struck parts of southern England, causing flash flooding in large areas of central London. Intense downpours began in London and swept the South East on Wednesday. High Beech, in Essex, saw the highest rainfall with 64mm falling in a 24-hour period, while Frittenden in Kent had 46mm of rain falling in one hour. Light and patchy rain in localised areas is expected over the next few days. The Met Office forecasts that Thursday will be damp in Northern Ireland and western Scotland as rain moves eastwards, with cloudy weather across south-east England and brighter spells for Wales and central England in the afternoon. Check the latest forecast where you are It follows a day whereheavy rain in the capitalaffected swathes of central London, including Bloomsbury, St Pancras station, Victoria and Kentish Town. Some shops and platforms at Victoria Station were forced to close after flooding at the main entrance led to large volumes of water running down a slope towards the eastern concourse. Rain filled the north London high streets of Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill, with cars seen struggling to drive through the water. The Almeida Theatre in Islington had to cancel a matinee performance as water leaked through the roof. Rain brought play to a halt at the Test match between England and South Africa at Lord's Cricket Ground The outline of St Paul's Cathedral can just be made out as people walk in the rain on Millennium Bridge in London Heavy rainfall led to roads across England, Wales and Scotland becoming flooded on Tuesday, following weeks of extreme heat and tinder-dry conditions. Gatwick Airport in Crawley, West Sussex, has warned of delays and cancellations to some flights as air traffic control restrictions were declared across the south due to poor weather. Worksop in Nottinghamshire experienced 93mm of rainfall between 17:00 and 20:00 BST on Tuesday -almost twice the average monthly rainfall of 54mm, according to BBC weather presenter Simon King. And more heavy rainfall is expected in England and Wales, with the most intense rain likely to fall in the South East covering London, Kent, West Sussex, Essex and Suffolk. BBC Weather's Stav Danaos said: ""Low pressure pushing in off the Atlantic will bring more of a breeze during Thursday, and this weather front will bring a band of cloud and rain which will slowly spread from west to east across the country. ""So initially we start of with quite a bit of cloud around, one or two heavy showers in the south east, but increasing amounts of sunshine for central, southern and eastern areas into the afternoon."" He added temperatures are set to peak at 25C in the south-east. A sudden downpour in Brighton saw daytrippers seek cover A series of flood alerts were issued for areas of London A total of eight areas of England are officially in drought despite the downpours this week, withThames Water becoming the latest water provider to announce a hosepipe ban, which will come into force later this month. Pollution warnings are also in place for dozens of beaches in England and Wales after untreated sewage was discharged into the sea around the coast following the period of heavy rain. Water companies faced criticism, including after untreated sewage had beenreleased upstream of popular swimming spot Warleigh Weir, along the River Avon. Southern Water, one of the companies responsible for the affected regions, said storm releases were made to ""protect homes, schools and businesses from flooding"", adding the release was ""95-97% rainwater"". Roads flooded in Worksop, Nottinghamshire Sewage pumping station overwhelmed in Totton, Hampshire Businesses shut in Dorset Road closures and car park flooded in Leicestershire Heavy downpours are unlikely to ease parched conditions seen across much of the UK, however, because rainwater struggles to permeate dry ground. The conditions mean water will be more likely to run off the dehydrated surface, leading to flash flooding in some areas. Additional reporting by Rachel Russell.

Manhunt for mobility scooter murder suspect,"The man is described as wearing grey shorts, a dark coloured T-shirt, a white baseball cap and white patterned builder style gloves Detectives investigating the murder of a grandfather stabbed while riding a mobility scooter have released images of a man seen running from the scene armed with a knife. Thomas O'Halloran, 87, died on Cayton Road, Greenford, west London, after being attacked just after 16:00 BST on Tuesday. Ch Supt Sean Wilson said it was an act of ""unprovoked violence"". Police now want to identify the man from CCTV as a matter of urgency. He is described as wearing grey shorts, a dark coloured T-shirt, a white baseball cap and white patterned builder style gloves. Det Ch Insp Jim Eastwood, who is leading the investigation, said: ""He is clearly a dangerous individual and people are advised not to approach him, but to call us immediately on 999 if they know him or have any information regarding his whereabouts."" The Met described the attack on Thomas O'Halloran in west London as an act of unprovoked violence Speaking at the crime scene at midday Ch Supt Wilson said: ""We believe that Mr O'Halloran was stabbed on Western Avenue before managing to travel 75 yards or so on his mobility scooter to Runnymede Gardens where he flagged down a member of the public for help,"" he said. ""So, please. If you saw anything we do need to hear from you."" This video can not be played WATCH: Police chief appeals for public's help over killing of 87-year-old Thomas O'Halloran It is the sixth murder investigation to be launched in London in the last four days. Ch Supt Wilson said Mr O'Halloran was a ""much-loved"" member of the Greenford community and lived locally. Extra officers will be deployed to patrol the area in the coming days to provide reassurance. A public meeting will also be held on Thursday evening at Greenford Community Centre organised by Metropolitan Police and chaired by Ch Supt Wilson. ""They are there to protect you and to help you,"" Ch Supt Wilson added. ""If you have any concerns or information that you want to share please approach those officers. I realised that dreadful impact that incidents like this have on our communities. ""I would like to reassure you all that we are doing all we can to solve the horrendous crimes that we have seen across London over the last few days. I stress that London remains one of the safest cities in the world."" Police described the attack as an ""awful incident"" According to BBC analysis of police crime figures, 66 murder investigations have been launched this year in London by the Met Police, City of London Police and British Transport Police (BTP). This is slightly lower compared with this time last year where police had launched 78 murder investigations in the capital. Nearly two-thirds of London homicide victims in 2022 have been stabbed to death. Four people have been fatally shot - all within the last month. Sixty-two cases have led to arrests, and 52 cases have seen someone charged with murder. At the scene:BBC London's Aurelia Foster An army of TV crews, satellite trucks and journalists have set up camp in this ordinary residential road in Greenford. A forensics tent remains standing ominously within the large police cordon - marking the very spot Thomas O'Halloran died. Traffic on the eastbound A40, which is parallel to Runnymede Gardens, has been slowing down while drivers and passengers take in the crime scene. This is a narrow road, meaning this happened in plain view immediately outside people's homes, as well as afternoon traffic. It's difficult to understand how something like this could have happened in a spot so exposed. Neighbours say this is a quiet, uneventful area, with a large number of elderly residents. They told me that they fear becoming victims of crime themselves. Frasley Coutinho, who lives opposite where Mr O'Halloran was stabbed, said he saw the pensioner being surrounded by a group of youths. He said: ""I saw a couple of people gathering around him and then he drove past and stopped further up, and then there was a group of young boys around him."" Mr Coutinho said he caught some of the incident on a CCTV camera but it had been obscured by a plant. Nick Lambie told BBC London the community is very worried by the fatal stabbing Another resident Nick Lambie said Mr O'Halloran was known to collect for charity. He added: ""When you hear something like that happening on your doorstep it is very disconcerting as it is a very quiet area. ""I understand he collected for charity and was quite often at the local Tesco. By the looks of it he was making his way from there. ""Someone in their 80s in a mobility scooter can't put up much of a fight.""

Ofgem board member resigns over price cap change,"A non-executive director at energy regulator Ofgem has quit over changes to the way the energy price cap is set. Christine Farnish said she felt the regulator had not ""struck the right balance between the interests of consumers and interests of suppliers"". Ofgem is in charge of setting the level at which domestic energy costs are capped every three months. The watchdog thanked Ms Farnish ""for her many years of devoted service"". Ms Farnishtold The Times,externalshe disagreed with a decision to change the cap to enable suppliers to recoup certain wholesale costs sooner - a measure the regulator has said would prevent more suppliers going bust. An Ofgem spokesperson said: ""Due to this unprecedented energy crisis, Ofgem is having to make some incredibly difficult decisions where carefully balanced trade-offs are being weighed up all the time. ""But we always prioritise consumers' needs both in the immediate and long term."" Energy bills to rise more than predicted - Ofgem Energy bills forecast to hit Â£3,363 this winter How high will my energy bill go? The regulator has faced criticism for raising the energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge domestic customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - this October. The cap is designed to protect consumers from short-term price changes and is adjusted by Ofgem every three months - based on the price energy suppliers pay producers for electricity and gas. Consumer rights campaigner Martin Lewis has previously accused the regulator of ""selling consumers down the river"". October's price cap is due to be announced at the end of this month. Energy industry analysts Cornwall Insight predict an average annual bill will reach Â£3,582 at this point - Â£200 higher than the previous estimate. In January 2023, when the the cap is due to be changed again, Cornwall Insights expects the cap to go up to Â£4,266. The higher estimate means the average household would be paying Â£355 a month, instead of Â£164 a month currently. Energy prices have risen sharply because demand for gas increased when Covid restrictions eased, and because the invasion of Ukraine has threatened supplies from Russia. Ofgem recently changed the rules so the cap can be revised every three months instead of every six, saying this would make it less likely that more energy suppliers would collapse, and allow consumers to feel the benefit of any future fall in prices more quickly. Around 30 suppliers have failed in the UK in the past year. Responding to Ms Farnish's resignation, an Ofgem spokesperson said that the rest of the board members had decided a shorter recovery period for energy costs was in ""the best interest"" of consumers in the ""long term"". The spokesperson said the change reduced the ""very real risk of suppliers going bust, which would heap yet more costs onto bills and add unnecessary worry and concern at an already very difficult time"". A spokesperson from the government's business department said: ""We are aware of a resignation at the Board of Ofgem, which has been accepted."" Ms Farnish declined to comment further.

Most families 'won't get blood scandal payout',"Jason Evans's father died in 1993, when Jason was four A Coventry man whose father died after being given infected blood in the 1970s and 1980s has criticised the government's compensation scheme. Victims of the infected blood scandal will receive interim compensation payments of Â£100,000 each, as recommended by a public inquiry. The scandal saw thousands infected with HIV and Hepatitis through contaminated blood products. The government said it was ""taking action to do right by victims"". But Jason Evans said hundreds of affected families would miss out. The campaigner's father, Jonathan, died in 1993, after he contracted both HIV and hepatitis C during treatment. Jason Evans was just four at the time, but speaking on Wednesday said families where relationships had broken down or widows and widowers had died would not get the payouts. ""It's the government's classic trick,"" he said. ""They put out a press release last night saying we're going to pay Â£100,000 to those impacted by the contaminated blood scandal. ""But the devil is truly in the detail."" Jonathan Evans was just 31 when he died in 1993 after contracting both HIV and hepatitis C during treatment He said that of 1,200 haemophiliacs infected with HIV, only 457 families would receive the compensation, due in October - the 229 victims who were still alive and 228 bereaved partners. This means 63% of those families would miss out, Mr Evans said. Listen: 'Too many families missing out' In all, some 4,000 victims of the infected blood scandal, including those with other blood disorders,are set to receive interim payments. However, some partners, children, siblings and parents of those who had been infected are set to miss out. ""It really seems like discrimination on the basis of marital status,"" Mr Evans said. ""This impacts those who are most ill who will die in the next two months, whose families won't get anything."" He said the compensation scheme, however, did represent a ""step forward"". ""For those getting this money by the end of October, it will allow them some degree of financial freedom, the likes of which they've never had. ""Many of them are deeply unable to work, to put it mildly, and in very bad health as a result of what was done to them."" The compensation package, which will be tax-free, has been recommended by the public inquiry and marks the first time payouts for items such as loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. It could also be just the first stage of compensation payments, as the inquiry is looking into whether more should be paid to a greater number of people. Boris Johnson said while nothing could make up for the pain of losing a family member, he said the government was trying ""to do right by victims"".

NI households to face further gas price rises,"The price of gas on global markets has surged in the last two months Northern Ireland's energy regulator has warned that households will face further gas prices rises in the coming weeks. The region's two suppliers, SSE and Firmus, last increased their prices at the start of July. The price of gas on global markets has surged in the last two months. A Treasury spokesperson has said it is ""absolutely committed""  to bringing an equivalent to the Â£400 energy bills discount to Northern Ireland. Russia has reduced its supplies of gas to Europe, increasing competition for gas produced in other countries. Next week the UK is expected to take delivery ofa shipment of gasfrom Australia. The regulator, John French, warned that households will face further gas price rises of up to 30% in the coming weeks. ""Just as a rule of thumb, we have seen prices more than double, 60% of the final bill is wholesale prices,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster. ""We are looking unfortunately at the moment, if we do the calculations today, you are looking at increases in gas at around 30% from 1 October."" Mr French said it is an ""awful picture where energy prices have gone"" and wholesale prices had ""got worse over the last six weeks"". ""We are doing everything we can to help consumers in terms of trying to make the market more efficient,"" he added. ""We are working with the Chancellor to try and get the support out sooner, but the underlying problem is the wholesale market has just risen to levels that have never been experienced historically - if you go back 20, 30 years, you have never seen the price rises we have seen in the last 12 months."" Northern Ireland's energy market is regulated separately from the rest of the UK. SSE Airtricity customers face 42.7% gas price hike Firmus Energy price rises take effect across NI Suppliers can announce price increases as and when they need to, as long as it is approved by the regulator, who scrutinises their costs. In Great Britain the energy price cap is announced twice a year meaning cost increases are passed on in two huge chunks. However, GB is now moving closer to the NI model with a plan for the cap to be reviewed every three months. John French is warning of further gas price increases The Treasury issetting up a joint taskforceto explore how households in Northern Ireland can receive a Â£400 discount on energy bills this autumn. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We are absolutely committed to bringing an equivalent to the Â£400 energy bills discount to Northern Ireland and have just announced a new joint taskforce to find a solution quickly. ""We will continue to work with Northern Ireland ministers and the regulator to deliver this support as soon as soon as possible to ease the burden on families."" Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi met Stormont ministers on Monday to discuss the issue. Households in Great Britainwill start receiving the money from October. Stormont politicians have called for the same timetable in Northern Ireland, but there are complications due to the lack of a fully functioning executive. Northern Ireland is also in a different energy market to the rest of the UK. Following a virtual meeting on Monday, the Treasury said the new taskforce would be made up of officials from the UK government and Stormont ministers. Mr French said a ""workable"" plan had been put forward to the Chancellor and Northern Ireland government departments in relation to the discount on energy bills. He said he had spoken with energy companies last week and ""they believed they could get it out in a reasonable time, weeks rather than months"". ""It is now down to both the UK government and Northern Ireland government to decide the governance around that mechanism,"" he said. ""If we keep this simple, we can get the money out quickly. ""It is a very different market here in Northern Ireland, we have got six suppliers compared to the 300 in GB, so some of the governance mechanisms they are trying to do, in my opinion, are gold plated, we need to get this money out quickly, we need to get this money out simply. ""There is a simple mechanism to do that and we are just hoping the Treasury will back that."" Mr French is hopeful that people will receive their payment before Christmas. ""You have to look at all the different companies' IT systems, but all being well it could be this side of Christmas that the monies go out and hopefully a lot sooner than that,"" he said. On Wednesday afternoon, Conservative Party leadership contenders Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak were both questioned on how to tackle the cost-of-livingat a hustings event, at the Culloden Hotel outside Belfast. Ms Truss said her first priority would be to reduce taxes in order to avoid a recession. ""We know how damaging a recession would be for people, for future government revenues,"" she said. ""I am also committed to removing the green levy to help people with their energy bills, I know it is very difficult, I know people are struggling."" Mr Sunak said that tax was the wrong focus. ""I believe we have to support vulnerable groups, those on low incomes, pensioners directly with financial support,"" he said. ""Because a tax cut does not work for those people, if Liz's plan is to say 'I believe in tax cuts not direct support', I don't think that's right.""

Ex-Fettes teacher's disappearance treated as murder,"Peter Coshan was last seen in Edinburgh on 11 August Detectives are treating the disappearance of a former teacher at Edinburgh's Fettes College as murder. Dr Peter Coshan, 75, was last seen in the Seafield Road area of Edinburgh at about 23:50 on 11 August and was reported missing the next day. Two men, aged 27 and 63, have been arrested and charged. Mr Coshan, who taught biology at former prime minister Tony Blair's old school, is presumed dead but his body has not been found. The arrested men are due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday. Fettes College said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" to hear of the disappearance. Mr Coshan was a member of the teaching staff from 1972 until his retirement in 2005.  He joined a year after Tony Blair attended the school, from 1966 to 1971. Helen Harrison, head of Fettes College, said: ""Peter was an inspirational biology teacher and he will be remembered fondly by many.

Most families 'won't get blood scandal payout'Jason Evans was just four when his father died in 1993 after contracting HIV and hepatitis C.,"Jason Evans's father died in 1993, when Jason was four A Coventry man whose father died after being given infected blood in the 1970s and 1980s has criticised the government's compensation scheme. Victims of the infected blood scandal will receive interim compensation payments of Â£100,000 each, as recommended by a public inquiry. The scandal saw thousands infected with HIV and Hepatitis through contaminated blood products. The government said it was ""taking action to do right by victims"". But Jason Evans said hundreds of affected families would miss out. The campaigner's father, Jonathan, died in 1993, after he contracted both HIV and hepatitis C during treatment. Jason Evans was just four at the time, but speaking on Wednesday said families where relationships had broken down or widows and widowers had died would not get the payouts. ""It's the government's classic trick,"" he said. ""They put out a press release last night saying we're going to pay Â£100,000 to those impacted by the contaminated blood scandal. ""But the devil is truly in the detail."" Jonathan Evans was just 31 when he died in 1993 after contracting both HIV and hepatitis C during treatment He said that of 1,200 haemophiliacs infected with HIV, only 457 families would receive the compensation, due in October - the 229 victims who were still alive and 228 bereaved partners. This means 63% of those families would miss out, Mr Evans said. Listen: 'Too many families missing out' In all, some 4,000 victims of the infected blood scandal, including those with other blood disorders,are set to receive interim payments. However, some partners, children, siblings and parents of those who had been infected are set to miss out. ""It really seems like discrimination on the basis of marital status,"" Mr Evans said. ""This impacts those who are most ill who will die in the next two months, whose families won't get anything."" He said the compensation scheme, however, did represent a ""step forward"". ""For those getting this money by the end of October, it will allow them some degree of financial freedom, the likes of which they've never had. ""Many of them are deeply unable to work, to put it mildly, and in very bad health as a result of what was done to them."" The compensation package, which will be tax-free, has been recommended by the public inquiry and marks the first time payouts for items such as loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. It could also be just the first stage of compensation payments, as the inquiry is looking into whether more should be paid to a greater number of people. Boris Johnson said while nothing could make up for the pain of losing a family member, he said the government was trying ""to do right by victims"".

British man found dead after saving son in Italy,"Aran Chada was on holiday with his partner and two children The body of a British man who jumped from a boat to save his son has been found in Italy. Aran Chada, from Leicestershire, went on holiday to Lake Garda with his partner and two children last month. He had been missing since disappearing under the water on 22 July, and the local coastguard said volunteers found his body on Tuesday. It said the family was currently in the UK, but would be returning to Italy to identify the body. It is thought the holiday was organised to celebrate Mr Chada's birthday, when he was due to turn 52. The family had rented a boat when Mr Chada's son got into trouble off the coast of the resort of Limone. Mr Chada disappeared under the water at Lake Garda on 22 July The coastguard said volunteers found Mr Chada's body at a depth of 316m (1,037ft) and a distance of 800m (2,625ft) from Limone. This was ""more or less in the area where he was seen sinking"", the coastguard said, and his drowning was ""probably caused by an illness"" following the rescue of his son. ""Thanks to the professionalism shown in this context and the equipment supplied to them, the volunteers of Lake Garda managed to locate the body of Mr Chada on Tuesday afternoon, 16 August 2022,"" the coastguard said. Mr Chada's body was found by volunteers after more than three weeks of searching by authorities The coastguardpreviously told the BBCthat Mr Chada's partner raised the alarm by phoning 112, the European emergency number. They said Mr Chada ""saved his son"" but then ""disappeared"" near the boat. A witnesstold local media,external: ""The mother screamed and the father jumped into the water."" The coastguard said it immediately sent one of its boats, which had been on patrol in the area. A helicopter, divers from the fire service, police and volunteers also joined efforts to find Mr Chada. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson added: ""We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in North Italy and are in contact with the local authorities.""

"Abuse of BBC journalist disgraceful, says Sturgeon","James Cook was called a ""traitor"" outside the Conservative leadership hustings in Perth Nicola Sturgeon has described the abuse of a BBC journalist by independence supporters as ""disgraceful"". Protesters outside the Conservative leadership hustings in Perth shouted insults including ""you're a traitor"" and ""scumbag rat"" at James Cook. There were also reports of eggs being thrown and people being spat at as they arrived at the event. The first minister said abusing journalists was never acceptable, and described Mr Cook as a ""total pro"". Ms Sturgeontweeted,external: ""Their job is vital to our democracy and it is important to report and scrutinise, not support any viewpoint. ""James Cook is a journalist of the highest quality and a total pro - the behaviour he was subjected to last night was disgraceful."" She later said she did not believe those involved had been SNP members, but that ""appropriate action"" would be taken if they were. Calls for reckoning over online abuse in politics A video of the exchange between Mr Cook and protesters outside the Perth Concert Hall on Tuesday evening was posted online by one of those involved in the demonstration before later being deleted. It showed insults being shouted at Mr Cook, the BBC's Scotland editor, before a woman asked him how long he had been in Scotland and whether he knew about the Claim of Right 1689. Mr Cook replied that he was Scottish before adding: ""I'm not going to be starting asking you how long you've been in Scotland, I think it's a bit of a rude question."" After abuse continued to be shouted, Mr Cook said: ""It's a waste of time. I'm very much trying to have a civilised conversation with you, in our nation, which we share. ""But I can't have a civilised conversation because this gentleman calls me 'traitor' and 'scum' and screams me down."" The BBC described Mr Cook as an ""exceptional correspondent"" who ""showed professionalism throughout the incident"". It added: ""It is never acceptable for journalists to suffer abuse of any nature while doing their job."" The BBC has faced accusations of bias - which it strongly denies - from many within the pro-independence movement since the 2014 referendum campaign. A small group of protesters carrying signs criticising the treatment of migrants and refugees broke through barriers and ran towards the door of the venue Mr Cook's predecessor as the broadcaster's Scotland editor, Sarah Smith, has previously spoken of the""criticism, bile and hatred""she faced while covering politics in the country. Ms Smith said she was frequently subjected to insults and misogyny, and had been ""demonised quite heavily amongst certain parts of the population"". SNP MSP James Dornan had to issue an apology after initially claiming Ms Smith had ""imagined"" or ""exaggerated"" her story. There were reports of abuse and eggs being hurled at Tory members as they arrived to hear leadership rivals Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak speak. Protesters hung banners saying ""Tory Scum Out"" and ""Scottish not British"" outside the venue, with one group breaking through the barriers and running towards the door of the concert hall before retreating. Holly Moscrop, the national chair of the Scottish Young Conservatives, said her coat had been grabbed, she was spat on and had misogynistic abuse screamed at her near the entrance to the venue. Ms Moscrop toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""The protesters were leaning right over the railing and one of them grabbed my coat. ""They were screaming abuse right in my face to the point that they were spitting in my face. ""They were shouting that I was a Tory whore, telling me that I should die and kill myself and that we were Tory scum. ""I was genuinely really scared that they were going to come over the barrier and that they were going to do something"". Scotsman journalist Alistair Grant said he was one of those who had been hit by an egg. Hetweeted,external: ""Can 100% confirm that when I arrived at the Tory leadership hustings, eggs were being thrown towards the queue of party members waiting to get in to the venue. ""Regret to say an egg just hit my leg. Can't stress how uncomfortable it is to have an eggy sock."" There were reports of eggs being thrown at Conservative members as they queued outside the Perth Concert Hall Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said people trying to attend the hustings had faced a ""gauntlet of hate"" outside. He added: ""Everyone is entitled to peacefully protest and make their voice heard against politicians they disagree with - that's the essence of democracy - but, not for the first time, a mob of extremist nationalists crossed a line. ""It's shameful that journalists doing their job and ordinary party members, some of them elderly, had to run a gauntlet of hate just to get into the venue, including having eggs thrown at them and being spat at."" Police Scotland said there had been no arrests at the protest, with Ch Supt Phil Davison insisting that an ""appropriate policing plan was in place to maintain public safety and minimise disruption"". He added: ""We have a duty under the European Convention on Human Rights to protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter-protest, balanced against the rights of the wider community."" It wasn't a huge surprise to see a crowd of protestors outside the venue. Many of the same banners were draped over the same railings at the last hustings in 2019. Some were slightly taken aback though at the scale and ferocity of the event, with insults and the occasional egg flying while a large sound system boomed out some rather sweary speeches. There was a fairly partisan atmosphere inside at times too, with members booing and heckling some questions from the host, broadcaster Colin Mackay. Political leaders are at pains to paint any abuse as the work of an extremely vocal minority. But there is no mistaking the fact that politics has a fairly angry tinge to it right now. People are struggling amid rising prices and fuel bills, and it's only going to get worse as we move into winter. Trust in politicians was plumbing new depths even before the cost of living crisis, and now inflation and interest rates are on the rise and wage disputes are commonplace. Whoever wins the Tory leadership is going to face a huge challenge in cooling the atmosphere of debate and bringing people together in such circumstances.

Passengers hurt escaping train engulfed by fire,"This video can not be played WATCH: Spanish firefighters are forced to flee the flames while battling a wildfire Ten passengers were hurt, three seriously, when they tried to escape a train that became caught up in a sweeping wildfire north-west of Valencia in eastern Spain. The fire near BejÃ­s has been whipped up by fierce winds, leaving several firefighters running for their lives. The passengers were on a service from Valencia to Zaragoza in the north when the fire brought the train to a halt. The train driver asked passengers to stay on board, but some panicked. As he prepared to reverse the train, which had left Valencia late on Tuesday afternoon with 48 passengers on board, some broke windows in an attempt to escape as the flames drew close. Some of those who fled suffered burns and one was airlifted to hospital for treatment in Valencia. Those with the worst burns were a 58-year-old woman and a girl aged 15, Spanish reports said. No-one who stayed on the train was hurt. The intensity of the fire was shared on social media as it approached the train. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The driver eventually moved to the back of the train and retreated to the nearby station of Caudiel. Passengers who had fled along the tracks rejoined the train and those who were injured received initial treatment there. More than 2,000 people have been evacuated from BejÃ­s and neighbouring towns. The CastellÃ³n fire brigade shared video of firefighters fleeing flames several metres in height as the wind changed and threatened their lives. ""Run, run!"" they can be heard shouting as the fire surrounds them. Firefighters fear as many as 6,000 hectares (60 km sq) of land has been ravaged by the fire. Another blaze, started by lightning in the Vall d'Ebo area of Valencia late on Saturday, has devastated 11,500 hectares. Much of Western Europe has seen forest fires during a long summer of sweltering heatwaves. Human-induced climate change has triggered more frequent and more intense heatwaves and the world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began. Valencia regional leader Ximo Puig said high winds had caused ""tremendous disruption"" and that the BejÃ­s fire had now spread south to Alcublas. He said the sheer scale of the two fires had made them very difficult to control but hoped that rain due in the area later would help to stabilise them. Spain has endured almost 400 wildfires so far in 2022 and seen 275,836 hectares burned,according to EU estimates,external. Rail passengers were also caught up in a Spanish wildfire last month, when a train came to a halt in Zamora in the north-west. The rail operator said they were never in danger. Passengers alarmed as train surrounded by flames.

Next PM's NI challenges,"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are competing for the votes of Conservative members Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are due to meet members of the Conservative Party in Northern Ireland as the Tory leadership hustings roadshow rolls in. There may be a relatively small number of votes at stake but the challenges the new prime minister will face in this part of the UK are among the most complex and delicate. The fact that Northern Ireland has the UK's only land border presented a Brexit brainteaser for negotiators. Almost everyone involved in the Brexit process agreed there should not be any checkpoints on the frontier with the Republic of Ireland. It was thought the open border was a powerful symbol of the peace process and that enforcing controls across the meandering frontier would be impractical. But the conundrum was: how could checks be avoided when the UK was outside the EU with distinct trading rules and the Republic of Ireland remained inside, continuing to follow European regulations? The solution - agreed between Boris Johnson's government and Brussels - wasthe Northern Ireland Protocol. Essentially, the arrangement has kept Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. That means there are no checks on the land border but some goods are inspected when they arrive in Northern Ireland from Great Britain to ensure they comply with EU standards. Unionist political parties claim the protocol amounts to an economic barrier within the UK and they want the trade border in the Irish Sea to be scrapped. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Northern Ireland Protocol Bill passes Commons Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Kyle Thompson, a unionist from Londonderry, says: ""When Northern Ireland is treated differently from everywhere else in the UK, obviously that is a big issue. ""The protocol means laws for Northern Ireland are being set by a foreign power - there's no accountability."" The issue has deep implications for London's relations with Brussels, the new PM's relations with the wider Conservative Party and for the fraught political relations in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been without a fully-functioning devolved government since Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) resigned as first minister in February. The DUP argues that the Northern Ireland Protocol was brought in without unionists' consent and that has damaged one of the key principles of power sharing. In May, Sinn FÃ©in replaced the DUP as the largest party at Stormont in the Assembly election. Michelle O'Neill is in line to be the first republican first minister but under the power-sharing rules she can only take up the role if the DUP agrees to nominate a deputy. Northern Ireland has been without a fully-functioning devolved government since February The DUP has insisted it will only do so if the trade border is scrapped. The party says it made its position clear prior to the election and would be letting down its voters if it relented. Liz Truss has introduced legislation in Westminster which wouldgive ministers in London the power to unilaterally override parts of the protocol. Critics say it would be a breach of international law. Rishi Sunak has said he would seek to reopen negotiations with the EU on the protocol but would also keep Ms Truss's bill going through Parliament. How does power-sharing work in Northern Ireland? NI assembly to be recalled in Speaker election bid NI Assembly Speaker blocked by DUP for second time The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has not explicitly endorsed either candidate for the Conservative leadership but he has criticised Mr Sunak's approach. The other four main parties at Stormont say the DUP is acting irresponsibly in blocking the return of devolved government, particularly at a time when financial pressures on families are significantly increasing. Some statistics suggest rising inflation may hit Northern Ireland harder than other parts of the UK. Ulster Bank's chief economist in Belfast, Richard Ramsey, points out that Northern Ireland has lower wages and households spend a greater proportion of their income on energy and food. ""People here are facing a bigger squeeze,"" he explains. ""Consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of the economy in Northern Ireland so the cost of living is definitely having an effect."" He says there are ""pockets of prosperity"", with some thriving sectors such as cybersecurity and pharmaceuticals. The economic challenges include low productivity, which in Mr Ramsey's view is linked to a lack of business investment and educational underachievement. People in Northern Ireland will generally face a bigger squeeze amid the cost-of-living crisis than those in other parts of the UK, says Richard Ramsey He also notes that public spending is higher per person than in England, Scotland or Wales but that is not reflected in the quality of the public services - for example, Northern Ireland has the longest hospital waiting times in the UK. ""We need to be more focused on outcomes, rather than just budgets,"" he says. In the short-term, he believes a recession is ""inevitable"". He says local economic conditions also mean that Northern Ireland would be more ""sensitive"" to interventions to help people cope with surging prices, such as the Â£400 discount to energy bills. Amie Gallagher leads the Focus Project in the Creggan area of Londonderry, which provides training and support to local women. She thinks the new prime minister should set price caps. ""They should apply to energy, fuel, childcare - everyday expenses which we see people struggling with more and more,"" she says. Another controversial piece of legislation deals with how killings from the conflict in Northern Ireland are investigated. The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill would set up a new agency which would gather information on deaths. Suspects who cooperate with the process would get immunity from prosecution. The bill would also stop inquests and civil court cases related to the Troubles. Troubles legacy bill published by UK government Troubles legacy bill passes Commons stages Most victims' groups, and all the Stormont political parties, oppose the bill, saying it takes away the hope of justice from bereaved families. Army veterans' organisations support the government's approach. The legislation has passed its Commons stages and will be scrutinised by the House of Lords in the coming months. It is likely to be challenged in the courts. The past few years have seen increased debate and public discussion about the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. A rise in support for parties who are neutral on that issue has seen unionism lose its overall majority in the Stormont Assembly chamber. Boris Johnson has consistently ruled out calling a border poll However, the number of people voting for parties who want to maintain Northern Ireland's place in the UK is still greater than those backing parties which favour a united Ireland. The Good Friday Peace Agreement in 1998 said the UK government should call a referendum on Irish unity if it appeared likely a majority in Northern Ireland would vote for a change. Boris Johnson consistently ruled out calling a border poll, on the grounds the criteria set out in the Agreement had not been fulfilled. His successor is very unlikely to take a different position. Future election results in Northern Ireland during the next few years will indicate whether a referendum may become more likely.

Truss and Sunak pledge to 'fix' protocol,"Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak try to win over party members in Northern Ireland as they battle to become Tory leader and PM The pair have been taking part in their eighth hustings at an event near Belfast Truss says the Northern Ireland Protocol - which sets out post-Brexit trading arrangements - is undermining the Good Friday Agreement She says she is determined to push forward controversial legislation that would allow the UK government to take unilateral action to change it That course of action has faced strong criticism in the EU Sunak also pledges to ""fix"" the protocol and stresses his record on the economy The devolved government in NI effectively collapsed in February after the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew as part of its protest against the protocol Edited by Dulcie Lee We're now wrapping up our coverage of today's Conservative leadership hustings in Northern Ireland. As a reminder, here are some of the points the two candidates touched upon:  We'll continue to cover the Truss-Sunak race for the party leadership. The latest polls suggestLiz Truss has a large lead over Sunak. There's more on on the next PM's challenges in Northern Irelandhere, and a guide to the candidates' policieshere. The next hustings are in Manchester on 19 August. The team behind the live page was made up of Alex Therrien, Heather Sharp, Laura Gozzi, Dulcie Lee, James FitzGerald, Chas Geiger, Luke Sproule, Chris Andrews, Mike Hirst, as well as Jayne McCormack and Grainne Connolly in Belfast and political correspondent David Cornock. Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in said it was ""totally insulting"" for the Conservative leadership candidates to ""rock up"" in Northern Ireland for today's debate. The republican party won the most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly election. John Finucane, the MP for North Belfast, said the Conservatives had no regard for people in Northern Ireland and were ""propping up the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party]'s block on an Executive being formed"". Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event During the questions at the hustings, George Platt asked Liz Truss whether she would overturn laws legalising abortion in Northern Ireland. She replied to sayshe wanted abortion laws to be the same across the UK. When asked how he felt about her response, Mr Platt said: âAbortion is on the minds and hearts of many people in Northern Ireland and itâs a really complex issue but I feel if youâre standing to be a leader, to represent the country, you need to know where you stand on this. Is it right or wrong?"" He adds: âI felt Liz sort of dodged the question and is the more conservative of the two - so maybe she dodged it and felt Iâd give her the vote anyway.â He says he is still undecided on who he will vote for, but is leaning more towards Truss. Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event Lynn Anderson (left) and Jayne Doherty attended the hustings Jayne Doherty says Rishi Sunak may have won her over with his answers today. ""I really came in 90% sure I was going to vote for Liz Truss,"" she says. ""But when I did hear the answers to questions and policies I was so impressed with Rishi Sunak today."" ""I can see him actually putting that into place, so I was swayed today but I still donât know how Iâm going to vote,"" she adds. But she said she didn't think either of the leadership rivals really answered questions about getting Stormont back up and running. ""Itâs a bit naive of them to think fixing the protocol will resolve it all,â she says. Lenn Jarvis backs Liz Truss Lenn Jarvis has already cast his vote, for Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. ""I think Liz was better in detail and had more detail,"" he says. ""Rishi, with him when he was chancellor, he was splashing the cash and talking about low taxation,"" he adds. ""Now thatâs contradictory, how much his arm was twisted by Boris, I donât know. But to me thereâs a credibility problem there which will take a few years to re-establish. So Iâm happy with my decision."" In the hustings a short time ago, Sunak repeated his recent line of attack that Truss is risking a ""moral failure"" if she doesn't support the country's most vulnerable people during the cost-of-living crisis. At the event near Belfast, Sunak said Truss's plan for tax would not help low-income groups and argued he had the better plan with an offer of direct financial support. After Sunak used the same ""moral failure"" line at Tuesday night's hustings in Scotland, a Truss campaign source told The Times: âItâs a shame that Sunak has had to stoop this low to get a headline.â The former chancellor was accused of being an ""attention seeker"". The latest inflation figure of 10.1% shows ""how serious the situation is"", Rishi Sunak says, speaking to journalists after the hustings near Belfast. ""Inflation is the enemy,"" he adds, describing rising prices as the biggest challenge facing the next prime minister. The former chancellor says it is important not to ""put fuel on the fire of inflation"" with the tax cuts proposed by his leadership rival Liz Truss. He says he would target support to those on the lowest incomes and pensioners. Need a recap? Here are the key points from the eighth of 12 hustings events in the leadership contest. It took place near Belfast, with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak both setting out their stalls before taking questions from Conservative Party members. Liz Truss:  Rishi Sunak Liz Truss has been speaking to journalists after the hustings, after the announcement this morning that UK inflation has reached 10.1% - the first time it's hit double digits since 1982. She says she will not ""predict a future budget"" as the economic situation is fast-moving. She repeats her pledge to reduce taxes which is ""vitally important to avoid a recession"". The Conservative candidate says she wants to remove the green levy ""to help people with their energy bills"" and to keep corporation tax low. ""We're currently facing a recession, I think that would be extremely damaging and that's why I don't believe in putting up taxes, I think that would cut off growth,"" she says. David CornockPolitical correspondent Rishi Sunak bounced on to the stage with a cheery greeting to âmy
fellow Britonsâ. Like Liz Truss, his pitch had a familiar air to it â is
there anyone left in the UK who doesnât know his mum was a chemist? Like his rival, he promised to âfixâ the Northern Ireland Protocol and protect Northern Irelandâs place in the UK. He suggested there was little between him and the foreign
secretary on that â though he acknowledged that legislation would take time
and said he would try to negotiate a settlement with the EU in the meantime. Unlike Liz Truss, he did go out of his way to attack his opponentâs
policies â particularly on borrowing and tax cuts. As the self-styled underdog in this race, that more
aggressive approach may be understandable. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent This was round eight of the
biggest rumble in UK politics right now, but neither camp took or landed any
big blows. BothLiz TrussandRishi Sunakdelivered polished performances,
carefully sidestepping the risks that come with being grilled on local
issues. While the hour-long event focused largely on their commitments to ""fix"" the protocol, their approaches to sorting out the economy remain starkly
different. And neither made much mention of the power-sharing impasse at Stormont
in their opening speeches, instead local members were left to ask each
candidate how theyâd sort it out. About 600 people in Northern Ireland get a say on who the next
occupant of No 10 should be. When asked at todayâs hustings how many were still undecided, a good
number of members were quick to stick up their hand. Despite being small in number, they were keen to remind the party
machine that every vote will count before a winner emerges on 5 September. The last question is on the ongoing impasse at Stormont, which a member of the public says will prevent all the policies Sunak has mentioned from being put in place. The Northern Ireland Assembly and executive are not currently functioning after the executive collapsed in Febraury when the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew First Minister Paul Givan in protest over the protocol. The party is refusing to return until its concerns with the protocol have been addressed. ""All of us want to see institutions back up and running,"" Sunak replies. ""Next year will be 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement and for it not to be function is sad,"" he says. ""Moving into the future starts with fixing the protocol and talking with all parties and fixing the differences and bringing people together,"" Sunak adds. He says he supports the government's the bill to override parts of the protocol, but in the interim he would talk to Europe, Ireland and the French, he says. And with that, Sunak's time is up - and that brings the event to a close. Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event Rishi Sunakâs upbeat delivery brought a lighter tone to the room in his opening speech, with a strong emphasis on values and family. Once again, there was a good show of hands when it came to question time with members keen to ask hard-hitting questions about issues including child labour in foreign countries, reaching net zero, the cost of living crisis and how people will make it through the winter. But itâs clear one key issue for members is what both candidates will do to try and restore power-sharing at Stormont, with the question raised more than once. On the topic of the environment and net zero, Sunak says that as a Conservative he cares about ""inheritance in all its guises"" - including the environment. Sunak says that in order to achieve net zero ""we need innovation to create the products of the future that will help provide clean, reliable, affordable and secure energy"" ""We need to do that across the board in solar, nuclear and wind power,"" he says. I know how to build an innovation economy, Sunak says, referring to his ""business background"", and adding that ""taxes are only a bit of the story"". ""That's how we do net zero in a positive way and spread jobs and opportunities around our country."" he says to applause. Sunak, too, faces a question on how he would âcounterâ China. The Chinese Communist Party represents the âgreatest threatâ
to economic and national security, he warns. Sunak outlines a range of actions he took as chancellor and would
continue to take as PM - including protections against âhostile investmentâ in
British companies from Beijing. He promises he will always stand up for democratic values
and those fleeing âpersecutionâ, for example from Hong Kong. He promises to spend âwhatever it takesâ to keep the UK
safe, criticising Liz Trussâs pledge to spend 3% of GDP on defence as an âarbitrary
targetâ. Rishi Sunak says he wants the Conservative Party to win in every part of the United Kingdom. The former chancellor says he is confident the party can win a fifth general election in a row, ""but it's going to require us to appeal to swing voters everywhere"". ""It's right that the Conservative and Unionist Party puts resources and candidates in every part of our United Kingdom,"" he adds to applause. The party fielded only one candidate in May's Northern Ireland Assembly elections. Matthew Robinson failed to be elected in North Down, while at the last UK general election it stood four MP candidates. First up, Sunak is asked how he plans to ""sort out"" the NHS including its staffing issues. Sunak reiterates one of his key campaign messages that ""bold and radical"" action is needed. The former chancellor says he wants people to talk less about how much money they're putting into the health service - and more about what they're getting out of it. He then reiterates one of his key pledges: fines for those who miss NHS appointments. The plan would change people's behaviour and ""free up an enormous amount of extra healthcare"", he promises. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent Itâs taken Rishi Sunak longer to get to Northern Ireland-specific
issues in his opening pitch than Liz Truss did. He began by sticking to what he knows best - talking
about the economy. Heâll have to do more to persuade some in this audience
of his credentials when it comes to talking tough with the EU. But interestingly he makes a specific reference to the late Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble, a former first minister of Northern Ireland and in later years a Conservative peer, as
he commits to âdoing what it takes to fix the protocolâ. After Truss leaves the stage, her rival Sunak is invited to set out his stall. He outlines his key values, including patriotism, loyalty to family and hard work. Sunak speaks of the importance of rebuilding the economy and restoring trust in the government. The former chancellor stresses that he's an honest candidate who tells the country what it ""needs to hear"", even if that's not always what it ""wants to hear"". David CornockPolitical correspondent Liz Trussâs opening pitch, with its focus on tax cutting and
her record in government, will have been familiar to anyone who has watched
previous hustings. But there were messages targeted at her audience,
particularly on ""fixing"" the Northern Ireland Protocol. The questions she faced have been rather different from those at other
events, with a focus on specific Northern Ireland issues. She's been asked about her failure to mention the stalemate at
Stormont. She insisted the answer lay in legislation on the protocol. âUntil we sort this issue out,â she said, âweâre not going
to get Stormont back up and running."" . Although she was confident the House of Lords would respect
the mandate for the Protocol Bill, the lengthy legislative process may mean we
shouldnât hold our breath for an early return of Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Why the Northern Ireland Protocol matters,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

Tory leadership candidates battle for votes in NI,"The two remaining candidates have taken part in a series of hustings events as well as head-to-head debates Leadership candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have pledged to progress the government's controversialprotocol bill, as they pitched for votes in north Down. Both have expressed opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocolduring the race to become the next PM. It is the deal agreed by the UK and EU in 2019 that put in place post-Brexit trade arrangements for NI. The contenders to replace Boris Johnson are staging debates across the UK. The hustings event, at the Culloden Hotel outside Belfast on Wednesday,gave local Tory members the chance to question the candidates on Northern Ireland-specific issues, as well as other topics such as the cost of living. As foreign secretary, Ms Truss introducedcontentious legislation going through Parliamentthat would give UK ministers powers to override parts of the protocol. In June, she defended the use of the bill and said the government had an obligation to act, due to the absence of a functioning executive at Stormont. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak stuck to the big themes of their campaigns - but sought to ""localise"" their messages to the Northern Ireland Conservatives. Mr Sunak spoke about restoring trust and rebuilding the economy but also made a reference to the negotiating style of thelate Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble, and mentioned a cross-community festival. Liz Truss focused on tax cuts and her experience in government - but made sure to mention the Balmoral Agricultural Show and her meetings with NI businesses. The local issue which came up most prominently in questions was the power-sharing crisis at Stormont. On this, there wasn't much to split the leadership  candidates - with both indicating they believed ""fixing"" the NI protocol was the key to bringing back the devolved government. Stormont has been without a power-sharing government since February, due to the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) ongoing protest againstthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The party is refusing to nominate a deputy first minister until the protocol is changed, meaning a decision-making executive cannot be formed and the legislative assembly cannot operate. Other ministers can remain in post but they are unable to take major policy decisions. Meet the NI Tories deciding on the next PM What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Liz Truss: bookies' favourite for Number Ten Both Ms Truss and Mr Sunak have said they would prioritise the restoration of the power-sharing institutions were they to become prime minister. Ms Truss told the hustings that until the protocol row was resolved: ""We are not going to get Stormont back up and running"". ""I've been in discussions with all the parties in Northern Ireland and I'm determined to make it happen,"" she said. This video can not be played Liz Truss says all laws should apply across the UK ""We will see power-sharing restored in Northern Ireland."" She added that the bill could take time to progress into law if it faces opposition in the Lords in the autumn, but stressed that it was a ""priority"" for her. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says he wants to radically change how businesses are taxed Mr Sunak had previously said his preference for solving the row over the protocol would be a compromise through fresh negotiations with the EU. However, he told the audience he was committed to ""doing whatever it takes to fix the protocol"". Last week, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson questioned Mr Sunak's commitment to the protocol legislation. Both candidates are vying for the job of prime minister, replacing Boris Johnson Mr Sunak said he would deliver on the bill but said that, while it makes its way through Parliament, he would want to reopen negotiations with the EU. He said it was ""sad"" that Northern Ireland was without a functioning devolved government, and that changing that needed to start with the protocol. Mr Sunak also referenced Lord Trimble, and said east-west relations needed to be repaired. The UK governmentpublished plans for the bill in June. At the centre of the proposal is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. This would mean: Goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports London also wants any trade disputes resolved by ""independent arbitration"" and not by the European Court of Justice, and for Northern Ireland to benefit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK.

Food prices push inflation to new 40-year high,"Soaring food costs have pushed UK inflation into double digits for the first time since 1982, with prices continuing to rise at their fastest rate for more than 40 years. Inflation hit 10.1% in the 12 months to July, up from 9.4% in June, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Soaring living costs are eating into household budgets,with prices rising faster than wages. The Bank of England has said inflation could peak at more than 13% this year. Why inflation is worse for some people than others How much are prices rising for you? Why are prices rising so quickly? Energy, petrol and diesel costs are also contributing to inflation. But food and non-alcoholic drinks were the largest contributor to rising prices in July, according to the ONS. The price of bread, cereals, milk, cheese and eggs rose the fastest, while the cost of vegetables, meat and chocolate were also higher. Prices also rose for other staples, such as toilet rolls, pet food and toothbrushes. Transport costs were another big contributing factor, with air fares and international rail tickets particularly increasing. The price for package holidays also went up, as demand increased. Restaurant owner Shaf Islam has put up his prices for the first time in five years Restaurant owner Shaf Islam, who runs Chutney Ivy in Leicester, said the hospitality industry was facing huge cost increases. ""Everything's gone up, from salt to soft drinks, rice to oil,"" he told the BBC. ""My electricity bill is going up from Â£1,000 a month to Â£3,000,"" he added. He is reluctantly passing some of that extra cost on to customers. ""For the first time in five years, we've put up prices. I don't like doing that because I know how tough it is for people,"" he said. Rebecca is worried about rising energy bills Rebecca Brown, a full-time PhD student at the University of Nottingham, is worried about what will happen when her energy bills go up again this winter. Her gas and electricity costs have already jumped from Â£80 to Â£140. She tops up her student loan by working part-time and shares her living costs with her partner. ""After rent and bills plus my bus fare, phone, Netflix and Spotify bills, that leaves me around Â£300 to Â£400 a month for food, fun and necessities,"" she said. ""Things like the dentist and getting my hair cut are pretty much a no-no, but my parents have helped out with that when I've gotten desperate."" Note: in the calculator, the ONS compares your personal inflation rate with CPIH, a measure of inflation that includes housing costs for those who own their home. Recently this has been slightly lower than the more widely-reported measure, called CPI, and in July 2022 it was 8.8%. If you can't see the calculator, click here.,external The rise in global food commodity prices, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills. The war has disrupted supplies from the two countries, which are major exporters of goods such as sunflower oil and wheat. Some commodities, especially grain and edible oils, have eased substantially, but there is typically a time lag of around six months before that feeds through to prices on the shelves. Kien Tan, director of retail strategy at PwC, said: ""Supermarkets have had little choice but to pass on price increases from suppliers, themselves contending with unprecedented inflation in raw material and ingredient input costs. ""This has been particularly acute in labour and utility intensive categories like dairy, with reports of the price of a pint of milk having more than doubled in some stores since the start of the year."" While the Bank of England and others have forecast that inflation would exceed 10%, most economists didn't expect it to happen just yet - with the consensus forecast at 9.8%. Driving up the average rise between June and July were food prices - everything from bread and cereals, up by an annual 12.4%, to milk cheese and eggs, up 19.4%, to oils and fats, up 23.4%. The causes are familiar: the reopening of the global economy post-pandemic, which meant the supply of goods like fuel couldn't keep up with surging demand, made worse by the war in Ukraine, which further disrupted the supply of goods like gas, wheat and cooking oil. That's led to a surge in output prices - prices of goods at the factory gate - which rose by 17.1%, faster than they have since 1977. The figures offer just a glimmer of hope from the petrol forecourts - where prices began to fall a little in July. The inflation rate is expected to rise further in October, when higher energy bills hit. The typical household energy bill is forecast to reach Â£3,582 in October and Â£4,266 in January, when the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - goes up again. The Bank of England has warned the UK will fall into recession later this year, with the economy forecast to shrink in the last three months of 2022 and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. The cost of living crisis will be among the biggest challenges facing the new prime minister in the autumn and leadership candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have clashed over what further support they would offer households. Ms Truss, who is the favourite to win the race, has pledged to cut taxes but Mr Sunak has said this should only happen once inflation is under control. Lord Stuart Rose, chairman of Asda and a Conservative peer, called for more action to help those most in need. ""We've been very, very slow in recognising this train coming down the tunnel. It's now here, and it's not about to run us over, it's [already] run quite a lot of people over,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said there were ""no easy options"" for the government in the face of soaring inflation. However, he said the Treasury was preparing ""all the options"" on additional support for households ready for the incoming prime minister. But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""ignoring the scale of this crisis"". Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""We must get a grip on rising inflation leaving families worried sick about making ends meet. ""Labour's fully-costed plan to freeze the energy price cap will bring inflation down this winter easing the burden on households and businesses."" How much are prices rising for you?

"Manhunt for mobility scooter murder suspectPolice say the attack on Thomas O'Halloran, 87, in west London was an act of unprovoked violence.","The man is described as wearing grey shorts, a dark coloured T-shirt, a white baseball cap and white patterned builder style gloves Detectives investigating the murder of a grandfather stabbed while riding a mobility scooter have released images of a man seen running from the scene armed with a knife. Thomas O'Halloran, 87, died on Cayton Road, Greenford, west London, after being attacked just after 16:00 BST on Tuesday. Ch Supt Sean Wilson said it was an act of ""unprovoked violence"". Police now want to identify the man from CCTV as a matter of urgency. He is described as wearing grey shorts, a dark coloured T-shirt, a white baseball cap and white patterned builder style gloves. Det Ch Insp Jim Eastwood, who is leading the investigation, said: ""He is clearly a dangerous individual and people are advised not to approach him, but to call us immediately on 999 if they know him or have any information regarding his whereabouts."" The Met described the attack on Thomas O'Halloran in west London as an act of unprovoked violence Speaking at the crime scene at midday Ch Supt Wilson said: ""We believe that Mr O'Halloran was stabbed on Western Avenue before managing to travel 75 yards or so on his mobility scooter to Runnymede Gardens where he flagged down a member of the public for help,"" he said. ""So, please. If you saw anything we do need to hear from you."" This video can not be played WATCH: Police chief appeals for public's help over killing of 87-year-old Thomas O'Halloran It is the sixth murder investigation to be launched in London in the last four days. Ch Supt Wilson said Mr O'Halloran was a ""much-loved"" member of the Greenford community and lived locally. Extra officers will be deployed to patrol the area in the coming days to provide reassurance. A public meeting will also be held on Thursday evening at Greenford Community Centre organised by Metropolitan Police and chaired by Ch Supt Wilson. ""They are there to protect you and to help you,"" Ch Supt Wilson added. ""If you have any concerns or information that you want to share please approach those officers. I realised that dreadful impact that incidents like this have on our communities. ""I would like to reassure you all that we are doing all we can to solve the horrendous crimes that we have seen across London over the last few days. I stress that London remains one of the safest cities in the world."" Police described the attack as an ""awful incident"" According to BBC analysis of police crime figures, 66 murder investigations have been launched this year in London by the Met Police, City of London Police and British Transport Police (BTP). This is slightly lower compared with this time last year where police had launched 78 murder investigations in the capital. Nearly two-thirds of London homicide victims in 2022 have been stabbed to death. Four people have been fatally shot - all within the last month. Sixty-two cases have led to arrests, and 52 cases have seen someone charged with murder. At the scene:BBC London's Aurelia Foster An army of TV crews, satellite trucks and journalists have set up camp in this ordinary residential road in Greenford. A forensics tent remains standing ominously within the large police cordon - marking the very spot Thomas O'Halloran died. Traffic on the eastbound A40, which is parallel to Runnymede Gardens, has been slowing down while drivers and passengers take in the crime scene. This is a narrow road, meaning this happened in plain view immediately outside people's homes, as well as afternoon traffic. It's difficult to understand how something like this could have happened in a spot so exposed. Neighbours say this is a quiet, uneventful area, with a large number of elderly residents. They told me that they fear becoming victims of crime themselves. Frasley Coutinho, who lives opposite where Mr O'Halloran was stabbed, said he saw the pensioner being surrounded by a group of youths. He said: ""I saw a couple of people gathering around him and then he drove past and stopped further up, and then there was a group of young boys around him."" Mr Coutinho said he caught some of the incident on a CCTV camera but it had been obscured by a plant. Nick Lambie told BBC London the community is very worried by the fatal stabbing Another resident Nick Lambie said Mr O'Halloran was known to collect for charity. He added: ""When you hear something like that happening on your doorstep it is very disconcerting as it is a very quiet area. ""I understand he collected for charity and was quite often at the local Tesco. By the looks of it he was making his way from there. ""Someone in their 80s in a mobility scooter can't put up much of a fight.""

LiveLiveTruss and Sunak pledge to 'fix' Northern Ireland protocolLess than a minute ago,"Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak try to win over party members in Northern Ireland as they battle to become Tory leader and PM The pair have been taking part in their eighth hustings at an event near Belfast Truss says the Northern Ireland Protocol - which sets out post-Brexit trading arrangements - is undermining the Good Friday Agreement She says she is determined to push forward controversial legislation that would allow the UK government to take unilateral action to change it That course of action has faced strong criticism in the EU Sunak also pledges to ""fix"" the protocol and stresses his record on the economy The devolved government in NI effectively collapsed in February after the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew as part of its protest against the protocol Edited by Dulcie Lee We're now wrapping up our coverage of today's Conservative leadership hustings in Northern Ireland. As a reminder, here are some of the points the two candidates touched upon:  We'll continue to cover the Truss-Sunak race for the party leadership. The latest polls suggestLiz Truss has a large lead over Sunak. There's more on on the next PM's challenges in Northern Irelandhere, and a guide to the candidates' policieshere. The next hustings are in Manchester on 19 August. The team behind the live page was made up of Alex Therrien, Heather Sharp, Laura Gozzi, Dulcie Lee, James FitzGerald, Chas Geiger, Luke Sproule, Chris Andrews, Mike Hirst, as well as Jayne McCormack and Grainne Connolly in Belfast and political correspondent David Cornock. Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in said it was ""totally insulting"" for the Conservative leadership candidates to ""rock up"" in Northern Ireland for today's debate. The republican party won the most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly election. John Finucane, the MP for North Belfast, said the Conservatives had no regard for people in Northern Ireland and were ""propping up the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party]'s block on an Executive being formed"". Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event During the questions at the hustings, George Platt asked Liz Truss whether she would overturn laws legalising abortion in Northern Ireland. She replied to sayshe wanted abortion laws to be the same across the UK. When asked how he felt about her response, Mr Platt said: âAbortion is on the minds and hearts of many people in Northern Ireland and itâs a really complex issue but I feel if youâre standing to be a leader, to represent the country, you need to know where you stand on this. Is it right or wrong?"" He adds: âI felt Liz sort of dodged the question and is the more conservative of the two - so maybe she dodged it and felt Iâd give her the vote anyway.â He says he is still undecided on who he will vote for, but is leaning more towards Truss. Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event Lynn Anderson (left) and Jayne Doherty attended the hustings Jayne Doherty says Rishi Sunak may have won her over with his answers today. ""I really came in 90% sure I was going to vote for Liz Truss,"" she says. ""But when I did hear the answers to questions and policies I was so impressed with Rishi Sunak today."" ""I can see him actually putting that into place, so I was swayed today but I still donât know how Iâm going to vote,"" she adds. But she said she didn't think either of the leadership rivals really answered questions about getting Stormont back up and running. ""Itâs a bit naive of them to think fixing the protocol will resolve it all,â she says. Lenn Jarvis backs Liz Truss Lenn Jarvis has already cast his vote, for Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. ""I think Liz was better in detail and had more detail,"" he says. ""Rishi, with him when he was chancellor, he was splashing the cash and talking about low taxation,"" he adds. ""Now thatâs contradictory, how much his arm was twisted by Boris, I donât know. But to me thereâs a credibility problem there which will take a few years to re-establish. So Iâm happy with my decision."" In the hustings a short time ago, Sunak repeated his recent line of attack that Truss is risking a ""moral failure"" if she doesn't support the country's most vulnerable people during the cost-of-living crisis. At the event near Belfast, Sunak said Truss's plan for tax would not help low-income groups and argued he had the better plan with an offer of direct financial support. After Sunak used the same ""moral failure"" line at Tuesday night's hustings in Scotland, a Truss campaign source told The Times: âItâs a shame that Sunak has had to stoop this low to get a headline.â The former chancellor was accused of being an ""attention seeker"". The latest inflation figure of 10.1% shows ""how serious the situation is"", Rishi Sunak says, speaking to journalists after the hustings near Belfast. ""Inflation is the enemy,"" he adds, describing rising prices as the biggest challenge facing the next prime minister. The former chancellor says it is important not to ""put fuel on the fire of inflation"" with the tax cuts proposed by his leadership rival Liz Truss. He says he would target support to those on the lowest incomes and pensioners. Need a recap? Here are the key points from the eighth of 12 hustings events in the leadership contest. It took place near Belfast, with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak both setting out their stalls before taking questions from Conservative Party members. Liz Truss:  Rishi Sunak Liz Truss has been speaking to journalists after the hustings, after the announcement this morning that UK inflation has reached 10.1% - the first time it's hit double digits since 1982. She says she will not ""predict a future budget"" as the economic situation is fast-moving. She repeats her pledge to reduce taxes which is ""vitally important to avoid a recession"". The Conservative candidate says she wants to remove the green levy ""to help people with their energy bills"" and to keep corporation tax low. ""We're currently facing a recession, I think that would be extremely damaging and that's why I don't believe in putting up taxes, I think that would cut off growth,"" she says. David CornockPolitical correspondent Rishi Sunak bounced on to the stage with a cheery greeting to âmy
fellow Britonsâ. Like Liz Truss, his pitch had a familiar air to it â is
there anyone left in the UK who doesnât know his mum was a chemist? Like his rival, he promised to âfixâ the Northern Ireland Protocol and protect Northern Irelandâs place in the UK. He suggested there was little between him and the foreign
secretary on that â though he acknowledged that legislation would take time
and said he would try to negotiate a settlement with the EU in the meantime. Unlike Liz Truss, he did go out of his way to attack his opponentâs
policies â particularly on borrowing and tax cuts. As the self-styled underdog in this race, that more
aggressive approach may be understandable. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent This was round eight of the
biggest rumble in UK politics right now, but neither camp took or landed any
big blows. BothLiz TrussandRishi Sunakdelivered polished performances,
carefully sidestepping the risks that come with being grilled on local
issues. While the hour-long event focused largely on their commitments to ""fix"" the protocol, their approaches to sorting out the economy remain starkly
different. And neither made much mention of the power-sharing impasse at Stormont
in their opening speeches, instead local members were left to ask each
candidate how theyâd sort it out. About 600 people in Northern Ireland get a say on who the next
occupant of No 10 should be. When asked at todayâs hustings how many were still undecided, a good
number of members were quick to stick up their hand. Despite being small in number, they were keen to remind the party
machine that every vote will count before a winner emerges on 5 September. The last question is on the ongoing impasse at Stormont, which a member of the public says will prevent all the policies Sunak has mentioned from being put in place. The Northern Ireland Assembly and executive are not currently functioning after the executive collapsed in Febraury when the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew First Minister Paul Givan in protest over the protocol. The party is refusing to return until its concerns with the protocol have been addressed. ""All of us want to see institutions back up and running,"" Sunak replies. ""Next year will be 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement and for it not to be function is sad,"" he says. ""Moving into the future starts with fixing the protocol and talking with all parties and fixing the differences and bringing people together,"" Sunak adds. He says he supports the government's the bill to override parts of the protocol, but in the interim he would talk to Europe, Ireland and the French, he says. And with that, Sunak's time is up - and that brings the event to a close. Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event Rishi Sunakâs upbeat delivery brought a lighter tone to the room in his opening speech, with a strong emphasis on values and family. Once again, there was a good show of hands when it came to question time with members keen to ask hard-hitting questions about issues including child labour in foreign countries, reaching net zero, the cost of living crisis and how people will make it through the winter. But itâs clear one key issue for members is what both candidates will do to try and restore power-sharing at Stormont, with the question raised more than once. On the topic of the environment and net zero, Sunak says that as a Conservative he cares about ""inheritance in all its guises"" - including the environment. Sunak says that in order to achieve net zero ""we need innovation to create the products of the future that will help provide clean, reliable, affordable and secure energy"" ""We need to do that across the board in solar, nuclear and wind power,"" he says. I know how to build an innovation economy, Sunak says, referring to his ""business background"", and adding that ""taxes are only a bit of the story"". ""That's how we do net zero in a positive way and spread jobs and opportunities around our country."" he says to applause. Sunak, too, faces a question on how he would âcounterâ China. The Chinese Communist Party represents the âgreatest threatâ
to economic and national security, he warns. Sunak outlines a range of actions he took as chancellor and would
continue to take as PM - including protections against âhostile investmentâ in
British companies from Beijing. He promises he will always stand up for democratic values
and those fleeing âpersecutionâ, for example from Hong Kong. He promises to spend âwhatever it takesâ to keep the UK
safe, criticising Liz Trussâs pledge to spend 3% of GDP on defence as an âarbitrary
targetâ. Rishi Sunak says he wants the Conservative Party to win in every part of the United Kingdom. The former chancellor says he is confident the party can win a fifth general election in a row, ""but it's going to require us to appeal to swing voters everywhere"". ""It's right that the Conservative and Unionist Party puts resources and candidates in every part of our United Kingdom,"" he adds to applause. The party fielded only one candidate in May's Northern Ireland Assembly elections. Matthew Robinson failed to be elected in North Down, while at the last UK general election it stood four MP candidates. First up, Sunak is asked how he plans to ""sort out"" the NHS including its staffing issues. Sunak reiterates one of his key campaign messages that ""bold and radical"" action is needed. The former chancellor says he wants people to talk less about how much money they're putting into the health service - and more about what they're getting out of it. He then reiterates one of his key pledges: fines for those who miss NHS appointments. The plan would change people's behaviour and ""free up an enormous amount of extra healthcare"", he promises. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent Itâs taken Rishi Sunak longer to get to Northern Ireland-specific
issues in his opening pitch than Liz Truss did. He began by sticking to what he knows best - talking
about the economy. Heâll have to do more to persuade some in this audience
of his credentials when it comes to talking tough with the EU. But interestingly he makes a specific reference to the late Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble, a former first minister of Northern Ireland and in later years a Conservative peer, as
he commits to âdoing what it takes to fix the protocolâ. After Truss leaves the stage, her rival Sunak is invited to set out his stall. He outlines his key values, including patriotism, loyalty to family and hard work. Sunak speaks of the importance of rebuilding the economy and restoring trust in the government. The former chancellor stresses that he's an honest candidate who tells the country what it ""needs to hear"", even if that's not always what it ""wants to hear"". David CornockPolitical correspondent Liz Trussâs opening pitch, with its focus on tax cutting and
her record in government, will have been familiar to anyone who has watched
previous hustings. But there were messages targeted at her audience,
particularly on ""fixing"" the Northern Ireland Protocol. The questions she faced have been rather different from those at other
events, with a focus on specific Northern Ireland issues. She's been asked about her failure to mention the stalemate at
Stormont. She insisted the answer lay in legislation on the protocol. âUntil we sort this issue out,â she said, âweâre not going
to get Stormont back up and running."" . Although she was confident the House of Lords would respect
the mandate for the Protocol Bill, the lengthy legislative process may mean we
shouldnât hold our breath for an early return of Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Intense downpours began in London and swept the South East on Wednesday. High Beech, in Essex, saw the highest rainfall with 64mm falling in a 24-hour period, while Frittenden in Kent had 46mm of rain falling in one hour. Light and patchy rain in localised areas is expected over the next few days.

Rain filled the north London high streets of Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill, with cars seen struggling to drive through the water. The Almeida Theatre in Islington had to cancel a matinee performance as water leaked through the roof. Rain brought play to a halt at the Test match between England and South Africa at Lord's Cricket Ground The outline of St Paul's Cathedral can just be made out as people walk in the rain on Millennium Bridge in London Heavy rainfall led to roads across England, Wales and Scotland becoming flooded on Tuesday, following weeks of extreme heat and tinder-dry conditions. Gatwick Airport in Crawley, West Sussex, has warned of delays and cancellations to some flights as air traffic control restrictions were declared across the south due to poor weather. Worksop in Nottinghamshire experienced 93mm of rainfall between 17:00 and 20:00 BST on Tuesday -almost twice the average monthly rainfall of 54mm, according to BBC weather presenter Simon King. And more heavy rainfall is expected in England and Wales, with the most intense rain likely to fall in the South East covering London, Kent, West Sussex, Essex and Suffolk. BBC Weather's Stav Danaos said: ""Low pressure pushing in off the Atlantic will bring more of a breeze during Thursday, and this weather front will bring a band of cloud and rain which will slowly spread from west to east across the country.

LiveLiveTruss and Sunak pledge to 'fix' Northern Ireland protocol4 minutes ago,"Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak try to win over party members in Northern Ireland as they battle to become Tory leader and PM The pair have been taking part in their eighth hustings at an event near Belfast Truss says the Northern Ireland Protocol - which sets out post-Brexit trading arrangements - is undermining the Good Friday Agreement She says she is determined to push forward controversial legislation that would allow the UK government to take unilateral action to change it That course of action has faced strong criticism in the EU Sunak also pledges to ""fix"" the protocol and stresses his record on the economy The devolved government in NI effectively collapsed in February after the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew as part of its protest against the protocol Edited by Dulcie Lee We're now wrapping up our coverage of today's Conservative leadership hustings in Northern Ireland. As a reminder, here are some of the points the two candidates touched upon:  We'll continue to cover the Truss-Sunak race for the party leadership. The latest polls suggestLiz Truss has a large lead over Sunak. There's more on on the next PM's challenges in Northern Irelandhere, and a guide to the candidates' policieshere. The next hustings are in Manchester on 19 August. The team behind the live page was made up of Alex Therrien, Heather Sharp, Laura Gozzi, Dulcie Lee, James FitzGerald, Chas Geiger, Luke Sproule, Chris Andrews, Mike Hirst, as well as Jayne McCormack and Grainne Connolly in Belfast and political correspondent David Cornock. Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in said it was ""totally insulting"" for the Conservative leadership candidates to ""rock up"" in Northern Ireland for today's debate. The republican party won the most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly election. John Finucane, the MP for North Belfast, said the Conservatives had no regard for people in Northern Ireland and were ""propping up the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party]'s block on an Executive being formed"". Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event During the questions at the hustings, George Platt asked Liz Truss whether she would overturn laws legalising abortion in Northern Ireland. She replied to sayshe wanted abortion laws to be the same across the UK. When asked how he felt about her response, Mr Platt said: âAbortion is on the minds and hearts of many people in Northern Ireland and itâs a really complex issue but I feel if youâre standing to be a leader, to represent the country, you need to know where you stand on this. Is it right or wrong?"" He adds: âI felt Liz sort of dodged the question and is the more conservative of the two - so maybe she dodged it and felt Iâd give her the vote anyway.â He says he is still undecided on who he will vote for, but is leaning more towards Truss. Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event Lynn Anderson (left) and Jayne Doherty attended the hustings Jayne Doherty says Rishi Sunak may have won her over with his answers today. ""I really came in 90% sure I was going to vote for Liz Truss,"" she says. ""But when I did hear the answers to questions and policies I was so impressed with Rishi Sunak today."" ""I can see him actually putting that into place, so I was swayed today but I still donât know how Iâm going to vote,"" she adds. But she said she didn't think either of the leadership rivals really answered questions about getting Stormont back up and running. ""Itâs a bit naive of them to think fixing the protocol will resolve it all,â she says. Lenn Jarvis backs Liz Truss Lenn Jarvis has already cast his vote, for Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. ""I think Liz was better in detail and had more detail,"" he says. ""Rishi, with him when he was chancellor, he was splashing the cash and talking about low taxation,"" he adds. ""Now thatâs contradictory, how much his arm was twisted by Boris, I donât know. But to me thereâs a credibility problem there which will take a few years to re-establish. So Iâm happy with my decision."" In the hustings a short time ago, Sunak repeated his recent line of attack that Truss is risking a ""moral failure"" if she doesn't support the country's most vulnerable people during the cost-of-living crisis. At the event near Belfast, Sunak said Truss's plan for tax would not help low-income groups and argued he had the better plan with an offer of direct financial support. After Sunak used the same ""moral failure"" line at Tuesday night's hustings in Scotland, a Truss campaign source told The Times: âItâs a shame that Sunak has had to stoop this low to get a headline.â The former chancellor was accused of being an ""attention seeker"". The latest inflation figure of 10.1% shows ""how serious the situation is"", Rishi Sunak says, speaking to journalists after the hustings near Belfast. ""Inflation is the enemy,"" he adds, describing rising prices as the biggest challenge facing the next prime minister. The former chancellor says it is important not to ""put fuel on the fire of inflation"" with the tax cuts proposed by his leadership rival Liz Truss. He says he would target support to those on the lowest incomes and pensioners. Need a recap? Here are the key points from the eighth of 12 hustings events in the leadership contest. It took place near Belfast, with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak both setting out their stalls before taking questions from Conservative Party members. Liz Truss:  Rishi Sunak Liz Truss has been speaking to journalists after the hustings, after the announcement this morning that UK inflation has reached 10.1% - the first time it's hit double digits since 1982. She says she will not ""predict a future budget"" as the economic situation is fast-moving. She repeats her pledge to reduce taxes which is ""vitally important to avoid a recession"". The Conservative candidate says she wants to remove the green levy ""to help people with their energy bills"" and to keep corporation tax low. ""We're currently facing a recession, I think that would be extremely damaging and that's why I don't believe in putting up taxes, I think that would cut off growth,"" she says. David CornockPolitical correspondent Rishi Sunak bounced on to the stage with a cheery greeting to âmy
fellow Britonsâ. Like Liz Truss, his pitch had a familiar air to it â is
there anyone left in the UK who doesnât know his mum was a chemist? Like his rival, he promised to âfixâ the Northern Ireland Protocol and protect Northern Irelandâs place in the UK. He suggested there was little between him and the foreign
secretary on that â though he acknowledged that legislation would take time
and said he would try to negotiate a settlement with the EU in the meantime. Unlike Liz Truss, he did go out of his way to attack his opponentâs
policies â particularly on borrowing and tax cuts. As the self-styled underdog in this race, that more
aggressive approach may be understandable. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent This was round eight of the

The Chinese Communist Party represents the âgreatest threatâ
to economic and national security, he warns. Sunak outlines a range of actions he took as chancellor and would
continue to take as PM - including protections against âhostile investmentâ in
British companies from Beijing. He promises he will always stand up for democratic values
and those fleeing âpersecutionâ, for example from Hong Kong. He promises to spend âwhatever it takesâ to keep the UK

Why inflation is worse for some people than others,"The cost of living is more than 11% higher than it was a year ago, the official figures say. But you may feel your bills have risen by a lot more. That's because your own personal inflation rate is driven by factors specific to you: if you're someone who buys a lot of petrol, your weekly outgoings will have gone up a lot more than someone who cycles everywhere, for example. Here are some ways that your individual experience of price rises may be at odds with what's reported in the news. Inflation is measured by taking a typical ""basket"" of goods and services and seeing how much they're going up in price. The contents of that basket changes each year as habits change. Pet collars, sports bras or canned pulses on your shopping list? The Official for National Statistics (ONS), which is responsible for calculating inflation statistics, says you're on trend for 2022. Note: in the calculator, the ONS compares your personal inflation rate with CPIH, a measure of inflation that includes housing costs for those who own their home. Recently this has been slightly lower than the more widely-reported measure, called CPI, and in October 2022 it was 9.6%. If you can't see the calculator, click here. In the age of hybrid work however, suits are out, and blazers, for the more sporadic trip to the office, are in instead. Individual bakery doughnuts are also out, because people working from home are more likely to plump for multipacks instead apparently. Not everything you buy is reflected in the official inflation numbers; the more niche, the less likely it is to be monitored. And the things you're buying may go up in price by more than what's in the basket, or if you're lucky by less. It's not just what's in the ONS's basket that's re-evaluated at the start of every year - but how big a part that item plays in our day to day spending. Every item has a ""weight"" attached, so the changing price of petrol will have a much bigger impact than if the cost of tea goes up - simply because we spend a much bigger proportion of our income on petrol. Sometimes that means there's a bit of a lag. For example, at present, the ONS assumes that household energy bills make up about 3.5% of spending, which was accurate at the start of 2022. But with energy bills poised to at least double, they're ultimately going to take up 7% or more of a typical household budget. That means the official rate of inflation may not be fully reflecting the impact of rising energy bills until next year. This video can not be played Watch: Cost of living: ""A lot of people have nowhere to turn"" Inflation has been driven largely by higher energy costs over the last year - but bills vary widely from household to household. For the 86% of UK homes that are mainly heated by gas, bills have risen more sharply, than where heating is from oil or electricity. Fuel efficiency makes a big difference too. Homes are rated on energy performance, from A to G, with A being the most efficient. Average fuel costsâ¯forâ¯a homeâ¯in Englandâ¯with aâ¯D ratingâ¯are a fifth higher than for those with an A-C rating. Those with a G rating may pay three times as much; those lofty but draughty period homes come with an invisible extra price tag. Between 2014 and 2021, the ONS reckons inflation was pretty much the same for people in all income groups. But that's changed this year, because the main items that are rising in price are staples: food as well as energy. That has a bigger impact on those with the lowest incomes. The ONS reckons energy, food, and drink accounts for around 15% of lower-income households' spending, compared to 10% for high-income groups. It means that it reckons inflation in October was 12.5% for the poorest 10% of households versus 9.6% for the richest 10% - the biggest gap since 2009. Even if that draughty mansion is expensive to heat, that might not represent as big a problem to the owner as a person on a low income in a small flat. Older, larger homes will cost more to heat, but the occupants may also be able to better afford the rising bills But it could have been even worse without the government's Energy Bill Support package. Before it was unveiled, the Institute for Fiscal Studies had predicted  least well off households could have faced an 18% inflation rate in October, while the richest 20% could have seen a rate of 11%. Older, larger homes will cost more to heat, but the occupants may also be able to better afford the rising bills Even if prices are rising for everyone, the pain felt varies. And the only way to maintain living standards is to have more money coming in. The average pay packet is failing to match the rising cost of living; the gap between the two is the biggest for at least two decades. The private sector - in particular hospitality, where staff shortages have been acute, and financial services - have typically seen bigger pay rises than the public sector. Those relying on the state pension or Universal Credit may see those rates go up by 10% - but they'll have to wait for next spring. So if you feel your money goes far less far than a year ago you're far from alone. Why are prices rising in the UK? What is a recession and how could one affect me?

Payout for woman catapulted from Hull Fair ride,"Jade Harrison suffered serious physical and psychological injuries in the incident A nursery nurse catapulted from a Hull Fair ride has agreed to a ""five-figure"" payout for physical and psychological damage caused. Jade Harrison, 24, fell from the Airmaxx 360 ride at Hull Fair on 7 October 2019, resulting in a broken jaw and other facial injuries. Miss Harrison has agreed an out-of-court settlement with the ride's insurers, her solicitor said. She said: ""I'm a different person now to that one that got on that ride."" Woman flung from fair ride 'lucky to be alive' Woman injured falling from fairground ride Safety calls after woman flung from fair ride Miss Harrison said she had needed psychological support and thousands of pounds worth of dental treatment as a result of the incident. ""Back then I had no fears and I was up for anything really, but now I am averse to anything that has an element of risk,"" she said. ""Simple fun things, like jumping off the rocks into the sea on holiday, I just wouldn't do anymore as I wouldn't be able to get past the fear of hitting a rock. That is how my mindset has changed."" The Airmaxx 360 ride at Hull Fair in 2019 Describing a family trip to Skegness, Miss Harrison said: ""I couldn't go on any rides. ""Some of my family went on them, but I didn't want them to. I couldn't even watch."" Insurers acting on behalf of Taylor's Funfairs, owners of the Airmaxx 360 ride, admitted liability for the accident and injuries caused. Despite the trauma, Miss Harrison said she no longer suffered from anxiety. ""In the weeks after my accident I was struggling and really anxious,"" she said. ""I'd have nightmares many nights and wake up in a state of panic, but over time that went away. ""When Hull Fair was on last year I just avoided it. I had to drive by it a couple of times so I just made sure I didn't look."" Rebecca Cone, of Hudgell Solicitors, said her client was grateful for the early admission of liability, which had enabled her to quickly access psychological and dental treatment. Ms Cone added: ""It was, of course, a shocking incident and one from which lessons must be learned. Accidents like this simply should not happen.""

Why are prices rising so quickly?How much are prices rising for you? Try our calculator,"Prices in the UK went up by 2.5% in the 12 months to December. It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for three months in a row. The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and cut them twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 but is Â£1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, withvinyl records and air fryersadded in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed. The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation. The main inflation measure is called theConsumer Prices Index (CPI),external, and the latest figure is published every month. CPIwas 2.5% in the year to December 2024, down from 2.6% in the 12 months to November. It marked the first fall in the inflation rate for three months. This was largely as a result of hotel prices falling, and tobacco costs increasing by less than in December 2023. Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years. However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly. Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of high food prices. UK inflation rise - what does it mean for me? When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high. The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises. But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. The Bank of England cut rates twice in 2024 - to 5% in August, and againto 4.75% in November. As expected,it held rates at 4.75% at its December meeting. The Bank also considersother measures,external, such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates. Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.2% in December, down from 3.5% in the year to November. After the Budget at the end of October, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained - includingan increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers- would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices. Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Bailey said the path for rates would likely be ""downward from here"" but warned cuts would be gradual. After the December meeting, he said ""a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right"", but added ""with the heightened uncertainty in the economy, we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year."" The next interest rate decision is on Thursday 6 February. Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper? How the Budget will affect you and your money Thelatest official quarterly figures,externalshow that regular pay grew more quickly than expected between August and October. Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period was 5.2%, up from 4.8% between July and September. This was the first increase for more than a year, and means wages are growing significantly more quickly than inflation. Five tips when asking for a pay rise How to get a job: Six expert tips for finding work Who are the millions of Britons not working? The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2.4% in December 2024, up from 2.2% in November. In June, the European Central Bank (ECB)cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%,the first fall in five years. It has since cut rates three times:to 3.5% in September, to 3.25% in October and to 3% in December,external. US inflationrose to 2.9% in the year to December 2024, as energy and egg prices surged. At its September meeting,the US central bank lowered rates for the first time in four years, cutting its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to between 4.75% and 5%. The cut was larger than many analysts had predicted. In November, the Federal Reserve announced a further cut,taking the key rate to between 4.5% and 4.75%. Ratesfell again in December, taking the target range to between 4.25% to 4.5%. The Fed is widely expected to keep its key rate, which now stands at about 4.3%, unchanged at its meeting in January.

LiveLiveCost of food and drink pushes UK inflation to 10.1%7 minutes ago,"The UK inflation rate has hit double digits - 10.1% - the Office for National Statistics says It's a higher rate than analysts were predicting - the last time price rises were in double digits was in February 1982 Rising food and drink prices made the biggest contribution to the change in the inflation rate between June and July Bread, cereals, milk, cheese and eggs had a particular impact on rising prices But the cost of living is rising across the board, driven partly by energy costs and the Ukraine war but also factors such as the cost of raw materials Meanwhile, average wage increases are falling behind, with the average salary buying 3% fewer goods and services than a year before Inflation is expected to continue rising this year, with the Bank of England predicting it won't go down to the target 2% for about two years Edited by Nathan Williams Thank you for following today's live coverage of the UK inflation rate and cost of living. Today's coverage was brought to you by George Wright, Marita Moloney, Jen Meierhans, James Fitzgerald, Rachel Russell, Nathan Williams and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. You can continue to follow the storyhere. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the latest UK rate of inflation figures shortly. Here's a reminder of what happened today:  When the Covid pandemic hit, many of us turned away from coins and notes to limit the spread of the virus. But as prices have risen, it seems people want to keep their spending under control by using cash instead of their bank cards or online payments. Post offices handled Â£801m in personal cash withdrawals in July, the most since records began five years ago. That's up more than 20% from a year earlier. Natalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, said it showed people are ""literally counting the pennies"" as they grapple with rising prices. ""It's absolutely because of the cost of living crisis,"" said Ceeney, who chaired the government's independent Access to Cash review. ""People will be taking out cash and physically putting it into pots, saying 'this is what I have for bills, this is what I have for food, and this is what's left'."" Nadhim Zahawi, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, says that there are ""no easy options"" for the government in the face of soaring inflation. On the day that inflation hit 10.1%, Zahawi tells the BBC that the high energy prices being experienced in the UK are down to ""Putin deliberately using energy as a tool to get back at us for the help that we are putting into Ukraine"". While the Bank of England's governor has also said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the largest contributor to UK inflation, economists say there are many contributing factors including supply chain issues and recruitment challenges. Meanwhile, Zahawi says that the Treasury is preparing ""all the options"" for the incoming prime minister on 5 September - but adds that he is also preparing plans for a further price cap increase in January. ""We leave no stone unturned; we are looking at every option to be ready for 5 September for additional support. ""My message is ... whether they are small businesses or families who are really struggling, really worried, is that we will be ready for more support as the new prime minister comes in. ""We are working night and day to make this work."" Labour MP Hilary Benn, who is also co-convener of the cross party UK Trade and Business Commission, has warned the government's Brexit deal may also be to blame for the increased prices. He urged the government to improve the terms of the Brexit deal to ""remove these artificial barriers to trade and allow for the easier movement of labour to and from the UK"". He said: âInflation is clearly a global problem but the UK is experiencing one of the highest rates of inflation among other comparable economies, almost twice as high as France and around four times that of Japan. âThe UK is the only G7 country dealing with the added pressures caused by the governmentâs Brexit deal, which has increased costs for businesses and contributed to labour shortages, in turn driving up prices for consumers even further."" Next month we will find out who will take over from Boris Johnson as prime minister. Right now Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are taking part in a hustings with Tory members in Belfast,which we are also covering live here. But what are their plans for dealing with the cost of living crisis? Liz Truss  Rishi Sunak If you're looking for ways to reduce the amount of energy you use while cooking in the kitchen, here are some tips we've put together from the Energy Saving Trust and energy companies: People are being urged not to turn off their fridges in order to save money on their fuel bills. Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says she has heard of households doing this to cut down on costs but warned it creates the risk of infection in food. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the health chief also said that people should try and keep the heating as energy prices rise this autumn, ""particularly those at the extreme ages of life"". ""I think one of the important things here is people recognise the importance of spending what will likely be for many people very limited resource on heating, because that is an essential part of their health,"" she said. The inflation rate of 10.1% announced today is higher than analysts expected and won't be the last cost of living increase we see this year. Earlier this month, theBank of Englandpredicted that Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation would hit 13.3% in October as energy bills soar. But the recent CPI figures have outstripped predictions. The Bank's forecast for July inflation was below what theOffice for National Statistics(ONS) measured across the month by 0.2 percentage points. James Smith, research director at independent think-tank the Resolution Foundation, adds that it will take ""many months, and much more living-standards pain, before inflation starts to ease"". Some analysts expect inflation to push higher into the winter, with Pwc economist Jake
Finney stating it will peak in January 2023 instead of October. While Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, says inflation will hit ""around 13% in October"" before it ""gradually eases"" from early next year, followed by a ""substantial"" decrease from autumn 2023. As the cost of living continues to rise, Citizens Advice is warning that one in four people in the UK wonât be able to pay their energy bills in October based on current forecasts. Of those who wonât be able to pay in October, 68% have a household income of less than Â£30,000. Some 3.2 million disabled people and 4.4 million families with children won't be able to afford autumnâs predicted rise in energy bills and will end up almost Â£100-a-month in the red,the charity adds,external. Citizens Advice says its advice takes into account the energy rebate and cost-of-living payments already being offered by the government, showing that increasing costs are outstripping support. It is calling for further interventions from government, as well as asking energy regulator Ofgem to ensure people are protected from the most serious consequences of falling into arrears. The organisation's CEO Dame Clare Moriarty says there is a risk of ""a winter of despair for millions"" if further support is not provided by government. Fiona TrottReporting from Newcastle More than 150 people have arrived at a building in Newcastle to get help and
advice about the cost of living. It's run by the West End Foodbank who are
having to buy food themselves, because donors tell them itâs now too expensive
to give away. Carole Rowland, the welfare manager, says: ""We see people in full-time
work with mortgages, who are broken. They canât cope. ""Everyone is just trying
to make their way in life. Government help is not touching the sides. We need a
review of Universal Credit so that people can keep up."" This foodbank is believed to be the biggest in the UK. It's receiving around 7
tonnes of food per month, but needs 20 tonnes because of increasing demand. Carole says: ""Before the pandemic, we had two foodbanks in Newcastle. We now have eight across the city and we run 11 sessions a week."" UK-wide inflation hit 10.1% in July but the poorest tenth of households faced an inflation rate of 10.9%, according to the Resolution Foundation. Meanwhile the richest tenth also saw their cost of living rise significantly, but only 9.4%. James Smith, research director at the foundation, said: ""Inflation has hit double digits earlier than expected off the back of the highest food price inflation in over two decades, and is set to continue climbing as energy bills soar this winter."" ""It will take many months, and much more living standards pain, before inflation starts to ease,"" Smith adds. ""So, the number one priority for the next prime minister will be to offer significant support to help millions of families through a brutal winter and beyond."" The price rises we experience depend
on what we spend our money on and some readers have been using our personal inflation calculator, built by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) to find out theirs. Vivgot a figure of 10.7% - ""pretty much what I expected, sadly,"" she says. ""Fuel bills accounted for 30%, though I have been using my car much less. The rises in household fuel costs in October will punish us severely... It's very worrying and the picture is grim."" Keithsays: ""I found my calculated inflation rate slightly less than I had expected."" ""I am an 83 year old slightly disabled man. I live alone and rely on care workers. ""About half of my income is index-linked, but past experience suggests that in practice this rarely compensates for real price increases. ""The rest of my income depends on investments, and I think it likely that I shall need to encroach more and more on the capital in order to maintain my present standard of living.""

The Bank of England thinks this could push the UK into arecession- when the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. Whether or not the Bank's October prediction proves true remains to be seen. Its forecast for July's inflation rate was 9.9%, 0.2 percentage points lower than where the ONS has now measured it. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the difference between the Bank's forecast and the measurement is mainly down to surging food prices. Meanwhile, theenergy pricecap will reach close to Â£3,640 in October, up from Â£1,971 at the moment, according to the most recent estimates by experts. Then energy prices are expected to rise even further. Energy consultancy Auxilione said that at today's prices the cap might rise to Â£4,722 in January before hitting Â£5,601 in April. Stefan JajecznykProducer, BBC Breakfast We've been chatting to business leaders at Birmingham's wholesale market about how record inflation is affecting them. Raj Kandola, head
of policy at Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, says companies are under pressure to raise their prices due to higher costs for fuel, energy and raw materials. ""The next few months are absolutely crucial, those margins are getting absolutely squeezed,"" he says. ""That's why we are calling on the government to act now and help alleviate these huge cost pressures firms are facing right now. ""Many small businesses incurred huge debts in the pandemic which they are struggling to repay and now the cost of living crisis is adding to that pressure right now. ""So whether it's financial support for those in energy intensive industries, potentially looking at a price cap for smaller firms or even removing VAT from energy bills as well, I think all of those measures would help in the short term."" Here's a recap on the latest developments in the cost of living crisis. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Todayâs inflation
figure is estimated to be the highest since early 1982. That's actually
about 20 years before we started using the current measure of price rises
for households - the Consumer Price Index. Thankfully, the
Office for National Statistics went back and worked outhow it might have looked in years gone by.,external And, using those
figures, you can see in this chart just how exceptional this current bout of
inflation really is. We've been talking about the rise in the rate of inflation - but what is it? Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Every month a figure is released, estimating how much prices are rising overall -the latest ONS data shows it has hit 10.1%. The Bank of England has warned that inflation could reach 13% and has predicted a recession by the end of the year. Stefan JajecznykProducer, BBC Breakfast In Birmingham's wholesale market, one trader tells us rising prices mean he can't plan from one week to the next and he does not feel there is any support. Leroy Howe, of Howe's Exports says: ""The price of fuel keeps going up so suppliers keep putting up the prices so what we find happening is that one week we'll be charged this price and the next week we'll be charged a higher price."" He says his biggest concern is the drop on footfall as customers cut back on spending. ""The amount of people that used to come through this market aren't coming through anymore so that is quite worrying,"" he says. He feels that traders like him are being ""left to our own devices"" and ""aren't getting any support from anywhere."" ""There's nobody trying to help us we are just trying to survive as trader in this market off our own back really,"" he says. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Despite
all the talk about the energy price cap being set to rise above Â£3,000, energy
costs havenât contributed that much directly to the latest hike in consumer
inflation. This
springâs price cap rise hit the figures in April and pushed inflation up to 9%. The
next price cap rise  - expected to take prices past Â£3,000 for the average
household - wonât be felt until after itâs announced at the end of the month. So
it's other things that have pushed inflation from those levels up into double
digits. In
the latest month, that's record increases in food and drink prices we've been
describing further down in the page. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Food prices push inflation to new 40-year highPrices climb 10.1% in the year to July as the cost of food, household goods and holidays soars.","Soaring food costs have pushed UK inflation into double digits for the first time since 1982, with prices continuing to rise at their fastest rate for more than 40 years. Inflation hit 10.1% in the 12 months to July, up from 9.4% in June, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Soaring living costs are eating into household budgets,with prices rising faster than wages. The Bank of England has said inflation could peak at more than 13% this year. Why inflation is worse for some people than others How much are prices rising for you? Why are prices rising so quickly? Energy, petrol and diesel costs are also contributing to inflation. But food and non-alcoholic drinks were the largest contributor to rising prices in July, according to the ONS. The price of bread, cereals, milk, cheese and eggs rose the fastest, while the cost of vegetables, meat and chocolate were also higher. Prices also rose for other staples, such as toilet rolls, pet food and toothbrushes. Transport costs were another big contributing factor, with air fares and international rail tickets particularly increasing. The price for package holidays also went up, as demand increased. Restaurant owner Shaf Islam has put up his prices for the first time in five years Restaurant owner Shaf Islam, who runs Chutney Ivy in Leicester, said the hospitality industry was facing huge cost increases. ""Everything's gone up, from salt to soft drinks, rice to oil,"" he told the BBC. ""My electricity bill is going up from Â£1,000 a month to Â£3,000,"" he added. He is reluctantly passing some of that extra cost on to customers. ""For the first time in five years, we've put up prices. I don't like doing that because I know how tough it is for people,"" he said. Rebecca is worried about rising energy bills Rebecca Brown, a full-time PhD student at the University of Nottingham, is worried about what will happen when her energy bills go up again this winter. Her gas and electricity costs have already jumped from Â£80 to Â£140. She tops up her student loan by working part-time and shares her living costs with her partner. ""After rent and bills plus my bus fare, phone, Netflix and Spotify bills, that leaves me around Â£300 to Â£400 a month for food, fun and necessities,"" she said. ""Things like the dentist and getting my hair cut are pretty much a no-no, but my parents have helped out with that when I've gotten desperate."" Note: in the calculator, the ONS compares your personal inflation rate with CPIH, a measure of inflation that includes housing costs for those who own their home. Recently this has been slightly lower than the more widely-reported measure, called CPI, and in July 2022 it was 8.8%. If you can't see the calculator, click here.,external The rise in global food commodity prices, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills. The war has disrupted supplies from the two countries, which are major exporters of goods such as sunflower oil and wheat. Some commodities, especially grain and edible oils, have eased substantially, but there is typically a time lag of around six months before that feeds through to prices on the shelves. Kien Tan, director of retail strategy at PwC, said: ""Supermarkets have had little choice but to pass on price increases from suppliers, themselves contending with unprecedented inflation in raw material and ingredient input costs. ""This has been particularly acute in labour and utility intensive categories like dairy, with reports of the price of a pint of milk having more than doubled in some stores since the start of the year."" While the Bank of England and others have forecast that inflation would exceed 10%, most economists didn't expect it to happen just yet - with the consensus forecast at 9.8%. Driving up the average rise between June and July were food prices - everything from bread and cereals, up by an annual 12.4%, to milk cheese and eggs, up 19.4%, to oils and fats, up 23.4%. The causes are familiar: the reopening of the global economy post-pandemic, which meant the supply of goods like fuel couldn't keep up with surging demand, made worse by the war in Ukraine, which further disrupted the supply of goods like gas, wheat and cooking oil. That's led to a surge in output prices - prices of goods at the factory gate - which rose by 17.1%, faster than they have since 1977. The figures offer just a glimmer of hope from the petrol forecourts - where prices began to fall a little in July. The inflation rate is expected to rise further in October, when higher energy bills hit. The typical household energy bill is forecast to reach Â£3,582 in October and Â£4,266 in January, when the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - goes up again. The Bank of England has warned the UK will fall into recession later this year, with the economy forecast to shrink in the last three months of 2022 and keep shrinking until the end of 2023. The cost of living crisis will be among the biggest challenges facing the new prime minister in the autumn and leadership candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have clashed over what further support they would offer households. Ms Truss, who is the favourite to win the race, has pledged to cut taxes but Mr Sunak has said this should only happen once inflation is under control. Lord Stuart Rose, chairman of Asda and a Conservative peer, called for more action to help those most in need. ""We've been very, very slow in recognising this train coming down the tunnel. It's now here, and it's not about to run us over, it's [already] run quite a lot of people over,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said there were ""no easy options"" for the government in the face of soaring inflation. However, he said the Treasury was preparing ""all the options"" on additional support for households ready for the incoming prime minister. But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""ignoring the scale of this crisis"". Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""We must get a grip on rising inflation leaving families worried sick about making ends meet. ""Labour's fully-costed plan to freeze the energy price cap will bring inflation down this winter easing the burden on households and businesses."" How much are prices rising for you?

Man in court over Windsor Castle crossbow incident,"Jaswant Singh Chail appeared in court via video-link from Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital A man charged under the Treason Act after allegedly entering the grounds of Windsor Castle with a loaded crossbow on Christmas Day has appeared in court. Jaswant Singh Chail is said to have told a protection officer ""I am here to kill the Queen"" before he was arrested, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Mr Chail, 20, is also charged with making threats to kill and possession of an offensive weapon. He was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 14 September. The Queen had been staying at Windsor, rather than spending Christmas as usual on her Sandringham estate Mr Chail, from Southampton, was allegedly spotted in the grounds of Windsor Castle at about 08:10 GMT on 25 December last year. Prosecutor Kathryn Selby told the court he had been carrying a Supersonic X-Bow weapon which had the potential to cause ""serious or fatal injuries"". She said the allegations were not being treated as a ""terrorism offence"" but had been dealt with by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. Mr Chail, who was unemployed at the time of the alleged offence but previously worked for Co-op supermarket, appeared in court via video-link from Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital in Berkshire. The Queen was at Windsor Castle on Christmas Day when the incident happened He has been charged with an offence under section 2 of the 1842 Treason Act, namely ""discharging or aiming firearms, or throwing or using any offensive matter or weapon, with intent to injure or alarm her Majesty"". The Queen had been staying at Windsor Castle for Christmas, rather than spending it as usual on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Her Majesty was due to be joined for lunch by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Under the 1842 Treason Act, it is an offence to assault the Queen, or have a firearm or offensive weapon in her presence with intent to injure or alarm her or to cause a breach of peace. In 1981, Marcus Sarjeant was jailed for five years under the section of the Treason Act after he fired blank shots at the Queen while she was riding down The Mall in London during the Trooping the Colour parade. The last person to be convicted under the separate and more serious 1351 Treason Act was William Joyce, also known as Lord Haw-Haw, who collaborated with Germany during the Second World War.

Pay-out for woman catapulted from Hull Fair ride,"Jade Harrison suffered serious physical and psychological injuries in the incident A nursery nurse catapulted from a Hull Fair ride has agreed to a ""five-figure"" payout for physical and psychological damage caused. Jade Harrison, 24, fell from the Airmaxx 360 ride at Hull Fair on 7 October 2019, resulting in a broken jaw and other facial injuries. Miss Harrison has agreed an out-of-court settlement with the ride's insurers, her solicitor said. She said: ""I'm a different person now to that one that got on that ride."" Woman flung from fair ride 'lucky to be alive' Woman injured falling from fairground ride Safety calls after woman flung from fair ride Miss Harrison said she had needed psychological support and thousands of pounds worth of dental treatment as a result of the incident. ""Back then I had no fears and I was up for anything really, but now I am averse to anything that has an element of risk,"" she said. ""Simple fun things, like jumping off the rocks into the sea on holiday, I just wouldn't do anymore as I wouldn't be able to get past the fear of hitting a rock. That is how my mindset has changed."" The Airmaxx 360 ride at Hull Fair in 2019 Describing a family trip to Skegness, Miss Harrison said: ""I couldn't go on any rides. ""Some of my family went on them, but I didn't want them to. I couldn't even watch."" Insurers acting on behalf of Taylor's Funfairs, owners of the Airmaxx 360 ride, admitted liability for the accident and injuries caused. Despite the trauma, Miss Harrison said she no longer suffered from anxiety. ""In the weeks after my accident I was struggling and really anxious,"" she said. ""I'd have nightmares many nights and wake up in a state of panic, but over time that went away. ""When Hull Fair was on last year I just avoided it. I had to drive by it a couple of times so I just made sure I didn't look."" Rebecca Cone, of Hudgell Solicitors, said her client was grateful for the early admission of liability, which had enabled her to quickly access psychological and dental treatment. Ms Cone added: ""It was, of course, a shocking incident and one from which lessons must be learned. Accidents like this simply should not happen.""

Mobility scooter murder victim named by police,"The man is described as wearing grey shorts, a dark coloured T-shirt, a white baseball cap and white patterned builder style gloves Detectives investigating the murder of a grandfather stabbed while riding a mobility scooter have released images of a man seen running from the scene armed with a knife. Thomas O'Halloran, 87, died on Cayton Road, Greenford, west London, after being attacked just after 16:00 BST on Tuesday. Ch Supt Sean Wilson said it was an act of ""unprovoked violence"". Police now want to identify the man from CCTV as a matter of urgency. He is described as wearing grey shorts, a dark coloured T-shirt, a white baseball cap and white patterned builder style gloves. Det Ch Insp Jim Eastwood, who is leading the investigation, said: ""He is clearly a dangerous individual and people are advised not to approach him, but to call us immediately on 999 if they know him or have any information regarding his whereabouts."" The Met described the attack on Thomas O'Halloran in west London as an act of unprovoked violence Speaking at the crime scene at midday Ch Supt Wilson said: ""We believe that Mr O'Halloran was stabbed on Western Avenue before managing to travel 75 yards or so on his mobility scooter to Runnymede Gardens where he flagged down a member of the public for help,"" he said. ""So, please. If you saw anything we do need to hear from you."" This video can not be played WATCH: Police chief appeals for public's help over killing of 87-year-old Thomas O'Halloran It is the sixth murder investigation to be launched in London in the last four days. Ch Supt Wilson said Mr O'Halloran was a ""much-loved"" member of the Greenford community and lived locally. Extra officers will be deployed to patrol the area in the coming days to provide reassurance. A public meeting will also be held on Thursday evening at Greenford Community Centre organised by Metropolitan Police and chaired by Ch Supt Wilson. ""They are there to protect you and to help you,"" Ch Supt Wilson added. ""If you have any concerns or information that you want to share please approach those officers. I realised that dreadful impact that incidents like this have on our communities. ""I would like to reassure you all that we are doing all we can to solve the horrendous crimes that we have seen across London over the last few days. I stress that London remains one of the safest cities in the world."" Police described the attack as an ""awful incident"" According to BBC analysis of police crime figures, 66 murder investigations have been launched this year in London by the Met Police, City of London Police and British Transport Police (BTP). This is slightly lower compared with this time last year where police had launched 78 murder investigations in the capital. Nearly two-thirds of London homicide victims in 2022 have been stabbed to death. Four people have been fatally shot - all within the last month. Sixty-two cases have led to arrests, and 52 cases have seen someone charged with murder. At the scene:BBC London's Aurelia Foster An army of TV crews, satellite trucks and journalists have set up camp in this ordinary residential road in Greenford. A forensics tent remains standing ominously within the large police cordon - marking the very spot Thomas O'Halloran died. Traffic on the eastbound A40, which is parallel to Runnymede Gardens, has been slowing down while drivers and passengers take in the crime scene. This is a narrow road, meaning this happened in plain view immediately outside people's homes, as well as afternoon traffic. It's difficult to understand how something like this could have happened in a spot so exposed. Neighbours say this is a quiet, uneventful area, with a large number of elderly residents. They told me that they fear becoming victims of crime themselves. Frasley Coutinho, who lives opposite where Mr O'Halloran was stabbed, said he saw the pensioner being surrounded by a group of youths. He said: ""I saw a couple of people gathering around him and then he drove past and stopped further up, and then there was a group of young boys around him."" Mr Coutinho said he caught some of the incident on a CCTV camera but it had been obscured by a plant. Nick Lambie told BBC London the community is very worried by the fatal stabbing Another resident Nick Lambie said Mr O'Halloran was known to collect for charity. He added: ""When you hear something like that happening on your doorstep it is very disconcerting as it is a very quiet area. ""I understand he collected for charity and was quite often at the local Tesco. By the looks of it he was making his way from there. ""Someone in their 80s in a mobility scooter can't put up much of a fight.""

Tory leadership candidates battle for votes in NIThe event gives Tory members the chance to question the candidates on Northern Ireland issues.Northern IrelandComments,"The two remaining candidates have taken part in a series of hustings events as well as head-to-head debates Leadership candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have pledged to progress the government's controversialprotocol bill, as they pitched for votes in north Down. Both have expressed opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocolduring the race to become the next PM. It is the deal agreed by the UK and EU in 2019 that put in place post-Brexit trade arrangements for NI. The contenders to replace Boris Johnson are staging debates across the UK. The hustings event, at the Culloden Hotel outside Belfast on Wednesday,gave local Tory members the chance to question the candidates on Northern Ireland-specific issues, as well as other topics such as the cost of living. As foreign secretary, Ms Truss introducedcontentious legislation going through Parliamentthat would give UK ministers powers to override parts of the protocol. In June, she defended the use of the bill and said the government had an obligation to act, due to the absence of a functioning executive at Stormont. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak stuck to the big themes of their campaigns - but sought to ""localise"" their messages to the Northern Ireland Conservatives. Mr Sunak spoke about restoring trust and rebuilding the economy but also made a reference to the negotiating style of thelate Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble, and mentioned a cross-community festival. Liz Truss focused on tax cuts and her experience in government - but made sure to mention the Balmoral Agricultural Show and her meetings with NI businesses. The local issue which came up most prominently in questions was the power-sharing crisis at Stormont. On this, there wasn't much to split the leadership  candidates - with both indicating they believed ""fixing"" the NI protocol was the key to bringing back the devolved government. Stormont has been without a power-sharing government since February, due to the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) ongoing protest againstthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The party is refusing to nominate a deputy first minister until the protocol is changed, meaning a decision-making executive cannot be formed and the legislative assembly cannot operate. Other ministers can remain in post but they are unable to take major policy decisions. Meet the NI Tories deciding on the next PM What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Liz Truss: bookies' favourite for Number Ten Both Ms Truss and Mr Sunak have said they would prioritise the restoration of the power-sharing institutions were they to become prime minister. Ms Truss told the hustings that until the protocol row was resolved: ""We are not going to get Stormont back up and running"". ""I've been in discussions with all the parties in Northern Ireland and I'm determined to make it happen,"" she said. This video can not be played Liz Truss says all laws should apply across the UK ""We will see power-sharing restored in Northern Ireland."" She added that the bill could take time to progress into law if it faces opposition in the Lords in the autumn, but stressed that it was a ""priority"" for her. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says he wants to radically change how businesses are taxed Mr Sunak had previously said his preference for solving the row over the protocol would be a compromise through fresh negotiations with the EU. However, he told the audience he was committed to ""doing whatever it takes to fix the protocol"". Last week, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson questioned Mr Sunak's commitment to the protocol legislation. Both candidates are vying for the job of prime minister, replacing Boris Johnson Mr Sunak said he would deliver on the bill but said that, while it makes its way through Parliament, he would want to reopen negotiations with the EU. He said it was ""sad"" that Northern Ireland was without a functioning devolved government, and that changing that needed to start with the protocol. Mr Sunak also referenced Lord Trimble, and said east-west relations needed to be repaired. The UK governmentpublished plans for the bill in June. At the centre of the proposal is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. This would mean: Goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports London also wants any trade disputes resolved by ""independent arbitration"" and not by the European Court of Justice, and for Northern Ireland to benefit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK.

As a reminder, here are some of the points the two candidates touched upon:  We'll continue to cover the Truss-Sunak race for the party leadership. The latest polls suggestLiz Truss has a large lead over Sunak. There's more on on the next PM's challenges in Northern Irelandhere, and a guide to the candidates' policieshere. The next hustings are in Manchester on 19 August. The team behind the live page was made up of Alex Therrien, Heather Sharp, Laura Gozzi, Dulcie Lee, James FitzGerald, Chas Geiger, Luke Sproule, Chris Andrews, Mike Hirst, as well as Jayne McCormack and Grainne Connolly in Belfast and political correspondent David Cornock. Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in said it was ""totally insulting"" for the Conservative leadership candidates to ""rock up"" in Northern Ireland for today's debate. The republican party won the most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly election. John Finucane, the MP for North Belfast, said the Conservatives had no regard for people in Northern Ireland and were ""propping up the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party]'s block on an Executive being formed"". Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event During the questions at the hustings, George Platt asked Liz Truss whether she would overturn laws legalising abortion in Northern Ireland. She replied to sayshe wanted abortion laws to be the same across the UK. When asked how he felt about her response, Mr Platt said: âAbortion is on the minds and hearts of many people in Northern Ireland and itâs a really complex issue but I feel if youâre standing to be a leader, to represent the country, you need to know where you stand on this. Is it right or wrong?"" He adds: âI felt Liz sort of dodged the question and is the more conservative of the two - so maybe she dodged it and felt Iâd give her the vote anyway.â He says he is still undecided on who he will vote for, but is leaning more towards Truss. Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event Lynn Anderson (left) and Jayne Doherty attended the hustings Jayne Doherty says Rishi Sunak may have won her over with his answers today. ""I really came in 90% sure I was going to vote for Liz Truss,"" she says. ""But when I did hear the answers to questions and policies I was so impressed with Rishi Sunak today."" ""I can see him actually putting that into place, so I was swayed today but I still donât know how Iâm going to vote,"" she adds. But she said she didn't think either of the leadership rivals really answered questions about getting Stormont back up and running. ""Itâs a bit naive of them to think fixing the protocol will resolve it all,â she says. Lenn Jarvis backs Liz Truss Lenn Jarvis has already cast his vote, for Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. ""I think Liz was better in detail and had more detail,"" he says. ""Rishi, with him when he was chancellor, he was splashing the cash and talking about low taxation,"" he adds. ""Now thatâs contradictory, how much his arm was twisted by Boris, I donât know. But to me thereâs a credibility problem there which will take a few years to re-establish. So Iâm happy with my decision."" In the hustings a short time ago, Sunak repeated his recent line of attack that Truss is risking a ""moral failure"" if she doesn't support the country's most vulnerable people during the cost-of-living crisis. At the event near Belfast, Sunak said Truss's plan for tax would not help low-income groups and argued he had the better plan with an offer of direct financial support. After Sunak used the same ""moral failure"" line at Tuesday night's hustings in Scotland, a Truss campaign source told The Times: âItâs a shame that Sunak has had to stoop this low to get a headline.â The former chancellor was accused of being an ""attention seeker"". The latest inflation figure of 10.1% shows ""how serious the situation is"", Rishi Sunak says, speaking to journalists after the hustings near Belfast. ""Inflation is the enemy,"" he adds, describing rising prices as the biggest challenge facing the next prime minister. The former chancellor says it is important not to ""put fuel on the fire of inflation"" with the tax cuts proposed by his leadership rival Liz Truss. He says he would target support to those on the lowest incomes and pensioners. Need a recap? Here are the key points from the eighth of 12 hustings events in the leadership contest. It took place near Belfast, with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak both setting out their stalls before taking questions from Conservative Party members. Liz Truss:  Rishi Sunak Liz Truss has been speaking to journalists after the hustings, after the announcement this morning that UK inflation has reached 10.1% - the first time it's hit double digits since 1982. She says she will not ""predict a future budget"" as the economic situation is fast-moving. She repeats her pledge to reduce taxes which is ""vitally important to avoid a recession"". The Conservative candidate says she wants to remove the green levy ""to help people with their energy bills"" and to keep corporation tax low. ""We're currently facing a recession, I think that would be extremely damaging and that's why I don't believe in putting up taxes, I think that would cut off growth,"" she says. David CornockPolitical correspondent Rishi Sunak bounced on to the stage with a cheery greeting to âmy
fellow Britonsâ. Like Liz Truss, his pitch had a familiar air to it â is
there anyone left in the UK who doesnât know his mum was a chemist? Like his rival, he promised to âfixâ the Northern Ireland Protocol and protect Northern Irelandâs place in the UK. He suggested there was little between him and the foreign
secretary on that â though he acknowledged that legislation would take time
and said he would try to negotiate a settlement with the EU in the meantime. Unlike Liz Truss, he did go out of his way to attack his opponentâs
policies â particularly on borrowing and tax cuts. As the self-styled underdog in this race, that more
aggressive approach may be understandable. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent This was round eight of the
biggest rumble in UK politics right now, but neither camp took or landed any
big blows. BothLiz TrussandRishi Sunakdelivered polished performances,
carefully sidestepping the risks that come with being grilled on local
issues. While the hour-long event focused largely on their commitments to ""fix"" the protocol, their approaches to sorting out the economy remain starkly
different. And neither made much mention of the power-sharing impasse at Stormont
in their opening speeches, instead local members were left to ask each
candidate how theyâd sort it out. About 600 people in Northern Ireland get a say on who the next
occupant of No 10 should be. When asked at todayâs hustings how many were still undecided, a good
number of members were quick to stick up their hand. Despite being small in number, they were keen to remind the party
machine that every vote will count before a winner emerges on 5 September. The last question is on the ongoing impasse at Stormont, which a member of the public says will prevent all the policies Sunak has mentioned from being put in place. The Northern Ireland Assembly and executive are not currently functioning after the executive collapsed in Febraury when the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew First Minister Paul Givan in protest over the protocol. The party is refusing to return until its concerns with the protocol have been addressed. ""All of us want to see institutions back up and running,"" Sunak replies. ""Next year will be 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement and for it not to be function is sad,"" he says. ""Moving into the future starts with fixing the protocol and talking with all parties and fixing the differences and bringing people together,"" Sunak adds. He says he supports the government's the bill to override parts of the protocol, but in the interim he would talk to Europe, Ireland and the French, he says. And with that, Sunak's time is up - and that brings the event to a close. Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event Rishi Sunakâs upbeat delivery brought a lighter tone to the room in his opening speech, with a strong emphasis on values and family. Once again, there was a good show of hands when it came to question time with members keen to ask hard-hitting questions about issues including child labour in foreign countries, reaching net zero, the cost of living crisis and how people will make it through the winter. But itâs clear one key issue for members is what both candidates will do to try and restore power-sharing at Stormont, with the question raised more than once. On the topic of the environment and net zero, Sunak says that as a Conservative he cares about ""inheritance in all its guises"" - including the environment. Sunak says that in order to achieve net zero ""we need innovation to create the products of the future that will help provide clean, reliable, affordable and secure energy"" ""We need to do that across the board in solar, nuclear and wind power,"" he says. I know how to build an innovation economy, Sunak says, referring to his ""business background"", and adding that ""taxes are only a bit of the story"". ""That's how we do net zero in a positive way and spread jobs and opportunities around our country."" he says to applause. Sunak, too, faces a question on how he would âcounterâ China. The Chinese Communist Party represents the âgreatest threatâ
to economic and national security, he warns. Sunak outlines a range of actions he took as chancellor and would
continue to take as PM - including protections against âhostile investmentâ in
British companies from Beijing. He promises he will always stand up for democratic values
and those fleeing âpersecutionâ, for example from Hong Kong. He promises to spend âwhatever it takesâ to keep the UK
safe, criticising Liz Trussâs pledge to spend 3% of GDP on defence as an âarbitrary
targetâ. Rishi Sunak says he wants the Conservative Party to win in every part of the United Kingdom. The former chancellor says he is confident the party can win a fifth general election in a row, ""but it's going to require us to appeal to swing voters everywhere"". ""It's right that the Conservative and Unionist Party puts resources and candidates in every part of our United Kingdom,"" he adds to applause. The party fielded only one candidate in May's Northern Ireland Assembly elections. Matthew Robinson failed to be elected in North Down, while at the last UK general election it stood four MP candidates. First up, Sunak is asked how he plans to ""sort out"" the NHS including its staffing issues. Sunak reiterates one of his key campaign messages that ""bold and radical"" action is needed. The former chancellor says he wants people to talk less about how much money they're putting into the health service - and more about what they're getting out of it. He then reiterates one of his key pledges: fines for those who miss NHS appointments. The plan would change people's behaviour and ""free up an enormous amount of extra healthcare"", he promises. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent Itâs taken Rishi Sunak longer to get to Northern Ireland-specific
issues in his opening pitch than Liz Truss did. He began by sticking to what he knows best - talking
about the economy. Heâll have to do more to persuade some in this audience
of his credentials when it comes to talking tough with the EU. But interestingly he makes a specific reference to the late Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble, a former first minister of Northern Ireland and in later years a Conservative peer, as
he commits to âdoing what it takes to fix the protocolâ. After Truss leaves the stage, her rival Sunak is invited to set out his stall. He outlines his key values, including patriotism, loyalty to family and hard work. Sunak speaks of the importance of rebuilding the economy and restoring trust in the government. The former chancellor stresses that he's an honest candidate who tells the country what it ""needs to hear"", even if that's not always what it ""wants to hear"". David CornockPolitical correspondent Liz Trussâs opening pitch, with its focus on tax cutting and
her record in government, will have been familiar to anyone who has watched
previous hustings. But there were messages targeted at her audience,
particularly on ""fixing"" the Northern Ireland Protocol. The questions she faced have been rather different from those at other
events, with a focus on specific Northern Ireland issues. She's been asked about her failure to mention the stalemate at
Stormont. She insisted the answer lay in legislation on the protocol. âUntil we sort this issue out,â she said, âweâre not going
to get Stormont back up and running."" . Although she was confident the House of Lords would respect
the mandate for the Protocol Bill, the lengthy legislative process may mean we
shouldnât hold our breath for an early return of Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
LiveLiveSunak and Truss make their pitch in Northern Ireland7 minutes ago,"Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak try to win over party members in Northern Ireland as they battle to become Tory leader and PM The pair have been taking part in their eighth hustings at an event near Belfast Truss says the Northern Ireland Protocol - which sets out post-Brexit trading arrangements - is undermining the Good Friday Agreement She says she is determined to push forward controversial legislation that would allow the UK government to take unilateral action to change it That course of action has faced strong criticism in the EU Sunak also pledges to ""fix"" the protocol and stresses his record on the economy The devolved government in NI effectively collapsed in February after the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew as part of its protest against the protocol Edited by Dulcie Lee We're now wrapping up our coverage of today's Conservative leadership hustings in Northern Ireland. As a reminder, here are some of the points the two candidates touched upon:  We'll continue to cover the Truss-Sunak race for the party leadership. The latest polls suggestLiz Truss has a large lead over Sunak. There's more on on the next PM's challenges in Northern Irelandhere, and a guide to the candidates' policieshere. The next hustings are in Manchester on 19 August. The team behind the live page was made up of Alex Therrien, Heather Sharp, Laura Gozzi, Dulcie Lee, James FitzGerald, Chas Geiger, Luke Sproule, Chris Andrews, Mike Hirst, as well as Jayne McCormack and Grainne Connolly in Belfast and political correspondent David Cornock. Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in said it was ""totally insulting"" for the Conservative leadership candidates to ""rock up"" in Northern Ireland for today's debate. The republican party won the most seats in the recent Northern Ireland Assembly election. John Finucane, the MP for North Belfast, said the Conservatives had no regard for people in Northern Ireland and were ""propping up the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party]'s block on an Executive being formed"". Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event During the questions at the hustings, George Platt asked Liz Truss whether she would overturn laws legalising abortion in Northern Ireland. She replied to sayshe wanted abortion laws to be the same across the UK. When asked how he felt about her response, Mr Platt said: âAbortion is on the minds and hearts of many people in Northern Ireland and itâs a really complex issue but I feel if youâre standing to be a leader, to represent the country, you need to know where you stand on this. Is it right or wrong?"" He adds: âI felt Liz sort of dodged the question and is the more conservative of the two - so maybe she dodged it and felt Iâd give her the vote anyway.â He says he is still undecided on who he will vote for, but is leaning more towards Truss. Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event Lynn Anderson (left) and Jayne Doherty attended the hustings Jayne Doherty says Rishi Sunak may have won her over with his answers today. ""I really came in 90% sure I was going to vote for Liz Truss,"" she says. ""But when I did hear the answers to questions and policies I was so impressed with Rishi Sunak today."" ""I can see him actually putting that into place, so I was swayed today but I still donât know how Iâm going to vote,"" she adds. But she said she didn't think either of the leadership rivals really answered questions about getting Stormont back up and running. ""Itâs a bit naive of them to think fixing the protocol will resolve it all,â she says. Lenn Jarvis backs Liz Truss Lenn Jarvis has already cast his vote, for Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. ""I think Liz was better in detail and had more detail,"" he says. ""Rishi, with him when he was chancellor, he was splashing the cash and talking about low taxation,"" he adds. ""Now thatâs contradictory, how much his arm was twisted by Boris, I donât know. But to me thereâs a credibility problem there which will take a few years to re-establish. So Iâm happy with my decision."" In the hustings a short time ago, Sunak repeated his recent line of attack that Truss is risking a ""moral failure"" if she doesn't support the country's most vulnerable people during the cost-of-living crisis. At the event near Belfast, Sunak said Truss's plan for tax would not help low-income groups and argued he had the better plan with an offer of direct financial support. After Sunak used the same ""moral failure"" line at Tuesday night's hustings in Scotland, a Truss campaign source told The Times: âItâs a shame that Sunak has had to stoop this low to get a headline.â The former chancellor was accused of being an ""attention seeker"". The latest inflation figure of 10.1% shows ""how serious the situation is"", Rishi Sunak says, speaking to journalists after the hustings near Belfast. ""Inflation is the enemy,"" he adds, describing rising prices as the biggest challenge facing the next prime minister. The former chancellor says it is important not to ""put fuel on the fire of inflation"" with the tax cuts proposed by his leadership rival Liz Truss. He says he would target support to those on the lowest incomes and pensioners. Need a recap? Here are the key points from the eighth of 12 hustings events in the leadership contest. It took place near Belfast, with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak both setting out their stalls before taking questions from Conservative Party members. Liz Truss:  Rishi Sunak Liz Truss has been speaking to journalists after the hustings, after the announcement this morning that UK inflation has reached 10.1% - the first time it's hit double digits since 1982. She says she will not ""predict a future budget"" as the economic situation is fast-moving. She repeats her pledge to reduce taxes which is ""vitally important to avoid a recession"". The Conservative candidate says she wants to remove the green levy ""to help people with their energy bills"" and to keep corporation tax low. ""We're currently facing a recession, I think that would be extremely damaging and that's why I don't believe in putting up taxes, I think that would cut off growth,"" she says. David CornockPolitical correspondent Rishi Sunak bounced on to the stage with a cheery greeting to âmy
fellow Britonsâ. Like Liz Truss, his pitch had a familiar air to it â is
there anyone left in the UK who doesnât know his mum was a chemist? Like his rival, he promised to âfixâ the Northern Ireland Protocol and protect Northern Irelandâs place in the UK. He suggested there was little between him and the foreign
secretary on that â though he acknowledged that legislation would take time
and said he would try to negotiate a settlement with the EU in the meantime. Unlike Liz Truss, he did go out of his way to attack his opponentâs
policies â particularly on borrowing and tax cuts. As the self-styled underdog in this race, that more
aggressive approach may be understandable. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent This was round eight of the
biggest rumble in UK politics right now, but neither camp took or landed any
big blows. BothLiz TrussandRishi Sunakdelivered polished performances,
carefully sidestepping the risks that come with being grilled on local
issues. While the hour-long event focused largely on their commitments to ""fix"" the protocol, their approaches to sorting out the economy remain starkly
different. And neither made much mention of the power-sharing impasse at Stormont
in their opening speeches, instead local members were left to ask each
candidate how theyâd sort it out. About 600 people in Northern Ireland get a say on who the next
occupant of No 10 should be. When asked at todayâs hustings how many were still undecided, a good
number of members were quick to stick up their hand. Despite being small in number, they were keen to remind the party
machine that every vote will count before a winner emerges on 5 September. The last question is on the ongoing impasse at Stormont, which a member of the public says will prevent all the policies Sunak has mentioned from being put in place. The Northern Ireland Assembly and executive are not currently functioning after the executive collapsed in Febraury when the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew First Minister Paul Givan in protest over the protocol. The party is refusing to return until its concerns with the protocol have been addressed. ""All of us want to see institutions back up and running,"" Sunak replies. ""Next year will be 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement and for it not to be function is sad,"" he says. ""Moving into the future starts with fixing the protocol and talking with all parties and fixing the differences and bringing people together,"" Sunak adds. He says he supports the government's the bill to override parts of the protocol, but in the interim he would talk to Europe, Ireland and the French, he says. And with that, Sunak's time is up - and that brings the event to a close. Grainne ConnollyReporting from the event Rishi Sunakâs upbeat delivery brought a lighter tone to the room in his opening speech, with a strong emphasis on values and family. Once again, there was a good show of hands when it came to question time with members keen to ask hard-hitting questions about issues including child labour in foreign countries, reaching net zero, the cost of living crisis and how people will make it through the winter. But itâs clear one key issue for members is what both candidates will do to try and restore power-sharing at Stormont, with the question raised more than once. On the topic of the environment and net zero, Sunak says that as a Conservative he cares about ""inheritance in all its guises"" - including the environment. Sunak says that in order to achieve net zero ""we need innovation to create the products of the future that will help provide clean, reliable, affordable and secure energy"" ""We need to do that across the board in solar, nuclear and wind power,"" he says. I know how to build an innovation economy, Sunak says, referring to his ""business background"", and adding that ""taxes are only a bit of the story"". ""That's how we do net zero in a positive way and spread jobs and opportunities around our country."" he says to applause. Sunak, too, faces a question on how he would âcounterâ China. The Chinese Communist Party represents the âgreatest threatâ
to economic and national security, he warns. Sunak outlines a range of actions he took as chancellor and would
continue to take as PM - including protections against âhostile investmentâ in
British companies from Beijing. He promises he will always stand up for democratic values
and those fleeing âpersecutionâ, for example from Hong Kong. He promises to spend âwhatever it takesâ to keep the UK
safe, criticising Liz Trussâs pledge to spend 3% of GDP on defence as an âarbitrary

Raducanu thrashes Williams in first meeting,"Serena Williams, who was playing the Western and Southern Open for what is likely to be the final time, won the Cincinnati title in 2014 and 2015 British number one Emma Raducanu put a dampener on Serena Williams' farewell tour after thrashing the American great in the Cincinnati Open first round. Williams, 40, plans to retire after the US Open, which starts on 29 August, and lost 6-4 6-0 in what is set to be the penultimate event of her career. The 23-time Grand Slam champion lacked sharpness and her 19-year-old opponent punished her in a composed display. Reigning US Open champion Raducanu will play Victoria Azarenka in round two. ""I'm so grateful for the experience to have been able to play Serena and for our careers to have crossed over,"" said world number 13 Raducanu, who played superbly with her defence of the Grand Slam title in New York looming. ""Everything she has achieved has been so inspirational and it was a true honour to share the court with her."" Gauff retires injured & Osaka loses with US Open on the horizon Meanwhile, British men's number two Dan Evans lost 6-3 6-4 to Serbia's Filip Krajinovic. Evans, 32, reached the Montreal semi-finals last week but was unable to sustain that form at the second successive ATP Masters event. Fellow Britons Andy Murray and Cameron Norrie meet in the second round at 16:00 BST on Wednesday, followed on the centre court by Raducanu's match against Belarus' former world number one Azarenka. Ever since Williams announced her impending retirement last week - or her evolution away from the sport, as she put it - there has been the swell of acclaim which her legendary status deserves. The respect of the locker room for Williams has been demonstrated in the following days, with world number one Iga Swiatek and Raducanu among the WTA players lavishing praise on the American's achievements and her legacy. Four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, who lost in the tournament earlier on Tuesday, cheered on her hero from the stands as Williams took on a player who had not been born when she won her first four major titles. But Williams showed, as many great athletes have in the past, that time has the knack of showing them up on the stages where they once dominated. There had been reports Williams' preparation was hampered by an injury in the build-up to the match, which was originally advertised to be played on Monday but then moved back to Tuesday. Whether she was bothered by a physical problem or not, Williams was unable to cope with the pressure caused by Raducanu's serve  and groundstrokes. Now, after waving goodbye to Cincinnati with a smile, the six-time US Open champion must try to regroup for what she will want to be a more fitting farewell at Flushing Meadows.

Raducanu had recalled that her first memory of seeing Williams play was when she went to Wimbledon as a seven-year-old, adding that being drawn against the American on her farewell tour was a ""great gift"". But the Briton showed there was no room for nostalgia or charity in one of her best performances since her extraordinary US Open triumph last year. Williams has long intimidated her opponents by simply being on the other side of the net, with her aura backed up by the potency of her serve and powerful game. Raducanu showed from the start she was not prepared to be overawed by the occasion. Raducanu hit 14 winners and made just one unforced error in a dominant win which took her just one hour and five minutes Williams' serve was broken to love in the first game, setting the tone for a one-sided match which slowly deflated the former world number one and, in turn, a home crowd desperate to see a national icon finish her illustrious career with a flourish. Raducanu broke serve again for a 4-1 lead and, although Williams clawed one of the breaks back to give the crowd hope, the younger player continued to dominate. A frustrating debut season on the WTA Tour has seen Raducanu struggle to gain momentum but, in what could be her one and only meeting with Williams, she returned to a similar level to the kind of form she showed in New York last year. After closing out the opening set with a hold to love, Raducanu raced through the second set by dropping just 10 points and sealed a comfortable win with a precise ace down the middle. ""I was nervous from the first point to the last,"" said Raducanu. ""Serena is dangerous and can come back from any situation. I had to stay focused. I'm so pleased I managed to keep my composure. ""Each of those wins kind of build confidence regardless of the level you're playing, every single win counts. But of course this one more so, because you're playing like the greatest. ""But I'm not trying to get too high or too low right now.""

Thames Water hosepipe ban to start next week,"Thames Water CEO Sarah Bentley said implementing the ban had been a ""difficult decision"" Thames Water has announced a hosepipe ban for 10 million customers across the south of England. The ban will come into force from 24 August and will impact people across the Thames Valley and London. The temporary use ban comes after reports of the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 and ""unprecedented weather conditions"". It means people will not be able to use hosepipes to water gardens, wash cars and windows, or fill paddling pools. Those found to breach the rulescould be fined up to Â£1,000.,external Thames Water CEO Sarah Bentley said implementing the ban had been a ""very difficult decision"" but, she added, reservoir storage levels in London and Farmoor, in Oxfordshire had ""reduced significantly"". The ban is the next phase in the water firm's drought plan, having already announced it was currently fixing 1,100 leaks across its 20,000-mile network every week. Ms Bentley added: ""After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted. ""Customer demand is at unprecedented levels and we now have to move into the next phase of our drought plan to conserve water, mitigate further risk and futureproof supplies."" Thames Water admits it must do better as ban looms London officially declared in drought Driest first half of year in England since 1976 Thames Water, which also has five million wastewater customers, is thelatest water provider to announce a hosepipe banas droughts have been declared across England. The firm previously admitted it ""must do better"" after coming under fire for having the worst record on leaks out of all nine water companies in the UK. More than 600 million litres of water is currently lost a week by the company, mainly due to ageing pipes. A council leaderhas said Thames Water should stop paying its bosses bonusesand use that money to fix leaks instead of ""rewarding themselves"". Clive Jones, from Wokingham Borough Council, shared analysis by his Liberal Democrat party which found executives were awarded an ""eyewatering"" Â£2.4m in 2021. Hosepipe bans come aftertemperatures topped 40C in the UK for the first time on record this summer. The recent heatwave resulted in the highest demand for water in the past 25 years, according to Thames Water. Dr Gina Brown told the BBC water supply problems in her village had been ""recurrent"" The company said it supplied 2.9 billion litres of water a day to customers across the region as temperatures spiked. In areas with particularly hot weather, the firm said demand rose by 50% compared to the average for the time of year. Taps in the Oxfordshire village of Northend ran dry in a heatwave last week and Thames Water had to deliver emergency supplies to 68 customers. Resident Dr Gina Brown, a radiologist who lives in the village with her elderly parents,p told the BBC water shortages were a ""recurrent"" problemduring hot weather. It was later found the issue was down toE.coli being found in a reservoir which supplies the village. Thames Water apologised for the disruption and said the site had been disinfected.

Sewage pollution alerts made for almost 50 beaches,"Pollution warnings are in place for dozens of beaches in England and Wales after untreated sewage was discharged into the sea around the coast. Official data shows there have been a number of discharges since Monday, which Southern Water says are to protect homes and businesses. The pollution follows a period of heavy rain across southern England, after a spell of extremely dry weather. Warnings from the Safer Seas and Rivers Service are based on water firms' data. The service is run by charity Surfers Against Sewage. Sewage regularly dumped illegally in England and Wales rivers Environment Agency seeks jail for polluting water bosses Many of the beaches contaminated are popular resorts and include: Bognor Regis, West Sussex Newquay, Cornwall East Looe, Cornwall Heacham, Norfolk Rest and Sandy Bay (Porthcawl), Bridgend Morecambe North, Lancashire Cowes, Isle of Wight Robin Hoods Bay, North Yorkshire Sidmouth Town, Devon Shoreham Beach, West Sussex Southend-on-Sea, Essex The majority are along England's south coast. Near Bath is a popular swimming spot along the River Avon called Warleigh Weir which runs through an area belonging to landowner Johnny Palmer. Untreated sewage has been released just upstream. Mr Palmer has been working for years to make the water clean enough to gain bathing water status. ""I think it's a disgrace. You've got children swimming. And you know, you can't tell your kids to not drink the water. So you've literally got children drinking sewage, which is the kind of thing you might expect in parts of Africa or India, but, you know, Western Europe,"" he said. ""Rivers are a central part of our landscape and our ecology and our natural environment. They are a resource that everyone can and should use - and does use."" Hundreds of people were bathing in this river near Bath last weekend Southern Water is one of the water companies responsible for those regions, along with Wessex Water and South West Water. In a statement, Southern Water said: ""There were thunderstorms accompanied by heavy rain the night before last and [Tuesday]. Storm releases were made to protect homes, schools and businesses from flooding. The release is 95-97% rainwater and so should not be described as raw sewage. ""We know customers do not like that the industry has to rely on these [discharges] to protect them, and we are pioneering a new approach."" Last year Southern Waterwas fined a record Â£90mafter admitting deliberately dumping vast amounts of sewage into the sea across the south coast. Under EU law, these kinds of sewage dischargesare legal only in ""exceptional"" circumstances.,externalThey happen mostly after heavy rain, when there is a risk that pipes that carry storm-water, along with sewage, may overflow. However,in 2020and2021,there were almost 400,000 such events. In a statement, the Environment Agency said that sewage pollution could be ""devastating to human health, local biodiversity and our environment"". It said it would not ""hesitate to act to eliminate the harm sewage discharges cause to the environment"". It has previously calledfor the top executives of England's water companies to face jail when serious incidents of pollution occur. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: ""Our rivers and beaches are once again being treated as open sewers. Years of underinvestment is now in plain sight."" The government has saidit intends to produce a plan,externalby September this year to reduce storm overflows. This was made a legal requirement by the Environment Act 2021.

"Thames Water hosepipe ban to start next weekThames Water, which supplies water to 10 million customers in the south of England, starts the ban on 24 August.England","Thames Water CEO Sarah Bentley said implementing the ban had been a ""difficult decision"" Thames Water has announced a hosepipe ban for 10 million customers across the south of England. The ban will come into force from 24 August and will impact people across the Thames Valley and London. The temporary use ban comes after reports of the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 and ""unprecedented weather conditions"". It means people will not be able to use hosepipes to water gardens, wash cars and windows, or fill paddling pools. Those found to breach the rulescould be fined up to Â£1,000.,external Thames Water CEO Sarah Bentley said implementing the ban had been a ""very difficult decision"" but, she added, reservoir storage levels in London and Farmoor, in Oxfordshire had ""reduced significantly"". The ban is the next phase in the water firm's drought plan, having already announced it was currently fixing 1,100 leaks across its 20,000-mile network every week. Ms Bentley added: ""After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted. ""Customer demand is at unprecedented levels and we now have to move into the next phase of our drought plan to conserve water, mitigate further risk and futureproof supplies."" Thames Water admits it must do better as ban looms London officially declared in drought Driest first half of year in England since 1976 Thames Water, which also has five million wastewater customers, is thelatest water provider to announce a hosepipe banas droughts have been declared across England. The firm previously admitted it ""must do better"" after coming under fire for having the worst record on leaks out of all nine water companies in the UK. More than 600 million litres of water is currently lost a week by the company, mainly due to ageing pipes. A council leaderhas said Thames Water should stop paying its bosses bonusesand use that money to fix leaks instead of ""rewarding themselves"". Clive Jones, from Wokingham Borough Council, shared analysis by his Liberal Democrat party which found executives were awarded an ""eyewatering"" Â£2.4m in 2021. Hosepipe bans come aftertemperatures topped 40C in the UK for the first time on record this summer. The recent heatwave resulted in the highest demand for water in the past 25 years, according to Thames Water. Dr Gina Brown told the BBC water supply problems in her village had been ""recurrent"" The company said it supplied 2.9 billion litres of water a day to customers across the region as temperatures spiked. In areas with particularly hot weather, the firm said demand rose by 50% compared to the average for the time of year. Taps in the Oxfordshire village of Northend ran dry in a heatwave last week and Thames Water had to deliver emergency supplies to 68 customers. Resident Dr Gina Brown, a radiologist who lives in the village with her elderly parents,p told the BBC water shortages were a ""recurrent"" problemduring hot weather. It was later found the issue was down toE.coli being found in a reservoir which supplies the village. Thames Water apologised for the disruption and said the site had been disinfected.

Liz Truss said UK workers need 'more graft',"Liz Truss said the UK needs ""more productivity"" to boost economic growth Conservative leadership candidate Liz Truss said British workers needed ""more graft"" in leaked comments. In the recording, published bythe Guardian,external, Ms Truss suggested Britons lacked the ""skill and application"" of foreign nationals. Labour said her comments were ""offensive"" and ""effectively brand British workers as lazy"". The foreign secretary did not deny making the comments and said productivity needed to improve. ""I don't know what you're quoting there,"" Ms Truss said under questioning at a Tory leadership event on Tuesday evening. ""But the point that I've always made is what we need in this country is more productivity across the country and we need more economic growth."" The leak emerged ahead of a hustings event in Perthwhere Ms Truss and her leadership rival former Chancellor Rishi Sunak were grilled by Scottish Conservative members. The party's roughly 200,000-strong membership are voting for their next leader, who will succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister in September. Truss and Sunak reject indyref2 in Scotland event Truss and Sunak policy guide How will the new party leader and PM be chosen? The Guardian report said,externalMs Truss made the comments in the audio when she was chief secretary to the Treasury, a role she held between 2017 and 2019. The report did not reveal the source of the audio recording, parts of which were redacted. In the two-minute clip, Ms Truss said British workers' ""mindset and attitude"" were partly to blame for them producing less per hour than their foreign counterparts, suggesting they needed ""more graft"". Ms Truss said in the recording: ""Essentially it's partly a mindset and attitude thing I think. Yeah, its working culture basically. If you go to China it's quite different, I can assure you... ""There's a fundamental issue of British working culture. Essentially if we're going to be a richer country and a more prosperous country, that needs to change. ""But I don't think people are that keen to change that."" Speaking on difference in productivity in the UK, she said: ""If you look at productivity, it's very, very different in London from the rest of the country."" A Truss campaign source said the comments were ""half a decade old"" and lacked ""context"", while acknowledging the UK does ""need to boost productivity"". ""As prime minister, Liz will deliver an economy that is high wage, high growth and low tax,"" the source said. The Office for National Statistics says,externalevery country has seen slower growth in output per worker since 2009 when compared with the pre-financial crisis period. OECD figures show,externalthat in 2019, the UK came fourth highest in the rankings of GDP per hour worked among G7 countries.

Asked about it at a leadership debate last month, Ms Truss distanced herself from the contentious assessment, claiming co-author and Sunak supporter Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, had written it. Mr Raab has subsequently said the authors of the book, which also included several other senior Conservative ministers, had agreed ""collective responsibility"" over its contents. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the ""Britannia Unchained fiasco"" seemed to be ""the blueprint"" for Ms Truss's prospective government. ""Workers across the country are working all hours to keep a roof over their heads, put food on the table and provide for their families,"" he said. ""Liz Truss should be helping working people to cope with this cost of living crises, as Labour this week outlined we would do, not peddling this offensive nonsense."" Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Olney called on the foreign secretary to apologise for her ""shameful"" comments, adding: ""Truss's mask has slipped"". ""How can Truss expect to win the support of the British public with views like this?,"" she added. The BBC approached Mr Sunak's team for comment on the matter but received no response.

"Infected blood victims get Â£100,000 compensation","Around 4,000 UK victims of the infected blood scandal are to receive interim compensation of Â£100,000 each, the government has announced. It will be given to those whose health is failing after developing blood-borne viruses like hepatitis and HIV, as well as partners of people who have died. It is the first time compensation will be paid after decades of campaigning. Families welcomed the news but said there were many people, such as bereaved parents, who would miss out. The payments will be made by the end of October in England. Those living in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive the money. It comes after the chair of the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, said there was a compelling case to make payments quickly - and victims were on borrowed time because of failing health. Currently, victims and families get financial support payments - and for some these will have run into tens of thousands of pounds. But this is the first time the government has agreed to a compensation payment for things such as loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. The government said the compensation would be tax-free and not affect the support payments these people are receiving. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""While nothing can make up for the pain and suffering endured by those affected by this tragic injustice, we are taking action to do right by victims and those who have lost their partners."" This could be just the first stage of compensation payments as the inquiry is looking into whether more payouts should be paid to a greater number of people. Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood The woman who lost two husbands to the scandal The secret in my blood The contaminated blood scandal has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Thousands of NHS patients with haemophilia and other blood disorders became seriously ill afterbeing given a new treatment called factor VIII or IX from the mid-1970s onwards. At the time the medication was imported from the US where it was made from the pooled blood plasma of thousands of paid donors, including some in high-risk groups, such as prisoners. If a single donor was infected with a blood-borne virus such as hepatitis or HIV then the whole batch of medication could be contaminated. An unknown number of UK patients were also exposed to hepatitis B or C through a blood transfusion after childbirth or hospital surgery. At least 2,400 people died after contracting HIV or hepatitis C through NHS treatments in the 1970s and 80s. Ros Cooper welcomed the judge's recommendation of compensation Ros Cooper was infected with hepatitis C as a child after being diagnosed with a bleeding disorder in 1975. She had no idea for the first 19 years of her life. ""It's affected everything - my physical health, my mental health. I was unable to continue working, I've been unable to have children because the treatment for hepatitis C rendered me infertile. It's affected my marriage, it's affected my parents and it's affected my brother and it still affects me now."" There is a possibility that the damage hepatitis has done to her liver could lead to her developing cancer in the future, she said. She added that she felt ""incredible guilt"" over the people who had not been included in the current payment package. ""There's an awful lot of people who haven't had their suffering recognised,"" she said. Gary Webster was diagnosed with HIV at 18 Gary Webster, who was diagnosed with HIV at 18 after being given blood products while at a school to treat haemophilia, said his whole life has been changed as a result of being given contaminated blood. ""It has affected relationships, my work and my finances. I had to give up work in 2012. I have struggled since. I still have a mortgage and I have debts,"" he said. ""This money will help with that, but it will not replace what I have lost. And I am one of the lucky ones. I am still here."" Over the years, the government has put in place a number of schemes offering victims financial support without any admission of liability but, unlike in the Republic of Ireland and some other countries, compensation has never been paid to individuals or families affected. In July public inquiry chairman Sir Brian said individuals who currently qualified for financial support, including some bereaved partners of those killed, should now be offered interim compensation of Â£100,000 each. Final recommendations on compensation for a wider group of people are expected when the inquiry concludes next year. Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s An independent study commissioned by the government,published last month,external, said victims should eventually be compensated for physical and social injury, the stigma of the disease, the impact on family and work life, and the cost of care. It recommended partners, children, siblings and parents of those who had been infected should be eligible for payments too. If the inquiry and the government accept those proposals completely then it is possible the final bill could be more than Â£1bn. The recipients of the interim compensation payments are people who are already registered for financial support payments, but campaigners have said there could be tens of thousands of others who have not yet come forward. Campaigner Sue Threakall, whose husband died in 1991 after contracting hepatitis B and HIV from contaminated blood, said she would continue to campaign for those left out of the compensation announcement. She said: ""This is not just about money - it's about recognition of people whose lives have been destroyed, young adults have grown up their whole life without their parents and they have not been recognised, and parents whose young children died in their arms. ""We still have a huge swathe of people whose lives were destroyed and who have not had anything, so we will continue to fight for them.""

Young watch far less TV than over-65s - Ofcom,"Young people now watch almost seven times less broadcast television than people aged over 65, according to a report from regulator Ofcom. It said 16 to 24-year-olds spend just 53 minutes watching TV each day, a two-thirds decrease in the past 10 years. Meanwhile, those aged 65 and over spend just under six hours on average watching TV daily. This ""generation gap"" in viewing habits is wider than ever before, according to Ofcom's annual Media Nations report. It attributed the gap to the use of television alternatives such as streaming services and short-form video. In its report, Ofcom said about one in five UK homes had access to all three of the biggest streaming services - Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime. It said 5.2 million homes now had access to all three, which would cost about Â£300 per year if they paid for them individually. However, it conceded that this figure included free trials and people who are sharing accounts between households. Ofcom also found that overall the number of homes subscribing to at least one streaming service had decreased by 350,000. It blamed the pressure on household budgets as a result of a rise in the cost of living. But it found - in a survey of people who cancelled their services - that three-quarters planned to renew their subscriptions when their circumstances changed. ""The streaming revolution is stretching the TV generation gap, creating a stark divide in the viewing habits of younger and older people,"" said Ofcom's director of market intelligence, Ian Macrae. ""Traditional broadcasters face tough competition from online streaming platforms, which they're partly meeting through the popularity of their own on-demand player apps, while broadcast television is still the place to go for big events that bring the nation together such as the Euro final or the Jubilee celebrations."" In 2021, Ofcom found screen time - the average amount of time people spend watching video content across all devices - hit a daily average of five hours and 40 minutes, nearly a third of an adult's waking hours. This decreased by 25 minutes in the latest figures which found, on average, people spent 59% of their screen time watching live or catch-up TV. Meanwhile, a third of adults in Great Britain watch short-form videos - or videos less than 10 minutes in length - with 65% of 18 to 24-year-olds watching them daily. This number is vastly increased for younger audiences, with 93% of 15 to 17-year-olds getting daily short-form videos from YouTube, 90% viewing on Instagram and 73% watching on TikTok. The report also looked into the type of short-form videos people are watching online and found ""how to"" content - such as recipes or DIY - was the most viewed. Some 59% said they engaged with short news videos online, 32% said they watched videos about video games and just over half of the adults surveyed said they watched videos posted online by friends and family.

Today's coverage was brought to you by George Wright, Marita Moloney, Jen Meierhans, James Fitzgerald, Rachel Russell, Nathan Williams and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. You can continue to follow the storyhere. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the latest UK rate of inflation figures shortly. Here's a reminder of what happened today:  When the Covid pandemic hit, many of us turned away from coins and notes to limit the spread of the virus. But as prices have risen, it seems people want to keep their spending under control by using cash instead of their bank cards or online payments. Post offices handled Â£801m in personal cash withdrawals in July, the most since records began five years ago. That's up more than 20% from a year earlier. Natalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, said it showed people are ""literally counting the pennies"" as they grapple with rising prices. ""It's absolutely because of the cost of living crisis,"" said Ceeney, who chaired the government's independent Access to Cash review. ""People will be taking out cash and physically putting it into pots, saying 'this is what I have for bills, this is what I have for food, and this is what's left'."" Nadhim Zahawi, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, says that there are ""no easy options"" for the government in the face of soaring inflation. On the day that inflation hit 10.1%, Zahawi tells the BBC that the high energy prices being experienced in the UK are down to ""Putin deliberately using energy as a tool to get back at us for the help that we are putting into Ukraine"". While the Bank of England's governor has also said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the largest contributor to UK inflation, economists say there are many contributing factors including supply chain issues and recruitment challenges. Meanwhile, Zahawi says that the Treasury is preparing ""all the options"" for the incoming prime minister on 5 September - but adds that he is also preparing plans for a further price cap increase in January. ""We leave no stone unturned; we are looking at every option to be ready for 5 September for additional support. ""My message is ... whether they are small businesses or families who are really struggling, really worried, is that we will be ready for more support as the new prime minister comes in. ""We are working night and day to make this work."" Labour MP Hilary Benn, who is also co-convener of the cross party UK Trade and Business Commission, has warned the government's Brexit deal may also be to blame for the increased prices. He urged the government to improve the terms of the Brexit deal to ""remove these artificial barriers to trade and allow for the easier movement of labour to and from the UK"". He said: âInflation is clearly a global problem but the UK is experiencing one of the highest rates of inflation among other comparable economies, almost twice as high as France and around four times that of Japan. âThe UK is the only G7 country dealing with the added pressures caused by the governmentâs Brexit deal, which has increased costs for businesses and contributed to labour shortages, in turn driving up prices for consumers even further."" Next month we will find out who will take over from Boris Johnson as prime minister. Right now Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are taking part in a hustings with Tory members in Belfast,which we are also covering live here. But what are their plans for dealing with the cost of living crisis? Liz Truss  Rishi Sunak If you're looking for ways to reduce the amount of energy you use while cooking in the kitchen, here are some tips we've put together from the Energy Saving Trust and energy companies: People are being urged not to turn off their fridges in order to save money on their fuel bills. Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says she has heard of households doing this to cut down on costs but warned it creates the risk of infection in food. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the health chief also said that people should try and keep the heating as energy prices rise this autumn, ""particularly those at the extreme ages of life"". ""I think one of the important things here is people recognise the importance of spending what will likely be for many people very limited resource on heating, because that is an essential part of their health,"" she said. The inflation rate of 10.1% announced today is higher than analysts expected and won't be the last cost of living increase we see this year. Earlier this month, theBank of Englandpredicted that Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation would hit 13.3% in October as energy bills soar. But the recent CPI figures have outstripped predictions. The Bank's forecast for July inflation was below what theOffice for National Statistics(ONS) measured across the month by 0.2 percentage points. James Smith, research director at independent think-tank the Resolution Foundation, adds that it will take ""many months, and much more living-standards pain, before inflation starts to ease"". Some analysts expect inflation to push higher into the winter, with Pwc economist Jake
Finney stating it will peak in January 2023 instead of October. While Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, says inflation will hit ""around 13% in October"" before it ""gradually eases"" from early next year, followed by a ""substantial"" decrease from autumn 2023. As the cost of living continues to rise, Citizens Advice is warning that one in four people in the UK wonât be able to pay their energy bills in October based on current forecasts. Of those who wonât be able to pay in October, 68% have a household income of less than Â£30,000. Some 3.2 million disabled people and 4.4 million families with children won't be able to afford autumnâs predicted rise in energy bills and will end up almost Â£100-a-month in the red,the charity adds,external. Citizens Advice says its advice takes into account the energy rebate and cost-of-living payments already being offered by the government, showing that increasing costs are outstripping support. It is calling for further interventions from government, as well as asking energy regulator Ofgem to ensure people are protected from the most serious consequences of falling into arrears. The organisation's CEO Dame Clare Moriarty says there is a risk of ""a winter of despair for millions"" if further support is not provided by government. Fiona TrottReporting from Newcastle More than 150 people have arrived at a building in Newcastle to get help and
advice about the cost of living. It's run by the West End Foodbank who are
having to buy food themselves, because donors tell them itâs now too expensive
to give away. Carole Rowland, the welfare manager, says: ""We see people in full-time
work with mortgages, who are broken. They canât cope. ""Everyone is just trying
to make their way in life. Government help is not touching the sides. We need a
review of Universal Credit so that people can keep up."" This foodbank is believed to be the biggest in the UK. It's receiving around 7
tonnes of food per month, but needs 20 tonnes because of increasing demand. Carole says: ""Before the pandemic, we had two foodbanks in Newcastle. We now have eight across the city and we run 11 sessions a week."" UK-wide inflation hit 10.1% in July but the poorest tenth of households faced an inflation rate of 10.9%, according to the Resolution Foundation. Meanwhile the richest tenth also saw their cost of living rise significantly, but only 9.4%. James Smith, research director at the foundation, said: ""Inflation has hit double digits earlier than expected off the back of the highest food price inflation in over two decades, and is set to continue climbing as energy bills soar this winter."" ""It will take many months, and much more living standards pain, before inflation starts to ease,"" Smith adds. ""So, the number one priority for the next prime minister will be to offer significant support to help millions of families through a brutal winter and beyond."" The price rises we experience depend
on what we spend our money on and some readers have been using our personal inflation calculator, built by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) to find out theirs. Vivgot a figure of 10.7% - ""pretty much what I expected, sadly,"" she says. ""Fuel bills accounted for 30%, though I have been using my car much less. The rises in household fuel costs in October will punish us severely... It's very worrying and the picture is grim."" Keithsays: ""I found my calculated inflation rate slightly less than I had expected."" ""I am an 83 year old slightly disabled man. I live alone and rely on care workers. ""About half of my income is index-linked, but past experience suggests that in practice this rarely compensates for real price increases. ""The rest of my income depends on investments, and I think it likely that I shall need to encroach more and more on the capital in order to maintain my present standard of living.""

The Bank of England thinks this could push the UK into arecession- when the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. Whether or not the Bank's October prediction proves true remains to be seen. Its forecast for July's inflation rate was 9.9%, 0.2 percentage points lower than where the ONS has now measured it. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the difference between the Bank's forecast and the measurement is mainly down to surging food prices. Meanwhile, theenergy pricecap will reach close to Â£3,640 in October, up from Â£1,971 at the moment, according to the most recent estimates by experts. Then energy prices are expected to rise even further. Energy consultancy Auxilione said that at today's prices the cap might rise to Â£4,722 in January before hitting Â£5,601 in April. Stefan JajecznykProducer, BBC Breakfast We've been chatting to business leaders at Birmingham's wholesale market about how record inflation is affecting them. Raj Kandola, head
of policy at Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, says companies are under pressure to raise their prices due to higher costs for fuel, energy and raw materials. ""The next few months are absolutely crucial, those margins are getting absolutely squeezed,"" he says. ""That's why we are calling on the government to act now and help alleviate these huge cost pressures firms are facing right now. ""Many small businesses incurred huge debts in the pandemic which they are struggling to repay and now the cost of living crisis is adding to that pressure right now. ""So whether it's financial support for those in energy intensive industries, potentially looking at a price cap for smaller firms or even removing VAT from energy bills as well, I think all of those measures would help in the short term."" Here's a recap on the latest developments in the cost of living crisis. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Todayâs inflation
figure is estimated to be the highest since early 1982. That's actually
about 20 years before we started using the current measure of price rises
for households - the Consumer Price Index. Thankfully, the
Office for National Statistics went back and worked outhow it might have looked in years gone by.,external And, using those
figures, you can see in this chart just how exceptional this current bout of
inflation really is. We've been talking about the rise in the rate of inflation - but what is it? Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Every month a figure is released, estimating how much prices are rising overall -the latest ONS data shows it has hit 10.1%. The Bank of England has warned that inflation could reach 13% and has predicted a recession by the end of the year. Stefan JajecznykProducer, BBC Breakfast In Birmingham's wholesale market, one trader tells us rising prices mean he can't plan from one week to the next and he does not feel there is any support. Leroy Howe, of Howe's Exports says: ""The price of fuel keeps going up so suppliers keep putting up the prices so what we find happening is that one week we'll be charged this price and the next week we'll be charged a higher price."" He says his biggest concern is the drop on footfall as customers cut back on spending. ""The amount of people that used to come through this market aren't coming through anymore so that is quite worrying,"" he says. He feels that traders like him are being ""left to our own devices"" and ""aren't getting any support from anywhere."" ""There's nobody trying to help us we are just trying to survive as trader in this market off our own back really,"" he says. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Despite
all the talk about the energy price cap being set to rise above Â£3,000, energy
costs havenât contributed that much directly to the latest hike in consumer
inflation. This
springâs price cap rise hit the figures in April and pushed inflation up to 9%. The
next price cap rise  - expected to take prices past Â£3,000 for the average
household - wonât be felt until after itâs announced at the end of the month. So
it's other things that have pushed inflation from those levels up into double
digits. In
the latest month, that's record increases in food and drink prices we've been
describing further down in the page. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Condemnation of poppies and flags on bonfire,"There has been widespread condemnation of the placement of poppy wreaths and flags on a bonfire in Londonderry. The bonfire at Meenan Square also displayed an image of a PSNI Land Rover and the Queen. The DUP called it an ""outrageous and offensive display of hate"". Sinn FÃ©in said it was ""disgraceful"". Police say they are treating it as a hate crime. They are also investigating reports of possible shots being fired in the Bogside area on Monday evening. Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said severalincidents of ""casual sectarianism""at the weekend showed Northern Ireland had not done enough to build reconciliation and integration. Sectarianism is an issue that needed to be solved across all society, the Bishop of Derry toldBBC Radio Ulsteron Tuesday. ""We sit on a whole iceberg of sectarianism here that actually benefits power struggles that are going on,"" Donal McKeown said. ""Unless everyone looks at the sectarianism in their own hearts, we could end up condemning a small number and saying that it is all their fault. ""It's the responsibility of all of us to build a shared future."" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney is among the politicians to have condemned the material on the bonfire Bonfires on 15 August are traditional in some nationalist parts of Northern Ireland to mark the Catholic Feast of the Assumption. To others, they are lit to commemorate the introduction of internment without trial of republican suspects, which was introduced by the government in 1971. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the actions of a minority in Derry were ""an insult"" to all the hard work of volunteers, community workers and youth organisations in the area. ""Whether in July or August, this kind of hatred is so far from the future we should be trying to build,"" Mr Coveney said in a tweet. SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said the burning of posters and flags on the bonfire in the Bogside was ""totally out of order"". ""If you think the route to a united Ireland is burning your neighbour's cultural symbols we're not on the same side,"" he tweeted. ""If you actually want to achieve something get your head in gear and learn that we have to share this place. There is no other way."" Allow Twitter content?

DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson called it an ""outrageous and offensive display of hate"" which must be ""universally rejected"". Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly called it ""disgraceful"" and ""deeply offensive"". ""There is no place for these displays of hate anywhere in our society. It must stop now,"" he said. ""Displays of hate on bonfires are totally wrong and those responsible do not represent the people of Derry,"" the mayor for Derry City and Strabane District Council has said. Sinn FÃ©in's Sandra Duffy said the ""real image"" of Derry was on show when thousands flocked to the city for theFoyle Maritime Festivaland theFoyle Cuplast month. DUP assembly member for Foyle Gary Middleton said the placement of wreaths was ""disgraceful and utterly insulting to those who had fought and died for all of our freedoms"". ""As a society we need to move away from blatant and intentional acts of disrespect and hurt,"" he added. The bonfire also features an image of the Queen The police say they are treating reports of material placed on the bonfire as a hate crime and are seeking to identify those responsible. ""The vast majority of people celebrate their culture peacefully and lawfully,"" Supt Willy Calderwood said. He added that they do not want cultural celebrations ""to be undermined by anti-social behaviour, criminal activity or hate directed towards others."" SDLP councillor John Boyle said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that the bonfire incident occurred just days after the sale of UVF and Parachute Regiment flags in Derry. Thirteen people were shot dead in Derry in 1972 when members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators - that day became known as Bloody Sunday. Mr Boyle said he understand the flag issue would have hurt people, ""reacting in kind serves nobody"". ""People who wish to celebrate and commemorate elements of their culture and traditions should always aim to do so in a non-confrontational way without seeking to offend or upset anyone else,"" he said. Alliance councillor Rachael Ferguson said it was ""sad to see"" the bonfire had once more ""attracted disappointing, sectarian displays"". ""I utterly condemn the placing of these items on this bonfire,"" she said. ""It also marks the latest in an incredibly horrendous few days of hatred and bigotry, including the selling of Parachute Regiment flags in this city.""

"Health officials plan to use dual Covid vaccineThe jab, approved for use in the UK, can protect against both the original virus and Omicron variant.Northern Ireland","UK health officials say people should take whichever booster they are offered A new coronavirus vaccine aimed at protecting people against both the original Covid-19 virus and the Omicron variant should be available in Northern Ireland by autumn. Stormont's Department of Health has said it is intended to be used as part of its autumn booster programme. On Monday,the UK became the first country in the world to approve the jabfor adult patients. It is known as a bivalent vaccine as it tackles two strains of Covid. However, UK health officials say people should take whichever booster they are offered as all jabs provide protection. Across the UK, 26 million people are eligible for some form of booster, but Moderna, which is manufacturing the vaccine, thinks only about half that amount of doses will be available this year. Last month, it was announced that everyone aged 50 and over will be offered a Covid booster vaccine this autumn. Booster jabs will also be offered to: health and social care staff pregnant women carers who are over the age of 16 people over five whose health puts them at greater risk, people over five who share a house with somebody with a weakened immune system Approval for the dual vaccine in the UK was granted by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency on Monday. In a statement to BBC News NI, a Stormont spokesman said: ""It is intended that the bivalent vaccine will be used in Northern Ireland as part of the autumn Covid-19 booster programme. ""The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will advise on how this vaccine should be offered as part of the deployment programme.

Liz Truss said UK workers need 'more graft'The Tory leadership hopeful is accused by critics of branding workers lazy in leaked audio.UK Politics,"Liz Truss said the UK needs ""more productivity"" to boost economic growth Conservative leadership candidate Liz Truss said British workers needed ""more graft"" in leaked comments. In the recording, published bythe Guardian,external, Ms Truss suggested Britons lacked the ""skill and application"" of foreign nationals. Labour said her comments were ""offensive"" and ""effectively brand British workers as lazy"". The foreign secretary did not deny making the comments and said productivity needed to improve. ""I don't know what you're quoting there,"" Ms Truss said under questioning at a Tory leadership event on Tuesday evening. ""But the point that I've always made is what we need in this country is more productivity across the country and we need more economic growth."" The leak emerged ahead of a hustings event in Perthwhere Ms Truss and her leadership rival former Chancellor Rishi Sunak were grilled by Scottish Conservative members. The party's roughly 200,000-strong membership are voting for their next leader, who will succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister in September. Truss and Sunak reject indyref2 in Scotland event Truss and Sunak policy guide How will the new party leader and PM be chosen? The Guardian report said,externalMs Truss made the comments in the audio when she was chief secretary to the Treasury, a role she held between 2017 and 2019. The report did not reveal the source of the audio recording, parts of which were redacted. In the two-minute clip, Ms Truss said British workers' ""mindset and attitude"" were partly to blame for them producing less per hour than their foreign counterparts, suggesting they needed ""more graft"". Ms Truss said in the recording: ""Essentially it's partly a mindset and attitude thing I think. Yeah, its working culture basically. If you go to China it's quite different, I can assure you... ""There's a fundamental issue of British working culture. Essentially if we're going to be a richer country and a more prosperous country, that needs to change. ""But I don't think people are that keen to change that."" Speaking on difference in productivity in the UK, she said: ""If you look at productivity, it's very, very different in London from the rest of the country."" A Truss campaign source said the comments were ""half a decade old"" and lacked ""context"", while acknowledging the UK does ""need to boost productivity"". ""As prime minister, Liz will deliver an economy that is high wage, high growth and low tax,"" the source said. The Office for National Statistics says,externalevery country has seen slower growth in output per worker since 2009 when compared with the pre-financial crisis period. OECD figures show,externalthat in 2019, the UK came fourth highest in the rankings of GDP per hour worked among G7 countries. Ms Truss, who has consistently led Mr Sunak in polls, has put her tax-cutting plan for boosting economic growth at the centre of her pitch to Conservative members. This video can not be played Watch: Liz Truss quizzed on 'no handouts' cost of living policy The remarks by Ms Truss echo controversial arguments made in a 2012 book she co-authored, ""Britannia Unchained"", in which British workers were described as among the ""worst idlers in the world"". Asked about it at a leadership debate last month, Ms Truss distanced herself from the contentious assessment, claiming co-author and Sunak supporter Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, had written it. Mr Raab has subsequently said the authors of the book, which also included several other senior Conservative ministers, had agreed ""collective responsibility"" over its contents. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the ""Britannia Unchained fiasco"" seemed to be ""the blueprint"" for Ms Truss's prospective government. ""Workers across the country are working all hours to keep a roof over their heads, put food on the table and provide for their families,"" he said. ""Liz Truss should be helping working people to cope with this cost of living crises, as Labour this week outlined we would do, not peddling this offensive nonsense."" Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Olney called on the foreign secretary to apologise for her ""shameful"" comments, adding: ""Truss's mask has slipped"".

Why inflation may feel even worse than it is,"The cost of living is more than 11% higher than it was a year ago, the official figures say. But you may feel your bills have risen by a lot more. That's because your own personal inflation rate is driven by factors specific to you: if you're someone who buys a lot of petrol, your weekly outgoings will have gone up a lot more than someone who cycles everywhere, for example. Here are some ways that your individual experience of price rises may be at odds with what's reported in the news. Inflation is measured by taking a typical ""basket"" of goods and services and seeing how much they're going up in price. The contents of that basket changes each year as habits change. Pet collars, sports bras or canned pulses on your shopping list? The Official for National Statistics (ONS), which is responsible for calculating inflation statistics, says you're on trend for 2022. Note: in the calculator, the ONS compares your personal inflation rate with CPIH, a measure of inflation that includes housing costs for those who own their home. Recently this has been slightly lower than the more widely-reported measure, called CPI, and in October 2022 it was 9.6%. If you can't see the calculator, click here. In the age of hybrid work however, suits are out, and blazers, for the more sporadic trip to the office, are in instead. Individual bakery doughnuts are also out, because people working from home are more likely to plump for multipacks instead apparently. Not everything you buy is reflected in the official inflation numbers; the more niche, the less likely it is to be monitored. And the things you're buying may go up in price by more than what's in the basket, or if you're lucky by less. It's not just what's in the ONS's basket that's re-evaluated at the start of every year - but how big a part that item plays in our day to day spending. Every item has a ""weight"" attached, so the changing price of petrol will have a much bigger impact than if the cost of tea goes up - simply because we spend a much bigger proportion of our income on petrol. Sometimes that means there's a bit of a lag. For example, at present, the ONS assumes that household energy bills make up about 3.5% of spending, which was accurate at the start of 2022. But with energy bills poised to at least double, they're ultimately going to take up 7% or more of a typical household budget. That means the official rate of inflation may not be fully reflecting the impact of rising energy bills until next year. This video can not be played Watch: Cost of living: ""A lot of people have nowhere to turn"" Inflation has been driven largely by higher energy costs over the last year - but bills vary widely from household to household. For the 86% of UK homes that are mainly heated by gas, bills have risen more sharply, than where heating is from oil or electricity. Fuel efficiency makes a big difference too. Homes are rated on energy performance, from A to G, with A being the most efficient. Average fuel costsâ¯forâ¯a homeâ¯in Englandâ¯with aâ¯D ratingâ¯are a fifth higher than for those with an A-C rating. Those with a G rating may pay three times as much; those lofty but draughty period homes come with an invisible extra price tag. Between 2014 and 2021, the ONS reckons inflation was pretty much the same for people in all income groups. But that's changed this year, because the main items that are rising in price are staples: food as well as energy. That has a bigger impact on those with the lowest incomes. The ONS reckons energy, food, and drink accounts for around 15% of lower-income households' spending, compared to 10% for high-income groups. It means that it reckons inflation in October was 12.5% for the poorest 10% of households versus 9.6% for the richest 10% - the biggest gap since 2009. Even if that draughty mansion is expensive to heat, that might not represent as big a problem to the owner as a person on a low income in a small flat. Older, larger homes will cost more to heat, but the occupants may also be able to better afford the rising bills But it could have been even worse without the government's Energy Bill Support package. Before it was unveiled, the Institute for Fiscal Studies had predicted  least well off households could have faced an 18% inflation rate in October, while the richest 20% could have seen a rate of 11%. Older, larger homes will cost more to heat, but the occupants may also be able to better afford the rising bills Even if prices are rising for everyone, the pain felt varies. And the only way to maintain living standards is to have more money coming in. The average pay packet is failing to match the rising cost of living; the gap between the two is the biggest for at least two decades. The private sector - in particular hospitality, where staff shortages have been acute, and financial services - have typically seen bigger pay rises than the public sector. Those relying on the state pension or Universal Credit may see those rates go up by 10% - but they'll have to wait for next spring. So if you feel your money goes far less far than a year ago you're far from alone. Why are prices rising in the UK? What is a recession and how could one affect me?

"Breaking|Breaking newsThames Water hosepipe ban to start next weekThames Water, which has 15 million customers across the south of England, says hosepipe ban will start on 24 AugustEngland","Thames Water CEO Sarah Bentley said implementing the ban had been a ""difficult decision"" Thames Water has announced a hosepipe ban for 10 million customers across the south of England. The ban will come into force from 24 August and will impact people across the Thames Valley and London. The temporary use ban comes after reports of the River Thames reaching its lowest level since 2005 and ""unprecedented weather conditions"". It means people will not be able to use hosepipes to water gardens, wash cars and windows, or fill paddling pools. Those found to breach the rulescould be fined up to Â£1,000.,external Thames Water CEO Sarah Bentley said implementing the ban had been a ""very difficult decision"" but, she added, reservoir storage levels in London and Farmoor, in Oxfordshire had ""reduced significantly"". The ban is the next phase in the water firm's drought plan, having already announced it was currently fixing 1,100 leaks across its 20,000-mile network every week. Ms Bentley added: ""After months of below average rainfall and the recent extreme temperatures in July and August, water resources in our region are depleted. ""Customer demand is at unprecedented levels and we now have to move into the next phase of our drought plan to conserve water, mitigate further risk and futureproof supplies."" Thames Water admits it must do better as ban looms London officially declared in drought Driest first half of year in England since 1976 Thames Water, which also has five million wastewater customers, is thelatest water provider to announce a hosepipe banas droughts have been declared across England. The firm previously admitted it ""must do better"" after coming under fire for having the worst record on leaks out of all nine water companies in the UK. More than 600 million litres of water is currently lost a week by the company, mainly due to ageing pipes. A council leaderhas said Thames Water should stop paying its bosses bonusesand use that money to fix leaks instead of ""rewarding themselves"". Clive Jones, from Wokingham Borough Council, shared analysis by his Liberal Democrat party which found executives were awarded an ""eyewatering"" Â£2.4m in 2021. Hosepipe bans come aftertemperatures topped 40C in the UK for the first time on record this summer. The recent heatwave resulted in the highest demand for water in the past 25 years, according to Thames Water. Dr Gina Brown told the BBC water supply problems in her village had been ""recurrent"" The company said it supplied 2.9 billion litres of water a day to customers across the region as temperatures spiked. In areas with particularly hot weather, the firm said demand rose by 50% compared to the average for the time of year. Taps in the Oxfordshire village of Northend ran dry in a heatwave last week and Thames Water had to deliver emergency supplies to 68 customers. Resident Dr Gina Brown, a radiologist who lives in the village with her elderly parents,p told the BBC water shortages were a ""recurrent"" problemduring hot weather. It was later found the issue was down toE.coli being found in a reservoir which supplies the village. Thames Water apologised for the disruption and said the site had been disinfected.

Truss critics condemn 'lazy' UK workers remarks,"Liz Truss said the UK needs ""more productivity"" to boost economic growth Conservative leadership candidate Liz Truss said British workers needed ""more graft"" in leaked comments. In the recording, published bythe Guardian,external, Ms Truss suggested Britons lacked the ""skill and application"" of foreign nationals. Labour said her comments were ""offensive"" and ""effectively brand British workers as lazy"". The foreign secretary did not deny making the comments and said productivity needed to improve. ""I don't know what you're quoting there,"" Ms Truss said under questioning at a Tory leadership event on Tuesday evening. ""But the point that I've always made is what we need in this country is more productivity across the country and we need more economic growth."" The leak emerged ahead of a hustings event in Perthwhere Ms Truss and her leadership rival former Chancellor Rishi Sunak were grilled by Scottish Conservative members. The party's roughly 200,000-strong membership are voting for their next leader, who will succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister in September.

The Guardian report said,externalMs Truss made the comments in the audio when she was chief secretary to the Treasury, a role she held between 2017 and 2019. The report did not reveal the source of the audio recording, parts of which were redacted. In the two-minute clip, Ms Truss said British workers' ""mindset and attitude"" were partly to blame for them producing less per hour than their foreign counterparts, suggesting they needed ""more graft"". Ms Truss said in the recording: ""Essentially it's partly a mindset and attitude thing I think. Yeah, its working culture basically. If you go to China it's quite different, I can assure you... ""There's a fundamental issue of British working culture. Essentially if we're going to be a richer country and a more prosperous country, that needs to change. ""But I don't think people are that keen to change that."" Speaking on difference in productivity in the UK, she said: ""If you look at productivity, it's very, very different in London from the rest of the country."" A Truss campaign source said the comments were ""half a decade old"" and lacked ""context"", while acknowledging the UK does ""need to boost productivity"". ""As prime minister, Liz will deliver an economy that is high wage, high growth and low tax,"" the source said.

Asked about it at a leadership debate last month, Ms Truss distanced herself from the contentious assessment, claiming co-author and Sunak supporter Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, had written it. Mr Raab has subsequently said the authors of the book, which also included several other senior Conservative ministers, had agreed ""collective responsibility"" over its contents. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the ""Britannia Unchained fiasco"" seemed to be ""the blueprint"" for Ms Truss's prospective government.

What is the contaminated blood scandal?,"The government has confirmed it has set aside Â£11.8bn to compensate victims of the infected blood scandal. More than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. A public inquiry described the scale of the scandal as ""horrifying"", and accused doctors, the government and NHS of repeatedly failing patients. Two main groups of NHS patients were affected by what has been called the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Firstly, haemophiliacs - and those with similar disorders -who have a rare genetic condition which means their blood does not clot properly.,external People with haemophilia A have a shortage of a clotting agent called Factor VIII, while people with haemophilia B do not have enough Factor IX. In the 1970s, a new treatment using donated human blood plasma was developed to replace these clotting agents. But whole batches were contaminated with deadly viruses. After being given the infected treatments, about 1,250 people in the UK with bleeding disorders developed both HIV and hepatitis C,including 380 children. This video can not be played Colin Smith, who died aged seven, was one of 380 children now thought to have been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products. About two-thirds later died of Aids-related illnesses. Some unintentionally gave HIV to their partners. Another 2,400 to 5,000 people developed hepatitis C on its own, which can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is difficult to know the exact number of people infected with hepatitis C, partly because it can take decades for symptoms to appear. A second group of patients were given contaminated blood transfusions after childbirth, surgery or other medical treatment between 1970 and 1991. The inquiry estimates between 80 and 100 of these people were infected with HIV, and about 27,000 with hepatitis C. In total, it is thought about 2,900 people have died. The victims, families and what happened I lost mum, dad and sister to HIV in blood scandal The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandal Announcing its findings in May 2024,the inquiry said victims had been failed ""not once, but repeatedly"",and that the risk of viral infections in blood products had been known since 1948. Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff said there had been a lack of openness from the authorities and elements of ""downright deception"", including the destruction of documents. He said half-truths were also told, so people did not know about the risk of their treatment, the availability of alternatives, or even whether they were infected. ""This disaster was not an accident,"" said Sir Brian. ""The infections happened because those in authority - doctors, the blood services and successive governments - did not put patient safety first."" The report said,external: too little was done to stop importing blood products from abroad, which used blood from high-risk donors such as prisoners and drug addicts in the UK, blood donations were accepted from high-risk groups such as prisoners until 1986 blood products were not heat-treated to eliminate HIV until the end of 1985, although the risks were known in 1982 there was too little testing to reduce the risk of hepatitis, from the 1970s onwards Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the Â£11.8bn total compensation figure during the Budget on 30 October. The government had previously said that thefirst compensation payments would be made to victimsbefore the end of 2024. Family members and loved ones of those infected will also be entitled to compensation from 2025. Payments will be exempt from tax, and will not affect benefits. The final amounts for individuals are being assessed against five criteria: harm caused, social impact from stigma and isolation, impact on autonomy and private life, care costs and financial loss. Outlining the compensation scheme after the inquiry reported in May 2024, the then-Conservative governmentsuggested how much people might receive,external: a person infected with HIV could expect to get compensation of between Â£2.2m and Â£2.6m those with a chronic hepatitis C infection, defined as lasting more than six months, could expect to receive between Â£665,000 and Â£810,000 the partner of someone infected with HIV who is still alive today could expect to receive about Â£110,000, while a child could get Â£55,000 Annual payments will be available for relatives who had been financially dependent on the loved one who died. In cases wherepeople who would be entitled to compensation have themselves died,the money will go to their estate. In late 2022, followingadvice from the inquiry,the Conservative government made interim payments of Â£100,000 each to about 4,000 surviving victims and bereaved partners. In June 2024, a second interim payment of Â£210,000 was paid to those infected. In October 2024 the government said more relatives of those who died could also apply for Â£100,000 interim payments if the money had not already been claimed. In the 1970s, the UK was struggling to meet the demand for blood-clotting treatments, so imported supplies from the US. But much of the blood was bought from high-risk donors such as prison inmates and drug-users. Factor VIII was made by pooling plasma from tens of thousands of donors. If just one was carrying a virus, the entire batch could be contaminated. UK blood donations were not routinely screened for hepatitis C until 1991, 18 months after the virus was first identified. Jackie Britton, from Portsmouth, was infected with hepatitis C through a transfusion after the birth of her daughter in 1983 By the mid-1970s, there were repeated warnings that imported US Factor VIII carried a greater risk of infection. However, attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies. Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk. BBC News has also uncovered evidencechildren were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments- often, without their family's consent. As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no ""conclusive proof"" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a linerobustly defended by former health minister Ken Clarkewhen he appeared before the inquiry. This video can not be played Carolyn Challis: ""I got through two life-threatening rounds of cancer only to be given another life-threatening illness"" Many other countries were affected, although some - including Finland - used older treatments until much later rather than switch to Factor VIII,which minimised HIV infections.,external Delivering the findings of the inquiry, Sir Brian criticised UK government claims in the 1990s that screening for hepatitis C began as soon as the technology was available. He said that 23 other countries - including Japan, Finland and Spain - introduced the screening before the UK. In the US, companies that supplied infected products have paid out millions in out-of-court settlements. Politicians and drug companies have been convicted of negligence in countries including France and Japan. In his evidence to the inquiry, former health secretary Andy Burnham suggested there maybe grounds for charges of corporate manslaughter,externalin the UK.

The school where dozens died,"Ade Goodyear was among the pupils at Treloar's College treated with contaminated blood A public inquiry has begun hearing from former students after more than 120 pupils at a school for disabled children were caught up in what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. From 1974 to 1987, those children were offered treatment for haemophilia at Treloar's College. At least 72 died after being given a drug contaminated with HIV and viral hepatitis. ""We've lost so many friends from Treloar's and it's absolutely heartbreaking,"" Richard Warwick, a pupil at the Hampshire school in the late 1970s who was later diagnosed with HIV, told the BBC ahead of the hearing. The inquiry into the use of infected blood began taking evidence from people connected to the school on Monday. Former headmaster, Alec Macpherson, is one of those due to answer questions. ""It caused those boys a lot of anxiety and a lot of upset,"" he told the BBC. ""It put a rage inside them - why me, why has this happened to me, why have I got this dreadful disease?"" Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood The secret in my blood Liz Hooper: The woman who lost two husbands to the scandal Lord Mayor's Treloar's College was a boarding school for physically disabled children with a specialist NHS haemophilia centre on site, run by a dedicated medical team. Treloar's College By the mid 1970s, a new treatment for haemophilia, known as factor VIII/IX, became available for the first time. It meant those with a serious form of the blood disorder could live a normal life without the risk of a bleed. The NHS was not self-sufficient in the blood plasma used to make the drug so it was imported from overseas, most notably the US. Batches were widely contaminated with hepatitis A, B, C and later HIV, infecting thousands of haemophiliacs across the UK. Ade Goodyear joined Treloar's in 1980 at the age of 10. He described life as ""wonderful"" with supportive teachers, nurses and good friends. Like dozens of other boys at the school, he was given factor VIII to help control his bleeding. Ade Goodyear received treatment for haemophilia, along with his two older brothers ""With one of my very first shots, I got hepatitis and was placed in isolation for two weeks,"" he said. In 1985 he was taken into a small office with a group of boys to be told he had tested positive for HIV - then a newly discovered virus with no known treatment and a short life expectancy. ""The doctor was upset and pointed at us and said, you have it, and you haven't. And I was back in science by 1.50pm. I didn't even get the afternoon off,"" he said. ""A friend of mine picked up a pot plant and threw it against the wall of the haemophilia centre. It was a beautiful summer's day and I remember thinking, how many more sunrises like this am I going to see?"" Ade's two older brothers died after treatment with factor VIII - Jason from Aids in 1997 and Gary from health problems linked to hepatitis C in 2015. For pupils like Ade and Richard it meant living with the stigma of what was then a little-known disease. Students were followed by newspaper reporters outside the school gates and shouted questions about their HIV status. Just 32 of the 122 haemophiliacs who attended the school from 1974 to 1987 are still alive today. Most died after contracting HIV or viral hepatitis. It's hoped the public inquiry will be able to answer questions about what happened at Treloar's and the NHS haemophiliac centre run from the site. Ex-pupils Stephen Nicholls and Richard Warwick wear ties with the colours they use to support those who died - red for HIV, yellow for hepatitis, black for death Families want to know why they were not told about the potential risks of Factor VIII earlier and why it took many years until the drug was heat treated to kill viruses and other contaminants. ""What happened at the school comes back to haunt us every day,"" said Stephen Nicholls, a former pupil who was infected with hepatitis C after his treatment. ""We will never forget the Treloar's story and those memories of what happened here."" It is a rare genetic condition in which the blood does not clot properly. It mostly affects men. People with the condition produce lower amounts of the essential blood-clotting protein known as factor VIII and IX. Former students are giving evidence this week, some anonymously, along with the parents of children who lost their lives. The haemophilia centre on the site was run by NHS doctors and nurses and not staff directly employed by the school, which still cares for physically disabled children today. ""Although no-one has at any point suggested that Treloar's was at fault, it is a tragic part of our past,"" the school said in a statement. ""It was, and still is, a very difficult time for our affected alumni, their families and staff who were here at the point. ""We are completely supportive of the campaign for truth, answers and justice by our former pupils."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Today's coverage was brought to you by George Wright, Marita Moloney, Jen Meierhans, James Fitzgerald, Rachel Russell, Nathan Williams and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. You can continue to follow the storyhere. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the latest UK rate of inflation figures shortly. Here's a reminder of what happened today:  When the Covid pandemic hit, many of us turned away from coins and notes to limit the spread of the virus. But as prices have risen, it seems people want to keep their spending under control by using cash instead of their bank cards or online payments. Post offices handled Â£801m in personal cash withdrawals in July, the most since records began five years ago. That's up more than 20% from a year earlier. Natalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, said it showed people are ""literally counting the pennies"" as they grapple with rising prices. ""It's absolutely because of the cost of living crisis,"" said Ceeney, who chaired the government's independent Access to Cash review. ""People will be taking out cash and physically putting it into pots, saying 'this is what I have for bills, this is what I have for food, and this is what's left'."" Nadhim Zahawi, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, says that there are ""no easy options"" for the government in the face of soaring inflation. On the day that inflation hit 10.1%, Zahawi tells the BBC that the high energy prices being experienced in the UK are down to ""Putin deliberately using energy as a tool to get back at us for the help that we are putting into Ukraine"". While the Bank of England's governor has also said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the largest contributor to UK inflation, economists say there are many contributing factors including supply chain issues and recruitment challenges. Meanwhile, Zahawi says that the Treasury is preparing ""all the options"" for the incoming prime minister on 5 September - but adds that he is also preparing plans for a further price cap increase in January. ""We leave no stone unturned; we are looking at every option to be ready for 5 September for additional support. ""My message is ... whether they are small businesses or families who are really struggling, really worried, is that we will be ready for more support as the new prime minister comes in. ""We are working night and day to make this work."" Labour MP Hilary Benn, who is also co-convener of the cross party UK Trade and Business Commission, has warned the government's Brexit deal may also be to blame for the increased prices. He urged the government to improve the terms of the Brexit deal to ""remove these artificial barriers to trade and allow for the easier movement of labour to and from the UK"". He said: âInflation is clearly a global problem but the UK is experiencing one of the highest rates of inflation among other comparable economies, almost twice as high as France and around four times that of Japan. âThe UK is the only G7 country dealing with the added pressures caused by the governmentâs Brexit deal, which has increased costs for businesses and contributed to labour shortages, in turn driving up prices for consumers even further."" Next month we will find out who will take over from Boris Johnson as prime minister. Right now Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are taking part in a hustings with Tory members in Belfast,which we are also covering live here. But what are their plans for dealing with the cost of living crisis? Liz Truss  Rishi Sunak If you're looking for ways to reduce the amount of energy you use while cooking in the kitchen, here are some tips we've put together from the Energy Saving Trust and energy companies: People are being urged not to turn off their fridges in order to save money on their fuel bills. Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says she has heard of households doing this to cut down on costs but warned it creates the risk of infection in food. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the health chief also said that people should try and keep the heating as energy prices rise this autumn, ""particularly those at the extreme ages of life"". ""I think one of the important things here is people recognise the importance of spending what will likely be for many people very limited resource on heating, because that is an essential part of their health,"" she said. The inflation rate of 10.1% announced today is higher than analysts expected and won't be the last cost of living increase we see this year. Earlier this month, theBank of Englandpredicted that Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation would hit 13.3% in October as energy bills soar. But the recent CPI figures have outstripped predictions. The Bank's forecast for July inflation was below what theOffice for National Statistics(ONS) measured across the month by 0.2 percentage points. James Smith, research director at independent think-tank the Resolution Foundation, adds that it will take ""many months, and much more living-standards pain, before inflation starts to ease"". Some analysts expect inflation to push higher into the winter, with Pwc economist Jake
Finney stating it will peak in January 2023 instead of October. While Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, says inflation will hit ""around 13% in October"" before it ""gradually eases"" from early next year, followed by a ""substantial"" decrease from autumn 2023. As the cost of living continues to rise, Citizens Advice is warning that one in four people in the UK wonât be able to pay their energy bills in October based on current forecasts. Of those who wonât be able to pay in October, 68% have a household income of less than Â£30,000. Some 3.2 million disabled people and 4.4 million families with children won't be able to afford autumnâs predicted rise in energy bills and will end up almost Â£100-a-month in the red,the charity adds,external. Citizens Advice says its advice takes into account the energy rebate and cost-of-living payments already being offered by the government, showing that increasing costs are outstripping support. It is calling for further interventions from government, as well as asking energy regulator Ofgem to ensure people are protected from the most serious consequences of falling into arrears. The organisation's CEO Dame Clare Moriarty says there is a risk of ""a winter of despair for millions"" if further support is not provided by government. Fiona TrottReporting from Newcastle More than 150 people have arrived at a building in Newcastle to get help and
advice about the cost of living. It's run by the West End Foodbank who are
having to buy food themselves, because donors tell them itâs now too expensive
to give away. Carole Rowland, the welfare manager, says: ""We see people in full-time
work with mortgages, who are broken. They canât cope. ""Everyone is just trying
to make their way in life. Government help is not touching the sides. We need a
review of Universal Credit so that people can keep up."" This foodbank is believed to be the biggest in the UK. It's receiving around 7
tonnes of food per month, but needs 20 tonnes because of increasing demand. Carole says: ""Before the pandemic, we had two foodbanks in Newcastle. We now have eight across the city and we run 11 sessions a week."" UK-wide inflation hit 10.1% in July but the poorest tenth of households faced an inflation rate of 10.9%, according to the Resolution Foundation. Meanwhile the richest tenth also saw their cost of living rise significantly, but only 9.4%. James Smith, research director at the foundation, said: ""Inflation has hit double digits earlier than expected off the back of the highest food price inflation in over two decades, and is set to continue climbing as energy bills soar this winter."" ""It will take many months, and much more living standards pain, before inflation starts to ease,"" Smith adds. ""So, the number one priority for the next prime minister will be to offer significant support to help millions of families through a brutal winter and beyond."" The price rises we experience depend
on what we spend our money on and some readers have been using our personal inflation calculator, built by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) to find out theirs. Vivgot a figure of 10.7% - ""pretty much what I expected, sadly,"" she says. ""Fuel bills accounted for 30%, though I have been using my car much less. The rises in household fuel costs in October will punish us severely... It's very worrying and the picture is grim."" Keithsays: ""I found my calculated inflation rate slightly less than I had expected."" ""I am an 83 year old slightly disabled man. I live alone and rely on care workers. ""About half of my income is index-linked, but past experience suggests that in practice this rarely compensates for real price increases. ""The rest of my income depends on investments, and I think it likely that I shall need to encroach more and more on the capital in order to maintain my present standard of living.""

The Bank of England thinks this could push the UK into arecession- when the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. Whether or not the Bank's October prediction proves true remains to be seen. Its forecast for July's inflation rate was 9.9%, 0.2 percentage points lower than where the ONS has now measured it. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the difference between the Bank's forecast and the measurement is mainly down to surging food prices. Meanwhile, theenergy pricecap will reach close to Â£3,640 in October, up from Â£1,971 at the moment, according to the most recent estimates by experts. Then energy prices are expected to rise even further. Energy consultancy Auxilione said that at today's prices the cap might rise to Â£4,722 in January before hitting Â£5,601 in April. Stefan JajecznykProducer, BBC Breakfast We've been chatting to business leaders at Birmingham's wholesale market about how record inflation is affecting them. Raj Kandola, head
of policy at Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, says companies are under pressure to raise their prices due to higher costs for fuel, energy and raw materials. ""The next few months are absolutely crucial, those margins are getting absolutely squeezed,"" he says. ""That's why we are calling on the government to act now and help alleviate these huge cost pressures firms are facing right now. ""Many small businesses incurred huge debts in the pandemic which they are struggling to repay and now the cost of living crisis is adding to that pressure right now. ""So whether it's financial support for those in energy intensive industries, potentially looking at a price cap for smaller firms or even removing VAT from energy bills as well, I think all of those measures would help in the short term."" Here's a recap on the latest developments in the cost of living crisis. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Todayâs inflation
figure is estimated to be the highest since early 1982. That's actually
about 20 years before we started using the current measure of price rises
for households - the Consumer Price Index. Thankfully, the
Office for National Statistics went back and worked outhow it might have looked in years gone by.,external And, using those
figures, you can see in this chart just how exceptional this current bout of
inflation really is. We've been talking about the rise in the rate of inflation - but what is it? Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Every month a figure is released, estimating how much prices are rising overall -the latest ONS data shows it has hit 10.1%. The Bank of England has warned that inflation could reach 13% and has predicted a recession by the end of the year. Stefan JajecznykProducer, BBC Breakfast In Birmingham's wholesale market, one trader tells us rising prices mean he can't plan from one week to the next and he does not feel there is any support. Leroy Howe, of Howe's Exports says: ""The price of fuel keeps going up so suppliers keep putting up the prices so what we find happening is that one week we'll be charged this price and the next week we'll be charged a higher price."" He says his biggest concern is the drop on footfall as customers cut back on spending. ""The amount of people that used to come through this market aren't coming through anymore so that is quite worrying,"" he says. He feels that traders like him are being ""left to our own devices"" and ""aren't getting any support from anywhere."" ""There's nobody trying to help us we are just trying to survive as trader in this market off our own back really,"" he says. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Despite
all the talk about the energy price cap being set to rise above Â£3,000, energy
costs havenât contributed that much directly to the latest hike in consumer
inflation. This
springâs price cap rise hit the figures in April and pushed inflation up to 9%. The
next price cap rise  - expected to take prices past Â£3,000 for the average
household - wonât be felt until after itâs announced at the end of the month. So
it's other things that have pushed inflation from those levels up into double
digits. In
the latest month, that's record increases in food and drink prices we've been
describing further down in the page. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

LiveLiveCost of living: Latest inflation figure due as prices rocket2 minutes ago2 minutes ago Welcome to our live coverageWelcome to our live coverageLive Cost of living: Latest inflation figure due as prices rocket  2 minutes ago,"The UK inflation rate has hit double digits - 10.1% - the Office for National Statistics says It's a higher rate than analysts were predicting - the last time price rises were in double digits was in February 1982 Rising food and drink prices made the biggest contribution to the change in the inflation rate between June and July Bread, cereals, milk, cheese and eggs had a particular impact on rising prices But the cost of living is rising across the board, driven partly by energy costs and the Ukraine war but also factors such as the cost of raw materials Meanwhile, average wage increases are falling behind, with the average salary buying 3% fewer goods and services than a year before Inflation is expected to continue rising this year, with the Bank of England predicting it won't go down to the target 2% for about two years Edited by Nathan Williams Thank you for following today's live coverage of the UK inflation rate and cost of living. Today's coverage was brought to you by George Wright, Marita Moloney, Jen Meierhans, James Fitzgerald, Rachel Russell, Nathan Williams and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. You can continue to follow the storyhere. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the latest UK rate of inflation figures shortly. Here's a reminder of what happened today:  When the Covid pandemic hit, many of us turned away from coins and notes to limit the spread of the virus. But as prices have risen, it seems people want to keep their spending under control by using cash instead of their bank cards or online payments. Post offices handled Â£801m in personal cash withdrawals in July, the most since records began five years ago. That's up more than 20% from a year earlier. Natalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, said it showed people are ""literally counting the pennies"" as they grapple with rising prices. ""It's absolutely because of the cost of living crisis,"" said Ceeney, who chaired the government's independent Access to Cash review. ""People will be taking out cash and physically putting it into pots, saying 'this is what I have for bills, this is what I have for food, and this is what's left'."" Nadhim Zahawi, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, says that there are ""no easy options"" for the government in the face of soaring inflation. On the day that inflation hit 10.1%, Zahawi tells the BBC that the high energy prices being experienced in the UK are down to ""Putin deliberately using energy as a tool to get back at us for the help that we are putting into Ukraine"". While the Bank of England's governor has also said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the largest contributor to UK inflation, economists say there are many contributing factors including supply chain issues and recruitment challenges. Meanwhile, Zahawi says that the Treasury is preparing ""all the options"" for the incoming prime minister on 5 September - but adds that he is also preparing plans for a further price cap increase in January. ""We leave no stone unturned; we are looking at every option to be ready for 5 September for additional support. ""My message is ... whether they are small businesses or families who are really struggling, really worried, is that we will be ready for more support as the new prime minister comes in. ""We are working night and day to make this work."" Labour MP Hilary Benn, who is also co-convener of the cross party UK Trade and Business Commission, has warned the government's Brexit deal may also be to blame for the increased prices. He urged the government to improve the terms of the Brexit deal to ""remove these artificial barriers to trade and allow for the easier movement of labour to and from the UK"". He said: âInflation is clearly a global problem but the UK is experiencing one of the highest rates of inflation among other comparable economies, almost twice as high as France and around four times that of Japan. âThe UK is the only G7 country dealing with the added pressures caused by the governmentâs Brexit deal, which has increased costs for businesses and contributed to labour shortages, in turn driving up prices for consumers even further."" Next month we will find out who will take over from Boris Johnson as prime minister. Right now Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are taking part in a hustings with Tory members in Belfast,which we are also covering live here. But what are their plans for dealing with the cost of living crisis? Liz Truss  Rishi Sunak If you're looking for ways to reduce the amount of energy you use while cooking in the kitchen, here are some tips we've put together from the Energy Saving Trust and energy companies: People are being urged not to turn off their fridges in order to save money on their fuel bills. Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says she has heard of households doing this to cut down on costs but warned it creates the risk of infection in food. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the health chief also said that people should try and keep the heating as energy prices rise this autumn, ""particularly those at the extreme ages of life"". ""I think one of the important things here is people recognise the importance of spending what will likely be for many people very limited resource on heating, because that is an essential part of their health,"" she said. The inflation rate of 10.1% announced today is higher than analysts expected and won't be the last cost of living increase we see this year. Earlier this month, theBank of Englandpredicted that Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation would hit 13.3% in October as energy bills soar. But the recent CPI figures have outstripped predictions. The Bank's forecast for July inflation was below what theOffice for National Statistics(ONS) measured across the month by 0.2 percentage points. James Smith, research director at independent think-tank the Resolution Foundation, adds that it will take ""many months, and much more living-standards pain, before inflation starts to ease"". Some analysts expect inflation to push higher into the winter, with Pwc economist Jake
Finney stating it will peak in January 2023 instead of October. While Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, says inflation will hit ""around 13% in October"" before it ""gradually eases"" from early next year, followed by a ""substantial"" decrease from autumn 2023. As the cost of living continues to rise, Citizens Advice is warning that one in four people in the UK wonât be able to pay their energy bills in October based on current forecasts. Of those who wonât be able to pay in October, 68% have a household income of less than Â£30,000. Some 3.2 million disabled people and 4.4 million families with children won't be able to afford autumnâs predicted rise in energy bills and will end up almost Â£100-a-month in the red,the charity adds,external. Citizens Advice says its advice takes into account the energy rebate and cost-of-living payments already being offered by the government, showing that increasing costs are outstripping support. It is calling for further interventions from government, as well as asking energy regulator Ofgem to ensure people are protected from the most serious consequences of falling into arrears. The organisation's CEO Dame Clare Moriarty says there is a risk of ""a winter of despair for millions"" if further support is not provided by government. Fiona TrottReporting from Newcastle More than 150 people have arrived at a building in Newcastle to get help and
advice about the cost of living. It's run by the West End Foodbank who are
having to buy food themselves, because donors tell them itâs now too expensive
to give away. Carole Rowland, the welfare manager, says: ""We see people in full-time
work with mortgages, who are broken. They canât cope. ""Everyone is just trying
to make their way in life. Government help is not touching the sides. We need a
review of Universal Credit so that people can keep up."" This foodbank is believed to be the biggest in the UK. It's receiving around 7
tonnes of food per month, but needs 20 tonnes because of increasing demand. Carole says: ""Before the pandemic, we had two foodbanks in Newcastle. We now have eight across the city and we run 11 sessions a week."" UK-wide inflation hit 10.1% in July but the poorest tenth of households faced an inflation rate of 10.9%, according to the Resolution Foundation. Meanwhile the richest tenth also saw their cost of living rise significantly, but only 9.4%. James Smith, research director at the foundation, said: ""Inflation has hit double digits earlier than expected off the back of the highest food price inflation in over two decades, and is set to continue climbing as energy bills soar this winter."" ""It will take many months, and much more living standards pain, before inflation starts to ease,"" Smith adds. ""So, the number one priority for the next prime minister will be to offer significant support to help millions of families through a brutal winter and beyond."" The price rises we experience depend
on what we spend our money on and some readers have been using our personal inflation calculator, built by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) to find out theirs. Vivgot a figure of 10.7% - ""pretty much what I expected, sadly,"" she says. ""Fuel bills accounted for 30%, though I have been using my car much less. The rises in household fuel costs in October will punish us severely... It's very worrying and the picture is grim."" Keithsays: ""I found my calculated inflation rate slightly less than I had expected."" ""I am an 83 year old slightly disabled man. I live alone and rely on care workers. ""About half of my income is index-linked, but past experience suggests that in practice this rarely compensates for real price increases. ""The rest of my income depends on investments, and I think it likely that I shall need to encroach more and more on the capital in order to maintain my present standard of living.""

The Bank of England thinks this could push the UK into arecession- when the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. Whether or not the Bank's October prediction proves true remains to be seen. Its forecast for July's inflation rate was 9.9%, 0.2 percentage points lower than where the ONS has now measured it. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the difference between the Bank's forecast and the measurement is mainly down to surging food prices. Meanwhile, theenergy pricecap will reach close to Â£3,640 in October, up from Â£1,971 at the moment, according to the most recent estimates by experts. Then energy prices are expected to rise even further. Energy consultancy Auxilione said that at today's prices the cap might rise to Â£4,722 in January before hitting Â£5,601 in April. Stefan JajecznykProducer, BBC Breakfast We've been chatting to business leaders at Birmingham's wholesale market about how record inflation is affecting them. Raj Kandola, head
of policy at Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, says companies are under pressure to raise their prices due to higher costs for fuel, energy and raw materials. ""The next few months are absolutely crucial, those margins are getting absolutely squeezed,"" he says. ""That's why we are calling on the government to act now and help alleviate these huge cost pressures firms are facing right now. ""Many small businesses incurred huge debts in the pandemic which they are struggling to repay and now the cost of living crisis is adding to that pressure right now. ""So whether it's financial support for those in energy intensive industries, potentially looking at a price cap for smaller firms or even removing VAT from energy bills as well, I think all of those measures would help in the short term."" Here's a recap on the latest developments in the cost of living crisis. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Todayâs inflation
figure is estimated to be the highest since early 1982. That's actually
about 20 years before we started using the current measure of price rises
for households - the Consumer Price Index. Thankfully, the
Office for National Statistics went back and worked outhow it might have looked in years gone by.,external And, using those
figures, you can see in this chart just how exceptional this current bout of
inflation really is. We've been talking about the rise in the rate of inflation - but what is it? Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. Every month a figure is released, estimating how much prices are rising overall -the latest ONS data shows it has hit 10.1%. The Bank of England has warned that inflation could reach 13% and has predicted a recession by the end of the year. Stefan JajecznykProducer, BBC Breakfast In Birmingham's wholesale market, one trader tells us rising prices mean he can't plan from one week to the next and he does not feel there is any support. Leroy Howe, of Howe's Exports says: ""The price of fuel keeps going up so suppliers keep putting up the prices so what we find happening is that one week we'll be charged this price and the next week we'll be charged a higher price."" He says his biggest concern is the drop on footfall as customers cut back on spending. ""The amount of people that used to come through this market aren't coming through anymore so that is quite worrying,"" he says. He feels that traders like him are being ""left to our own devices"" and ""aren't getting any support from anywhere."" ""There's nobody trying to help us we are just trying to survive as trader in this market off our own back really,"" he says. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Despite
all the talk about the energy price cap being set to rise above Â£3,000, energy
costs havenât contributed that much directly to the latest hike in consumer
inflation. This
springâs price cap rise hit the figures in April and pushed inflation up to 9%. The
next price cap rise  - expected to take prices past Â£3,000 for the average
household - wonât be felt until after itâs announced at the end of the month. So
it's other things that have pushed inflation from those levels up into double
digits. In
the latest month, that's record increases in food and drink prices we've been
describing further down in the page. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Young watch far less TV than over-65s - OfcomThe average 16 to 24-year-old watches TV for 53 minutes a day compared with nearly six hours for over-65s.Technology,"Young people now watch almost seven times less broadcast television than people aged over 65, according to a report from regulator Ofcom. It said 16 to 24-year-olds spend just 53 minutes watching TV each day, a two-thirds decrease in the past 10 years. Meanwhile, those aged 65 and over spend just under six hours on average watching TV daily. This ""generation gap"" in viewing habits is wider than ever before, according to Ofcom's annual Media Nations report. It attributed the gap to the use of television alternatives such as streaming services and short-form video. In its report, Ofcom said about one in five UK homes had access to all three of the biggest streaming services - Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime. It said 5.2 million homes now had access to all three, which would cost about Â£300 per year if they paid for them individually. However, it conceded that this figure included free trials and people who are sharing accounts between households. Ofcom also found that overall the number of homes subscribing to at least one streaming service had decreased by 350,000. It blamed the pressure on household budgets as a result of a rise in the cost of living. But it found - in a survey of people who cancelled their services - that three-quarters planned to renew their subscriptions when their circumstances changed. ""The streaming revolution is stretching the TV generation gap, creating a stark divide in the viewing habits of younger and older people,"" said Ofcom's director of market intelligence, Ian Macrae. ""Traditional broadcasters face tough competition from online streaming platforms, which they're partly meeting through the popularity of their own on-demand player apps, while broadcast television is still the place to go for big events that bring the nation together such as the Euro final or the Jubilee celebrations."" In 2021, Ofcom found screen time - the average amount of time people spend watching video content across all devices - hit a daily average of five hours and 40 minutes, nearly a third of an adult's waking hours. This decreased by 25 minutes in the latest figures which found, on average, people spent 59% of their screen time watching live or catch-up TV. Meanwhile, a third of adults in Great Britain watch short-form videos - or videos less than 10 minutes in length - with 65% of 18 to 24-year-olds watching them daily. This number is vastly increased for younger audiences, with 93% of 15 to 17-year-olds getting daily short-form videos from YouTube, 90% viewing on Instagram and 73% watching on TikTok.

Thunderstorms warning as heavy rain floods roads,"Roads have flooded around the UK, including in Port Talbot Parts of Scotland have been hit by a week's worth of rain in just 24 hours as downpours batter the UK after days of hot, dry weather. Heavy rainfall has led to flooded roads across England and Wales. The Met Office issued yellow thunderstorms warnings in both nations, with travel disruption, power cuts and lightning possible. The Environment Agency has issued nearly 20 flood alerts for areas of Midlands and south-east England. The stormy conditions will continue to move south through the day, following the longest heatwave in 15 years in south-east England - with temperatures passing the threshold of 28C (82F) on nine consecutive days.

London, like much of the south of England, has seen its first proper rainfall in weeks More flooding in Port Talbot By 07:00 BST, Strathallan near Perth, had seen 55.2mm (2in) of rain fall in less than 24 hours. This is 71% of the 77mm the area normally sees in August. The heavy rain led to flooding on tracks in the area and a signalling fault, while speed restrictions of 40mph (64km/h) were put in place across vast swathes of the rail network. Houghton Hall in Norfolk saw 17mm (0.7in) of rain in the space of an hour on Tuesday afternoon. Footage and photos shared on social media showed torrential rain and floodwater sweeping through towns across southern England and Wales, including Newquay in Cornwall, Bishop's Tawton in Devon, Haywards Heath in West Sussex, Port Talbot in south-west Wales, and Bridport in Dorset. Other disruption caused by the stormy conditions includes: Three people were injuredwhen part of a balcony fell in Newquay Emergency street repairs had to be carried outin Sheffield after flash flooding Homes were flooded and roads blockedat Totton, near Southampton Residents had to have theirhomes pumped outat Market Rasen, Lincs Flood alerts have been issuedcovering 10 London boroughs BBC Weather presenter Jennifer Bartram said while heavy rain in August is not unusual, it ""is perhaps causing problems as a result of how dry it's been in the lead up"". She added heavy showers and thunderstorms will continue overnight and into Wednesday, becoming increasingly confined to southern England and East Anglia as the day goes on - with the continuing potential for further flooding in places. Flooding on train tracks in Perth caused a signalling fault. On the roads, Traffic Scotland warned surface water was affecting many routes and urged motorists to take care. A yellow weather warning has now ended in Scotland but warnings remain in place for most of England and Wales on Tuesday, and southern England on Wednesday. Yellow thunderstorm warnings mean flooding of homes and businesses could happen quickly, with fast flowing or deep floodwater possible, causing a danger to life. Flooding in a supermarket car park in car park in Loughborough Tonnes of mud and potatoes were washed on to a road in Somerset by the heavy rain Local authorities in Somerset said the A358 is set to reopen after they finished shifting more than 50 tonnes of mud off the road at Combe Florey, following a mudslide on Monday. Meanwhile, Network Rail said a suspected lightning strike near Hither Green in south-east London had caused signalling problems and power to fail, leading to passengers being stranded on trains and delays. And swimmers have been warned ofsewage and pollution at several beacheson English coastlines, linked to the heavy rain. According to data gathered by environmental campaign group Surfers Against Sewage, there has been storm sewage discharge into the waters at beaches in Cornwall, Devon, Sussex, Essex, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Northumberland and Cumbria. This video can not be played Watch: Lightning strikes light up Scottish skies Weeks of little raincaused drought across parts of the UKbut the next few days is unlikely to ease the parched conditions because rainwater struggles to permeate dry ground, meaning it will run off the dehydrated surface and lead to flash flooding in some areas. Stephen Dixon from the Met Office advised anyone who lives in an area prone to flooding to ""have a grab bag with things like water and insurance details and anything you might need, ready to go"". He added people who feel their property is vulnerable to flooding could consider moving valuables upstairs. One weather watcher in Newquay posted a video of torrential rain leading to flooding.

Despite the rain, the Environment Agency declared adrought in Yorkshireon Tuesday, the first since autumn 2018. Meanwhile, hosepipe bans are set to remain in place on theIsle of Manand inKent and Sussex. Thames Water has said one will come into force in ""the middle of next week"" and the company confirmed there has been ""less than 65% of the usual rainfall in this year"". Thames Water covers Greater London, the Thames Valley, Gloucestershire and north Wiltshire. Hosepipe bans will also come into force in: Cornwall and parts of Devon from 23 August Pembrokeshire and part of Carmarthenshire from 19 August Yorkshire Water from 26 August Rain did not dampen the spirits of spectators at the Fringe festival in Edinburgh. Amid these bans, some water companies have been told to ""up their game"" by the head of the water regulator for England and Wales, as he defended Ofwats's record of holding water companies to account. Questioned on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, Ofwat chief executive David Black singled out businesses like Thames Water and Southern Water and described the ""poor performance"" of some water firms as ""quite simply unacceptable"". Why drought can lead to dangerous flooding 500 more UK wildfires this year than all of 2021 Daily demand for water in England and Wales was 14 billion litres (three billion gallons), on average in 2018. In periods of hot weather this is likely to be higher. But each day, another three billion litres were lost through leakage, according to a National Audit Office report.

Inflation drives fastest fall in real pay on record,"Pay has fallen further behind the rising cost of living, according to the latest official data. While average wages rose 4.7% between April and June, that was outpaced by inflation - or price rises - which is growing at a much faster pace. As a result, the ""real value"" of pay fell by 3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. Household budgets are being hit by soaring energy bills as well as higher food and fuel costs. The rise in prices has fuelled the UK inflation rate to a 40-year high. The latest inflation figure, due out on Wednesday, is forecast to be higher. The gap between pay growth and inflation is the biggest since records began more than 20 years ago. What is the UK inflation rate and why is it rising? What is a recession and how could it affect me? Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS said the ""real value"" of pay was continuing to fall. ""Excluding bonuses, it is still dropping faster than at any time since comparable records began in 2001,"" he said. The data also highlighted a gap between public and private sector wage growth. Private sector wages grew by 5.9% while those working in the public sector saw pay growth of 1.8% - which Mr Morgan said is the ""largest difference we have seen for 20 years"". The rising cost of living has prompted calls from workers and unions for pay rises, with some sectors, such as the rail industry, taking strike action in recent weeks. More than 40,000 railway workers, who are members of the RMT union, are set to go on strike this Thursday and Saturday, but disruption is also expected on Friday because normal services may take time to resume. Last month,the government announced pay rises for millions of public sector workersincluding teachers, nurses, doctors, police officers, and members of the armed forces. However, most wage increases awarded were below the current rate of inflation of 9.4%, with ministers arguing large rises could cause inflation to remain higher for longer. The Bank of England recently lifted interest rates by the largest amount in 27 years to 1.75% in a bid to cool rising prices. It also warned that the UK economy will fall into recession towards the end of this year as prices for gas and electricity continue to rise. Nye Cominetti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said Britain was witnessing the biggest pay squeeze since the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977. ""The scale of this pay pain is even deeper than official figures suggest too, as pay growth estimates are still artificially boosted by the effects of the furlough scheme last year,"" he said. It says something about the extremity of inflation that the average pay rise is still not enough to keep up with price rises. The key now will be what happens to inflation next year. If price inflation slows down as hoped, then pay rises may once more outstrip price rises. That's better for workers' living standards. But the Bank of England will be worried that it means higher pay will itself become a cost fuelling inflation and that pay will have to rise by even more to make up for that - the much-dreaded 'wage-price-spiral' so that inflation takes a lot longer to get back to the 2% target. Expect an interest rate rise in September, and it might be more than a quarter of a percentage point. Julie Marson, minister at the Department for Work and Pensions, said the government recognised people were ""struggling with rising prices"". ""Being in stable employment is one of the best ways for people to get on, but we're also providing Â£1,200 direct payments for millions of low income households as part of our Â£37bn package of support to help with the cost of living,"" she said. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the fall in real wages was ""further proof that the Tories have lost control of the economy"". ""Because of the Tories' failure on the economy, families face plummeting real wages and soaring energy bills. Yet, this Zombie Government is offering no solutions to the cost of living crisis,"" he said. Separately, the ONS also revealed that quarterly job vacancies fell for the first time since 2020. Between May and July, they dropped by 19,800 to 1.274 million. Though the ONS points out that since vacancies fell to an all-time low between April to June 2020 in the beginning months of the Covid pandemic, they have increased by 945,000. Overall, the ONS said the unemployment rate held at 3.8%, while the employment rate for people aged 16 to 64 decreased slightly to 75.5%. The number of people classed as economic inactive, not in or seeking for work, was unchanged between April to June at 21.4%. The over-50s make up the majority of people who have left work since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, said the ""overall picture"" in the jobs market was "" still positive for those looking for work or to change jobs to raise their pay"". But he said firms were still struggling with staff shortages, which he claimed would ""constrain growth and drive inflation"". Louise Juggins, who runs the Crow Bar in Felixstowe, is one of many business owners struggling to recruit staff, which she said had affected her summer trade. Louise Juggins has been missing out on busy summer trading due to a lack of staff. ""We could certainly be taking more than we are if we were doing food seven days a week and I'd got more staff so we could put the facilities out there,"" she said. ""We're not putting tables out on Mondays and Tuesdays at the moment purely because I haven't got the staff to do so"". While Trevor Mangan who runs TJ Painting and Decorating in Alton, said: ""It's an absolute nightmare trying to find decent people, there's so much work around so people don't want to spend the time learning the trade. ""It really holds back a small business growing, more work is there but I just haven't got the people I trust to do it so can't take it on.""

UK begins final effort to end EU research row,"The UK government has begun what may be its final effort to resolve a dispute over the UK's membership of the EU's â¬100bn Horizon research programme. It has written to Brussels urging it to ""end persistent delays"" in delivering on its promise to allow British access to EU research collaborations. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss accused the European Commission of politicising scientific co-operation. Some experts say the move is the start of UK withdrawal from the programme. Prof James Wilsdon the director of the Research on Research Institute at Sheffield University told BBC News that he believes that there will be no resolution, at which point the new prime minister will instead announce the UK's own international research programme - known as Plan B. ""The only thing that today's announcement does offer is a clearer path towards a pivot from the UK's association to Horizon Europe, the outcome that the science community prefer, to Plan B, which is a hastily cobbled together set of alternative funding arrangements intended to be a substitute for some, but by no means all, of what's being lost,"" he said. Horizon Europe is the EU's flagship programme which brings together leading academic and industrial researchers from across its member nations to work on the highest quality science. Brussels had agreed to the UK's continued participation following Brexit in the withdrawal agreement 18 months ago. It changed its mind last year following the dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol. This latest move by the government is the start of a 30-day formal consultation period to resolve the issue, after which a lengthy, legalistic arbitration process can begin if agreement is not reached. Liz Truss, who is competing with former UK chancellor Rishi Sunak to be Britain's next prime minister, said that the EU was in ""clear breach"" of its agreement to allow participation in several scientific programmes, including Horizon Europe. ""We cannot allow this to continue,"" she said. ""That is why the UK has now launched formal consultations and will do everything necessary to protect the scientific community."" But Prof Wilsdon shares the view of other policy experts, who fear that after the 30 days are up, there will be no resolution, and rather than going to arbitration the new prime minister will instead announce Plan B. ""Our newly anointed PM can then say that they've 'tried everything but the intransigent EU won't budge,'"" he said. But Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group, which represents 24 leading research-intensive universities, hopes that the consultation will lead to a resolution. ""Despite the delays, securing the UK's full association to Horizon Europe remains the best outcome for both the UK and the EU,"" he said. Other affected schemes include the nuclear research programme Euratom, and services including Space Surveillance and Tracking. Minister of State for Europe Graham Stuart said: ""It is disappointing that the EU has not facilitated UK participation in the agreed scientific programmes, despite extensive UK engagement on the issue.'' David Lammy MP, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, said that the EU and the UK both need to show more flexibility, but described the government as having a ''reckless and law-breaking approach''. ""Instead of continuing the pattern of starting rows with the EU to appeal to their Tory base, the next prime minister should sit down with all parties to ease the tensions and find agreement in the national interest,"" he said. A European Commission spokesman previously said the EU continued to ""recognise the mutual benefit in co-operation in science, research and innovation, nuclear research and space"". But he added there had been ""serious difficulties in the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and parts of the trade and cooperation agreement"" and looked forward to a ""prompt resolution"" of these problems. He said: ""The Commission's objective remains to have a stable and positive relationship with the UK based on our international agreements signed and ratified by both the EU and the UK.""
