New laws to protect Christmas savings clubs money,"New laws are aimed at preventing scandals like the collapse of Christmas savings club Farepak in 2006 Savings clubs for shoppers will soon be protected under new laws to be introduced by the government. Many families pay into schemes throughout the year to spend on Christmas, weddings or home projects. These clubs are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. But new laws mean even if the company goes bust, shoppers' money will still be protected. It is aimed at preventing scandals like the collapse of Christmas savings club Farepak in 2006. When the Swindon-based company folded, it left116,000 customers with losses of Â£37mand many unable to pay for festive gifts. Many UK supermarkets and other businesses have a Christmas savings club, allowing customers to top up an account throughout the year and receive products and services in time for Christmas. The average family spends about Â£740 extra in December, analysis from the Bank of England has shown. Consumer minister Paul Scully said that families' hard-earned savings needed to be protected now more than ever due to the cost of living crisis. ""New laws will crack down on dodgy dealers who have no plans in place to protect shoppers' savings if their business goes to the wall,"" he said. ""We'll make sure scandals like Farepak never happen again, where thousands of families, many on low incomes, lost all they had saved for Christmas."" The law will apply to Christmas savings clubs and other prepayment schemes that are forms of a savings club.

Passengers' panic as train comes to sudden stop,"The Rail Accident Investigation Branch was notified after a Lumo train came to a sudden halt Rail passengers have complained of being thrown from their seats and hit by falling luggage after a train came to a sudden stop. The driver of the 08:20 from Newcastle to King's Cross hit the emergency brake near Peterborough, operator Lumo said. Passenger Neuma Domingos said she had a panic attack and hurt her leg and Lumo apologised for any distress caused. Police said 15 people had minor injuries and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch had been informed. Lumo said all travellers had been rerouted and the train was taken out of service for safety checks with later journeys cancelled. ""Regrettably there has been a knock-on effect for passengers on the 12:09 from King's Cross and the return journey at 18:52 from Edinburgh, both of which have been cancelled,"" Lumo said in a statement to the BBC. Neuma Domingos said she twisted her leg when the train came to a sudden halt Ms Domingos was returning to London for a hospital appointment after visiting family in Newcastle. The King's College London student told the BBC: ""Everything was fine until very abruptly we started veering to the right. All things fell on the floor. I was leaning on to the woman next to me and she almost fell out of her seat. ""And then very rapidly the train swung from side to side, heavily on to the left side all the luggage fell at this point. I hit my knee, people were gasping, a couple of people cried out - it was like really bad turbulence on a plane."" She added: ""I'm still pretty shocked by everything, surprised and my leg still hurts. A suitcase hit a man's head. I can't get that image out of my head. The suitcase slowly moving and then bang. It happened right in front of me."" Billie Rainer said the movement of the train felt much worse than plane turbulence Billie Rainer, 25, said she was left ""shaken"" by the incident after she caught the train from Newcastle to visit friends in the capital. ""The train was swinging from side to side as it went around the corner very fast,"" she told the BBC. ""I felt like a massive jolt and I was lifted out of my seat. I wasn't injured but other people were, by falling items. A woman was limping because she'd been hurt. ""The train tipped to the side a bit, then loads more. My suitcase fell to the floor and a couple of people fell off chairs. ""After the train swung from side to side it came to a massive halt and stopped at Peterborough station for an hour and a bit. ""It did feel like the train had approached the corner way too fast. It was so much worse than plane turbulence."" Ellie Foster tweeted a picture of her dented suitcase after it fell from a shelf Ellie Foster, 24, who lives in Canterbury was on the train with her partner Luke after visiting family over the Easter holidays. She tweeted about the ""very scary"" moment when she saw ""luggage and people flown all over the train"". She shared a photograph of a dent in her suitcase after it fell from a shelf. ""We were approaching Peterborough and we were sitting on the right side of the train and the train sort of jolted to the left causing all the luggage to come down from above our head. The train then wobbled and came to a stop and we were left waiting for over an hour,"" she said. ""In that instance you don't really know what's happening. I've obviously grabbed on to something because I've hurt my two little fingers, nothing serious, but I was bracing for the impact because I honestly thought the train was going to crash. I feel fine now. ""The ladies on the train said they were just waiting for the signal to change, there was no reason for what happened and they just hoped everyone was ok."" British Transport Police (BTP) said it received a report of an emergency stop at 11.53 BST. Officers met the train at King's Cross and talked to passengers who were offered medical assistance by paramedics at the station, BTP said. Lumo is owned by the travel business FirstGroup and runs trains on the East Coast Main Line between London King's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley.The route started in October and all Lumo trains on the service are electric. The operator said it was ""very sorry for any distress the sudden stop may have caused"". ""Such events can be jolting for passengers and we took great care to check on everybody's welfare. There was some falling luggage and naturally many people will have felt the effects of the sudden halt."" It added: ""A full investigation is now under way and we are supporting our driver and the Rail Accident Investigations Branch to determine precisely what happened."" It said all passengers were entitled to a full refund through the normal delay repay channels.

Next and finance firms buy JoJo Maman Bebe,"Baby goods retailer JoJo Maman Bebe is being sold to High Street giant Next and a group of finance firms, the BBC has learned. Next has taken on 44% of the firm's shares, with the other 56% acquired by investment companies managed or advised by hedge fund Davidson Kempner. There will be no immediate job losses at JoJo Maman Bebe. Its founder said she was ""excited by the opportunities this new partnership will offer"". As part of the deal though, Laura Tenison will leave the business that she founded nearly 30 years ago. She added that she was ""exceptionally proud"" of the firm's achievements, having grown the company ""from a kitchen table start-up to being the UK's leading specialist boutique mother and baby brand"". Gwynn Milligan, who joined JoJo Maman Bebe in 2017 as commercial director, has taken over as chief executive. The retailer has 87 brick-and-mortar shops across the UK, which will continue trading. According to its LinkedIn page, it currently employs more than 950 people. JoJo Maman Bebe blames shortages for raising prices Next warns prices to rise by more than expected In an email seen by the BBC, staff were told on Thursday that the deal would ""ensure the longevity of the brand for generations of new customers"". Next will also make a Â£16.3m investment in the brand using its own cash, although the value of JoJo Maman Bebe's sale was not immediately made clear. Next plans to keep the JoJo brand distinct and grow the business globally using its online shopping infrastructure, such as warehousing and software, to support the up-market baby goods retailer's physical shops and online sales. It has not yet been decided whether or not the boutique baby clothes will be sold in Next shops. Last September, JoJo Maman Bebe was forced to hike pricesfor the first time in about five years due to rising costs and supply chain issues. At the time, Ms Milligan said that the company had seen shipping costs quadruple. She added that the company was also having to absorb increased costs on some products, because of competition from retail rivals. In a statement, Simon Wolfson, Next's chief executive, said: ""We are excited to see what can be achieved through the combination of JoJo's exceptional product with Next's infrastructure and Davidson Kempner as our investment partner."" He added that the investment was not expected to have any immediate impact on the High Street giant's profits this financial year, but he expects it ""to make a positive contribution thereafter"".

Unrest in Sweden over planned Quran burnings,"Rioting continued on Sunday in NorrkÃ¶ping More than 40 people have been arrested after violent clashes in Sweden between police and people angry at plans by a far-right group to burn copies of the Quran. Three people were injured in Norrkoping on Sunday when officers fired warning shots at rioters, police said. The violence was sparked by a series of rallies organised by the Danish-Swedish politician Rasmus Paludan. He says he has burned a copy of Islam's holy book and wants to do so again. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Saudi Arabia has condemned what it called the ""deliberate abuse of the holy Quran by some extremists in Sweden, and provocation and incitement against Muslims"". Iran and Iraq earlier summoned the Swedish ambassadors to lodge protests. Police broke up crowd of protesters in the RosengÃ¥rd area of Malmo on Saturday Sweden's national police chief, Anders Thornberg, said he had never seen such violent riots following Sunday's clashes in Norrkoping, which is about 160km (99 miles) south-west of Stockholm, and nearby Linkoping. The two cites also witnessed riots on Friday, along with the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby and the western city of Orebro. On Saturday, there was a riot in the southern city of Malmo. On Monday, police said 26 police officers and 14 members of the public had been injured in the violence and that more than 20 vehicles had been damaged or destroyed. They said that around 200 people had been involved in the violence, adding they believed it was organised by networks of criminal gangs. Some of the individuals are already known to police and Sweden's security service, Sapo. Sunday's violence in Norrkoping came after Rasmus Paludan said he planned to hold a rally there. However, he never showed up in the city. In a statement posted by his far-right, anti-immigrant Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, Paludan said he cancelled the rally because Swedish authorities had ""shown that they are completely incapable of protecting themselves and me"". He had earlier appeared on Thursday in the central city of Jonkoping, but as he talked into a megaphone while holding a Quran, his words were drowned out by a priest ringing the bells of a local church in protest. Protests against plans by Stram Kurs to burn the Quran have turned violent in Sweden before. In 2020, protesters set cars on fire and shop fronts were damaged in clashes in MalmÃ¶. Paludan represented Stram Kurs party in the last Danish elections in 2019, where it received 1.8 % of the vote, failing to win a seat. In 2020, he was jailed in Denmark for a month for a string of offences including racism. He plans to stand in Swedish elections in September, but he reportedly does not yet have the necessary number of signatures to secure his candidature.

War forces Germany to burn bridges with Russia,"A protest in Bonn, Germany: The German government has previously argued against weapons deliveries to Ukraine Repenting historical wrongs is a national pastime in Germany. But even by German standards, the soul-searching over Berlin's Russia policy is remarkable. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, many German politicians have publicly admitted they got Vladimir Putin wrong. Even German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has apologised, saying it was a mistake to use trade and energy to build bridges with Moscow. ""It's a bitter acknowledgement that for 30 years we emphasised dialogue and co-operation with Russia,"" says Nils Schmid, foreign affairs spokesperson for Mr Steinmeier's party, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). ""Now we have to recognise this has not worked. That's why we have entered a new era for European security."" That new era was dubbed ""Zeitenwende"" - literally meaning a turning point - by Germany's SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a now-famous speech in the German parliament a few days after the invasion. It means scrapping rules about weapons exports, a huge boost in defence spending and an end to Russian energy imports. A Russian gas pipeline to Germany called Nord Stream 2 has already been suspended. ""For the foreseeable future, co-operation with Russia will not occur. It will be more about containment and deterrence and, if needed, defence against Russia,"" Mr Schmid tells me. Unexpectedly hawkish words for a party that until seven weeks ago believed Germany's historical guilt and moral duty to make up for Nazi crimes meant peace with Russia at all costs. But in Berlin, the war in Ukraine feels very close. The images of shelled Ukrainian buildings look like German cities in World War Two. And the third-of-a-million refugees, mostly women and children, arriving at German train stations remind many here of their parents or grandparents as children fleeing Russian soldiers in 1945. Even Germany's view of its own history is changing. Putin's war prompts dramatic German U-turn Until the invasion mainstream opinion was that German reunification was thanks to dialogue with Moscow by another SPD chancellor, Willy Brandt. But now the debate has shifted, with reminders that Mr Brandt's diplomacy was backed up by strong deterrence, including a West German defence budget of 3% of GDP. The issue of German historical war guilt has also become more nuanced. Before the invasion the government argued against weapon deliveries to Ukraine because of Nazi crimes against Russia. ""Under Putin, official Russian policy tried to monopolise the memory of the Second World War for the bilateral German-Russian relationship,"" explains Mr Schmid. This blinded parts of German society to the suffering of Ukrainians during the war, he adds. Now there is a greater awareness of Ukraine's traumas under the Nazis. Berlin's rhetoric has shifted dramatically. But some ask whether actions are following fast enough. Certainly warm words of support are not enough for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. He has criticised Germany's continued reliance on Russian oil and gas. This video can not be played WATCH: Zelensky says European countries still buying Russian oil are dealing in blood money In a BBC interview last week,Mr Zelensky called payments for Russian energy ""blood money"". And a planned visit to Kyiv by President Steinmeier was cancelled at the last minute. There are conflicting reports about what happened: some Ukrainian officials say Mr Steinmeier was not ""disinvited"". But certainly German politicians and commentators interpret the failed visit as a sign of Ukraine's distrust in the German president, who as foreign minister under Angela Merkel spent years trying to achieve peace by engaging with Russia. At the Brandenburg Gate - a symbol of another ""Wende"", the word used in German for the process of German reunification - I meet Claudia Major, defence specialist at SWP, the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ""Our partners look at us, and say: OK, you do aZeitenwendebut what are you practically doing?"" she says. ""On sanctions we are timid and on weapons delivery, we are reluctant. So, rightly, they wonder what that Zeitenwende is about, and given that Germany is a big economic, military, political power in the middle of Europe, whatever we do makes a difference, in good ways and bad."" Germany has committed to sanctioning Russian energy imports, but wants a gradual phase-out, rather than an instant embargo. The government argues this would tip Germany into recession and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. ""This is a dilemma that Germany has created itself,"" argues political scientist Liana Fix from the KÃ¶rber Foundation. ""That's obviously difficult to accept for other countries, who are willing to go ahead with an embargo and have done their homework on energy diversification."" German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he was told he was not welcome in Ukraine due to his close ties with Russia Ironically, it's a Green Party politician, Economy Minister Robert Habeck, from a party that for years has been calling for energy independence from Russia, who is having to solve this dilemma. On military support for Ukraine, Berlin says it is prepared to send whatever weapons Kyiv needs. But there are allegations that some ministries are getting tied up in bureaucracy. Here, too, it is a Green politician, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who is pushing the governing coalition to go faster. She has called for heavy weaponry, such as tanks or fighter jets, for Ukraine. The chancellor, meanwhile, appears to dodge the question when asked - possibly nervous of losing his party's support. Olaf Scholz has to keep his party onside, govern in a three-way coalition and overturn Germany's guilt-laden pacifist identity overnight. But even his allies say the chancellor should at least communicate better what's going on. One speech in parliament and a few TV chat shows are not enough, says Claudia Major. UKRAINE:Battle for justice over alleged war crimes ANALYSIS:Why Russia wants to seize eastern Donbas ON THE GROUND:Collecting the dead in Bucha READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Meanwhile, it feels like many individual Germans are going through their ownZeitenwende. Ariane Bemmer, a columnist for the Tagesspiegel newspaper, has written about reassessing her own feelings towards Russia. ""I definitely got it wrong, it's like losing a friend,"" she tells me. Like many in the former West Germany in the 1980s, she was wary of US-style cutthroat capitalism. She bought a book called Ami Go Home - she never read it, but felt it would look good on her bookshelf - and was intrigued by the reforms in Russia. ""In America you had Ronald Reagan as a president, which was a shock for us. We thought: what will he do, this crazy actor with his cowboy boots? Will he set the world on fire? Russia was a place where all the good changes were, perestroika, freedom, wind of change,"" she says. Few in Germany think that now. In one recent poll, 55% of Germans said Berlin should send heavy weapons, such as tanks and fighter jets, to Ukraine to fight against Russia. For Ariane, and many other Germans, any lingering Russophile romanticism vanished for good the day Putin's tanks rolled over Ukraine's border.

Online posts 'transform' war crimes documentation,"This video can not be played How do you prove a war crime has been committed? Images posted online will be crucial in prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine, according to UK legal experts. A law professor said the use of bomb footage from Yemen during a mock war crimes trial showed how images shared online had ""transformed"" the documentation of atrocities. One online investigator said there was ""so much"" useful and verifiable information in warzone footage. But experts also said eyewitness accounts must not be overshadowed. Cases against individuals who have committed war crimes in Ukraine could depend on social media posts about unlawful killings, wartime sexual violence and torture, said Prof Yvonne McDermott Rees, who runs the Open Source Research for Human Rights project at Swansea University. Images shared online have ""transformed"" the documentation of atrocities, legal experts say She said material, known as open-source information, had ""completely transformed our way of knowing about human rights violations"". ""We're seeing increasingly the UN commissions of inquiry, fact-finding missions, even the International Criminal Court in the Hague, using this kind of evidence,"" she explained. Do Bucha civilian killings amount to genocide? Biden calls for Putin to face war crimes trial War crimes probe details Ethiopia ethnic cleansing Bucha satellite image contradicts Russian claims Prof McDermott Rees said open-source information had also been used in Swedish and Dutch courts to prosecute members of the so-called Islamic State returning from Syria. Open-source information is information that is freely available online. ""A video of a beheading that's recorded or shared on YouTube or Facebook... is evidence,"" she said, adding that similar material was recently tested for use in a UK court. In 2018, unverified footage of the aftermath of a deadly airstrike on the office of the presidency in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, was posted on Twitter. People were seen lifting injured people from the rubble following an airstrike in Sana'a, Yemen The open-source investigative website, Bellingcat, used geolocation, satellite imagery and comparisons of hundreds of imagesto document the attack,external. Their evidence was then presented in the mock trial of a fictitious Saudi pilot accused of war crimes. ""We wanted to see if one of these videos would be accepted as evidence in a common-law court in England and Wales,"" said Nick Waters, the justice accountability lead at Bellingcat. He said the result was a methodology ""we're now using to collect and verify incidents in Ukraine"". Six people were reported to have died in an airstrike in Yemen, footage of which was then used in a mock war crimes trial in the UK The problem, said Prof McDermott Rees, is that in the midst of war, bystanders are rarely thinking about a criminal trial. ""They're sharing it with the intention of showing the world what they've witnessed,"" she explained. Bystanders are being encouraged to film landmarks and known buildings in their footage of war crimes and to use a mobile phone app developed by the International Bar Association, calledeyeWitness,external. A young woman with a mobile phone takes pictures of a destroyed Retroville shopping centre in Kyiv following a Russian shelling attack ""It does things like capturing the metadata, the time, the date, the place where this piece of content was recorded,"" she said. ""If you are recording this, as well as showing the injuries suffered, the weapon, see if you can include landmarks or buildings in the background."" She said Witness, a charity that uses videos to document human rights abuses, has publishedguidelines on how bystanders can gather images,externalthat will be acceptable for use in courts. War crimes investigators are also fighting against the widely held view that online images cannot be trusted. ""That misses out on the fact that there is so much useful and verifiable information being posted on the Internet,"" Mr Waters said, adding that it is difficult to fake incidents online because real events come with a pattern of tweets from multiple sources. ""With the advent of social media, of smartphones, you effectively have an incredibly powerful information network where people are able to take pictures and take videos of the events,"" Mr Waters added. The presence of mobile phones in war zones has been a gamechanger Solicitor Dearbhla Minogue works with the human rights charity,Global Legal Action Network,externaland Bellingcat, She said viewing a video of something happening is a lot more compelling than hearing somebody talk about it. ""Think about... the death of George Floyd,"" said Ms Minogue. ""People actually saw that happening in real-time, including the jury, by watching what was filmed by a passer-by. ""That impacted the outcome of that trial because it was no longer one person's word against another person's."" The University of California has developed rules for the use of digital open-source material,called the Berkeley Protocol,external. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine WAR CRIMES:Are atrocities part of a strategy? WATCH:Finding our parents in a warzone ANALYSIS:Why is Russia losing so many tanks? READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external The question facing war crimes prosecutors, Ms Minogue said, is how to reassure a judge that the video is not faked or manipulated for political reasons. ""With a video that just appears online purporting to be the aftermath of an airstrike, how do we know that it is what it says it is?"" she said. ""That it's not staged or faked or these issues that are being raised by Russia in the context of these Bucha videos."" Ms Minogue said the normal way in domestic courts is to call the person who filmed it to give evidence in court. ""But in the cast of open-source information, where you don't have the creator, you can't ask them how they created it, whether they manipulated it [or] whether someone else could manipulate it. ""Using the information in the video and comparing it with other satellite imagery or other videos showing the same event, they can piece together all these bits of content and assess whether they think it real or fake."" This video can not be played ""Russian soldiers raped me and killed my husband"" Prof McDermott Rees warned that while open-source material can help, ""it's important not to lose the human side in all of this"". She said: ""In Yemen, this kind of evidence wasn't seen on its own, it was in close collaboration with accounts that were gathered by NGOs on the ground."" In Ukraine, she said evidence of rape had been documented in the testimony of survivors, ""so it's really important that we don't underplay the importance of those human accounts"". ""It's about showing that when international crimes are committed, they're not committed with impunity,"" Prof McDermott Rees said. ""So this work in documenting and gathering informationâ¦ we have to make sure that's going to stand up in court and that we'll see justice. ""All of us are seeing this really disturbing content coming out of Bucha, other areas in Ukraine and I think universally we want to see justice done."" Is Russia committing genocide in Ukraine?

The BBC's global disinformation reporter Hannah Gelbart investigates their emotionally charged tricks, and follows digital paper trails across the internet. Ukraine's president says he has spoken with the International Monetary Fund about Ukraine's financial stability and the country's post-war reconstruction. Volodymyr Zelensky said the discussion with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva had laid out ""clear plans"". The president's economic adviser says Ukraine will be asking the IMF and G7 (Group of Seven) industrial countries for $50bn (Â£38bn) to cover its war-linked deficit. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal will attend the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington DC over the next week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sailors said to be from the Moskva were shown on parade in a video released on Saturday Some 40 sailors were killed, several are missing and many more were wounded in the sinking of the warship Moskva, the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta Europe reports quoting the mother of a sailor believed to be on board. The mother said her son told her in a phone call that the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, had been hit by three missiles from land, from Ukrainian territory. ""He called me and was crying because of what he had seen. It was terrifying,"" she said, adding that she herself was terrified of having to wait for him to finish his service. He said he would not give her the details of what he had seen because it was so terrible, adding that many of the wounded had lost limbs because of the explosions. The newspaper has not named the sailor or his mother to protect them. But it says it has documentary evidence which makes it plausible that the sailor was serving on the Moskva. Russia's defence ministry has so far given no word of any casualties in the sinking. However, earlier we reported that Radio Libertyhad confirmed the death of Midshipman Ivan Vakhrushev. Meanwhile the ministry on Saturday postedvideo which it says is of the ship's sailorsmeeting the commander of the Russian Navy in Sevastopol. It blames the sinking on a fire on board the ship and stormy weather. Ukraine says it hit the Moskva with two missiles. Novaya Gazeta Europe was set up earlier this month to get around Russia's crackdown on media freedom. Its Russian counterpart suspended its operations in March after being repeatedly threatened with closure over its coverage of the invasion of Ukraine. Joel Gunterreporting from Serhiivka, Donbas region Rayisa
Horislavets hasnât spoken to her sister for two weeks. The sisters live either
side of the frontlines in Donbas in eastern Ukraine - Rayisa in a village
controlled by Ukraine, her sister not far away in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, controlled by Russia. They
stopped speaking because the phone connection to the Russian-controlled part of
Donbas went down, but the relationship had already deteriorated before then,
Rayisa said. Her
sister believes that the news about Russiaâs attacks on Ukraine is fake. ""She
tells me not to believe anything I see in our media, that it is the Ukrainians
doing all the damage,â Rayisa said. âI told her there are witnesses, we see
what is happening in Kharkiv and elsewhere, but she doesnât believe me.â Rayisa's
story is not uncommon in eastern Ukraine, where frontlines have divided
families and Russian propaganda has convinced many on the Russian side that the
atrocities and attacks in international media are fake. âWhen
bad things came to their home we supported them,â Rayisa said, referring to
Russian hostilities in Donetsk starting in 2014. âNow bad things come to our
home, and they turn their backs,"" she said. Rayisa
would like to speak to her sister again. âOf course, she is my sister,â she
said. âBut we cannot talk now, we will only fight.â Read Joel Gunter's full report here. Joe InwoodReporting from Dnipro Kharkiv saw fresh shelling on Sunday Across eastern
Ukraine, air raid sirens have gone from sporadic to near constant. Areas we
visited where we expected to feel relatively safe, proved to be anything but. It seems nowhere
is that the case more than in the city of Kharkiv. Terrifying
footage, filmed by the Sun newspaperâs defence editor Jerome Starkey,
shows a team of paramedics coming under attack from above. A man in red shields
a wounded woman on the floor, while others flee in panic past him. Fires are said
to be raging throughout the city, with five people reported killed. But itâs not
just Kharkiv where Russia is reportedly taking civilian lives. Zolote is a
village right on the frontlines of the Donbas. We visited it a week ago,
filming in the trenches with Ukrainian soldiers. Even then it was
astonishing to think that civilians were still living in an area that felt like
a warzone. Now, with Russiaâs main offensive gathering pace, it is simply
incomprehensible that people are still there. But, with reports
of two dead and four injured in the area, it is evident that there are still
many civilians who have been unable or unwilling to flee. Ukrainian armed
forces say they have repelled a number of attacks today, taking out dozens of
tanks, armoured vehicles and drones. But, the more
Russia is frustrated on the ground, the more they are expected to vent their
anger from above. For the people of the eastern Ukraine, that is a terrifying
prospect. Ivan Fedorov was freed last month in a prisoner exchange Mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov and three other Ukrainian lawmakers attended Pope Francis's Easter Vigil mass at St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City on Saturday evening. The Vatican said that the Pope met the Ukrainian delegation privately before the mass. Fedorov was detained by Russian forces last month but freed later in a prisoner exchange. His city remains under Russian occupation. Pope Francis said: ""In this darkness of war, in the cruelty, we are all praying for you and with you this night. We are praying for all the suffering. We can only give you our company, our prayer."" This video can not be played Pope Francis calls for peace in his Easter message Russian shelling set apartments ablaze in Kharkiv on Sunday If you're just joining us, welcome to our live coverage of events in Ukraine. Here's a round-up of the latest developments: Azovstal iron and steel plant in Mariupol, 4 Apr 22 The Ukrainian troops defending the huge Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol may hold out for a long time with guerrilla tactics, using its nuclear bunkers and tunnels, a military expert says. Justin Crump of security consultancy Sibylline told the BBC ""they are really well set for defence"", having had more than 50 days to fortify the site and build
escape routes. ""I suspect that unless they are wiped out theyâll be
there a long time - they could do nasty stuff at night, and go back in."" He estimates as many as 800 fighters are defending the plant, led by the far-right Azov Battalion - a group vilified by Russia as ""neo-Nazis"". ""The soldiers there donât want to get captured, I donât think they'll surrender. And Russia doesnât want to go in and clear it out metre
by metre, underground, that's horrendous,"" he said. Ukraine has managed to resupply its beleaguered forces in Mariupol in very risky night-time missions, he said. The steelworks is a key industrial site and, if Russia does get control of it, ""maybe the Chinese will get them back in operation, as they want the steel"", Mr Crump said. But it will take years to rebuild devastated Mariupol, he added. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said Russia and Ukraine have not had any recent diplomatic communications. In an interview on CBS News, Kuleba said: ""Mariupol may be a red line"" for peace talks and the situation over there is ""dire"". Russia's guarantee that it would spare the lives of Ukrainian soldiers who surrender and lay their arms down has been rejected by Ukraine. Earier on, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukrainian soldiers have remained in the besieged city of Mariupol and they ""fight to the end"". The Kremlin has said that its forces had almost completely seized the city. A monument to the Soviet commander and hero of World War Two Marshal Georgy Zhukov has been pulled down in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Video footage circulating on social media shows the bust being toppled from its pedestal. Local official Tatyana Topchiy told Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne the incident happened very quickly at about 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT), adding that she did not know who was responsible. Local authorities in the city have been long opposed to the dismantling of the monument. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Konstantin Nemichev, leader of a military unit called the Kraken, affiliated to the far-right National Corps, said the unit had carried out the act. A longer version of the video published in his Telegram channel shows the bust being driven away in a truck and dumped at a rubbish tip. Marshal Zhukov is regarded as the most important Soviet commander of the Second World War. He played key roles in the battles of Stalingrad and Kursk, and commanded the final assault on Berlin. The manner of the monument's removal is likely to be seen as a serious provocation by many Russians. In an interview with ABC, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that remaining Ukrainian forces in the southern port city of Mariupol are still fighting and will continue to defy Russia's ultimatum for them to surrender. ""The city has not fallen"", Shmyhal said. On Sunday, Russia said it would guarantee the lives of Ukrainian soldiers who would surrender, with the Kremlin adding that the only Ukrainian soldiers left in the city were at a giant steelworks. Other Ukrainian officials have been reiterating the same message. Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko told the BBC earlier on that he had spoken to soldiers in Mariupol and ""they're going to fight until the end"". A community kitchen set up by celebrity chef JosÃ© AndrÃ©s was among the buildings destroyed by Russian bombing in Kharkiv city on Saturday. Kharkivâs mayor said three people were killed and 34 wounded by missile strikes in the city. Nate Mook, CEO of World Central Kitchen,tweeted a video of himself,externalat the destroyed building, adding that four staff members were injured in the missile attack. AndrÃ©s founded World Central Kitchen in 2010 after the devastating earthquake in Haiti that displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Since then, the organisation has set up community kitchens in several disaster zones around the world. World Central Kitchen now operates kitchens in 30 Ukrainian cities and says it provides nearly 300,000 meals a day. The Associated Press news agency reported that AndrÃ©s said the Kharkiv attack in Kharkiv  showed that giving food âin the middle of a senseless warâ was an act of courage, and that his chefs wouldnât stop their work. At the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games on Saturday evening, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex paid tribute to the people of Ukraine and praised their bravery. The Duke of Sussex, who set up the sporting competition for injured military veterans, said the world was united with Ukraine. With the first full day of the event in the Netherlands under way, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have been pictured with Ukrainian athletes. The Duchess praised the country's team for making the journey to take part. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine is fighting in the Donbas region and it has ""no intention of surrendering"". In an interview broadcast on Sunday by CNN, Zelensky brushed aside the idea of letting Moscow take over the Donbas and part of eastern Ukraine to stop the conflict. He added: ""Ukraine and its people are clear. We have no claim to anyone else's territories but we are not going to give up ours"". When Russian President Vladimir Putin talks about taking over the Donbas, he is referring to Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. What he really means is the entirety of two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border. Earlier on we reported on the deadly shelling in Kharkiv, which led to five people being killed and 13 injured, according to regional health officials. A series of strikes were heard across the city. The shelling hit the city centre and saw fire engines called into operation from all areas. Firefighters have been battling the blazes in residential buildings. Reporters from the news agency AFP were on the scene and have described what happened. They said that the shelling ignited fires throughout the city and tore roofs from buildings, showering debris onto the roads below. Ever since Russia pulled back from its offensive to capture the capital Kyiv, the Kremlin has scaled up attacks on the east of Ukraine including Kharkiv, which is just 21km (13 miles) from the Russian border. On Friday, shelling of residential areas of the city killed 10 people, and on Saturday a strike claimed two more lives. Catherine ByaruhangaReporting from Odesa The governor of Ukraineâs Mykolaiv region has told the BBC that there have been continuous rocket attacks in the city and surrounding areas since Sunday morning. Vitaliy Kim said: âToday in the morning there were rockets, which damaged the electricity lines that provide for one of the regions of our city.â A BBC team approaching the centre of town heard explosions in the distance. The military spokesman for the region says, the Russians are bombing power grids, houses and playgrounds with various types of missiles. One eyewitness in Mykolaiv said it was hard to pinpoint the location of the strikes. The military in Mykolaiv has held off Russian forces seeking to take over the south-eastern corner of Ukraine, including the strategic port city of Odesa. Kim said that despite the recent attacks, the Russians have not yet moved the front line. âThey [Russian forces] can't advance in one day, even in one a week, they canât advance and reach Mykolaiv. So people will have some time to leave Mykolaiv, if it becomes dangerous. And if I see it becoming dangerous in the city, I will tell everyone to leave,â he said. He added: âBut for now, we have no threat about them circling us or occupying us.â The region is now in its fourth day without water after an explosion on a central water pipe along the battle lines. Most people can get drinking water from wells, but thereâs no running water for hygienic purposes. The Moskva was the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet Journalists from Radio Liberty's Ukrainian service say they have confirmed one death during the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva, despite no casualties having been announced by the Russian authorities. They spotted that news of the death of Midshipman Ivan Vakhrushev, 41, had been posted by his wife on Russian social media site Odnoklassniki (Classmates). ""Our hero!!! He died doing his duty. He fought to his last breath for the life of the ship. We are in tears and in mourning. You'll always be a hero in our hearts,"" she wrote on the site. Varvara Vakhrusheva told the journalists that her husband had died as a result of the sinking. She was informed of his death on 14 April, adding that his body had been found but the circumstances of his death had not been revealed. Ms Vakhrusheva said that another 27 members of the crew were missing, but there has been no official confirmation of this. On Saturday Russia's defence ministrypublished video footage of a paradein Sevastopol of what it said were sailors from the sunken ship, the first evidence offered of the survival of any sailors from the vessel. They were met by Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Nikolay Yevmenov. The ministry announced late on Thursday thatthe Moskva had sunk on stormy seasafter a fire caused by exploding ammunition. Ukraine said it had sunk the ship with two Neptune missiles. Five people have been killed and 13 injured in shelling of the city of Kharkiv, local officials say. ""Rescuers are operating in the sites,"" the Ukrainian Suspilne public broadcaster reports. We'll provide more details as we get them. A lenghty queue of trucks has formed on the Poland-Belarus border as Russian and Belarusian drivers try to leave the European Union following a sanctions deadline. In the run-up to the Saturday deadline, the line extended to 80km (60 miles), with some drivers stuck for up to 33 hours. Hours after the deadline passed, the waiting times had been shortened to 12 hours, the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw says.

The Biden administration is planning to announce another $800m (Â£615m) military aid package for Ukraine, according to US media. Asked on Tuesday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, if he would send more artillery to Ukraine, President Biden responded: ""Yes."" The White House last week announced it would sent an $800m package to Ukraine that includes 40,000 artillery rounds and 18 howitzers (155mm). Speaking at a domestic event in the US state of New Hampshire, President Joe Biden said that he's not sure whether he'll travel to Ukraine. âThe answer is, I donât know,â Biden told reporters, according to CNN. âIâve been to Ukraine many times, just havenât been there recently.â White House officials have been saying since last week that a senior official may travel to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky has also invited Biden to personally make the trip. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday that there are currently no plans for Biden to go. She later added that if there were plans in the works, she would not tell reporters in advance anyway. Officials say it's more likely that the US will send the secretary of state or secretary of defence. The Ukrainian president giving his latest video address Ukraineâs
President Zelensky has given his nightly video address, with an update on the
fighting in the east. He says ""the situation
in Mariupol remains as severe as possible without any changes,"" according to the Reuters news agency, adding that Russian forces have been blocking attempts to organise humanitarian corridors to help civilians leave the besieged city. He also says, ""the fate of tens of thousands of Mariupol residents, who have been earlier moved to the territory controlled by Russia, is unknown"". Zelensky claims ""the intensity of fire by Russian troops in the Kharkiv direction, in the Donbas, and in the Dnipro region has increased significantly"" and accuses Russia of targeting
residential buildings and civilians. He adds, ""this is such meanness, which for generations will mark the Russian state as a source of absolute evil.â Brimstone missiles seen attached to a British jet in 2014 More now on what's been promised by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following his video call with President Biden and others earlier. Johnson was among the Western leaders who pledged to send more artillery to Ukraine. Specifically, he said he planned to equip Kyiv with anti-ship missiles - including by mounting British Brimstone rockets to vehicles. Reuters reports that Brimstones have previously been used by UK forces in Libya and Syria, and are typically launched from fast jet aircraft. They're used against fast-moving land and sea targets. Ukraine's allies have provided Kyiv with additional military aircraft and aircraft parts to increase their fleet size and repair others in Ukraine's arsenal that were damaged, the US defence department said on Tuesday. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at a news briefing. He added that Washington had not provided aircraft to Kyiv. Earlier, US President Joe Biden held a video call with Western leaders about stepping up military support to Ukraine.They pledged to send more weaponsto help the country defend itself against the renewed Russian offensive in the east.  Jonathan BealeReporting from Dnipro Ukrainian forces are entrenched in the old industrial area The Donbas is mostly open countryside, outside the big
cities. Itâs Ukraineâs old industrial heartland. Youâll see slag heaps and
mines there. Open countryside gives both sides
room for manoeuvre. Russian tanks, which have been seen elsewhere stuck in
columns on roads, will be able to go over fields there and make life more difficult
for Ukrainian forces. But the Ukrainians are well dug-in. Theyâre in
trenches. They have anti-tank weapons supplied by the West which they can use
to effect. I think itâs important what happens in the air. The Donbas
is closer to Russian territory, and the Russians may have more freedom over the
air. They certainly havenât got air superiority at the moment. But itâs difficult for the Ukrainian air force, as small as
it is, to operate that far to the east of the country. So that might be one
advantage for the Russians. Russia's defence ministry has once again called on Ukrainian troops holding out inside Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant to lay down their weapons on Wednesday. Mariupol has been besieged by Russian attacks, but Ukraine's Azov Battalion is reportedly still holding out in Azovstal - a huge steelworks plant overlooking the Azov Sea. Russian troops will observe a cease-fire while the proposal is in effect - starting from 1100 GMT on 20 April. Not a single Ukrainian soldier accepted that same offer on Tuesday, the ministry said in a statement. Russia's military says it controls almost all of Mariupol, but Ukrainian officials insist their remaining soldiers will fight to the end.

Mykhailo
Podolyak said the current hiatus would likely be prolonged by the ongoing siege of Mariupol and Russia's apparent desire to strengthen its hand with a renewed offensive in the east. Relations were also soured by the alleged killing of civilians in the town of Bucha before the withdrawal of Russian forces earlier this month. The last face-to-face talks were on March 29. ""Obviously, against the backdrop of the Mariupol
tragedy, the negotiation process has become even more complicated,"" Podolyak told Reuters. ""Russia defiantly renounces any manifestations of
humanity and humanism when it comes to certain humanitarian corridors.
Especially when we talk about Mariupol."" Ukrainian authorities say at least 20,000 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the war, and that efforts to evacuate the city have been repeatedly hampered by Russian shelling. ""It
is difficult to say when the next face-to-face round of negotiations will be
possible because the Russians are seriously betting on [making gains in] the
so-called 'second stage of the special operation',"" Podolyak said. Russian-backed forces are reportedly storming the area where Mariupol's final Ukrainian defenders are holed-up - the vast Azovastal iron and steel works. Plumes of smoke can be seen drifting into the air from near the plant, in this drone video released by Ukraine's defence ministry.

The call also included French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, among others. According to the readout, the leaders on the call ""affirmed their solidarity"" with Ukraine and condemned ""the humanitarian suffering caused by Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion"". ""They also discussed their coordinated efforts to impose severe economic costs to hold Russia accountable,"" the readout says.

Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring The Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier in Murmansk shipyard Google has denied making changes
to its satellite images of Russiaâs military sites after false claims were widely shared online that it
had unblurred images of certain spots. A number of self-described open source intelligence accounts claimed yesterday that Google had stopped hiding
Russiaâs âsecretâ military facilities from public view on its Google Earth and
Maps services. Images of those facilities went
viral online and the story was widely reported as a new development in Ukraine. But Google has never hidden those
facilities, and high-resolution images of Moscowâs military sites and equipment
have been publicly available for years. The companytook to Twitter to refute the claim,external, saying it hadnât made âany blurring changes to our satellite
imagery in Russiaâ. A search of the companyâs
historic imagery function on Google Earth confirms no specific changes have been
made with regard to satellite images from Russia. Google has been found to have
blurred satellite images of certain territories in the past,including parts of Israel and
Palestinian territories, owing to a now defunct US regulation. It also blurssatellite
images of certain sensitive sites,external, likely at the request of national
governments. Destroyed buildings and vehicles in Mariupol on 13 April The embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol could completely fall to Russian forces within days, a European official has told Reuters. The official, who asked not to be named, said they believe that Russia hopes to declare the city ""liberated"" by 9 May, the date when Russia marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. ""We do expect a complete destruction of the city and many civilian casualties in Mariupol,"" they added. The official added they fear the death toll could be worse than Bucha, where Russian troops have been accused of killing hundreds of civilians. Russia denies the claims. Additionally, the official said they believed Russia's medium-term objective was to control Luhansk and Donetsk and secure a land corridor with Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014. Such an operation is likely to take between four and six months to complete, after which the conflict could result in a stalemate, the official added. Joe Biden after landing in New Hampshire on 19 April US President Joe Biden has told reporter the US will send more artillery systems to Ukraine amid a renewed Russian offensive in the east. Since the beginning of the Biden administration began, the US has provided $3.2 billion (Â£2.46bn) in security aid to Ukraine, including $2.6bn since the conflict began on 24 February. ""What we have done here is...exactly what the president would do from the beginning. Which is to [provide] significant security assistance, economic assistance, and support to the Ukrainian people,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. ""And we're going to continue to do exactly that,"" she added. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent A Ukrainian T-64BV battle tank pictured at a plant in February The Czech Republic will repair Ukrainian tanks and armoured personnel carriers damaged in combat, Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova has confirmed. She said the first vehicles would be Ukrainian T-64 tanks, but that others -
including infantry fighting vehicles - would follow. Cernochova
said the Czech Republic was the first country approached by Ukraine with a
request to service and repair combat vehicles. Seznam said the vehicles would also be repaired in Ukraine's neighbour, Slovakia. The Czech
Republic was the first foreign country to supply Ukraine with tanks -
Soviet-era T-72s - as well as BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, belonging to
its active reserves. There are also reports it has supplied self-propelled
artillery as well as multiple launch rocket systems. The defence ministry refuses to specify the amount and type of deliveries to Ukraine,
confirming only that it is sending both light and heavy weapons and will
continue to do so regardless of Russian objections. Alongside the official
government military aid, a crowd-funding campaign to buy weapons for the
Ukrainian armed forces has so far raised over â¬40m (Â£33m). UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK will step up aid to Ukraine and provide artillery systems at a time in which the conflict ""is in a very perilous stage"". Speaking in the House of Commons after a video call with Western allies, Johnson said that it is ""vital that we don't allow Putin to gain momentum"" in the eastern Donbas region. ""That's why we are stepping up our supply of military hardware of the kind that the Ukrainians particularly need now,"" he said, adding that the war has become ""an artillery conflict"". ""That is what we are giving them, in addition to many other forms of support,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

What does the UK's deal mean?,"Home Secretary Priti Patel travelled to Rwandan capital Kigali to sign the deal There was only muted applause from a handful of officials as the politicians shook hands in the Kigali Conference Centre, smiling awkwardly for the cameras. But Home Secretary Priti Patel hailed the Rwandan deal as a world first, a major milestone. And it is. Potentially. Some nations have attempted to outsource their asylum processing offshore. But no country has ever tried to export its asylum responsibilities before. What the deal envisages is an end to the system of protection for those fleeing war and persecution that Britain signed up to more than 70 years ago. Last year 28,526 people crossed the Channel in small boats Instead of claiming asylum when they arrive in Britain, those fleeing persecution or war will have to find a legal and safe route to the UK or, for most, face being packed off to Africa. There are currently very few such routes and none available to the citizens of countries that make up the bulk of those granted refugee status in Britain. What is an asylum seeker form Iraq or Iran, say, supposed to do? They are faced with Catch 22. They can only claim asylum to Britain on British soil. But in reaching the UK, they make themselves inadmissible for asylum. Which other countries send asylum seekers overseas? UK criticised over 'cruel' Rwanda asylum plan Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion For the home secretary and the prime minister, that appears to be the long-term aim: to stop all asylum seekers from coming to Britain. Instead, we are promised a network of safe routes from UN-run refugee camps. As things stand, the UK is a passive recipient of those asking for sanctuary. The government has no control over who the asylum seekers are. The new plan would mean politicians could pick and choose. This video can not be played Watch: Prime Minister outlines Rwanda immigration plans in April ""It's a striking fact that around seven out of 10 of those arriving in small boats last year were men under 40, paying people smugglers to queue jump and taking up our capacity to help genuine women and child refugees,"" was how the prime minister put it. Boris Johnson knew what buttons he was pressing when he said: ""We can't ask the British taxpayer to write a blank cheque to cover the costs of anyone who might want to come and live here."" There is concern the UK is being taken for a ride by people simply seeking a better life. He conflated the thousands of people risking their lives to reach the Kent coast in small boats with ""economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system"". The problem with this argument is that a substantial majority of those who cross the channel are subsequently granted refugee status by the UK government. Home Office officials decide they do indeed have a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of origin. It was noticeable how upbeat the home secretary was as she jetted to Kigali to sign on the dotted line. Priti Patel signed the deal with Rwandan foreign minister Vincent Biruta Priti Patel has faced a great deal of criticism in recent weeks, often from MPs on her own side.  But she sees the Rwandan deal, nine months in the making, as an opportunity to defeat the ""evil people smugglers"" whose activities in the Channel are so humiliating for a government that promised to take back control of Britain's borders. I sense this home secretary relishes the opportunity of a battle against ""the naysayers"", her ""political opponents"" who ""condemn everything"" without a plan of their own, and the asylum ""lawyers who are fleecing the British taxpayer"". That is an argument that would play well with her core support, burnish her Brexit credentials, and helpfully change the conversation from visa delays and ""partygate"". One can see, then, why the UK government would want this deal, but what about the Rwandans? Are they happy about it? We don't know all the details of the arrangement, but there is an initial Â£120m for educational projects and other money to assist with processing sent by the UK. Rwandan ministers believe the arrival of motivated migrants will help boost their economy and the deal itself will encourage further investment. But one wonders what the ordinary Rwandan will think of a rich European country sending its problem to a small African state.

Whatever happened to the Novavax Covid vaccine?,"A first dose of the Novavax vaccine being given in Berlin, Germany on 28 February, 2022 In February, the UK medicines regulator approved the first Covid vaccine based on an older, more established technology. Its developer, Novavax, has pitched it as an alternative for people reluctant to take newer mRNA-based jabs. But while it is now available in much of Europe, Novavax is still not cleared for use in the UK. ""It's been so frustrating - and it's not just me,"" says a woman in her 40s, who did not want to be named. ""There are other people out there who are not anti-vax or anything like that, but are just hesitant to take the new kind of mRNA vaccines."" She caught Covid last year and spent five nights in hospital on oxygen. Last month she travelled from the UK to a vaccine clinic in France to have the Novavax jab. ""I had to blag it a bit,"" she says. ""But the language barrier actually helped because I just looked confused."" She had wanted a vaccine previously, but was unsure about the Pfizer and Moderna jabs which have been rolled out in their tens of millions across the UK. Both have been through formal clinical trials and found to be safe and effective by medicines regulators, while real-world monitoring over the past year suggests serious side effects are extremely rare. But they are based on a newer type of technology which delivers genetic code, known as messenger RNA (mRNA), into the bodies' cells - instructing them to produce copies of the distinctive spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Novavax vaccine was one of the first on the market to work in a more traditional way - the spike protein is grown outside the body in a laboratory and then injected, alongside a separate ingredient which boosts the immune response called an adjuvant. ""Protein-based vaccines like this have quite a long history - from hepatitis to meningococcal B, to HPV,"" says Novavax's chief medical officer Filip Dubovsky. ""I think some people are reassured by the decades of safety profiles which are based on this technology."" Another ""more traditional"" vaccine - produced by the French company Valneva - has just beenapproved by the UK medicines regulator, although the UK government currently has no doses of that jab on order. After months of promises, and a series of delays, the Novavax jab was finally approved for use in adults by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in late December 2021, followed by the British equivalent, the MHRA, on 3 February 2022. In countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands, it was quickly recommended for use - as an alternative to the mRNA vaccines, for people who may have had an allergic reaction to them in the past, or those who are still unvaccinated. But while more than 150,000 doses have now been administered in other parts of Europe, Novavax has still not been recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), who advise ministers in the UK. The JCVI's chair of Covid-19, Professor Wei Shen Lim, says only that the vaccine's potential use remains ""under consideration"" and full advice will be published in ""due course"". One hurdle to overcome is that the UK vaccine programme does not currently allow someone to choose which type of jab they are given. In some other European countries, individuals can call a dedicated phone line to request the Novavax product. All four vaccines used so far in the UK have gone through safety checks as part of the clinical trial and approval process. Most side effects - like a sore arm or headache - are mild, with the risk of a severe reaction extremely low. Covid vaccine safety - What we know How many people have had boosters so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? More than 92% of over-12s in the UK have already received at least one of those Covid jabs - but that still leaves around five million people unvaccinated. Every fortnight, a team from Imperial College London has logged the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. The sample size of each survey is small, at around 70 people, as they are investigating a hard-to-reach minority, but the results are still thought to be representative. The most common reason for remaining unvaccinated is concern about side effects, followed by worries the jabs have not been tested sufficiently. Six per cent also said it was because the specific vaccine they wanted was not yet available in the UK. ""I think [the Novavax vaccine] could make a difference,"" says Dr Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control and former editor of the journal Vaccines in Practice. ""When you think about people in intensive care and the pressure on the NHS, it is the unvaccinated who are making up a disproportionate number of those in hospital with Covid. Even lifting it [vaccination rates] by a few per cent would be worth it."" People wait in separate queues to receive the Novavax and Pfizer vaccines in Berlin, Germany on 28 February 2022 Kenneth, from Bristol, says he has a health condition which makes him cautious about anything that interacts with his immune system; he has been waiting for an alternative to the two main mRNA vaccines. ""I'm making a personal choice based on my own research and my own body,"" he says. He stresses that he is not anti-vaccination. He adds he is still being as careful around other people as he was at the height of lockdown. ""Every single one of our neighbours in the EU - Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands - they all have access to Novavax. The UK is an island in the middle that doesn't."" ""By now, someone in Germany who got their first Novavax vaccine at the end of February could have had their full primary series and be getting on with their life - whereas I'm still waiting around in a sort-of personal lockdown, so that is really frustrating."" Both the Pfizer and Moderna jabs have been tested on a cross-section of the population, including people with a variety of health conditions. Medicine regulators also continue to collect data, so vaccine safety can be monitored and any possible adverse reactions can be investigated. Domestic production The wait to make the Novavax jab available comes after the UK played a significant part in its development: government-funding helped support clinical trials and 15,000 British volunteers participated in the testing. In January 2021,an order for 60 million doseswas placed by UK ministers, with a deal agreed for it to be manufactured at a Fujifilm plant in Billingham, Teesside. At the time, Novavax said production should be up and running by April 2021. But when the vaccine was finally given medical approval in the UK in February 2022, it was on the basis that initial doses would come, not from Teesside, but from the Serum Institute in India. Health Secretary Sajid Javid toured the Fujifilm site in Teesside in February Health Secretary Sajid Javid recently toured the factory in Billingham, which is in the middle of a Â£400m expansion, though it is still unclear if - and when - Novavax jabs made here could make their way into the arms of UK citizens. Novavax itself says it is continuing to work with Fujifilm and plans to update its submission to the UK medicines regulator so that doses produced in Teesside can be used by the NHS. The developer is also in the process of applying to regulators to use the vaccine as a booster shot and in children, where vaccination rates are currently much lower than in adults.

"Unrest in Sweden over planned Quran burningsThere is ongoing unrest over a far-right group which burned a copy of the Quran, and planned to do so again.Europe","Rioting continued on Sunday in NorrkÃ¶ping More than 40 people have been arrested after violent clashes in Sweden between police and people angry at plans by a far-right group to burn copies of the Quran. Three people were injured in Norrkoping on Sunday when officers fired warning shots at rioters, police said. The violence was sparked by a series of rallies organised by the Danish-Swedish politician Rasmus Paludan. He says he has burned a copy of Islam's holy book and wants to do so again. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Saudi Arabia has condemned what it called the ""deliberate abuse of the holy Quran by some extremists in Sweden, and provocation and incitement against Muslims"". Iran and Iraq earlier summoned the Swedish ambassadors to lodge protests. Police broke up crowd of protesters in the RosengÃ¥rd area of Malmo on Saturday Sweden's national police chief, Anders Thornberg, said he had never seen such violent riots following Sunday's clashes in Norrkoping, which is about 160km (99 miles) south-west of Stockholm, and nearby Linkoping. The two cites also witnessed riots on Friday, along with the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby and the western city of Orebro. On Saturday, there was a riot in the southern city of Malmo. On Monday, police said 26 police officers and 14 members of the public had been injured in the violence and that more than 20 vehicles had been damaged or destroyed. They said that around 200 people had been involved in the violence, adding they believed it was organised by networks of criminal gangs. Some of the individuals are already known to police and Sweden's security service, Sapo. Sunday's violence in Norrkoping came after Rasmus Paludan said he planned to hold a rally there. However, he never showed up in the city. In a statement posted by his far-right, anti-immigrant Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, Paludan said he cancelled the rally because Swedish authorities had ""shown that they are completely incapable of protecting themselves and me"". He had earlier appeared on Thursday in the central city of Jonkoping, but as he talked into a megaphone while holding a Quran, his words were drowned out by a priest ringing the bells of a local church in protest. Protests against plans by Stram Kurs to burn the Quran have turned violent in Sweden before. In 2020, protesters set cars on fire and shop fronts were damaged in clashes in MalmÃ¶. Paludan represented Stram Kurs party in the last Danish elections in 2019, where it received 1.8 % of the vote, failing to win a seat. In 2020, he was jailed in Denmark for a month for a string of offences including racism. He plans to stand in Swedish elections in September, but he reportedly does not yet have the necessary number of signatures to secure his candidature.

PM and Charles remember Ukraine in Easter messages,"The prime minister previously met members of the Ukrainian community at the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London Boris Johnson has remembered the war in Ukraine in his Easter message, saying there was ""light beyond the darkness"". He said Jesus' ""message of hope, the triumph of life over death, and good over evil"" would especially resonate with Christians in Ukraine this year. Addressing Ukrainians in their language, he urged them to ""be strong"" and to ""have courage in your heart"". Prince Charles also highlighted the suffering of ""innocent victims of conflict"" in his Easter message. In a video message shared on his Twitter account,external, the prime minister said Easter was a time when the UK ""burst with new life and new hope"". He said it was also a moment to reflect on the meaning of Christ's ""self-sacrifice and resurrection"" for people today as he paid tribute to Christians in the UK ""loving their neighbours and carrying out countless acts of kindness"". Remembering those ""around the world facing fear of persecution"", Mr Johnson said for the Christians of Ukraine - whether they were marking Easter today or its Orthodox equivalent later this month - Christ's message of hope would ""resonate this year perhaps more than any other"". ""Easter tells us that there is light beyond the darkness, that beyond the suffering lies redemption,"" he added. Addressing the Christians of Ukraine in their language,external, Mr Johnson rounded off his message by saying: ""Be strong and have courage in your heart all you who trust in the Lord."" The prime minister's address comes a day after he and other senior ministers werebanned from entering Russia over the UK's ""hostile"" stance on the war in Ukraine. Prince Charles said he was ""heartbroken"" at the suffering of innocent victims of conflict Meanwhile in his Easter message, the Prince of Wales said he was ""heartbroken"" at the plight of those forced to flee their homes due to conflict or persecution but was ""profoundly moved"" by those ready to open their homes to people in need. Russia's invasion ofUkraine has led to millions of people fleeing their homes. In the UK, more than 200,000 people have expressed an interest in housing Ukrainian refugees through the government's Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme - although it has been criticised for being too bureaucratic and slow. Prince Charles said: ""Today, millions of people find themselves displaced, wearied by their journey from troubled places, wounded by the past, fearful of the future - and in need of a welcome, of rest, and of kindness. He added that it had been ""profoundly moving to see how so many people are ready to open their homes to those in need, and how they have offered their time and their resources to help those facing such soul-destroying sorrow and hardship."" The prince said he was ""profoundly moved"" by those ready to open their homes to displaced people The prince doesn't refer to Ukraine by name in his Easter message but there can be no doubt that the unfolding horrors there have inspired him to highlight the plight of refugees. He has often in the past spoken out in support of Christians who've been persecuted in different parts of the world. He's also in recent weeks shown his support for Ukraine by visiting the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London where he lit a candle and expressed his sympathy with members of the Ukrainian community. His Easter message recalls the actions of Jesus at the Last Supper when he knelt before his disciples and washed their ""travel-weary feet"". The principle of looking after and serving one another is particularly relevant, the prince suggests, in the context of millions of people who find themselves displaced and ""wearied by their journey from troubled places"". At Easter, he says, we are reminded of the timeless example of goodness in the face of light and of courage in the face of fear. Special coins were given out to local elderly people during the Royal Maundy Service Prince Charles continued that he ""prayed with all my heart"" the ""darkness of the world"" would be dispelled. ""This Easter, as always, we are reminded of Our Lord's timeless example of goodness in the face of suffering, of courage in the face of fear, of faith in the face of despair,"" he added. ""His light triumphed in that dark time."" Prince Charles also remembered the role his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, played during the many Maundy services he attended. He said it was an ""enormous privilege"" to perform the ceremony of distributing Maundy money to the community when hestepped in for the Queen on Thursday. The prince has previously used his annual Easter message to highlight social issues, includingknife crimeand religious tolerance.

"Next and finance firms buy JoJo Maman BebeThere will be no immediate job losses at the baby goods retailer, although its founder will step down.Business","Baby goods retailer JoJo Maman Bebe is being sold to High Street giant Next and a group of finance firms, the BBC has learned. Next has taken on 44% of the firm's shares, with the other 56% acquired by investment companies managed or advised by hedge fund Davidson Kempner. There will be no immediate job losses at JoJo Maman Bebe. Its founder said she was ""excited by the opportunities this new partnership will offer"". As part of the deal though, Laura Tenison will leave the business that she founded nearly 30 years ago. She added that she was ""exceptionally proud"" of the firm's achievements, having grown the company ""from a kitchen table start-up to being the UK's leading specialist boutique mother and baby brand"". Gwynn Milligan, who joined JoJo Maman Bebe in 2017 as commercial director, has taken over as chief executive. The retailer has 87 brick-and-mortar shops across the UK, which will continue trading. According to its LinkedIn page, it currently employs more than 950 people. JoJo Maman Bebe blames shortages for raising prices Next warns prices to rise by more than expected In an email seen by the BBC, staff were told on Thursday that the deal would ""ensure the longevity of the brand for generations of new customers"". Next will also make a Â£16.3m investment in the brand using its own cash, although the value of JoJo Maman Bebe's sale was not immediately made clear. Next plans to keep the JoJo brand distinct and grow the business globally using its online shopping infrastructure, such as warehousing and software, to support the up-market baby goods retailer's physical shops and online sales. It has not yet been decided whether or not the boutique baby clothes will be sold in Next shops. Last September, JoJo Maman Bebe was forced to hike pricesfor the first time in about five years due to rising costs and supply chain issues. At the time, Ms Milligan said that the company had seen shipping costs quadruple. She added that the company was also having to absorb increased costs on some products, because of competition from retail rivals. In a statement, Simon Wolfson, Next's chief executive, said: ""We are excited to see what can be achieved through the combination of JoJo's exceptional product with Next's infrastructure and Davidson Kempner as our investment partner."" He added that the investment was not expected to have any immediate impact on the High Street giant's profits this financial year, but he expects it ""to make a positive contribution thereafter"".

"Whatever happened to the Novavax Covid vaccine?The jab, seen as an alternative for vaccine-hesitant people, is available in the EU but not in the UK.Health","A first dose of the Novavax vaccine being given in Berlin, Germany on 28 February, 2022 In February, the UK medicines regulator approved the first Covid vaccine based on an older, more established technology.

She had wanted a vaccine previously, but was unsure about the Pfizer and Moderna jabs which have been rolled out in their tens of millions across the UK. Both have been through formal clinical trials and found to be safe and effective by medicines regulators, while real-world monitoring over the past year suggests serious side effects are extremely rare. But they are based on a newer type of technology which delivers genetic code, known as messenger RNA (mRNA), into the bodies' cells - instructing them to produce copies of the distinctive spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Novavax vaccine was one of the first on the market to work in a more traditional way - the spike protein is grown outside the body in a laboratory and then injected, alongside a separate ingredient which boosts the immune response called an adjuvant. ""Protein-based vaccines like this have quite a long history - from hepatitis to meningococcal B, to HPV,"" says Novavax's chief medical officer Filip Dubovsky. ""I think some people are reassured by the decades of safety profiles which are based on this technology."" Another ""more traditional"" vaccine - produced by the French company Valneva - has just beenapproved by the UK medicines regulator, although the UK government currently has no doses of that jab on order. After months of promises, and a series of delays, the Novavax jab was finally approved for use in adults by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in late December 2021, followed by the British equivalent, the MHRA, on 3 February 2022. In countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands, it was quickly recommended for use - as an alternative to the mRNA vaccines, for people who may have had an allergic reaction to them in the past, or those who are still unvaccinated. But while more than 150,000 doses have now been administered in other parts of Europe, Novavax has still not been recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), who advise ministers in the UK. The JCVI's chair of Covid-19, Professor Wei Shen Lim, says only that the vaccine's potential use remains ""under consideration"" and full advice will be published in ""due course"". One hurdle to overcome is that the UK vaccine programme does not currently allow someone to choose which type of jab they are given. In some other European countries, individuals can call a dedicated phone line to request the Novavax product. All four vaccines used so far in the UK have gone through safety checks as part of the clinical trial and approval process. Most side effects - like a sore arm or headache - are mild, with the risk of a severe reaction extremely low. Covid vaccine safety - What we know How many people have had boosters so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? More than 92% of over-12s in the UK have already received at least one of those Covid jabs - but that still leaves around five million people unvaccinated. Every fortnight, a team from Imperial College London has logged the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. The sample size of each survey is small, at around 70 people, as they are investigating a hard-to-reach minority, but the results are still thought to be representative. The most common reason for remaining unvaccinated is concern about side effects, followed by worries the jabs have not been tested sufficiently. Six per cent also said it was because the specific vaccine they wanted was not yet available in the UK. ""I think [the Novavax vaccine] could make a difference,"" says Dr Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control and former editor of the journal Vaccines in Practice. ""When you think about people in intensive care and the pressure on the NHS, it is the unvaccinated who are making up a disproportionate number of those in hospital with Covid. Even lifting it [vaccination rates] by a few per cent would be worth it."" People wait in separate queues to receive the Novavax and Pfizer vaccines in Berlin, Germany on 28 February 2022 Kenneth, from Bristol, says he has a health condition which makes him cautious about anything that interacts with his immune system; he has been waiting for an alternative to the two main mRNA vaccines. ""I'm making a personal choice based on my own research and my own body,"" he says. He stresses that he is not anti-vaccination. He adds he is still being as careful around other people as he was at the height of lockdown. ""Every single one of our neighbours in the EU - Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands - they all have access to Novavax. The UK is an island in the middle that doesn't."" ""By now, someone in Germany who got their first Novavax vaccine at the end of February could have had their full primary series and be getting on with their life - whereas I'm still waiting around in a sort-of personal lockdown, so that is really frustrating."" Both the Pfizer and Moderna jabs have been tested on a cross-section of the population, including people with a variety of health conditions. Medicine regulators also continue to collect data, so vaccine safety can be monitored and any possible adverse reactions can be investigated. Domestic production The wait to make the Novavax jab available comes after the UK played a significant part in its development: government-funding helped support clinical trials and 15,000 British volunteers participated in the testing. In January 2021,an order for 60 million doseswas placed by UK ministers, with a deal agreed for it to be manufactured at a Fujifilm plant in Billingham, Teesside. At the time, Novavax said production should be up and running by April 2021. But when the vaccine was finally given medical approval in the UK in February 2022, it was on the basis that initial doses would come, not from Teesside, but from the Serum Institute in India. Health Secretary Sajid Javid toured the Fujifilm site in Teesside in February Health Secretary Sajid Javid recently toured the factory in Billingham, which is in the middle of a Â£400m expansion, though it is still unclear if - and when - Novavax jabs made here could make their way into the arms of UK citizens. Novavax itself says it is continuing to work with Fujifilm and plans to update its submission to the UK medicines regulator so that doses produced in Teesside can be used by the NHS. The developer is also in the process of applying to regulators to use the vaccine as a booster shot and in children, where vaccination rates are currently much lower than in adults.

Analysis: Rwanda deal does what no country has done before,"Home Secretary Priti Patel travelled to Rwandan capital Kigali to sign the deal There was only muted applause from a handful of officials as the politicians shook hands in the Kigali Conference Centre, smiling awkwardly for the cameras. But Home Secretary Priti Patel hailed the Rwandan deal as a world first, a major milestone. And it is. Potentially. Some nations have attempted to outsource their asylum processing offshore. But no country has ever tried to export its asylum responsibilities before. What the deal envisages is an end to the system of protection for those fleeing war and persecution that Britain signed up to more than 70 years ago. Last year 28,526 people crossed the Channel in small boats Instead of claiming asylum when they arrive in Britain, those fleeing persecution or war will have to find a legal and safe route to the UK or, for most, face being packed off to Africa. There are currently very few such routes and none available to the citizens of countries that make up the bulk of those granted refugee status in Britain. What is an asylum seeker form Iraq or Iran, say, supposed to do? They are faced with Catch 22. They can only claim asylum to Britain on British soil. But in reaching the UK, they make themselves inadmissible for asylum. Which other countries send asylum seekers overseas? UK criticised over 'cruel' Rwanda asylum plan Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion For the home secretary and the prime minister, that appears to be the long-term aim: to stop all asylum seekers from coming to Britain. Instead, we are promised a network of safe routes from UN-run refugee camps. As things stand, the UK is a passive recipient of those asking for sanctuary. The government has no control over who the asylum seekers are. The new plan would mean politicians could pick and choose. This video can not be played Watch: Prime Minister outlines Rwanda immigration plans in April ""It's a striking fact that around seven out of 10 of those arriving in small boats last year were men under 40, paying people smugglers to queue jump and taking up our capacity to help genuine women and child refugees,"" was how the prime minister put it. Boris Johnson knew what buttons he was pressing when he said: ""We can't ask the British taxpayer to write a blank cheque to cover the costs of anyone who might want to come and live here."" There is concern the UK is being taken for a ride by people simply seeking a better life. He conflated the thousands of people risking their lives to reach the Kent coast in small boats with ""economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system"". The problem with this argument is that a substantial majority of those who cross the channel are subsequently granted refugee status by the UK government. Home Office officials decide they do indeed have a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of origin. It was noticeable how upbeat the home secretary was as she jetted to Kigali to sign on the dotted line. Priti Patel signed the deal with Rwandan foreign minister Vincent Biruta Priti Patel has faced a great deal of criticism in recent weeks, often from MPs on her own side.  But she sees the Rwandan deal, nine months in the making, as an opportunity to defeat the ""evil people smugglers"" whose activities in the Channel are so humiliating for a government that promised to take back control of Britain's borders. I sense this home secretary relishes the opportunity of a battle against ""the naysayers"", her ""political opponents"" who ""condemn everything"" without a plan of their own, and the asylum ""lawyers who are fleecing the British taxpayer"". That is an argument that would play well with her core support, burnish her Brexit credentials, and helpfully change the conversation from visa delays and ""partygate"". One can see, then, why the UK government would want this deal, but what about the Rwandans? Are they happy about it? We don't know all the details of the arrangement, but there is an initial Â£120m for educational projects and other money to assist with processing sent by the UK. Rwandan ministers believe the arrival of motivated migrants will help boost their economy and the deal itself will encourage further investment. But one wonders what the ordinary Rwandan will think of a rich European country sending its problem to a small African state.

"PM and Charles remember Ukraine in Easter messagesAddressing Ukrainians in their language, Boris Johnson urged them to ""be strong"".UK","The prime minister previously met members of the Ukrainian community at the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London Boris Johnson has remembered the war in Ukraine in his Easter message, saying there was ""light beyond the darkness"". He said Jesus' ""message of hope, the triumph of life over death, and good over evil"" would especially resonate with Christians in Ukraine this year. Addressing Ukrainians in their language, he urged them to ""be strong"" and to ""have courage in your heart"". Prince Charles also highlighted the suffering of ""innocent victims of conflict"" in his Easter message. In a video message shared on his Twitter account,external, the prime minister said Easter was a time when the UK ""burst with new life and new hope"". He said it was also a moment to reflect on the meaning of Christ's ""self-sacrifice and resurrection"" for people today as he paid tribute to Christians in the UK ""loving their neighbours and carrying out countless acts of kindness"". Remembering those ""around the world facing fear of persecution"", Mr Johnson said for the Christians of Ukraine - whether they were marking Easter today or its Orthodox equivalent later this month - Christ's message of hope would ""resonate this year perhaps more than any other"". ""Easter tells us that there is light beyond the darkness, that beyond the suffering lies redemption,"" he added. Addressing the Christians of Ukraine in their language,external, Mr Johnson rounded off his message by saying: ""Be strong and have courage in your heart all you who trust in the Lord."" The prime minister's address comes a day after he and other senior ministers werebanned from entering Russia over the UK's ""hostile"" stance on the war in Ukraine. Prince Charles said he was ""heartbroken"" at the suffering of innocent victims of conflict Meanwhile in his Easter message, the Prince of Wales said he was ""heartbroken"" at the plight of those forced to flee their homes due to conflict or persecution but was ""profoundly moved"" by those ready to open their homes to people in need. Russia's invasion ofUkraine has led to millions of people fleeing their homes. In the UK, more than 200,000 people have expressed an interest in housing Ukrainian refugees through the government's Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme - although it has been criticised for being too bureaucratic and slow. Prince Charles said: ""Today, millions of people find themselves displaced, wearied by their journey from troubled places, wounded by the past, fearful of the future - and in need of a welcome, of rest, and of kindness. He added that it had been ""profoundly moving to see how so many people are ready to open their homes to those in need, and how they have offered their time and their resources to help those facing such soul-destroying sorrow and hardship."" The prince said he was ""profoundly moved"" by those ready to open their homes to displaced people The prince doesn't refer to Ukraine by name in his Easter message but there can be no doubt that the unfolding horrors there have inspired him to highlight the plight of refugees. He has often in the past spoken out in support of Christians who've been persecuted in different parts of the world. He's also in recent weeks shown his support for Ukraine by visiting the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London where he lit a candle and expressed his sympathy with members of the Ukrainian community. His Easter message recalls the actions of Jesus at the Last Supper when he knelt before his disciples and washed their ""travel-weary feet"". The principle of looking after and serving one another is particularly relevant, the prince suggests, in the context of millions of people who find themselves displaced and ""wearied by their journey from troubled places"". At Easter, he says, we are reminded of the timeless example of goodness in the face of light and of courage in the face of fear. Special coins were given out to local elderly people during the Royal Maundy Service Prince Charles continued that he ""prayed with all my heart"" the ""darkness of the world"" would be dispelled. ""This Easter, as always, we are reminded of Our Lord's timeless example of goodness in the face of suffering, of courage in the face of fear, of faith in the face of despair,"" he added. ""His light triumphed in that dark time."" Prince Charles also remembered the role his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, played during the many Maundy services he attended. He said it was an ""enormous privilege"" to perform the ceremony of distributing Maundy money to the community when hestepped in for the Queen on Thursday. The prince has previously used his annual Easter message to highlight social issues, includingknife crimeand religious tolerance.

"Russia bans Johnson from country over Ukraine warBoris Johnson and other senior ministers are barred for ""whipping up anti-Russian hysteria"".","Russia has banned Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior ministers from entering Russia over the UK's ""hostile"" stance on the war in Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and 10 other senior politicians - mostly members of the Cabinet - have also been barred. Moscow said the decision had been made in retaliation to the UK's sanctions against it since it invaded Ukraine. In March, Moscow imposed a similar ban against US President Joe Biden. The full list is: Prime MinisterBoris Johnson Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss Defence SecretaryBen Wallace Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor, and Secretary of State for JusticeDominic Raab Secretary of State for TransportGrant Shapps Home SecretaryPriti Patel The ChancellorRishi Sunak Minister for Entrepreneurship, Energy and Industrial StrategyKwasi Kwarteng Minister for Digital, Culture, Media and SportNadine Dorries Minister for the Armed ForcesJames Heappey First Minister of ScotlandNicola Sturgeon Attorney General for England and Wales and advocate general for Northern IrelandSuella Braverman Conservative MP and former British Prime MinisterTheresa May In a statement,external, Russia's foreign ministry said: ""London's unbridled information and political campaign aimed at isolating Russia internationally, creating conditions for containing our country and strangling the domestic economy"" were responsible for its decision. It added: ""In essence, the British leadership is deliberately aggravating the situation around Ukraine, pumping the Kyiv regime with lethal weapons and coordinating similar efforts on the part of Nato."" The UK government said it remained ""resolute"" in its support for Ukraine despite the move, adding that it condemned Russia's ""reprehensible actions"" in the country. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also reacted to the sanctions, describing President Putin as ""a war criminal"" and vowing that she would not ""shy away from condemning him and his regime"". Earlier this week, the UK and US governmentsannounced further sanctions on Russia. The sanctions included financial measures designed to damage Russia's economy and penalise Russian President Vladimir Putin, high-ranking officials, and people who have benefited from his regime. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia Nato countries - including the UK and US - are also supplying weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine, although they have ruled out sending in Nato troops or implementing a no-fly zone. On Wednesday, the US said that more sophisticated offensive weaponry would be sent to Ukraine as part of a $800m (Â£612m) package. In response, Moscow on Friday warned the US that there would be ""unpredictable consequences"" if it refused to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Retaliation of this kind was always likely. Russia sees the UK as one of the international actors most intimately involved in efforts to support Ukraine's militarily and isolate Russia economically and politically. Russia's move is unlikely to make a difference to the travel plans of the 13 British politicians. It is unlikely any of them had a trip to Moscow in their diaries. But it speaks to the Kremlin's growing anger at the way the West has responded to its invasion of Ukraine and its willingness to lash out against those who it sees as having played a role in isolating Russia in the past - Theresa May helped to orchestrate the mass expulsion of scores of Russian diplomats from more than 20 Western allies in the wake of Russia's use of a nerve agent in Salisbury in 2018. Russia has warned that further shipments of Western military equipment to Ukraine could result in ""unpredictable consequences"". Banning political leaders is not exactly unexpected. What worries officials in London, Washington and elsewhere is that Russia has the ability, and possibly even the desire, to resort to other military means, including the use of unconventional weapons.

"Beauty chain L'Occitane in U-turn on Russian shopsThe firm says military action in Ukraine means it will shut its shops, having defended staying open.Business","The French cosmetics chain L'Occitane says it will close its Russian shops and website, days after defending its decision to continue trading. The firm said the move follows the ""enormous human suffering and escalating military action in Ukraine"". L'Occitane told the BBC last weekit was keeping its shops open to protect staff from potential ""retaliation"". Some customers had criticised the company for its decision and called for a boycott of the brand. Its products are sold at more than 3,085 retail outlets worldwide and had sales of â¬1.5bn (Â£1.3bn) last year. Last week the firm told the BBC it had discussed closing its Russian stores ""at length"" but said it had not because it wanted to protect staff from potential ""retaliation"". The cosmetics firm, which has spas and stores in Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg, originally said it could not take the ""risk"" of closing its shops. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Chanel restricts sales of goods to Russians abroad But in a statement issued on Friday evening, L'Occitane said the decision to shut its Russian operation had been approved by the company's board of directors. ""Given the enormous human suffering being caused by escalating military action in Ukraine and to protect our employees worldwide from potential public aggression, we have decided to close our own stores and e-commerce websites in Russia,"" the statement said. Hundreds of international brands including L'Oreal and Estee Lauder have already closed shops and ceased online sales in Russia in protest at the war in Ukraine.

Among them are the French energy giant EDF, the UAE's Emirates airline, and China's Lenovo computer brand. Around 600 big firms have pulled out of Russia or suspended sales since it invaded, including Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple. Other international outlets still open in Russia have said they are not able to shut stores due to complex franchise deals preventing them from withdrawing. Burger King and the hotel groups Marriott and Accor are among the firms restricted by these arrangements. On Tuesday, some independent Nike stores were found to be operating in Russia over a week after the sportswear brand said it was temporarily closing all its shops in the country. Professor Vanessa Burbano, from Columbia Business School in the US, said that consistency between claims and actions is important for brands with operations in Russia. ""Customers and employees do pay attention to which companies are first in making these kinds of commitments and which firms don't go as far,"" Prof Burbano said. ""The risk of companies making claims that may not be perceived as consistent with their actions is that they could be seen as a green-washing in the Ukraine context which would be bad for their reputation.""

Prince Charles said: ""Today, millions of people find themselves displaced, wearied by their journey from troubled places, wounded by the past, fearful of the future - and in need of a welcome, of rest, and of kindness. He added that it had been ""profoundly moving to see how so many people are ready to open their homes to those in need, and how they have offered their time and their resources to help those facing such soul-destroying sorrow and hardship."" The prince said he was ""profoundly moved"" by those ready to open their homes to displaced people The prince doesn't refer to Ukraine by name in his Easter message but there can be no doubt that the unfolding horrors there have inspired him to highlight the plight of refugees. He has often in the past spoken out in support of Christians who've been persecuted in different parts of the world. He's also in recent weeks shown his support for Ukraine by visiting the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London where he lit a candle and expressed his sympathy with members of the Ukrainian community. His Easter message recalls the actions of Jesus at the Last Supper when he knelt before his disciples and washed their ""travel-weary feet"". The principle of looking after and serving one another is particularly relevant, the prince suggests, in the context of millions of people who find themselves displaced and ""wearied by their journey from troubled places"". At Easter, he says, we are reminded of the timeless example of goodness in the face of light and of courage in the face of fear. Special coins were given out to local elderly people during the Royal Maundy Service Prince Charles continued that he ""prayed with all my heart"" the ""darkness of the world"" would be dispelled. ""This Easter, as always, we are reminded of Our Lord's timeless example of goodness in the face of suffering, of courage in the face of fear, of faith in the face of despair,"" he added. ""His light triumphed in that dark time."" Prince Charles also remembered the role his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, played during the many Maundy services he attended. He said it was an ""enormous privilege"" to perform the ceremony of distributing Maundy money to the community when hestepped in for the Queen on Thursday.
