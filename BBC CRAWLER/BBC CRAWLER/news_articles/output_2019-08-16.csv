Labour promises to tackle 'retail apocalypse',"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has announced proposals to help Britain's ""struggling"" high streets. He said he wanted to give councils the power to reopen shops in premises left vacant for more than a year. Mr Corbyn also said empty shops should be given to start-up business and community projects in an effort to reverse a ""retail apocalypse"". The government responded: ""Jeremy Corbyn would wreck the economy, meaning more boarded-up shops and fewer jobs."" Mr Corbyn would ""tax small businesses and scare off the investment needed to help our high streets"", local growth minister Jake Berry said. The number of retail units which have been vacant for more than 12 months is currently estimated at 29,000. Large retailers, including Debenhams and House of Fraser, have closed stores across the UK andthe shop vacancy rate is now at its highest level since January 2015. This video can not be played John Healey: Councils should have ""back-up powers"" to manage vacant shops Shadow housing secretary John Healey said Labour wanted councils to be given back-up powers to manage shops that have been vacant for more than a year. He said it was about ""stopping that downward spiral we often see of boarded-up shops and premises in the town centre"". Shops are facing pressure from a variety of sources, including the rise ofonline shoppingand increasing costs. Mr Corbyn, who will be visiting Bolton on Saturday, described his proposals as a ""radical plan"" to turn ""the blight of empty shops into the heart of the high street."" He said: ""Boarded-up shops are a symptom of economic decay under the Conservatives and a sorry symbol of the malign neglect so many communities have suffered. ""Once thriving high streets are becoming ghost streets."" Why we no longer love department stores UK consumer spending growth 'falls to record low' The town battling the High Street blues Andrew Gwynne, Labour's shadow local government secretary, said: ""High street closures are at a historic high, leaving too many of our once thriving towns abandoned and awash with boarded-up shop fronts."" But Mr Berry said the government would ""deliver Brexit by 31 October, so that we can get on with levelling up opportunities across our country and breathe new life into high streets and town centres"". In October 2018,the government announced the creation of the Future High Streets Fund,external- with Â£675m allocated to investing in infrastructure and regeneration.

"'Weâre not for sale,' Greenland tells Trump","Greenland is an autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans Greenland has said it is ""not for sale"" after President Donald Trump stated that he would like the US to buy the world's biggest island. The president is said to have discussed the idea of purchasing Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, during dinners and meetings with advisers. But Greenland's government dismissed the idea, saying: ""We're open for business, not for sale."" Mr Trump's plans have also been quickly dismissed by politicians in Denmark.""It must be an April Fool's Day joke...but totally out of [season]!"",external, tweeted former Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which first reported the news,said Mr Trump had spoken about the purchase with ""varying degrees of seriousness"".,external Sources quoted in other media differed over whether the president was joking or seriously hoping to expand US territory. Officials in Greenland have insisted that the island is not on the market. ""Greenland is rich in valuable resources such as minerals, the purest water and ice, fish stocks, seafood, renewable energy and is a new frontier for adventure tourism. We're open for business, not for sale,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement shared on social media. Greenland Premier Kim Kielsen repeated the comments in a separate statement. ""Greenland is not for sale, but Greenland is open for trade and cooperation with other countries, including the USA,"" he said. Greenland MP Aaja Chemnitz Larsenwas also among those to dismiss the president's interest.,external ""No thanks to Trump buying Greenland!"", she wrote on Twitter, adding that a ""better and more equal partnership with Denmark"" was the way forward. Poul Krarup, editor-in-chief of Greenland's Sermitsiaq newspaper, told the BBC he ""couldn't believe"" Mr Trump's remarks. ""Greenland is an independent area in the Danish kingdom and must be respected as such,"" he said. But he said he thought the chances of Mr Trump's reported ambitions being realised were unlikely. ""We'd like to cooperate with the US, no doubt about that, but we are independent and we decide who our friends are."" Politicians in Denmark have ridiculed the idea of a possible US acquisition. ""If he is truly contemplating this, then this is final proof, that he has gone mad,"" foreign affairs spokesman for the populist Danish People's Party, Soren Espersen, told national broadcaster DR. ""The thought of Denmark selling 50,000 citizens to the United States is completely ridiculous."" ""Out of all things that are not going to happen, this is the most unlikely.Forget it,external,"" Danish Conservative MP Rasmus Jarlov wrote on Twitter. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who took office earlier this year, has not commented on the reports. She is set to visit Greenland this weekend and has said she is ""very much looking forward"" to it. Mr Trump is scheduled to visit Denmark in September but there is no indication that the possible acquisition of Greenland is on the agenda. The WSJ reported that it was ""unclear"" how the US would go about acquiring Greenland if Mr Trump was serious. Greenland is the largest island in the world (after Australia, which is defined as a continent in its own right). It is an autonomous Danish territory, located between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss Greenland: What you need to know 'Why I translate all of Trump's tweets into Chinese' It has a population of about 56,000 people concentrated around the coastline. Almost 90% are indigenous Greenlandic Inuit people. It has a limited self-government and its own parliament. More than 80% of the island is covered by an ice cap which is feared to be melting due to global warming. The ice melt has increased access to the island's mineral resources. But it's also believed that the receding ice may expose toxic nuclear waste that was left at several US military sites during the Cold War. Mr Trump has reportedly taken an interest in Greenland, in part, because of its natural resources, such as coal, zinc, copper and iron ore. But while Greenland might be rich in minerals, it currently relies on Denmark for two thirds of its budget revenue. It has high rates of suicide, alcoholism and unemployment. Reports differ over whether Mr Trump was serious about trying to purchase Greenland Two people briefed on the discussions told the New York Timesthe president was also interested in Greenland's ""national security value"",externalbecause of its location. The US has long seen the island as being strategically important and established an air force and radar base there at the start of the Cold War. Republican Representative Mike Gallagherdescribed Mr Trump's idea as a ""smart geopolitical move"".,external ""The United States has a compelling strategic interest in Greenland, and this should absolutely be on the table,"" he tweeted. Historically, countries have acquired territory not only through military conquest but also financial deals. Under the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the US acquired about 827,000 sq miles (2.1m sq km) of land from France for $15m (Â£12.3m). In 1867, the US reached a deal with Russia to purchase Alaska for $7.2m. The US later purchased the Danish West Indies in 1917 and renamed them the US Virgin Islands. However, Duke University law professor Joseph Blocher told the BBC that the practice ""has basically dried up"". ""I think in part because nations can often get what they want without expanding their sovereign territory, and also because... people can't just be bartered around like chattel anymore,"" said Professor Blocher. ""An outright sale would have to be approved by the United States, Denmark, and the people of Greenland, and the odds of that seem vanishingly small,"" he added. The idea of purchasing Greenland was first mooted during the 1860s under the presidency of Andrew Johnson. In 1867,a report by the US State Department,externalsuggested that Greenland's strategic location, along with its abundance of resources, made it an ideal acquisition. But no official move was made until 1946, when Harry Truman offered Denmark $100m for the territory. He had earlier toyed with the idea of swapping land in Alaska for strategic parts of Greenland, according to AP.

Scottish government nationalises Ferguson shipyard,"An order for CalMac ferries has been at the centre of a dispute The Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow has been nationalised by the Scottish government. Ministers will now operate the yard under a management agreement with administrators, which will see the Scottish government buy the facility if no private buyer is found within four weeks. Ferguson has been involved in a dispute with the Scottish government over the construction of two ferries for CalMac. About 300 people work at the yard. The deal means the yard will no longer be owned by industrialist Jim McColl, who could not persuade ministers to pay more than the Â£97m contract price for the disputed ferries. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay visited the Port Glasgow yard on Friday The agreement also means work on the CalMac ferries, and other contracts, can continue while efforts to find a commercial buyer get under way. Administrator Deloitte described the ferry contract as being ""materially behind schedule and over budget"". The monthly wage bill for workers at the yard will now be met from Scottish government funds. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said:  ""We have always been clear that we want to complete the vessels, secure jobs and give the yard a future. ""Public control will provide much-needed continuity of employment now and ensure the completion of the ferry contracts at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer. ""It is absolutely essential that the outstanding contracts to build these two ferries are completed."" Mr Mackay said the alternative was for the government to ""stand aside"" while the company went into administration, with jobs being lost and the vessels not being completed. ""That was not an outcome I was willing to consider,"" he said. A deal was struck to save the yard in 2014 When Ferguson Shipbuilders went bust in the summer of 2014 it seemed the last shipyard on the lower Clyde was heading for oblivion. But within weeks a deal had been brokered for billionaire tycoon Jim McColl to save the Port Glasgow yard. He was adamant that Scottish shipbuilding could have a bright future. The workforce at Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd, as it became known, rose from about 70 to 350. Early work came in the shape of a Â£97m Scottish government order for two new ferries for CalMac. And that is where it all started to unravel. CMAL, the company that owns and manages ferries and other assets on behalf of the Scottish government, was pushing Ferguson Marine hard to complete the ferries on time and on budget. But Mr McColl was adamant CMAL had made repeated design changes, a claim denied by CMAL, and a bitter dispute ensued with Ferguson Marine last year revealing it expected to lose nearly Â£40m on the ferry deals. The Scottish government has made two loans to Ferguson Marine, totalling Â£45m, and what happens to these, as well as when the ferries will eventually enter service, remains unclear. The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift Mr Mackay added that developing a revised cost analysis to establish the actions required to complete the two CalMac vessels would be one of the first task undertaken by a new management team. As part of the agreement with the administrators, the Scottish government will acquire Ferguson Marine if there is no viable commercial offer within the next four weeks. The GMB union said nationalisation would secure the immediate future of the yard. The union's Scotland organiser Gary Cook said: ""That is a very welcome development, particularly after all the recent uncertainty. ""Our members were caught in the middle of a situation that had nothing to do with them and their relief will be palpable. It is five years since the yard went bust and the Scottish government has prevented that from happening again."" Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Jamie Greene MSP said: ""The SNP Government's decision to barge in and use ministerial powers to take over the yard simply covers up the true extent of how much they have messed up this bungled ferry contract. ""We all want to save the yard, save jobs and see these new ferries completed. ""But Derek Mackay has not explored all of the options available, and he has refused to compromise with the shipbuilders over the disputed costs."" Michael Magnay, restructuring partners at Deloitte, said: ""We are grateful for the support afforded to the business by Scottish ministers at what is undoubtedly a very challenging period for all stakeholders, and in particular its employees. ""With this support we will keep the yard operating whilst we proceed to actively market the business for sale, in order to secure its long term future."" A spokesman for Clyde Blowers Capital (CBC) said: ""The Scottish government have not involved CBC or the directors of Ferguson Marine in any of the discussions leading up to this appointment. ""We are unaware of the deal that the Scottish government have made behind the scenes and, as a result, are unable to provide any further comment at this stage.""

Killers jailed after man died saving his daughter,"Brian Boyle was attacked with a knife and a hammer outside his home Two killers have been jailed for murdering a man who stepped in to save his daughter. Paul McCann, 38, and Mark Moncrieff, 33, attacked Brian Boyle outside his flat in Glasgow's Dennistoun. Mr Boyle, who was 56, had gone out with his daughter Kayleigh after hearing her car being vandalised. After getting between the killers and Kayleigh, who is 23, Mr Boyle was repeatedly struck with a knife and a hammer. Speaking about the attack in July last year, Kayleigh said: ""He saved my life. If he had not jumped in front of me, it would have been me who would have been stabbed."" Kayleigh Boyle said her father died protecting her McCann and Moncrieff were convicted of murder following a three-week trial at the High Court in Glasgow. After they were found guilty, it emerged both had a string of previous convictions. McCann had 36 convictions and had previously been sentenced to five and a half years in jail for assault and robbery. At the time of the murder, he was awaiting sentencing for an offence of threatening and abusive behaviour. Moncrieff's record included 12 convictions, including an attempted murder in 2004. Jailing both for life, judge Lord Boyd said: ""Why Brian Boyle died is beyond me. Perhaps the only explanation was that you were openly engaging in the mindless violence you are used to."" He paid tribute to Kayleigh, saying she showed ""considerable courage"" facing the killers from the witness box. The judge added: ""She had to deal with the horror of seeing her father die in her arms before her."" Moncrieff - who delivered the fatal blow - will serve a minimum sentence of 20 years. McCann will serve at least 18 years. A third person, 22-year-old Domenica Smith, had also faced the murder charge but jurors returned a not proven verdict. She will be sentenced at a later date after being found guilty of two charges of threatening and abusive behaviour, and of assault. Moncrieff gave evidence during the trial - and claimed he had not meant to kill Mr Boyle. He said: ""I did not want the guy to die. I do not want to be standing here."" Giving evidence, Kayleigh Boyle had described the moments after her father was attacked. ""He tried to grab onto a fence, but he did not have the energy,"" she said. ""He just collapsed. ""I tried to stop the bleeding and tried to save him. No-one was able to save him."" She said he had ""come to defend his daughter like any father would"". Ms Boyle added: ""He was an excellent dad and would do anything to defend me.""

Disney's Mulan faces boycott calls,"The hashtag #BoycottMulan began gaining traction on Twitter after Liu Yifei's post Disney's live-action remake of the animated film Mulan is facing calls for a boycott, after its star voiced support for Hong Kong's police force. Chinese actress Liu Yifei, a naturalised US citizen, reposted a viral pro-police comment on Chinese social media platform Weibo. The territory has been convulsed by sometimes violent pro-democracy protests over the past 10 weeks. Rights groups and the UN have accused the police of a heavy handed response. Why are there protests in Hong Kong? Brand 'witch hunt' takes over Chinese internet What is mainland China hearing about Hong Kong? Ms Liu had shared a Weibo post from the government-run Beijing newspaper People's Daily that read (in Chinese): ""I also support Hong Kong police. You can beat me up now."" The post adds in English: ""What a shame for Hong Kong."" The film is a remake of the 1998 animation The quote referred to what are said to be the words of a reporter for the state newspaper Global Times, who was attacked by protesters at Hong Kong's airport earlier this week after being accused of being an undercover police agent. Ms Liu shared the post and echoed the comment by saying: ""I also support Hong Kong police."" How Disney aims to win over China with Mulan She received widespread support on the platform, which is subject to censorship. But on Twitter, which is banned in China, the hashtag #BoycottMulan began gaining traction. Twitter users accused the actress of supporting police brutality, and also pointed to the freedoms she enjoys as an American citizen. Allow Twitter content?

Carrie Symonds makes first speech since No 10 move,"Boris Johnson's partner Carrie Symonds has made her first public speech since moving into Downing Street last month. In a speech at a Birdfair event, Ms Symonds said politicians have a ""gigantic responsibility"" to care for the environment. She also joined a question and answer session with Chris Packham, presenter of BBC Springwatch. The 31-year-old quit her role as a director of communications for the Conservatives last year. The prime minister's girlfriend is now a senior adviser for US environmental campaign group Oceana. What role will Carrie Symonds play in Downing Street? She works with the charity's marketing operation in London and a profile on its website describes her as being ""passionate about protecting the oceans and marine life"". In her speech Ms Symonds said she was a newcomer to bird-watching, having become interested after visiting a puffin colony at Bempton in East Yorkshire. She said she had been alarmed at seeing a picture of a slaughtered bird in a newspaper shortly afterwards, and condemned the trophy hunting of puffins. However, Ms Symonds said she was ""profoundly optimistic"" that the people who care ""far outnumber the people who don't, especially among young people"". She said while she is not ""perfect"", she is ""learning"" and referred to the floral print sustainable dress she wore to the event. The Â£225 garment is reported to be eco-friendly, having been made locally in London from a cotton blend that is biodegradable and which does not contain microplastics or dyes that pollute the environment. More than 24,000 people attended Birdfair last year over three days. Tim Appleton, founder of the annual event for birdwatchers, said it has raised Â£40m for global conservation projects in the 31 years that it has been running. He said: ""We're absolutely over the moon that Carrie is supporting us and we hope she will continue supporting us and conservation for many years to come."" Who is Carrie Johnson?

Should my next car be an electric one?BBC journalist Angie Brown investigates whether she should ditch her 15-year-old petrol car and go electric.,"Angie Brown's 15-year-old petrol-fuelled car has clocked up thousands of miles, but is it time for her to replace it with an electric vehicle? The pure electric car market is growing, but cost, battery life and charging points can put people off. Here, one wannabe electric car owner searches for answers to key questions. After buying my car 15 years ago and accidentally scraping paint from its nose on a multi-storey car park pillar, reversing it into the corner of my house and then driving over a small wall in my garden, it became affectionately know as ""Scratch"". On our muddy adventures over the years to my many ultra-marathons and mountain bike trips ""he"" has become a trusty companion allowing me great freedom to access even the remotest places in Scotland. Sadly though, his backdoor now rattles and disconcerting creaking noises have led me for many years to approach every trip as if it is his last. The thing is, I don't want my next car to be a petrol one. So I've been flirting with the idea of buying an electric vehicle, or as the cool people say, an EV. I desperately want to do more for the environment, to fix our planet, but is an EV a reality for me with the places I want to go to, or is it just too soon to take this carbon-free step into the unknown? To find out more I visited Barry Carruthers, head of innovation, sustainability and quality at Scottish Power to have a test drive in one of their fleet of Nissan Leaf cars. From his office in Glasgow he drove us 20 miles to Scottish Power's Whitelee Wind Farm, which produces much of the green electricity for the car. Then I took the wheel. It was a smooth ride for electric car novice Angie Brown It was an automatic, much to my horror as I've only driven manual cars, but surprisingly within no time I was nipping about with ease - a relief as I've now learned all EVs are automatic. It had surprisingly good acceleration too, for overtaking on the motorway, not the Driving Miss Daisy ride I had thought it would be. Did you know? At present, theUK has a network of more than 24,000 public charging connectors,externalin nearly 9,000 locations, according to figures from the Department for Transport. ""Don't you feel smug?"", Barry asked, and then it hit me I was finally driving guilt-free for the first time in my life. I wasn't polluting the world with carbon fumes and it felt great. ""Yes"", I said and at that moment I didn't want to wait another fume-filled minute, it was time to get rid of ""Scratch"" and buy an electric car. However, to purchase one new would be between Â£31,500 and Â£39,500, which is a hefty financial undertaking even with the UK government's Â£3,500 grant and the Scottish government's interest free loan of up to Â£35,000 over six years. ""You can buy a second-hand one though for about Â£7,000,"" said Barry who has owned a used Renault Zoe for the past two years. But is there any hope the new car cost will come down soon? Analysis by environmental lobby group, European Federation for Transport and Environment (T&E), suggests the number ofelectric car models available to consumers in Europe could triple by 2021. If that does happen then there will be a bigger market, more competition and possibly a better deal for customers. But my problem is ""Scratch"" hasn't got much life left. My test-drive Nissan Leaf had 155 miles on the clock when we set off, but it was a brand new model with just a few road miles. But how good is the battery in a used electric, do they act like a mobile phone battery when it gets old? Barry's answer was: ""When I thought that perhaps the battery range [in his EV] was reducing, a software upgrade from the manufacturer helped increase the range."" That was exciting to hear as this has been one of my biggest worries. Recentresearch suggested only one in four people would consider buying a fully electric carin the next five years. And range, that's the distance the electric car travels between charges, was one of the most limiting factors. Another worry of mine was finding charging points. Were there enough around the country? I discovered thatthere are more than 1,000 charging points now across Scotland,externalincluding rapid charging points, charging cars within 25-40 minutes. The Scottish government says the average distance between any given location to the nearest public charging point is just 2.78 miles.

This video can not be played Angie Brown uses an electric car charging point for the first time He had a special card, costing a one-off Â£20, which he used it to activate the charge point. The lead was then plugged from car to charger and the free fill-up began. Yes, free fuel - I was getting more interested by the second. I thought it wouldn't be good for the car's battery to charge before it was fully discharged but Barry disagreed. He also said there were now many cinemas and supermarkets with charging points so I could top up while I was shopping or watching a film. In an urban environment, the charging picture looks positive. Another positive is there is no car tax. Also I checked out that I could get an electric car MOT done at my local garage. But it does look like any big problems with the battery - the most important part of an electric car - would have to be tackled by the dealership. There are only about 200 moving parts in an electric vehicle Did you know? A combustion engine car has more than 1,000 moving parts while a pure electric vehicle has about 200. Most electric cars have warranties on the battery of about seven or eight years. They are made up of several modules which can be replaced if the battery, for example, stops charging past 70% capacity. However, the battery is too expensive to be replaced entirely. Access to charging points while out and about is one thing, but charging up at home is what I need. Installing a charging point at my house, where I am fortunate to have a driveway, would cost in the region of Â£1,500. That's a big outlay, but I could get grants that bring the price down to a few hundred pounds. After early research and my test drive, I was turning into an ""electric car evangelist"", I thought. I had to be more hard headed so I decided to write down exactly what I needed a car for, including how practical it was to get to remote races and to Glenshee in the winter for skiing. At this point I remembered Barry telling me an EV loses about 25% battery life in freezing cold weather, which would not be good. How do I charge an electric car without a driveway - and more of your questions answered Wireless electric car charging gets cash boost Then I got thinking about what happens if I break down. So I called the AA and a spokesman told me they did attend EVs and all their engineers were trained to work on electric and hybrid cars. I was happy again. The motoring breakdown organisation also said it was developing and trialling an alternative fuels vehicle capable of providing a top-up charge for an electric vehicle or a hydrogen top-up for a fuel cell vehicle. They could also tow EVs to the nearest charging point. The clock is ticking towards the end of petrol and diesel fuelled vehicles I was still in a bit of a quandary so I decided to call The Scotsman's motoring correspondent, Matt Allan, for advice. He said: ""For some an EV is perfectly feasible and they can charge their car overnight at their home. For others between the range and infrastructure they might find it to be a stumbling block. ""I wouldn't discount an EV for my next car as it would serve my commuting needs, but it's when we want to drive for example to my mother-in laws that it suddenly becomes very limiting."" Matt added: ""You can charge them in an ordinary three-point pin socket but it would take a very long time so again that maybe isn't feasible."" Is there a portable charger I could carry in the boot of my car? Matt said: ""There isn't, I'm afraid, as it would be too heavy."" Angie Brown doesn't think ""Scratch"" will be on the road for too much longer I decided to ask a friend why she had sold an electric car only three years after she had bought it in 2014. She said she gave it up because it just wasn't feasible. One, she didn't enjoy sitting in dark remote car parks waiting for her car to charge. Two, the 150-mile range would change on a daily basis, depending on how she drove, so she couldn't be sure of relying on the mileage promised. And three, when she moved to a flat it wasn't practical to roll leads out of a window across the pavement to her car. Did you know? There are 31.5 million cars on the road in Britain, according to the DVLA - and 31 million of them are still petrol or diesel powered. Like all wannabe electric car owners, for me cost and battery life are key. I've concluded that an EV hitting a capacity in the region of 300 miles will be the one I go for. Car manufacturers say they are getting there in terms of range, thanks to the larger 64 kilowatt battery. And a promise of more miles for your charge has created growing waiting lists for next-generation EVs. Take, for example, Hyundai - they told me that since August last year, they had sold 1,500 of their Kona electric and because of the growing demand had a waiting list of 4,000 plus. A spokeswoman at the company said that although the car itself was made by them in South Korea the battery was sourced from elsewhere. She thought that if they started making the batteries themselves then they could more easily fulfil demand for their EVs. While I won't be an electric car pioneer, I want to be an early adopter. But when? Well, for now I'll put my name on the list for one of those bigger battery cars and continue believing I can join the road to an emissions-free future, sooner rather than later. And while I wait, I'm hoping ""Scratch"" will keep on going.

Should my next car be an electric one?,"Angie Brown's 15-year-old petrol-fuelled car has clocked up thousands of miles, but is it time for her to replace it with an electric vehicle? The pure electric car market is growing, but cost, battery life and charging points can put people off. Here, one wannabe electric car owner searches for answers to key questions. After buying my car 15 years ago and accidentally scraping paint from its nose on a multi-storey car park pillar, reversing it into the corner of my house and then driving over a small wall in my garden, it became affectionately know as ""Scratch"". On our muddy adventures over the years to my many ultra-marathons and mountain bike trips ""he"" has become a trusty companion allowing me great freedom to access even the remotest places in Scotland. Sadly though, his backdoor now rattles and disconcerting creaking noises have led me for many years to approach every trip as if it is his last. The thing is, I don't want my next car to be a petrol one. So I've been flirting with the idea of buying an electric vehicle, or as the cool people say, an EV. I desperately want to do more for the environment, to fix our planet, but is an EV a reality for me with the places I want to go to, or is it just too soon to take this carbon-free step into the unknown? To find out more I visited Barry Carruthers, head of innovation, sustainability and quality at Scottish Power to have a test drive in one of their fleet of Nissan Leaf cars. From his office in Glasgow he drove us 20 miles to Scottish Power's Whitelee Wind Farm, which produces much of the green electricity for the car. Then I took the wheel. It was a smooth ride for electric car novice Angie Brown It was an automatic, much to my horror as I've only driven manual cars, but surprisingly within no time I was nipping about with ease - a relief as I've now learned all EVs are automatic. It had surprisingly good acceleration too, for overtaking on the motorway, not the Driving Miss Daisy ride I had thought it would be. Did you know? At present, theUK has a network of more than 24,000 public charging connectors,externalin nearly 9,000 locations, according to figures from the Department for Transport. ""Don't you feel smug?"", Barry asked, and then it hit me I was finally driving guilt-free for the first time in my life. I wasn't polluting the world with carbon fumes and it felt great. ""Yes"", I said and at that moment I didn't want to wait another fume-filled minute, it was time to get rid of ""Scratch"" and buy an electric car. However, to purchase one new would be between Â£31,500 and Â£39,500, which is a hefty financial undertaking even with the UK government's Â£3,500 grant and the Scottish government's interest free loan of up to Â£35,000 over six years. ""You can buy a second-hand one though for about Â£7,000,"" said Barry who has owned a used Renault Zoe for the past two years. But is there any hope the new car cost will come down soon? Analysis by environmental lobby group, European Federation for Transport and Environment (T&E), suggests the number ofelectric car models available to consumers in Europe could triple by 2021. If that does happen then there will be a bigger market, more competition and possibly a better deal for customers. But my problem is ""Scratch"" hasn't got much life left. My test-drive Nissan Leaf had 155 miles on the clock when we set off, but it was a brand new model with just a few road miles. But how good is the battery in a used electric, do they act like a mobile phone battery when it gets old? Barry's answer was: ""When I thought that perhaps the battery range [in his EV] was reducing, a software upgrade from the manufacturer helped increase the range."" That was exciting to hear as this has been one of my biggest worries. Recentresearch suggested only one in four people would consider buying a fully electric carin the next five years. And range, that's the distance the electric car travels between charges, was one of the most limiting factors. Another worry of mine was finding charging points. Were there enough around the country? I discovered thatthere are more than 1,000 charging points now across Scotland,externalincluding rapid charging points, charging cars within 25-40 minutes. The Scottish government says the average distance between any given location to the nearest public charging point is just 2.78 miles. Barry showed me the electric car's in-built sat nav to find us a charging point only a few miles away and how easy it was to use.

Universities criticised for offering money for places,"Universities have been offering cash rewards to persuade uncertain students to join their courses. Scholarships of up to Â£4,500 have been offered to students going through clearing. But the approach has been criticised for having a negative effect on students' long-term futures. ""There's no point if after a few months you say 'You know what, this isn't me, why did I do this?'"" Sinead Tohill, 21, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Despite record numbers of applicants,fewer studentswere placed on courses as the results were released on Thursday. Westminster University has been offering up to 40clearing scholarships,externalworth Â£4,500 each over three years of study. Bedfordshire University'sclearing offer,externalincludes Â£1,500 bursaries for all UK and EU students - which goes up to Â£2,400 for those with grades of B,B,C. Roehampton University hasoffered scholarships,externalof up to Â£3,000 for academic excellence and Â£1,500 per year for sports and e-sports. Although the university points out that the scholarships would be available at other times of the year. And these are just some of the institutions offering rewards. Allow Twitter content?

This is a ""life-transforming decision"" and students should ""not be swayed by any short-term perks"", says Nicola Dandridge, Chief Executive of the Office for Students. Instead, they should ""take time, take advice, and think through what the longer term interests are"". A University of Westminster spokesman said its scholarships recognise the ""rising cost of living in London as a barrier to many of our brightest students from lower socio-economic backgrounds"". ""At Westminster we believe education should be attainable for all, regardless of background and so we have made up to 40 merit-based scholarships available."" Aberystwyth University offers a broad range of scholarships including Entrance Scholarships and the Academic Excellence Scholarships which are awarded to applicants who achieve 3 grade As or A levels equivalent. A statement from the uni said: ""As more and more prospective students apply for university outside the main UCAS timetable, a number of Academic Excellence Scholarships that have been on offer to students throughout the year, have been held back so that high achieving applicants who chose to study at Aberystwyth are not disadvantaged financially in any way. ""Aberystwyth University has for many years guaranteed accommodation for first year students so they have the best possible start to university life."" Clearing takes place when students do not get the results they expected ""It's your career at the end of the day,"" says Sinead, who will be studying communications and media with Spanish at the University of Liverpool. She finally got into university at her third attempt - and she avoided clearing - choosing to retake her A-levels instead. ""If the course is relevant to you, then of course it's great that there would be discount on it. ""But I wouldn't recommend jumping into any course because it's still a lot of debt regardless."" Sinead says students should not be guided by incentives Sinead says she ""always wanted to do"" media and Spanish. ""Many universities have options for media so when I looked at the courses that didn't have Spanish, I was tempted."" But she says no ""incentive"" would have made her do media without Spanish. ""This could affect their lives,"" says Nicola Dandridge from the Office for Students. ""So it's really important they look at the broader qualifications and the sorts of learning they're going to get."" Sinead says you're ""better off taking the year out and considering 'Is this course going to lead me to where I want to go, is it going to take me to the career I want?'""

Cathay Pacific boss resigns after protest row,"Rupert Hogg had been chief executive of Cathay Pacific for three years The chief executive of Hong Kong flag-carrier Cathay Pacific has quit after the airline became embroiled in the controversy over protests there. Rupert Hogg said he was taking responsibility as these had been ""challenging weeks"" for the airline. Some of its employees took part in the protest, but China's aviation regulator ordered the airline to suspend staff who did so. Cathay's chairman, John Slosar, said it was time to put ""a new management team in place who can reset confidence"". Paul Loo is also leaving as chief customer and commercial officer. Mr Hogg said: ""These have been challenging weeks for the airline and it is right that Paul and I take responsibility as leaders of the company."" Last week, Cathay Pacific had told its staff it would not stop them joining the pro-democracy demonstrations currently sweeping Hong Kong. But on Monday, Mr Hoggwarned staff they could be fired if they ""support or participate in illegal protests"". Cathay faced pressure online after China's state-run press fuelled a #BoycottCathayPacific hashtag, which trended on Chinese social media. Beijing's aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), required Cathay to submit lists of staff working on flights going to the mainland or through its airspace. It also had to submit a report on planned measures to ""strengthen internal control and improve flight safety and security"". Cathay Pacific said that Mr Hogg had been replaced by Tang Kin Wing Augustus and Mr Loo by Ronald Lam. The airline is currently majority-owned by the Swire investment company, while Air China has a 30% stake. Qatar Airways also owns a stake. Cathay's new chief executive Mr Tang was the head of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company, which is also owned by Swire. Mr Lam was head of Cathay's low-cost service Hong Kong Express. Mr Slosar said that while Mr Hogg and his team had carried out a three-year turnaround plan, ""recent events have called into question Cathay Pacific's commitment to flight safety and security and put our reputation and brand under pressure"". ""This is regrettable as we have always made safety and security our highest priority,"" he said. The new bosses ""have the experience and depth of knowledge of aviation and our people to be strong and effective leaders of Cathay Pacific at this sensitive time"", he added. Why Cathay Pacific changed its tune on Hong Kong protests Why are there protests in Hong Kong? Meanwhile, Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, has taken out a series of full-page newspaper ads in an attempt to calm rising tension within the territory, urging people to ""love China, love Hong Kong and love yourself"". But the Chinese star of the upcoming Disney live-action remake of Mulan has expressed support for Hong Kong police in the wake of the pro-democracy protests. In a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, actress Liu Yifei wrote: ""I support Hong Kong police. You can attack me now,"" adding in English: ""What a shame for Hong Kong."" Hong Kong's airport has been a target for anti-government protestors Hong Kong International Airport has been closed at times this week in the wake of the massive anti-government protests that have paralysed one of Asia's key transport hubs. The airport is one of the world's busiest, and the Airport Authority has obtained a temporary injunction banning protesters from entering certain areas. The protests began over plans that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China, but they have broadened into a pro-democracy movement concerned about China's growing influence in the city. Mr Slosar said Cathay was ""fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of 'one country, two systems' as enshrined in the basic law"". This is a reference to the fact that despite being part of China, Hong Kong receives ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"". ""We are confident that Hong Kong will have a great future,"" he added. Mr Hogg was born in Portsmouth, has a degree from Edinburgh University, and joined John Swire & Sons - part of the Swire conglomerate of businesses - in 1986. He has worked in Sydney, Hong Kong and South East Asia.

Youth climate strikers allowed one school day off,"Youth climate strikers are to be given permission to take part in protests for one authorised school day per year. However, Edinburgh councillors say no punishment will be levelled at pupils or parents if they choose to strike over a longer period. The city council's education, children and families committee approvedÂ a motion by the SNP-Labour coalition to limit authorised absences to one day. This was despite a plea from activists to back the pupils' action. It follows two emergency motions by Green councillors earlier this year where pupils were allowed to attend climate emergency demonstrations with parental permission on a one-off basis. However, officials warned that ""potential for adverse risk to children who are absent and unsupervised is high and runs counter to child protection and raising attainment."" A report said ""almost all head teachers were not in support of children's absence being authorised"" by councillors as it had ""devalued the hard work they had undertaken in working with parents who did not value good attendance at school"". Sandy Boyd, a youth climate activist from Trinity Academy, said the decision was ""morally wrong"". He added: ""The youth climate strike movement has brought change across the world. ""It will stop this progress dead in its tracks. You are trying to suppress young people's opinions on matters that will affect young people. ""We are imploringÂ this council to allow us authorised absence to pressure governments - finally, we are seeing some action. ""The educational value of taking part in these events is massive. It's building a society that we want to see. We will keep doing them until we see change."" However, councilÂ officers highlighted the importance of ensuring that pupils attended lessons. Protestors gathered outside the Scottish Parliament during a strike earlier this year Lorna Sweeney, the council's schools and lifelong learning senior manager, said: ""Fundamentally, we have to make sure the children attend. ""If we give conflicting information to parents it make the whole purpose of education very difficult. ""The principle purpose of schools is to raise attainment. The single biggest factor is attendance."" Andy Gray, head of schools and lifelong learning, said if pupils took part in strike action with parental permission, there would be no financial penalty. He added: ""We are not going to punish children for this activity but what we are saying is that it's definitelyÂ an unauthorised absence."" Councillors voted to limit the authorised strike action to one day.

Legal action over breast implant cancer link,"Linzy developed a rare lymphoma 13 years after breast implant surgery Twenty UK women are taking legal action after developing a rare form of cancer linked to their breast implants. More than 50 women have been diagnosed with the same condition in the UK, and hundreds more worldwide. A top surgeon said there were gaps in implant information and people were almost being ""used as guinea pigs"". One manufacturer has issued a worldwide recall of some textured implants, which have beenlinked to most cases of breast implant-associated lymphoma.,external The MHRA, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which regulates medical devices in the UK, is currently collecting data on women affected bybreast implant associated-anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL),external. It has assessed the risk to be one in every 24,000 implants sold (looking at both textured and other types of breast implant). Tens of thousands of breast implant surgeries are thought to take place each year in the UK, mostly in private clinics. Linzy Bromfield, 50, is one of the women who is taking legal action - in her case against the manufacturer. She paid privately for breast augmentation in 2005 after having two children, and went from a B to a D cup bra size. Linzy was very satisfied with her implants but, 13 years later in 2016, she noticed her right breast had become so swollen she was unable to wear her bra. She had fluid drained from the breast in an NHS hospital and was later diagnosed with implant-associated lymphoma. ""I cried, really cried. I was angry and hurt. I couldn't really take it in at first. I was worried I was going to die. ""I think when you hear that word 'cancer' you think, am I going to die?"" Linzy had both of her implants removed and has been free of disease since. However, other women have needed further treatment, including chemotherapy. It is a cancer of the immune system, not a type of breast cancer, and it's a rare sub-type of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mr Nigel Mercer, a plastic surgeon and chair of an advisory group of surgeons monitoring cases of the cancer for the MHRA, said: ""The same type of implant has been around for 30 years but we only started seeing this as a disease recently, so it looks like it's a genuinely new disease."" Typically, the cancer cells are found near the scar tissue and fluid near the implant but, in rare cases, they can spread. Scientists believe the lymphoma could be a reaction to the textured surface of the implant If caught early, the lymphoma can be cured by removing the implant and the capsule surrounding it. Cases have occurred between three and 14 years after surgery. Doctors are not sure how BIA-ALCL is caused - but scientists believe it could be a reaction to the textured surface of the implant or a bacterial infection. Linzy's surgeon, Prof James Frame, who works in Chelmsford, Essex, says he was shocked by her case, which is the only one he has seen in the 30,000 or more breast surgeries he has performed. He says there is not enough information available to surgeons about the potential risks associated with different breast implants. ""There needs to be a more robust information package to those delivering the service. [UK research around this] is dreadful,"" he said. Prof Frame was Linzy's surgeon Prof Frame believes insurance packages could be made available to patients opting for private surgery to ensure they receive ongoing care. Mr Mercer says there are many unknowns when it comes to breast implants and doctors have a moral duty to tell that to patients. He said women in the UK were not ""appropriately warned that breast implants are not for life, necessarily"". ""There are unknowns with any implant, but it does mean we are using our entire population as human guinea pigs, almost."" Mr Mercer and Prof Frame are both calling for international collaboration between worldwide clinicians to share breast implant data. The MHRA issued a joint statement with several of the UK's leading surgeons' associations in July. It said it is ""essential"" that surgeons make all patients considering a breast implant for reconstructive or cosmetic purposes fully aware of the potential risks. The organisation also says breast implants undergo a rigorous risk-based approval process before they can be used by the wider population. Women who have textured implants may not need to have them removed, but they should consult their clinician if they have any concerns or symptoms. Removing implants unnecessarily can carry a risk of further surgical complications. When Linzy had her implants fitted in 2005, BIA-ALCL was not widely known about and neither surgeons nor patients had been made aware of the risks. Linzy says she may well have gone ahead with the surgery anyway, but thinks some women may be put off in the future. The women are taking legal action against surgeons and manufacturers. They want recovery for the costs of the implants and their removal, and compensation for personal injury, distress and any potential financial loss they suffered. Letters Before Action are being sent to relevant parties this month. Their lawyer Zahra Nanji, from Leigh Day, says: ""I really do believe strongly that the manufacturers, producers and distributors of these implants need to take responsibility."" Manufacturer Allergan said patient safety was a priority and it would support informative labelling ""to promote and advance the safest use of breast implant products"". ""We continue to invest in and support work to further understanding and increasing awareness of BIA-ALCL,"" the company said. It has issued a voluntary worldwide recall of Biocell saline-filled and silicone-filled textured breast implants and tissue expanders.

Univeristies criticised for offering money for places,"Universities have been offering cash rewards to persuade uncertain students to join their courses. Scholarships of up to Â£4,500 have been offered to students going through clearing. But the approach has been criticised for having a negative effect on students' long-term futures. ""There's no point if after a few months you say 'You know what, this isn't me, why did I do this?'"" Sinead Tohill, 21, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Despite record numbers of applicants,fewer studentswere placed on courses as the results were released on Thursday. Westminster University has been offering up to 40clearing scholarships,externalworth Â£4,500 each over three years of study. Bedfordshire University'sclearing offer,externalincludes Â£1,500 bursaries for all UK and EU students - which goes up to Â£2,400 for those with grades of B,B,C. Roehampton University hasoffered scholarships,externalof up to Â£3,000 for academic excellence and Â£1,500 per year for sports and e-sports. Although the university points out that the scholarships would be available at other times of the year. And these are just some of the institutions offering rewards. Allow Twitter content?

This is a ""life-transforming decision"" and students should ""not be swayed by any short-term perks"", says Nicola Dandridge, Chief Executive of the Office for Students. Instead, they should ""take time, take advice, and think through what the longer term interests are"". A University of Westminster spokesman said its scholarships recognise the ""rising cost of living in London as a barrier to many of our brightest students from lower socio-economic backgrounds"". ""At Westminster we believe education should be attainable for all, regardless of background and so we have made up to 40 merit-based scholarships available."" Aberystwyth University offers a broad range of scholarships including Entrance Scholarships and the Academic Excellence Scholarships which are awarded to applicants who achieve 3 grade As or A levels equivalent. A statement from the uni said: ""As more and more prospective students apply for university outside the main UCAS timetable, a number of Academic Excellence Scholarships that have been on offer to students throughout the year, have been held back so that high achieving applicants who chose to study at Aberystwyth are not disadvantaged financially in any way. ""Aberystwyth University has for many years guaranteed accommodation for first year students so they have the best possible start to university life."" Clearing takes place when students do not get the results they expected ""It's your career at the end of the day,"" says Sinead, who will be studying communications and media with Spanish at the University of Liverpool. She finally got into university at her third attempt - and she avoided clearing - choosing to retake her A-levels instead. ""If the course is relevant to you, then of course it's great that there would be discount on it. ""But I wouldn't recommend jumping into any course because it's still a lot of debt regardless."" Sinead says students should not be guided by incentives Sinead says she ""always wanted to do"" media and Spanish. ""Many universities have options for media so when I looked at the courses that didn't have Spanish, I was tempted."" But she says no ""incentive"" would have made her do media without Spanish. ""This could affect their lives,"" says Nicola Dandridge from the Office for Students. ""So it's really important they look at the broader qualifications and the sorts of learning they're going to get."" Sinead says you're ""better off taking the year out and considering 'Is this course going to lead me to where I want to go, is it going to take me to the career I want?'"" Clearing scholarships are seen as important by some in getting people into university. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Turkish army pension fund to buy British Steel,"Turkey's military pension fund has reached a tentative deal to buy British Steel out of insolvency. The Turkish Armed Forces Assistance Fund (known as Oyak) says it plans to take over British Steel, which employs 5,000 people, by the end of the year. British Steel owns the Scunthorpe steel works where 3,000 people work and it employs another 800 on Teesside. But the firm was put into compulsory liquidation in May after rescue talks with the government broke down. Another 20,000 jobs in the supply chain were put at risk by the collapse of the talks between the government and British Steel's owner, Greybull, prompting aparliamentary inquiry. The company was transferred to the Official Receiver because British Steel, its shareholders and the government were not able to, or would not, support the business. British Steel employs 3,000 people at its plant in Scunthorpe The news was welcomed by trade association UK Steel. ""British Steel's production facilities in Scunthorpe and elsewhere in the North East represent one third of the UK's steel production and are a major strategic asset to our country,"" the body's general secretary, Gareth Stace, said. ""Their loss would leave our manufacturing, construction and infrastructure capability in a considerably poorer state."" But he called on the government to partner with the steel industry ""to help deliver a level playing field"" by subsidising energy prices and lowering business rates. The Business Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, described the news as an ""important step"" to secure the future of British Steel. ""The UK has a long and proud history of steel manufacturing and I am committed to a modern and sustainable future for the industry,"" she said. But Ross Murdoch from the GMB union said: ""Our members are staring redundancy in the face as uncertainty continues to hang over the company. ""This dedicated and loyal workforce must not be an afterthought amidst all of the speculation,"" he said, adding that they were put in the position ""through no fault of their own"". Steelworkers' union Community said the deal was ""hugely encouraging"" and an ""important milestone"". ""As we have said from the outset, we believe the business must be kept together and the future of steelmaking at Scunthorpe secured,"" said the union's general secretary, Roy Rickhuss. ""We will want to be assured that Ataer has a long-term strategy to invest in the assets and develop the business going forward."" The Official Receiver said it had received ""several"" bids for the firm, but described Ataer, Oyak's investment arm, as its ""preferred buyer"". Ataer's accountants have exclusive rights to the insolvent firm's books, so that they can examine the state of its finances. ""Following discussions with a number of potential purchasers for the British Steel group over the past few weeks, I am pleased to say I have now received an acceptable offer from Ataer,"" the Official Receiver said, adding that the focus was now on finalising the sale. ""I will be looking to conclude this process in the coming weeks, during which time British Steel continues to trade and supply its customers as normal."" Ataer owns nearly 50% of Erdemir, Turkey's biggest steel producer, which employs 11,530 people. Together, Ataer-owned companies make about a quarter of Turkey's steel, making it the third-largest producer in Europe, according to the firm's site.

New arrest in screwdriver stab death inquiry,"Peter Duncan died in hospital after being attacked An eighth teenager has been arrested by police after a lawyer was stabbed to death with a screwdriver in Newcastle city centre. Peter Duncan was attacked after what police said was a chance ""coming together"" with a group of youths near Old Eldon Square on Wednesday evening. A 15-year-old boy was arrested on Friday, Northumbria Police said. Four of seven boys previously arrested on suspicion of murder have been released with no further action. Northumbria Police said two boys aged 15 and two aged 17 had been released without charge and a 14-year-old boy had been released while investigations continue. Two 17-year-olds and the 15-year-old arrested on Friday remain in custody. Northumbria Police believes Mr Duncan, 52, from Newcastle, was attacked after a ""chance encounter"" outside a branch of Greggs. A cordon was put in place in Eldon Square He was described by his family as a ""devoted father and husband"". According to his profile on LinkedIn, Mr Duncan trained as an electrical engineer before graduating from Northumbria University with a law degree in 2003. He was working as legal counsel in the Newcastle office of Royal IHC Limited, and previously as a solicitor and legal advisor with companies in the North East. Darlington-based offshore maintenance firm Deep Ocean, where Mr Duncan worked for eight years, said staff were ""devastated"" at the news of his death. A spokesman said: ""Peter was an excellent lawyer, we will remember his professionalism and his ability to see beyond the legal issues to identify what was in the best interests of the business, our clients and his colleagues. ""Having worked with him, we also know that he was a true family man who was devoted to his wife and sons. ""We cannot therefore comprehend how they must feel and our thoughts are with each of them at this most difficult of times."" Flower tributes have been left near the scene Northumbria Police Area Commander, Ch Supt Ged Noble, said: ""Searches have been conducted across the city and at a number of addresses in Newcastle."" Leader of Newcastle City Council, Nick Forbes, said: ""This tragic incident is hard to understand in a city like ours, but I hope Peter Duncan's family find some comfort in knowing Newcastle stands with them at this incredibly sad time. ""Across our city people have spoken of their shock and sadness at what happened to Peter and the loss his family and friends and work colleagues are dealing with.""

Could Donald Trump actually buy Greenland?,"Greenland is an autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans Greenland has said it is ""not for sale"" after President Donald Trump stated that he would like the US to buy the world's biggest island. The president is said to have discussed the idea of purchasing Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, during dinners and meetings with advisers. But Greenland's government dismissed the idea, saying: ""We're open for business, not for sale."" Mr Trump's plans have also been quickly dismissed by politicians in Denmark.""It must be an April Fool's Day joke...but totally out of [season]!"",external, tweeted former Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which first reported the news,said Mr Trump had spoken about the purchase with ""varying degrees of seriousness"".,external Sources quoted in other media differed over whether the president was joking or seriously hoping to expand US territory. Officials in Greenland have insisted that the island is not on the market. ""Greenland is rich in valuable resources such as minerals, the purest water and ice, fish stocks, seafood, renewable energy and is a new frontier for adventure tourism. We're open for business, not for sale,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement shared on social media. Greenland Premier Kim Kielsen repeated the comments in a separate statement. ""Greenland is not for sale, but Greenland is open for trade and cooperation with other countries, including the USA,"" he said. Greenland MP Aaja Chemnitz Larsenwas also among those to dismiss the president's interest.,external ""No thanks to Trump buying Greenland!"", she wrote on Twitter, adding that a ""better and more equal partnership with Denmark"" was the way forward. Poul Krarup, editor-in-chief of Greenland's Sermitsiaq newspaper, told the BBC he ""couldn't believe"" Mr Trump's remarks. ""Greenland is an independent area in the Danish kingdom and must be respected as such,"" he said. But he said he thought the chances of Mr Trump's reported ambitions being realised were unlikely. ""We'd like to cooperate with the US, no doubt about that, but we are independent and we decide who our friends are."" Politicians in Denmark have ridiculed the idea of a possible US acquisition. ""If he is truly contemplating this, then this is final proof, that he has gone mad,"" foreign affairs spokesman for the populist Danish People's Party, Soren Espersen, told national broadcaster DR. ""The thought of Denmark selling 50,000 citizens to the United States is completely ridiculous."" ""Out of all things that are not going to happen, this is the most unlikely.Forget it,external,"" Danish Conservative MP Rasmus Jarlov wrote on Twitter. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who took office earlier this year, has not commented on the reports. She is set to visit Greenland this weekend and has said she is ""very much looking forward"" to it. Mr Trump is scheduled to visit Denmark in September but there is no indication that the possible acquisition of Greenland is on the agenda. The WSJ reported that it was ""unclear"" how the US would go about acquiring Greenland if Mr Trump was serious. Greenland is the largest island in the world (after Australia, which is defined as a continent in its own right). It is an autonomous Danish territory, located between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss Greenland: What you need to know 'Why I translate all of Trump's tweets into Chinese' It has a population of about 56,000 people concentrated around the coastline. Almost 90% are indigenous Greenlandic Inuit people. It has a limited self-government and its own parliament. More than 80% of the island is covered by an ice cap which is feared to be melting due to global warming. The ice melt has increased access to the island's mineral resources. But it's also believed that the receding ice may expose toxic nuclear waste that was left at several US military sites during the Cold War. Mr Trump has reportedly taken an interest in Greenland, in part, because of its natural resources, such as coal, zinc, copper and iron ore. But while Greenland might be rich in minerals, it currently relies on Denmark for two thirds of its budget revenue. It has high rates of suicide, alcoholism and unemployment. Reports differ over whether Mr Trump was serious about trying to purchase Greenland Two people briefed on the discussions told the New York Timesthe president was also interested in Greenland's ""national security value"",externalbecause of its location. The US has long seen the island as being strategically important and established an air force and radar base there at the start of the Cold War. Republican Representative Mike Gallagherdescribed Mr Trump's idea as a ""smart geopolitical move"".,external ""The United States has a compelling strategic interest in Greenland, and this should absolutely be on the table,"" he tweeted. Historically, countries have acquired territory not only through military conquest but also financial deals. Under the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the US acquired about 827,000 sq miles (2.1m sq km) of land from France for $15m (Â£12.3m). In 1867, the US reached a deal with Russia to purchase Alaska for $7.2m. The US later purchased the Danish West Indies in 1917 and renamed them the US Virgin Islands. However, Duke University law professor Joseph Blocher told the BBC that the practice ""has basically dried up"". ""I think in part because nations can often get what they want without expanding their sovereign territory, and also because... people can't just be bartered around like chattel anymore,"" said Professor Blocher. ""An outright sale would have to be approved by the United States, Denmark, and the people of Greenland, and the odds of that seem vanishingly small,"" he added. The idea of purchasing Greenland was first mooted during the 1860s under the presidency of Andrew Johnson. In 1867,a report by the US State Department,externalsuggested that Greenland's strategic location, along with its abundance of resources, made it an ideal acquisition. But no official move was made until 1946, when Harry Truman offered Denmark $100m for the territory. He had earlier toyed with the idea of swapping land in Alaska for strategic parts of Greenland, according to AP.

Legal action over breast implant cancer linkTwenty UK women are taking legal action over a rare type of breast implant-related cancer.Health,"Linzy developed a rare lymphoma 13 years after breast implant surgery Twenty UK women are taking legal action after developing a rare form of cancer linked to their breast implants. More than 50 women have been diagnosed with the same condition in the UK, and hundreds more worldwide. A top surgeon said there were gaps in implant information and people were almost being ""used as guinea pigs"". One manufacturer has issued a worldwide recall of some textured implants, which have beenlinked to most cases of breast implant-associated lymphoma.,external The MHRA, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which regulates medical devices in the UK, is currently collecting data on women affected bybreast implant associated-anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL),external. It has assessed the risk to be one in every 24,000 implants sold (looking at both textured and other types of breast implant). Tens of thousands of breast implant surgeries are thought to take place each year in the UK, mostly in private clinics. Linzy Bromfield, 50, is one of the women who is taking legal action - in her case against the manufacturer. She paid privately for breast augmentation in 2005 after having two children, and went from a B to a D cup bra size. Linzy was very satisfied with her implants but, 13 years later in 2016, she noticed her right breast had become so swollen she was unable to wear her bra. She had fluid drained from the breast in an NHS hospital and was later diagnosed with implant-associated lymphoma. ""I cried, really cried. I was angry and hurt. I couldn't really take it in at first. I was worried I was going to die. ""I think when you hear that word 'cancer' you think, am I going to die?"" Linzy had both of her implants removed and has been free of disease since. However, other women have needed further treatment, including chemotherapy. It is a cancer of the immune system, not a type of breast cancer, and it's a rare sub-type of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mr Nigel Mercer, a plastic surgeon and chair of an advisory group of surgeons monitoring cases of the cancer for the MHRA, said: ""The same type of implant has been around for 30 years but we only started seeing this as a disease recently, so it looks like it's a genuinely new disease."" Typically, the cancer cells are found near the scar tissue and fluid near the implant but, in rare cases, they can spread. Scientists believe the lymphoma could be a reaction to the textured surface of the implant If caught early, the lymphoma can be cured by removing the implant and the capsule surrounding it. Cases have occurred between three and 14 years after surgery. Doctors are not sure how BIA-ALCL is caused - but scientists believe it could be a reaction to the textured surface of the implant or a bacterial infection. Linzy's surgeon, Prof James Frame, who works in Chelmsford, Essex, says he was shocked by her case, which is the only one he has seen in the 30,000 or more breast surgeries he has performed. He says there is not enough information available to surgeons about the potential risks associated with different breast implants. ""There needs to be a more robust information package to those delivering the service. [UK research around this] is dreadful,"" he said. Prof Frame was Linzy's surgeon Prof Frame believes insurance packages could be made available to patients opting for private surgery to ensure they receive ongoing care. Mr Mercer says there are many unknowns when it comes to breast implants and doctors have a moral duty to tell that to patients. He said women in the UK were not ""appropriately warned that breast implants are not for life, necessarily"". ""There are unknowns with any implant, but it does mean we are using our entire population as human guinea pigs, almost."" Mr Mercer and Prof Frame are both calling for international collaboration between worldwide clinicians to share breast implant data. The MHRA issued a joint statement with several of the UK's leading surgeons' associations in July. It said it is ""essential"" that surgeons make all patients considering a breast implant for reconstructive or cosmetic purposes fully aware of the potential risks. The organisation also says breast implants undergo a rigorous risk-based approval process before they can be used by the wider population. Women who have textured implants may not need to have them removed, but they should consult their clinician if they have any concerns or symptoms. Removing implants unnecessarily can carry a risk of further surgical complications. When Linzy had her implants fitted in 2005, BIA-ALCL was not widely known about and neither surgeons nor patients had been made aware of the risks. Linzy says she may well have gone ahead with the surgery anyway, but thinks some women may be put off in the future. The women are taking legal action against surgeons and manufacturers. They want recovery for the costs of the implants and their removal, and compensation for personal injury, distress and any potential financial loss they suffered. Letters Before Action are being sent to relevant parties this month. Their lawyer Zahra Nanji, from Leigh Day, says: ""I really do believe strongly that the manufacturers, producers and distributors of these implants need to take responsibility."" Manufacturer Allergan said patient safety was a priority and it would support informative labelling ""to promote and advance the safest use of breast implant products"". ""We continue to invest in and support work to further understanding and increasing awareness of BIA-ALCL,"" the company said. It has issued a voluntary worldwide recall of Biocell saline-filled and silicone-filled textured breast implants and tissue expanders.

Deal struck to nationalise Ferguson shipyard,"An order for CalMac ferries has been at the centre of a dispute The Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow has been nationalised by the Scottish government. Ministers will now operate the yard under a management agreement with administrators, which will see the Scottish government buy the facility if no private buyer is found within four weeks. Ferguson has been involved in a dispute with the Scottish government over the construction of two ferries for CalMac. About 300 people work at the yard. The deal means the yard will no longer be owned by industrialist Jim McColl, who could not persuade ministers to pay more than the Â£97m contract price for the disputed ferries. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay visited the Port Glasgow yard on Friday The agreement also means work on the CalMac ferries, and other contracts, can continue while efforts to find a commercial buyer get under way. Administrator Deloitte described the ferry contract as being ""materially behind schedule and over budget"". The monthly wage bill for workers at the yard will now be met from Scottish government funds. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said:  ""We have always been clear that we want to complete the vessels, secure jobs and give the yard a future. ""Public control will provide much-needed continuity of employment now and ensure the completion of the ferry contracts at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer. ""It is absolutely essential that the outstanding contracts to build these two ferries are completed."" Mr Mackay said the alternative was for the government to ""stand aside"" while the company went into administration, with jobs being lost and the vessels not being completed. ""That was not an outcome I was willing to consider,"" he said. A deal was struck to save the yard in 2014 When Ferguson Shipbuilders went bust in the summer of 2014 it seemed the last shipyard on the lower Clyde was heading for oblivion. But within weeks a deal had been brokered for billionaire tycoon Jim McColl to save the Port Glasgow yard. He was adamant that Scottish shipbuilding could have a bright future. The workforce at Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd, as it became known, rose from about 70 to 350. Early work came in the shape of a Â£97m Scottish government order for two new ferries for CalMac. And that is where it all started to unravel. CMAL, the company that owns and manages ferries and other assets on behalf of the Scottish government, was pushing Ferguson Marine hard to complete the ferries on time and on budget. But Mr McColl was adamant CMAL had made repeated design changes, a claim denied by CMAL, and a bitter dispute ensued with Ferguson Marine last year revealing it expected to lose nearly Â£40m on the ferry deals. The Scottish government has made two loans to Ferguson Marine, totalling Â£45m, and what happens to these, as well as when the ferries will eventually enter service, remains unclear. The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift Mr Mackay added that developing a revised cost analysis to establish the actions required to complete the two CalMac vessels would be one of the first task undertaken by a new management team. As part of the agreement with the administrators, the Scottish government will acquire Ferguson Marine if there is no viable commercial offer within the next four weeks. The GMB union said nationalisation would secure the immediate future of the yard. The union's Scotland organiser Gary Cook said: ""That is a very welcome development, particularly after all the recent uncertainty. ""Our members were caught in the middle of a situation that had nothing to do with them and their relief will be palpable. It is five years since the yard went bust and the Scottish government has prevented that from happening again."" Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Jamie Greene MSP said: ""The SNP Government's decision to barge in and use ministerial powers to take over the yard simply covers up the true extent of how much they have messed up this bungled ferry contract. ""We all want to save the yard, save jobs and see these new ferries completed. ""But Derek Mackay has not explored all of the options available, and he has refused to compromise with the shipbuilders over the disputed costs."" Michael Magnay, restructuring partners at Deloitte, said: ""We are grateful for the support afforded to the business by Scottish ministers at what is undoubtedly a very challenging period for all stakeholders, and in particular its employees. ""With this support we will keep the yard operating whilst we proceed to actively market the business for sale, in order to secure its long term future."" A spokesman for Clyde Blowers Capital (CBC) said: ""The Scottish government have not involved CBC or the directors of Ferguson Marine in any of the discussions leading up to this appointment. ""We are unaware of the deal that the Scottish government have made behind the scenes and, as a result, are unable to provide any further comment at this stage.""

Cyber-attack leads to forensic samples backlog,"A cyber-attack on the UK's biggest forensic services provider led to a backlog of 20,000 samples, the BBC has learned. Eurofins Scientific was targeted by a ""highly-sophisticated"" ransomware virus in June, which led British police to suspend work with the company. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) is now clearing the backlog, which includes blood and DNA specimens. It warned of delays to police investigations and court cases. Forensic firm paid ransom after cyber-attack Cyber-attack hits police forensic work The NPCC said it decided three weeks ago that it was safe for police forces to use the firm again. Since then, it has managed to reduce the backlog to 15,000. The ""overwhelming majority"" of cases - which include specimens from suspects and evidence from crime scenes - will be cleared within two months, the police body added. The NPCC lead for the forensic marketplace, Assistant Chief Constable Paul Gibson, said: ""The security and integrity of the criminal justice system is of the highest possible priority, which meant we had to take stringent steps to ensure that police data had, firstly, not been manipulated or changed and, secondly, was suitably protected for the future."" Eurofins carries out DNA testing, toxicology analysis, firearms testing and computer forensics for police forces across the UK. It deals with more than 70,000 criminal cases in the UK each year. Last month, the BBC was toldthe global testing firm paid a ransom to the perpetratorsof the cyber-attack to restore access to its computer network. The ransomware attack hit the company, which accounts for more than half of forensic science provision in the UK, on the first weekend in June. Ransomware is a computer virus that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files. Messages sent by the perpetrators demand a payment in order to unlock the frozen accounts. The use of private firms and police laboratories to carry out forensic science work was stepped up after the closure of the state-owned Forensic Science Service in 2012. The National Crime Agency is still investigating the attack.

Thousands of people reacted to PC Stephen Croshaw's tweets about overcoming his difficult childhood. The Warwickshire officer, 46, said he suffered abuse from an alcoholic mother, was locked in a coal shed and eventually slept rough. He said his story showed ""hope"" and ""determination"" can surpass all else. The police officer, now married and a stepfather, said he had experienced some ""low lows"" while growing up in Nuneaton. He said his mother, who has since died, struggled with mental heath issues and alcoholism and found it difficult to cope after his father, who has also since died, left. Latest news from the West Midlands PC Croshaw regularly suffered violence as a young boy, recalling being beaten with a bat, locked in the coal shed naked and verbally abused. He scraped through school, he said, but dropped out of college, sleeping rough on and off after being ""thrown out"" following arguments with his mother.

Police 'failed to protect' woman killed by ex,"This video can not be played 'He's taken her and her children's lives' Police failed to adequately protect a woman who was later killed by her ex-partner, an investigation has found. Laura Stuart, 33, was subjected to two years of ""distress, isolation and humiliation"" before being killed by Jason Cooper as she left a Denbigh pub. An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation probed the 18 contacts made with North Wales Police before her murder in 2017. The force said it had now changed how it deals with domestic abuse calls. One officer has also been found guilty of misconduct. ""Reports made to police included allegations that Mr Cooper had used violence, made threats, had financial influence over Laura, attempted to remove her from the house following arguments and had threatened to distribute intimate photographs of her,"" said Mel Palmer, of the IOPC. Jason Cooper was sentenced to 31 years in prison after being found guilty of murder ""These behaviours were likely to cause Laura distress, isolation and humiliation and escalated over the two years leading up to the tragic events of 12 August 2017."" Murderer ex-boyfriend jailed for 31 years Murdered mum 'let down by police' Man guilty of ex-girlfriend's murder Welsh Women's Aid said the case was a ""stark reminder"" of the ""devastating impact"" of domestic abuse and called for more effective training for officers. The attack happened as Ms Stuart walked home from a night out and she suffered stab wounds to her back, head and chest, internal bleeding, and a fractured nose and cheek bone. A friend who tried to help was also stabbed. Laura Stuart was killed by Jason Cooper as she left a pub in Denbigh town centre After Cooper was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 31 years in prison, Ms Stuart's family said she had been ""let down"". Her mother Liz Griffiths said: ""They could have done more for her."" During the trial, jurors heard Ms Stuart was told to ""run"" because Cooper was ""going to kill her"" and ""erase"" her. She was also falsely accused of having a relationship with another man, and Cooper threatened to post naked photographs of her online. The IOPC investigation followed a mandatory referral by North Wales Police to look at how the calls were handled Between August 2015 and August 2017, 18 reports were made to police, including allegations of assault and verbal altercations. The IOPC investigation looked at why Cooper was not arrested or his phone seized to investigate allegations of harassment, stalking or malicious communications. However, it did find police made ""numerous, unsuccessful attempts"" to get accounts from Ms Stuart of two allegations of assault. But officers did not pursue safeguarding measures despite referring her to other agencies. Following the report's publication, Ms Palmer said the ""range of characteristics and dynamics"" of domestic abuse mean police officers need to be ""vigilant"". ""Incidents that may be perceived as low risk need to be viewed as part of a bigger picture so that forces view risk holistically to better safeguard women like Laura,"" she said. Laura Stuart and Jason Cooper were together for two years before the relationship deteriorated - he once texted her 421 times in a day Since the murder the force has made changes, including making it best practice for officers to activate body-worn video equipment when attending domestic abuse incidents. It has also employed a trainer and staff will be educated in dealing with different situations. Supt Nick Evans said the force accepted the findings of the IOPC. ""This has led to improvements in our policy and how we deal with domestic abuse incidents, more training for front line officers and investment in more domestic abuse specialists,"" he said. A spokeswoman for Welsh Women's Aid said: ""It is vital police forces across Wales have effective training to identify and effectively investigate all incidents of domestic abuse, including coercive controlling behaviour and stalking and harassment which is at the centre of many survivors' experiences of abuse.""

"Electricity bills to increase for 450,000 homesPower NI is hiking prices in a move that will see domestic bills go up by an average of Â£35 a year.Northern IrelandComments","This video can not be played Power NI customers set for 6% bill increase Almost half a million homes in Northern Ireland will see their electricity bills rise by 6% from October. Power NI, which has 458,000 domestic customers across Northern Ireland, is increasing prices in a move that will add about Â£35 a year to the average household electricity bill. This is the third year in a row that Power NI has hiked its prices. The company said the change, which has been agreed withthe Utility Regulator,external, was due to increased costs. Energy prices to fall for millions this winter It said these had come from the electricity network provider and the market operator. ""Unfortunately, like all suppliers, we have no alternative but to pay these increased network and market charges, which have a knock-on effect on our prices,"" said Stephen McCully, managing director of Power NI. ""Having been through a rigorous process with the Utility Regulator, our customers can be sure that although unwelcome, this increase is as low as possible."" The Consumer Council advises people to shop around for a better deal The Consumer Council described the increase as disappointing. Paulino Garcia, head of energy policy, said the council is concerned about the impact on vulnerable consumers on low incomes. He said the fall in wholesale energy prices over the last three months had not materialised in prices. Mr Garcia added that Power NI and the Utility Regulator assured the council that if wholesale prices continue to fall, the savings will be passed on. The Consumer Council advises bill payers to use theirindependent comparison tool to check if they can make savings,external. It also pointed out that bills can be cut without switching your supplier by setting up a direct debit. Power NI has 35,000 farm and business customers who will also see a rise in their bills, but as many have personalised contracts with either a market tracker or a fixed-price deal, the increase will vary depending on contract type and tariff. Power NI is regulated by the Utility Regulator in Northern Ireland. ""Approving any increase to electricity bills is not a decision we take lightly,"" said Utility Regulator chief executive Jenny Pyper. ""It is disappointing that, due to a number of rising costs, Power NI need to increase their domestic tariff."" ""Despite this increase, Power NI's standard domestic electricity tariff continues to be lower than the Great Britain and Republic of Ireland average,"" she added.

"Wolves captain writes to 48 fans in Armenia tripConor Coady personally thanks those who made the 6,370-mile round trip for the Europa League game.Birmingham & Black Country","Conor Coady has ""quite a big connection with the fans"", the club said Wolves captain Conor Coady has written to all 48 fans who made the 6,370-mile round trip to their match in Armenia. He thanked those who saw the team beat Pyunik 4-0 in the Europa League last week, with Wolves in Europe this season for the first time since 1980. Tickets for the third qualifying round first-leg game in Yerevan were Â£1, but the expedition cost fans ""something like"" Â£1,000, the club said. Coady had wanted to say thanks and this was ""not a publicity stunt"", it added. The letters were all signed individually and had the fans' names on, Wolves said. Supporter Brian Jones, 60, who has watched Wolves since 1969, said it was ""a bit of a surprise"". It was ""not unusual"" for Coady to be the first player to go across to applaud fans at the end of games, he said. ""He's come through as very iconic really in terms of the development of the club. He gives the impression of [having] a real affinity with supporters. ""I don't think too many football supporters have a letter from the captain, [it's] a nice touch."" Raul Jimenez was a big threat in Armenia Coady wrote that he hoped the players made the trip for the first-leg game worthwhile for fans, Mr Jones said. The supporter, from Nottingham, said he knew of one man who had not missed a match since 1971 and only arrived with 18 minutes left in Armenia following a delayed flight. Mr Jones himself waited about six hours for his flight from Moscow and chatted to a Russian football fan with the help of ""Google Translate"", but felt ""quite privileged"" to have been to Armenia, where ""the most we paid for a pint was Â£2"". ""It shouldn't be forgotten there were loads who'd have loved to have gone, but it was very expensive, it was quite short notice."" A Wolves spokesman said: ""He came to us, he wanted to come up with an idea to say 'thank you' to the travelling fans. ""It was such a big effort for those 48 to go there [with] no direct flights and [it costing] something like over and above Â£1,000 to get there with the flights and hotel."" Coady has got ""quite a big connection with the fans and they've got a connection with him,"" the spokesman added. ""It's not something he's done as a publicity stunt, but a genuine thank you to the fans.""

Lawyer killed after 'chance coming together',"Peter Duncan died in hospital shortly after being attacked A 52-year-old lawyer who was stabbed to death with a screwdriver in a busy shopping centre was a devoted father, his family has said. Peter Duncan was attacked after what police said was a chance ""coming together"" with a group of youths near Old Eldon Square in Newcastle. He was attacked at about 18:20 BST on Wednesday and died later in hospital. Seven teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of his murder. The boys, a 14 year-old, two 15-year-olds and four 17-year-olds, remain in custody. Northumbria Police said it believed Mr Duncan was attacked after a ""chance encounter"" outside a branch of Greggs. A cordon was put in place in Eldon Square Mr Duncan, from Newcastle, was described by his family as a ""devoted father and husband"". ""Peter was a kind and caring man who was always first to help others,"" they added. ""He was a devoted father, husband, son, brother, uncle and friend and loved by all who knew him. ""His death will leave such a huge hole in our lives and he'll be deeply missed by us all."" According to his profile on LinkedIn, Mr Duncan trained as an electrical engineer before graduating from Northumbria University with a law degree in 2003. He was working as legal counsel in the Newcastle office of Royal IHC Limited, and previously as a solicitor and legal advisor with other companies in Darlington and Newcastle. Ch Supt Ged Noble said it appeared there had been a ""coming together"" at the entrance to the shopping centre, which led to Mr Duncan receiving a single puncture wound to the chest. He added: ""This was a tragic incident and our thoughts go out to Peter's family and friends at this incredibly difficult time. ""Peter's family have requested that their privacy is respected during this difficult time.
