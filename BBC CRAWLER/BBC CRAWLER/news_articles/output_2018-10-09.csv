UN envoy Nikki Haley in shock resignation,"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Hopefully you'll be coming back at some point ... you can have your pick"" US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has announced she is resigning - after nearly two years in the post. President Donald Trump appeared in the Oval Office alongside Mrs Haley to say she had done ""an incredible job"". The 46-year-old former South Carolina governor - one of the few women in the Trump cabinet - gave no reason for her exit, but dismissed speculation she was planning to run for president in 2020. Mr Trump said he would name a replacement in two-three weeks. Nikki Haley: Trump critic to Trump envoy The White House revolving door Are Dina Powell and Ivanka Trump top amongst possible Haley successors? He said he would consider the candidature of Dina Powell - his former deputy security council adviser - and added that his daughter Ivanka ""would be dynamite"" as ambassador, but that he would be accused of nepotism if he chose her. Hours later, Ivanka ruled herself out of the race. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs Haley did not give details about her move - or what she would do next. ""It's been eight years of intense time, and I'm a believer in term limits,"" she said referring to her time in public office. ""I don't have anything set on where I'm going to go,"" she said. Mrs Haley told journalists she would be campaigning for ""this one"", pointing to Mr Trump. Mr Trump said Mrs Haley had told him some time ago she wanted to take some time off. This video can not be played President Trump: ""I'm not sure there's anyone more competent in the world."" The president said she ""has been very special to me, she has done an incredible job, she is a fantastic person, very importantly, but she is also somebody that gets it"". ""Hopefully you'll be coming back at some point, right,"" Mr Trump said. ""Maybe a different capacity, you can have your pick."" Mrs Haley laughed. Analysis by Nick Bryant, BBC UN correspondent Through the revolving door of the Trump administration goes another high-level departure: UN ambassador Nikki Haley, by far the most high-profile woman in the cabinet, and an internationalist who's done much to protect the United Nations from Donald Trump's anti-globalist wrecking ball. She was a strident critic of Russia and Syria at the UN, and also fiercely critical of what she claimed was the global body's anti-Israel's bias. She supported shutting off US funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency and revelled in defending the Trump administration's decision to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in the face of an acid show of international criticism. She was also instrumental in pressuring China to support a tough sanctions regime against North Korea. Sometimes, however, her style grated with colleagues. Her aggressive and repeated warnings about compiling a list of countries that didn't back the United States irritated even close allies. Yet it's often said that the UN's biggest peacekeeping mission is directed against the Trump White House, and Nikki Haley was seen as a valuable ally. A former governor of South Carolina, she's a talented politician who's widely spoken of as a future female US president. Though she has ruled out challenging Donald Trump in 2020, we have not heard the last of Nikki Haley. How Nikki Haley shook up the UN Born Nimrata Randhawa to Indian immigrant parents, she was raised as a Sikh in Bamberg, South Carolina, later converting to Christianity Her first job as a 13-year-old was bookkeeping for her family's clothing store In 2010, she became South Carolina's first female and first minority governor - and youngest governor in the US - and was re-elected in 2014 She received nationwide praise for removing the Confederate flag from the state capitol after a mass shooting on black churchgoers in Charleston in 2015 She did not initially endorse Mr Trump during the 2016 campaign, instead backing Florida Senator Marco Rubio Mrs Haley is married to Army National Guard Captain Michael Haley, and the couple have two teenage children Mrs Haley's resignation comes a day after an anti-corruption watchdog accused her of accepting seven luxury private plane trips as gifts from South Carolina business leaders. This video can not be played Haley: 'Jared is such a hidden genius' Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said,externalMrs Haley had undervalued the cost of the flights by tens of thousands of dollars in an annual financial disclosure report.

In April, Mrs Haley clashed with the White House when a Trump aide suggested she had prematurely announced a round of sanctions against Russia. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested she had got ""ahead of the curve"" and had a ""momentary confusion"". But she fired back hours later telling Fox News: ""With all due respect, I don't get confused."" Mrs Haley was a frequent critic of Mr Trump during his election campaign. She had said that women who accused him of sexual assault ""should be heard"". At one point she suggested that Mr Trump's rhetoric could trigger a world war. Republican lawmakers praised Mrs Haley on Tuesday after news of her resignation broke. Retiring Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said: ""She challenged friend and foe to be better."" South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said she had been ""a true agent of reform"" at the UN. Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called her departure ""yet another sign of the Trump Administration's chaotic foreign policy"". He added that he is ""deeply concerned about the leadership vacuum she leaves and the national security impact of her departure at this time of continued disarray"".

PM appoints minister for suicide prevention,"A minister for suicide prevention has been appointed in England by the prime minister as the government hosts the first ever global mental health summit. Theresa May said the appointment of Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price to the new role will help tackle the stigma surrounding suicide. While suicide rates are falling, 4,500 people take their own lives every year. The appointment comes as ministers and officials from more than 50 countries assemble in London for the summit. Wednesday's meeting - hosted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - coincides with World Mental Health Day.  The government has also promised more support in schools, bringing in new mental health support teams and offering help in measuring students' health, including their mental wellbeing. Ms May said: ""We can end the stigma that has forced too many to suffer in silence and prevent the tragedy of suicide taking too many lives."" Alongside the announcement, the prime minister pledged Â£1.8m to the Samaritans so the charity can continue providing its free helpline for the next four years.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Mental health is known to deteriorate when you are left without help, and you can only imagine how things got worse with me."" Hannah Lewis said her mental health issues dated back to when she was a child Ms Lewis welcomed the government's announcement - especially the proposals to bring more awareness of mental health into schools - but she added: ""More joined-up working at schools and early intervention is great, but we need to make sure then there are sufficient services to be signposted to."" Mrs Doyle-Price, who has been an MP since 2010, will now become the minister for mental health, inequalities and suicide prevention. As health is devolved separately to the UK's four nations, her role will include making sure each local area in England has effective plans to stop unnecessary deaths and to look into how technology could help identify those at risk. Jackie Doyle-Price has been the MP for Thurrock since 2010 She said she understood the ""tragic, devastating and long-lasting"" effect of suicide on families, having met some of those bereaved. ""It's these people who need to be at the heart of what we do,"" she added. Manchester University's Prof Louis Appleby, one of the country's leading experts on suicide, said having a minister for suicide prevention would ""open doors"" and make it easier to have conversations about the role such things as benefits and online gambling have in suicidal people's lives. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the appointment would also help with getting support for mental illness on a par with services for physical health. ""There is a long road to travel to get there. This is not something you solve overnight,"" he said. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, said there had not been enough improvements to services since Mrs May pledged to tackle the issue two years ago. ""While we applaud the intention [of the announcement], it is striking that the UK should be hosting such a summit when we hear daily about people left untreated due to a lack of nurses and doctors,"" she said.

We haven't heard the last of her,"Through the revolving door of the Trump administration goes another high-level departure: the UN ambassador Nikki Haley, by far the most high-profile woman in the cabinet, and an internationalist who's done much to protect the United Nations from Donald Trump's anti-globalist wrecking ball. At a meeting in the Oval Office, they both went out of their way to stress this was an amicable separation. Donald Trump lavished her with what for him is high praise, by saying she'd brought more ""glamour"" to the role. Mrs Haley, who is widely spoken of as a possible future president, promised she had no plans to challenge him for the party's presidential nomination in 2020. Like President Trump, she has an eye for a television moment, and after the Assad regime launched a chemical weapons strike in April 2017, she brandished pictures of dead children in the Security Council. ""The pictures of dead children were not fake news,"" she railed. ""They were the result of the Syrian regime's barbaric inhumanity. ""And they were the result of the regime and Russia's failure to live up to their international commitments to remove all chemical weapons from Syria."" This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Hopefully you'll be coming back at some point ... you can have your pick"" It provided diplomatic theatre of the most electrifying and meaningful kind. Mrs Haley was a strident critic of Russia and Syria at the UN, and also fiercely critical of what she claimed was the global body's anti-Israel bias. She supported shutting off US funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency and revelled in defending the Trump administration's decision to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in the face of an acid show of international criticism. Nikki Haley: Trump critic to Trump envoy The White House revolving door She was also instrumental in pressuring China to support a tough sanctions regime against North Korea. Her personal diplomacy in closed-door meetings, when she demanded immediate answers from Beijing's more cautious and sometimes slow-moving diplomats, was unexpectedly successful. Often her style grated with colleagues. Take her debut remarks at the UN. ""I wear heels,"" she said determinedly. ""It's not for a fashion statement. It's because if I see something wrong, we're going to kick them every single time."" This ""new sheriff"" in town rhetoric not only alarmed foreign diplomats but some veterans of the state department who man the US mission to the UN. So, too, did her aggressive and repeated warnings about compiling a list of errant countries that didn't back the United States, which irritated even close allies. But she was popular at the UN, partly for her easy 'Hi y'all"" southern charm (her personal motto is ""Kick 'em with a smile""), partly because she was such an unflinching critic of Moscow and Damascus and partly because she was seen as a human buffer between the White House and UN. From the outset, she formed a strong working relationship with the incoming UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, and together they pushed through a reform agenda, focussing particularly on trimming the organisation's peacekeeping budget. It is often said that the UN's biggest peacekeeping mission is directed against the Trump White House, and Mrs Haley was seen as a valuable ally. Resurgent anti-Trump 'resistance' defines a divided America Mr Trump does not go after the UN in the same way that he targets Nato and the World Trade Organisation, which shows how effective the Haley-Guterres partnership has been. A former governor of South Carolina, she's a talented retail politician with the brightest of futures. Once a foreign policy neophyte, she now has a top-ranking diplomatic assignment on her curriculum vitae. She's also been a senior member of the Trump team, though one who managed to maintain a measure of independence. Over the past two years, she has ticked a few important political and policy boxes. Unlike others who have served in the Trump cabinet, such as Rex Tillerson, who she hated, she has also burnished her reputation. Nikki Haley became an articulate spokeswoman for Donald Trump's America First foreign policy, often performing clean-up duties on issues such as the Middle East when the president's tweets and offhand remarks created international confusion. But I doubt if she's ever been a really true believer in Trumpism at home. Asked to deliver the Republican response to Barack Obama's State of the Union address in 2016, she warned Republicans against listening to the ""siren call of the angriest voices"", which was a clear dig at the billionaire candidate. In that year's South Carolina primary, she backed Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and, as an Indian-American, urged the party to be more demographically inclusive. She was also the governor who pushed after the Charleston shootings for the Confederate flag to be lowered from the state house grounds in Columbia - a particularly brave political act in the state where the first shots of American Civil War rang out. Watching her at the UN perform the diplomatic drudgery of listening to overlong speeches from ambassadors on countries that previously would not have been on her radar, I often wondered whether her heart was truly in it. But on the occasions when the eyes of the world were on the Security Council, she relished her role and rarely failed to deliver the most ringing quote of the day. Certainly, the UN has been a useful stepping stone. One of her predecessors as UN ambassador, George Herbert Walker Bush, went from the horseshoe table of the Security Council to the White House. It does not require a great leap of imagination to see her making the same journey. Certainly, we have not heard the last of Nikki Haley.

From Trump critic to insider,"Governor Haley was critical of Mr Trump during his presidential campaign The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has resigned after only 19 months in the role. Mrs Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, was appointed to the role by President Donald Trump in January 2017. The former South Carolina governor was a vocal critic of the property mogul on the campaign trail but later voted for him, lamenting that she was ""not a fan"" of either Mr Trump or Hillary Clinton. The 46-year old has been an outspoken envoy to the UN, removing the US from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) after accusing it of bias. Allow Twitter content?

Born Nimrata ""Nikki"" Randhawa, Mrs Haley was the first minority and female governor of South Carolina, a deeply conservative state with a long history of racial strife. The Indian-American was elected in 2010 and served two terms, riding the wave of the Republican Tea Party with the support of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. As the youngest governor in the US and only the second Indian-American to serve at the helm of a US state, she was touted as a rising star within the Republican Party. She took a public stand against resettling Syrian refugees in South Carolina and also opposed President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Her re-election win in 2014 also marked the largest margin of victory for a South Carolina gubernatorial candidate in 24 years. Before becoming the state's chief executive, she served for six years as a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. She is married to Army National Guard Captain Michael Haley and has two children. An accountant and businesswoman, Mrs Haley was raised in a Sikh household but converted to Christianity and attends a Methodist church. Her first job was bookkeeping for her family's clothing store at the age of 13. Mrs Haley called for the state removal of the Confederate flag following the Emanuel AME Church shooting Mrs Haley attracted national attention in 2015 when she asked the state legislature to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Capitol following a racially charged massacre that left nine people dead at a Charleston church. The state has long wrestled with its connection to the divisive flag, which is considered by many as a totem of racism but defended by others as an important historical symbol. Charleston shootings: Power of forgiveness in African-American church Charleston church victims remembered ""Today, we are here in a moment of unity in our state, without ill will, to say it is time to move the flag from the Capitol grounds,"" said Mrs Haley at a news conference. ""One hundred and fifty years after the end of the Civil War, the time has come."" Though she had previously supported preserving the flag's symbolism of Southern Heritage, the governor signed a bill requiring its removal and the flag was taken down in July 2015. Mrs Haley endorsed Senator Rubio and then Senator Cruz before she finally backed Mr Trump For the 2016 presidential bid, Mrs Haley endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio during the Republican primary election and after he dropped out, threw her support behind Senator Ted Cruz - Mr Trump's final rival before he became the party's nominee. The then-governor also urged Mr Trump to release his tax returns and criticised his harsh campaign rhetoric throughout the primary election. She also confronted the then-frontrunner's call to temporarily ban Muslims from the country, adding: ""No-one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country."" Nikki Haley, the Republican who took on Trump Mr Trump lashed out by calling the then-governor ""very weak on immigration"" and tweeted she wasan embarrassment to the state,external. She responded in a tweet: ""Bless your heart"",external, which is often viewed as condescending dismissal in the South. However, she finally voted for Mr Trump and after he won the election, she was announced his pick for US envoy to the UN. Mr Trump praised his former critic as a ""proven dealmaker"" and said she would ""be a great leader representing us on the world stage"". Mr Trump said Mrs Haley was doing ""an incredible job"" as US ambassador to the UN Mrs Haley joined Mr Trump's cabinet as US envoy to the UN shortly after his inauguration in January 2017. The former South Carolina governor had little foreign policy experience, though she did travel abroad to broker economic deals for her state. She soon stood out as an outspoken critic on the international stage - voicing her opinion on policy issues like North Korea and engaging in verbal battles with Russia over Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons against its citizens. In June,she berated human rights groups for trying to ""thwart reform"" of the UNHRC- which the US then withdrew from, calling it a ""cesspool of political bias"". Mrs Haley had earlier said it was ""hard to accept"" that resolutions had been passed against Israel, a US ally, but none considered on Venezuela and not enough done to criticise Iran. At the time of her resignation, she had just served as temporary president of the UN Security Council for a month.

Five drilling rigs have been moved out of the storm's path, according to the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds.

Army investigates Tommy Robinson photo,"The Army is investigating after former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson posted a photo of himself with a group of young soldiers. Mr Robinson also put a video of the scene on Facebook, in which the men could be heard cheering and shouting his name. The Army said it was aware of the posts and ""investigating the circumstances"". A spokeswoman said: ""Far-right ideology is completely at odds with the values and ethos of the armed forces."" She added: ""The armed forces have robust measures in place to ensure those exhibiting extremist views are neither tolerated nor permitted to serve."" The photograph and video appear to have been taken outside a motorway service area and Mr Robinson described the group as ""young recruits"". Mr Robinson wrote on Facebook: ""A moment like this makes it all worth while. Today I met real British heroes (sic)."" Responding to news of the investigation, Mr Robinson said in a video post that he had met the soldiers ""by chance"" and they should not be ""left hung out to dry"" for having their photo taken with him. Imam Asim Hafiz, Islamic religious adviser to the armed forces, said ""any form of racism, discrimination or extremism is taken extremely seriously and will be dealt with accordingly"". He added: ""The armed forces remain absolutely committed to welcoming individuals from across all faiths and cultures into its ranks."" The Muslim Council of Britain said Mr Robinson ""does not represent our armed forces, however much he tries to claim otherwise"" and welcomed the ""swift statement by the Army in disassociating itself from the far right"".

Bodyguard is 'airbrushing reality',"This video can not be played To pretend that sexism and racism no longer exists in the Police ""is airbrushing reality"" Daisy Goodwin tells World at One Victoria screenwriter Daisy Goodwin says TV dramas are ""airbrushing reality"" by having too many powerful female characters. She refers to the recent successes of BBC dramas Bodyguard and Killing Eve, which both feature female leads. Both saw women in prominent positions, as the Home Secretary in Bodyguard and as an MI5 agent in Killing Eve. Goodwin told the BBC that these narratives pretended ""sexism and racism in our institutions"" had gone away. Keeley Hawes played the Home Secretary Julia Montague Bodyguard, which was the BBC's most watched drama in 10 years, featured a number of women in high profile roles including Gina McKee as Anne Sampson, head of the Metropolitan Police's counter terrorism unit, and Pippa Haywood as Lorraine Craddock, head of the Met's specialist protection branch. This was alongside Keeley Hawes playing Home Secretary Julia Montague and Anjli Mohindra as suicide bomber Nadia Ali. Killing Eve, written by Fleabag actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge, saw two women go head-to-head - Jodie Comer as assassin Villanelle and Sandra Oh as Eve Polastri, an MI5 agent with a female boss and assistant. Bodyguard David Budd, played by Richard Madden, was outnumbered by women in the series ""There's something slightly troubling about the fact that there's lots of women in power but even the snipers [in Bodyguard] were women,"" Goodwin told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""All the police officers were women and I just don't believe that is necessarily an accurate representation of what goes on in the police at the moment. ""I think its unrealistic to pretend on television that women and men are treated equally and that's not the case,"" Goodwin added. She said it was a ""two way split"" as ""on one hand you want to promote positive role models for little girls but [on the other] let them know it's not that easy and you might have to deal with a lot of negative remarks."" Jodie Comer (top) plays assassin Villanelle, with Sandra Oh as Eve in Killing Eve The ITV writer, who has also written a number of novels, said she thinks progress could be made with more dramas that ""reflect reality and the Me Too debate"". ""I think it's extraordinary that the Me Too scandal erupted a year ago and we have seen nothing on screen that really reflected it. ""It's a much more live issue now than it has ever been.

Fears for music lessons in schools,"Music lessons in England schools could be under threat unless central government covers the cost of a pay rise for teachers, councils claim. In July, the government agreed to fund a 3.5% rise for lower-paid teachers and 1.5% and 2% for higher-paid teachers, senior staff and head teachers. But councils say this does not cover centrally employed teachers, most of whom offer music lessons in schools. The government says it is in discussion with councils over this issue. The Local Government Association (LGA) is concerned that young people will miss out on music lessons if councils have to cut back. It says the extra cost of a 1 to 2.5% pay rise for centrally employed teachers will be around Â£5.5m - a cost that councils have not budgeted for. Classroom teachers up to 3.5% pay rise Creative subjects squeezed, say schools School spending 'really has been cut' With councils facing a challenging financial landscape, the LGA is warning that many will have little choice but to cut back on services like music tuition. No. While the majority of these posts are within music teaching, other roles centre around additional support for specific groups. For example: teachers who work with children from black and minority ethnic backgrounds and traveller heritages teachers supporting disabled children those teaching outside school environments, such as within a secure unit those supporting schools with early years provision. There are currently around 4,900 centrally employed teachers in England. The LGA fears certain types of education provision will be cut. Cllr Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the LGA's children and young people board, says: ""While we were pleased that the government announced that it would fully fund a pay increase for teachers in the summer, it needs to extend this to fund the pay rise for centrally employed teachers, such as those providing music tuition. ""Local government is already under massive financial pressure with many services over-stretched. ""If this additional cost is left for councils to pick up then they will be put in the very difficult position of being forced to reduce certain types of education provision, including music teaching."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, says schools are already facing pressures on their budgets. ""Local authorities have also suffered ruinous funding cuts over the last 10 years, and cannot now be expected to find the money for millions of centrally employed teachers' pay rises with no additional money from the government at all. ""It is very easy in this situation to see how music could simply slip off the list of priorities entirely, cheating a generation of children out of the opportunity to explore their talents and denying them the benefits music education can bring."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""The number of teachers centrally employed by councils represents around 1% of the teaching workforce and we are in discussions with a range of stakeholders, including the Local Government Association, about this issue. ""Our Â£300m music hubs programme is ensuring every primary or secondary school pupil has the opportunity to learn to play an instrument. ""We are considering how the pay rise affects those teachers employed as part of the scheme.""

'Neo-nazi' couple named baby after Hitler,"Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas gave their child the middle name Adolf, a court has heard A couple accused of being in a banned British Neo-Nazi group named their baby after Hitler, a court has heard. Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, from Banbury, gave their child the middle name Adolf in honour of the infamous dictator, prosecutors claim. Jurors heard the couple were pictured with a convicted racist and ""vehement Nazi"" as he held a Swastika flag and performed a racist salute over their baby. Both deny being members of the group. Barnaby Jameson, prosecuting, told jurors at Birmingham Crown Court that National Action was ""so extreme and violent"" it was banned in 2016. ""Given that the child was born almost a year after National Action was banned, you may think the use of the name 'Adolf' - even as a middle name - was of significance,"" he said. Photographs of the couple's ""close friend"" Darren Fletcher, 28, from Wolverhampton, posing with their child were uncovered during investigations into the group, the court heard. They are on trial alongside Daniel Bogunovic, 27, who is also accused of being a National Action member. Mr Jameson warned jurors the case dealt with ""a world in which any right-thinking person would wish did not exist"". He said the court would hear of ""hate crime committed by National Action members and the ruthlessness with which they were prepared to spread terror"". Mr Bogunovic and Mr Thomas had a ""particular interest"" in owning machetes, he said, and bomb-making instructions were found on Mr Thomas's computer. Mr Jameson said the case was about ""a specific type of terror...born out of fanatical and tribal belief in white supremacy"". Describing the terror as a ""cult of violent white racial supremacy"", Mr Jameson said it regarded groups including black, Jewish, Asian and gay people as ""sub-human"". ""It is a terror that can be summarised in two words: white Jihad - in other words, a white holy war,"" he said. The jury of six men and six women heard Bogunovic was among four men convicted earlier this year of stirring up racial hatred after plastering Aston University campus in Birmingham with National Action stickers. Jurors were also told of the defendants' associations with ""other prominent National Action figures"". Jurors also heard that photos of an ""arsenal"" of weaponry which the ""extremist's extremist"" Mikko Vehvilainen had built up were found on Thomas and Patatas' phones. Thomas also stands accused of a having a terrorist document, namely the Anarchist's Cookbook. Patatas and Thomas,  of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, and Bogunovic, of Crown Hills Rise, Leicester, deny all the charges and the trial, expected to last four weeks, continues.

Cambridge tackles 'too big' tour groups,"Cambridge's King's Parade has proved a popular destination for tourists Tourism bosses in Cambridge are to encourage Chinese tourists to visit in smaller groups. Dozens of visitors from the country regularly gather for organised tours around the university city's narrow streets, making some ""impassable"". Emma Thornton, of Visit Cambridge and Beyond, said groups of 50 standing in front of landmarks such as King's College were a ""problem"". The city council said it was also working to tackle coach congestion. Councillor Rosy Moore said Cambridge was ""a small city with narrow streets, so parked coaches and large groups of tourists can be frustrating for residents trying to get about their daily lives"". Emma Thornton said ""if you have 50 people standing in front of Kings College at any one time, it's a problem"" Eve Balshaw, 23, who lives in the city, said large groups of tourists made it ""challenging"" to get around safely. ""If tour guides don't lead groups carefully, it can make both locals and visitors feel like there isn't space for them,"" she said.

PM warned of 'voter backlash' over Brexit,"This video can not be played Steve Baker: ""There are quite a few people who are on the edge of the cliff"" Theresa May has been warned of ""dire"" electoral consequences for the Tories if she persists with her Brexit plan. Former minister David Davis said it would be ""obvious"" to voters if the UK ended up as a ""rule-taker"" and not able to exploit the benefits of leaving. The PM says her so-called Chequers plan for close links to the EU is the only alternative to leaving without a deal. But cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has declined to give this blueprint for EU relations her explicit backing. The international development secretary said the prime minister had her full support, but then added it was not clear where the process would ""end up"". Talks between the two sides are entering a critical phase in the hope that an agreement can be struck by the middle of November at the latest. Kuenssberg: How could May get Brexit deal through MPs? Unionist parties in Brussels Brexit talks Q&A: Brexit and the Irish border The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said negotiations were intense and fluid but there was said to be a sense of optimism and movement. After Tuesday's weekly cabinet meeting, Downing Street made clear Mrs May would not agree to any withdrawal deal including the Â£39bn so-called divorce bill to be paid to the EU, without a ""precise"" declaration of the two sides' future trade and security partnership. This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt: The PM has my ""full support"" over Brexit Later, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab faced MPs' questions on developments since last month's Salzburg summit, when EU leaders rebuffedthe PM's plan for a free trade zonefor manufactured and agricultural goods, underpinned by a common rule book, and a combined customs territory. Mr Raab said the two sides were ""closing in on workable solutions"" on key issues, and stressed the need to ""hold our nerve"" and ""stay resolute"" in order to secure a good deal. On the thorny issue of avoiding new border checks in Northern Ireland, he reiterated that the government would not accept anything that threatened the ""constitutional and economic integrity of the UK"". And he said the sort of free trade agreement being demanded by some Tory Brexiteers was a ""shortcut to no deal"" because it would not solve the Irish border question. Labour said rather than Mr Raab, Mrs May should be answering questions on ""what went wrong"" in Salzburg. And there was a warning from the Democratic Unionist Party's Nigel Dodds, who said his party - which gives the government support in key votes - would not accept anything that ""separates"" Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Mr Dodds warned against repeating the ""debacle"" when the DUP rejected a draft deal struck between the UK and the EU. Please upgrade your browser Mr Davis, who quit as Brexit secretary in July in protest at the Chequers plan - which is named after the country house where the cabinet discussed them - said the UK faced being forced into further concessions, rendering the outcome all the more unpalatable. ""If we stay on our current trajectory, we will go into the next election with the government having delivered none of the benefits of Brexit, with the country having been reduced to a rule taker from Brussels, "" he wrote in a letter to Conservative MPs. ""This will not be a technicality. It will be very obvious to the electorate. The electoral consequences could be dire."" 'Big issues' still in way of Brexit deal It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Mr Davis and other backbench critics of the PM, including former ministers Boris Johnson and Steve Baker, want a looser arrangement modelled on Canada's trade deal with the EU. Former chief whip Mark Harper, previously seen as a loyalist, has added his voice to those calling for the PM to listen to MPs' concerns and back the Canada option. The DUP leader has said there can be no customs or regulatory barriers between Britain and Northern Ireland Up to 40 Tory MPs could oppose the PM in a vote on the deal later this autumn, Mr Baker told the BBC's Politics Live, adding there could be further ministerial resignations before then if there is no U-turn. A Canada-style deal is unviable, Mrs May has said, because it does not provide a solution to the Irish border issue and risks separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Ms Mordaunt, a prominent Leave campaigner in the 2016 referendum, said the prime minister had her ""full support"" at a critical moment in the negotiations but added ""we don't know where this is going to end up"". 'Big issues' still in way of Brexit deal It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says ""I don't doubt her commitment and I don't doubt for one moment her understanding that we have to deliver a good Brexit, we have to honour that result,"" she told journalists following a speech in London on aid policy. The EU and UK are at loggerheads over the so-called Irish backstop, the arrangement designed to guarantee that there will not be a physical border on the island of Ireland, whatever the wider UK-EU deal. Brussels wants Northern Ireland to effectively remain in the customs union and single market - an outcome the UK has said it cannot accept as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland the rest of Great Britain. The UK's counter-proposal would see the country as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after the end of 2020, when the proposed transition period ends. The leader of the Democratic Unionists has reiterated that she would not support any Brexit deal that could lead to new economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Speaking after meeting EU negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels, Arlene Foster said she needed to see the ""legal text"" of any amended backstop proposal before deciding whether it was acceptable.

Rebuilding trust in RBS will take '10 years',"This video can not be played Ross McEwan has been chief executive of RBS since 2013 It's 10 years since RBS received a Â£45bn bailout from the taxpayer, but boss Ross McEwan says its reputation could take another decade to restore. RBS now has one of the highest levels of cash reserves in the industry. But Mr McEwan told the BBC that while its finances may now be fixed when it comes to building levels of trust, there is still a long way to go. ""I think it will take five - maybe even 10 - years to rebuild trust to where we'd want it to be."" RBS's reputation has suffered more than most banks since the crisis. As well as paying out billions in fines and compensation, its poor treatment of many small business customers in the aftermath of the crash was the subject of a highly critical report from the Financial Conduct Authority. Emails from RBS staff encouraging colleagues to ""give business enough rope to hang themselves"" and allegations that an RBS subsidiary acquired property from distressed companies at knockdown prices to sell at a profit (a charge that was not held up by the investigation), painted a cynical picture of the culture in some parts of RBS. A sense of injustice was compounded when the banking watchdog, the FCA, concluded - after a four-year inquiry - that RBS's business-lending activities were not within its regulatory remit. I put it to Mr McEwan that the failure to deal with these issues was a source of ongoing mistrust. He admitted that the bank had failed some customers, and said sorry. ""We were not there supporting customers in the way we should have been and for that once again I apologise."" Mr McEwan has spent exactly five years at the helm helping oversee what he describes as ""one of the biggest turnarounds in corporate history"". It's been a long hard slog and left RBS barely recognisable from the beast it was in 2008, when it was the world's biggest bank on some measures. In the last decade it has shut up shop or sold operations in 41 countries, shedding some 130,000 workers. It used to make nearly 40% of its revenue overseas - today that's only 7% and its assets shrank from Â£2.2 trillion (that's more than the entire UK earns and spends in a year) to Â£748bn. RBS bailout 'unlikely to be recouped' RBS to shut a further 54 bank branches RBS warns of no-deal Brexit loss of customers RBS comes bottom of bank league tables This kind of surgery is painful. In total, the bank has racked up losses from fines compensation and restructuring costs of Â£63bn. In other words - it chewed through the whole Â£45bn bailout and then some. It's now making a profit of about Â£1bn every three months and has started paying a dividend to its shareholders, but Mr McEwan acknowledges it's very unlikely that taxpayers will ever be repaid in full. For normal customers, perhaps the most visible changes are in the cities, towns and villages where the branches are - or aren't. Since 2007, the number of RBS branches (including NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank) has more than halved. Like other banks, RBS points to the rise in the popularity of banking online or via mobile as an explanation/excuse for more than 1,000 closures, but if you are trying to rebuild RBS as your friendly neighbourhood bank, it surely helps if you have one in your neighbourhood. Replacing branches with mobile apps is all very well if the technology works, but often it hasn't. Serious meltdowns in 2012 and 2014 led to chaos for customers and cost the bank more than Â£100m in fines. That is why the bank is trying to simplify the plumbing that underpins its services. From a mindboggling 5,000 separate computer systems and applications, RBS now runs a ""mere"" 2,500 and hopes to get that down to 1,500 by 2020. ""We will never be simple - but we will be simpler,"" he says, adding that he considers the threat of cyber-attack the bank's number one risk. Mr McEwan and his boss, RBS chairman Sir Howard Davies, know that rebuilding the RBS brand is a big job - which is one of the reasons they are thinking of ditching it altogether. Sir Howard has been saying for months that the company is a collection of brands (NatWest, Ulster, Coutts etc) with the most toxic one on top. That process has already started.

Vodafone Freeman break-up advert banned,"A Vodafone advert starring Martin Freeman, in which the actor seems to be breaking up with his partner but is really trying to leave the phone firm, has been banned for being misleading. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advert implied it was possible for customers to leave a contract at any time. However, people are only allowed to quit during the initial 30-day period. Vodafone said it would make sure its 30-day rule was clear in its marketing. The ASA acted after complaints from 11 customers, who challenged the advert. Whistleblower warns of Vodafone security breaches Vodafone rated worst mobile provider by Which? survey Vodafone plans UK fibre broadband roll-out Clearcast, which pre-approves most British television advertising, said that Vodafone wanted to highlight that its service guarantee was for 30 days, whereas other companies only allowed customers a 15-day period of grace. In the advert, Freeman's character says, ""I haven't got the strength to keep arguing with you"", before a few seconds later, adding, ""I'm leaving"". A voice from the phone immediately replies: ""You can't leave, you're still within your contract."" A voiceover then states: ""Breaking up's never easy. But unlike other networks, Vodafone has a 30-day service guarantee, so if you don't love us you can leave us."" The ASA ruled that the advert was ambiguous regarding when the 30-day rule applied and felt it suggested that customers could leave whenever they wanted. It accepted that Vodafone had published the address of its terms and conditions website page in a caption, but felt that did not change the impression given. The authority ruled the advert must not appear again in its current form and told the company its future advertising must not misleadingly imply that its service guarantee applied at any time. A Vodafone spokesperson said: ""Our 'love us or leave us' 30-day service guarantee is the best in the market. We already make clear that the 30 days is from the start of a customer's contract in our terms and conditions, and will also make sure this is totally clear in our marketing."" It isthe second Vodafone advert featuring Freeman to be banned by the ASA. Last month, the ASA banned a Vodafone ad which the regulator said misled customers about lagging broadband speeds and discounts on bills. In February, another Vodafone advert with Freeman, about the ability to make emergency calls from an area with no signal, was cleared by the ASA. The ASA found a Nissan Leaf advert was misleading Also on Wednesday, the authority announced it had banned an advert for the Nissan Leaf electric car, which it said was misleading customers - in this case about the amount of time needed to charge the vehicle. Following aBBC investigationthree people complained, and the ASA ruled that the advert did not convey the potential degree of variability in achieving a certain amount of charge. It said: ""We concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were likely to mislead."" Nissan said: ""We were very disappointed with the ruling made by the ASA, although of course we will respect their decision. ""We constantly review and react to customer feedback to ensure that we are giving the very best possible service and information.""

Make-up artist: I was shot nine times,"Jemma McGrath won the Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank Enterprise award at The Prince's Trust Awards ""I was shot nine times and left in a wheelchair."" Life looked pretty bleak for Jemma McGrath five years ago. Involved in drink and drugs, her life spiralled out of control after the death of her dad. Aged 24, she was shot, left with multiple broken bones and doctors said she would never walk again. Now, she's just won a Prince's Trust award after launching her own make-up business. Jemma McGrath at the Prince's Trust Awards ""I grew up in a [Belfast] community filled with religious and racial hate, and fought my way through life,"" she says. ""I worked in care but used drugs and alcohol out of hours."" Being shot was the wake-up call she needed. ""Although it was a horrific thing to happen, it was a real turning point in my life,"" she tells Newsbeat. The injuries had a huge impact on her body. ""There's still a hole in my femur now, there's plates and screws holding my whole body together."" Jemma still has a bullet in her stomach which will ""probably be with me until the day I die - it doesn't give me any bother,"" she says. ""Some people call me the bionic woman, we have a laugh about it."" Whilst she recovered in hospital, she set herself some goals: ""To become a professional make-up artist and to walk my friend down the aisle."" Three months later, Jemma started walking but she still only had use of one arm. Using social media, she managed to learn and practice her skills. Now 29, she says: ""When I was recovering, I sat and played with make-up. I was watching different YouTube tutorials."" Her friend advised her to join Enterprise, a Prince's Trust programme which helps unemployed young people get going in business. Allow YouTube content?

After leaving the Enterprise programme, Jemma launched #MakeUpUrLife - a make-up, microblading and inspirational speaking business. Within eight months of trading, she has expanded her business by training in new techniques and selling false eyelashes online. She has also been nominated for an Irish Beauty Award. Now she plans on taking a mentoring and coaching qualification to help others who might be struggling with PTSD.

Apology over EgyptAir Barrymore article,"Barrymore's recent credits include the Netflix series Santa Clarita Diet EgyptAir's in-flight magazine has apologised over an interview with actress Drew Barrymore that was slated on social media after being published. The article went viral after being posted online, with many questioning whether the interview was real. Barrymore's representatives said she ""did not participate"" in the interview, which was notable for a number of grammatical and spelling errors. The publisher now says the confusion was due to translation issues. Ahram Advertising Agency, which publishes the EgyptAir's inflight magazine Horus, said the interview was conducted in English by its Hollywood reporter Aida Takla O'Reilly, then translated into Arabic and subsequently translated back into English. ""We apologise for any misunderstanding that might be interpreted as an offence to the great artist,"" the agency said. The ""surreal"" article was spotted last week. Allow Twitter content?

Salisbury suspect 'decorated by Putin',"CCTV footage issued by the Met Police of the man now identified as Alexander Mishkin The second suspect in the Salisbury poisoning case was a doctor and highly decorated Russian military intelligence officer, an investigative website says. Bellingcat said it used a combination of online material and leaked documents to identify Alexander Mishkin, 39, as a person linked to the attack in March. It said President Vladimir Putin had presented him with the Hero of the Russian Federation award in 2014. When asked about the naming of Dr Mishkin, the Kremlin would not comment. Last month, Bellingcat named the first suspect as Anatoliy Chepiga, a claim also rejected by Russia which says it was not prepared to discuss reports or media articles on the case. At a news conference held in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday, Bellingcat investigator Cristo Grozev said Dr Mishkin - like Mr Chepiga - was a member of the GRU and given the celebrated award for ""actions in Ukraine"". Novichok suspect traced to tiny village The website behind the Skripal revelation Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far He said Dr Mishkin's grandmother has a photograph that has ""been seen by everybody in the village"" of President Putin shaking his hand and giving him the award. The BBC has contacted two people who knew Dr Mishkin as a child in Loyga in the north of Russia, and they confirmed from photographs that he was the man seen in images released by police after the Salisbury attack. Bellingcat has issued three photos of the man identified as Alexander Mishkin, including his passport image Bellingcat, a UK-based website, said both Dr Mishkin's real passport and the false passport he travelled to the UK on in the name of Alexander Petrov carried the same date of birth. Outlining in detail how it identified the Salisbury suspect as Dr Mishkin, Bellingcat said,externalit had pieced together his identity using various databases online, including telephone and car insurance records, and later obtained copies of his passport and driving licence. It also used social media to contact hundreds of people who may have been at military academy with Dr Mishkin. Most people did not respond to the inquiry but one, who requested complete anonymity, said they had recognised Dr Mishkin as the suspect who wasinterviewed under the name of Alexander Petrov by the RT television channel. Mr Grozev said: ""That person told us everybody from his class, his department, was contacted two weeks ago and told not to talk to the media."" Bellingcat said Dr Mishkin completed his medical studies at a faculty which trains doctors for Russia's naval armed forces and around the same period was recruited by the GRU. It said he made several trips to Ukraine, including during the 2013-14 unrest. In spring 2014 mass demonstrations in central Kiev over the government's decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the EU ended in bloodshed and the ousting of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. Soon afterwards Russian troops annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and unrest broke out in mainly Russian-speaking eastern areas of the country. The unrest became a full-scale insurgency, and rebels seized large swathes of territory. Since then, thousands of people have died in fighting between the rebels and Ukrainian government forces. Moscow denies sending regular troops and heavy weapons to the separatists, but admits that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. Dr Mishkin is believed to have lived in this St Petersburg building about a decade ago The tiny village of Loyga in the Russian far north is not the kind of place you would expect to be at the centre of an international spy scandal. With fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, it has rail access but no paved roads. It's too small even to show up on Google Maps. But Loyga has proved crucial to piecing together the story of the real ""Alexander Petrov"" - the second man the UK authorities suspect over the Skripal poisoning case in Salisbury. Read more: Novichok suspect traced to tiny village Former GRU officer Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia survived being poisoned with Novichok on 4 March. The attack left Mr Skripal and Yulia critically ill, but Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. London's Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service said last month that there wasenough evidence to charge Dr Mishkin and Mr Chepigawith attempted murder over the Salisbury attack. Police issued CCTV of the two suspects in Salisbury on the day of the attack on Sergei Skripal Detectives said the pair arrived in the UK using passports bearing the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov on 2 March, although they had said it was likely the men were travelling under aliases. The movements of the suspects, who are alleged to have smeared Novichok on a door handle of Mr Skripal's home, were captured in a series of CCTV images that were released by police. The event sparked a series of accusations and denials between the UK and Russian governments, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent It took longer for investigators at the Bellingcat website to identify Alexander Mishkin because he has an even sparser digital footprint than the first man to be named, Anatoly Chepiga. But using databases and passport details they concluded that this was the real name of the man who came to Salisbury as Alexander Petrov. Facial recognition experts were asked to examine two photos 15 years apart and use techniques of simulated age progression to establish the match. Last Thursday,four GRU officers were exposed for trying to hack into communications of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weaponsin the Netherlands at the time it was investigating the Salisbury poisoning. Dr Mishkin's identification will raise more questions about how easy it has been to expose supposedly undercover intelligence officers and undermine Russia's official account that the two men who came to Salisbury were there to see the cathedral spire. Recent reports in the Russian media suggest that Vladimir Putin - himself a former spy chief - is unhappy with the GRU's performance - and that a purge could be on the way.

"'Neo-nazi' couple named baby after HitlerA couple accused of being in National Action gave their child the middle name Adolf, a court hears.Oxford","Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas gave their child the middle name Adolf, a court has heard A couple accused of being in a banned British Neo-Nazi group named their baby after Hitler, a court has heard. Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, from Banbury, gave their child the middle name Adolf in honour of the infamous dictator, prosecutors claim. Jurors heard the couple were pictured with a convicted racist and ""vehement Nazi"" as he held a Swastika flag and performed a racist salute over their baby. Both deny being members of the group. Barnaby Jameson, prosecuting, told jurors at Birmingham Crown Court that National Action was ""so extreme and violent"" it was banned in 2016. ""Given that the child was born almost a year after National Action was banned, you may think the use of the name 'Adolf' - even as a middle name - was of significance,"" he said. Photographs of the couple's ""close friend"" Darren Fletcher, 28, from Wolverhampton, posing with their child were uncovered during investigations into the group, the court heard. They are on trial alongside Daniel Bogunovic, 27, who is also accused of being a National Action member. Mr Jameson warned jurors the case dealt with ""a world in which any right-thinking person would wish did not exist"". He said the court would hear of ""hate crime committed by National Action members and the ruthlessness with which they were prepared to spread terror"". Mr Bogunovic and Mr Thomas had a ""particular interest"" in owning machetes, he said, and bomb-making instructions were found on Mr Thomas's computer. Mr Jameson said the case was about ""a specific type of terror...born out of fanatical and tribal belief in white supremacy"". Describing the terror as a ""cult of violent white racial supremacy"", Mr Jameson said it regarded groups including black, Jewish, Asian and gay people as ""sub-human"". ""It is a terror that can be summarised in two words: white Jihad - in other words, a white holy war,"" he said. The jury of six men and six women heard Bogunovic was among four men convicted earlier this year of stirring up racial hatred after plastering Aston University campus in Birmingham with National Action stickers. Jurors were also told of the defendants' associations with ""other prominent National Action figures"". Jurors also heard that photos of an ""arsenal"" of weaponry which the ""extremist's extremist"" Mikko Vehvilainen had built up were found on Thomas and Patatas' phones. Thomas also stands accused of a having a terrorist document, namely the Anarchist's Cookbook. Patatas and Thomas,  of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, and Bogunovic, of Crown Hills Rise, Leicester, deny all the charges and the trial, expected to last four weeks, continues.

""I worked in care but used drugs and alcohol out of hours."" Being shot was the wake-up call she needed. ""Although it was a horrific thing to happen, it was a real turning point in my life,"" she tells Newsbeat. The injuries had a huge impact on her body. ""There's still a hole in my femur now, there's plates and screws holding my whole body together."" Jemma still has a bullet in her stomach which will ""probably be with me until the day I die - it doesn't give me any bother,"" she says. ""Some people call me the bionic woman, we have a laugh about it."" Whilst she recovered in hospital, she set herself some goals: ""To become a professional make-up artist and to walk my friend down the aisle."" Three months later, Jemma started walking but she still only had use of one arm. Using social media, she managed to learn and practice her skills. Now 29, she says: ""When I was recovering, I sat and played with make-up. I was watching different YouTube tutorials."" Her friend advised her to join Enterprise, a Prince's Trust programme which helps unemployed young people get going in business. Allow YouTube content?

Jemma says she's had post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and insomnia: ""I was up all night, designing and figuring things out through business ideas and getting them all onto paper."" After leaving the Enterprise programme, Jemma launched #MakeUpUrLife - a make-up, microblading and inspirational speaking business. Within eight months of trading, she has expanded her business by training in new techniques and selling false eyelashes online. She has also been nominated for an Irish Beauty Award. Now she plans on taking a mentoring and coaching qualification to help others who might be struggling with PTSD.

Sturgeon urges 'patience' over indyref2,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""It is now up to us to honour those who went before and win our countryâs independence."" Nicola Sturgeon has called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her SNP conference speech. The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent. She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in 2014. Ms Sturgeon also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless. The first minister was speaking on the final day of the SNP's three-day conference in Glasgow. She used her speech to hit out at ""unfolding calamity"" and ""despair"" at Westminster, contrasting this by painting an independent Scotland as ""a beacon of progressive values"". Brian Taylor: Sturgeon focused on politics of the possible Watch Nicola Sturgeon's speech in full Recap: How Nicola Sturgeon's speech unfolded The SNP leader kicked off the conference by announcing that the party's 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled at Parliament. And she closed it with a speech also packed with constitutional arguments, describing Brexit as a ""serious problem"" and repeatedly promoting the cause of independence. Nicola Sturgeon: ""Never, ever, let anyone tell us that Scotland doesnât have the talent and resources to be a successful independent country."" Ms Sturgeon hailed the ""passion"" of independence supporters,nodding to the tens of thousands who marched through Edinburgh the day before the conference began. And she acknowledged the frustration that has been voiced by some campaigners over the fact that plans for a fresh referendum have not been forthcoming. She said: ""Our job is to take that passion and blend it with pragmatism, perseverance and patience to persuade those not yet persuaded. ""If we do that, then believe me - the momentum for independence will be unstoppable."" In essence, Ms Sturgeon was telling her party two things from an SNP point of view. One, that passion alone is insufficient to achieve their objective. They must operate with a calm, temperate approach. They must be prepared to see the alternative view - to acknowledge and understand those who dislike independence. Secondly, she was making plain that an independence referendum must be deferred - at least until there is clarity over Brexit and possibly substantially beyond that. She was addressing an audience who yearn for independence. They want it tonight, if not sooner. And yet her underlying tone was all about elongation of time scales. Read more from Brian Ms Sturgeon went on to say that ""the future relationship between the UK and the EU will determine the context in which Scotland would become independent"". She said: ""But as we wait - impatiently, at times, I know - for this phase of negotiations to conclude and for the fog of Brexit to clear, be in no doubt about this. ""The last two years have shown why Scotland needs to be independent. And I am more confident than ever that Scotland will be independent."" The UK government has placed itself in opposition to a second referendum either on independence or on Brexit. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said Scotland ""had an independence referendum four years ago and voted decisively to remain in the UK"", adding that ""now is not the time"" for a fresh vote. ""Hope"" is the theme of the SNP conference Ms Sturgeon announced some new policies in her speech, including: increased bursaries for trainee nurses, of up to Â£10,000 by 2020 more money for Social Bite to tackle homelessness a new ""fair work first"" strategy of investment in skills and training and payment of the living wage an ""advanced manufacturing fund"" to help small businesses modernise and grow She also called on the UK government to halt the rollout of Universal Credit ""now"", saying the policy was leaving people unable to eat and urging ministers to ""find some compassion"". Ms Sturgeon said the Westminster administration was a ""shambles"" which ""stumbles from disaster to disaster"", saying that ""a political system that throws up Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson as contenders for Prime Minister has clearly gone very badly wrong"". Brexit 'boosts case for Scottish independence' Sturgeon - SNP MPs would back new Brexit vote Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", she said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"". And she warned any parties ""itching to open up our NHS as part of a trade deal with Donald Trump"" to ""prepare for the political fight of your lives"". The march in Edinburgh is the latest in a series of events to held by All Under One Banner Earlier on Tuesday, the Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, also urged activists to be patient over a second independence referendum, which he said should only take place when voters are ""persuaded, ready and determined to win"". Mr Russell had earlier been confronted by an SNP councillor at a fringe event who said members were ""very frustrated with constantly being told to just wait"", saying there was ""a sense that time is slipping away"". The MSP said: ""Our job as a party and as a government is to both make sure that Scotland flourishes, no matter the circumstances but also to ensure that - at the right moment - the choice of independence can be made. ""The right moment - not the most comfortable moment or the moment that best relieves our natural impatience. The moment at which our country is persuaded, ready and determined to win."" The Scottish Conservatives said that while Ms Sturgeon had called for ""patience"" from her supporters, ""most people lost patience with the SNP a long time ago"". MSP Annie Wells said: ""Astonishingly, in a speech littered with references to independence, there was just a glancing reference to education. ""It was a staggering omission and it tells you all you need to know. Education isn't her number one priority - the only priority the SNP has is separating our country in two."" And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Ms Sturgeon had ""delivered plenty of rhetoric for the party faithful but dodged any detail on the new economic prospectus for separation"". He added: ""The so called 'Growth Commission' - in reality a cuts commission - has been the elephant in the room at the SNP conference. The first minister could not bear to tell her activists that her new plan for independence means a decade of unprecedented austerity."" Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell said that ""independence in the EU is the right choice for Scotland"", saying his party would ""redouble efforts to build a convincing case for this alongside the SNP"". And Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said Ms Sturgeon ""needs to stop trying to turn Brexit into the break-up of the UK"".

Last week, Crown Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News that his government was ""very keen to know what happened to him"", and that Mr Khashoggi had left ""after a few minutes or one hour"". Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins Britain has apparently told the Saudis they need to show Mr Khashoggi is alive, and the best way to do that would be for him to appear on television.

"Salisbury suspect 'decorated by Putin'Online and leaked documents unmasked intelligence officer, investigative website says.UK","CCTV footage issued by the Met Police of the man now identified as Alexander Mishkin The second suspect in the Salisbury poisoning case was a doctor and highly decorated Russian military intelligence officer, an investigative website says. Bellingcat said it used a combination of online material and leaked documents to identify Alexander Mishkin, 39, as a person linked to the attack in March. It said President Vladimir Putin had presented him with the Hero of the Russian Federation award in 2014. When asked about the naming of Dr Mishkin, the Kremlin would not comment. Last month, Bellingcat named the first suspect as Anatoliy Chepiga, a claim also rejected by Russia which says it was not prepared to discuss reports or media articles on the case. At a news conference held in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday, Bellingcat investigator Cristo Grozev said Dr Mishkin - like Mr Chepiga - was a member of the GRU and given the celebrated award for ""actions in Ukraine"". Novichok suspect traced to tiny village The website behind the Skripal revelation Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far He said Dr Mishkin's grandmother has a photograph that has ""been seen by everybody in the village"" of President Putin shaking his hand and giving him the award. The BBC has contacted two people who knew Dr Mishkin as a child in Loyga in the north of Russia, and they confirmed from photographs that he was the man seen in images released by police after the Salisbury attack. Bellingcat has issued three photos of the man identified as Alexander Mishkin, including his passport image Bellingcat, a UK-based website, said both Dr Mishkin's real passport and the false passport he travelled to the UK on in the name of Alexander Petrov carried the same date of birth. Outlining in detail how it identified the Salisbury suspect as Dr Mishkin, Bellingcat said,externalit had pieced together his identity using various databases online, including telephone and car insurance records, and later obtained copies of his passport and driving licence. It also used social media to contact hundreds of people who may have been at military academy with Dr Mishkin. Most people did not respond to the inquiry but one, who requested complete anonymity, said they had recognised Dr Mishkin as the suspect who wasinterviewed under the name of Alexander Petrov by the RT television channel. Mr Grozev said: ""That person told us everybody from his class, his department, was contacted two weeks ago and told not to talk to the media."" Bellingcat said Dr Mishkin completed his medical studies at a faculty which trains doctors for Russia's naval armed forces and around the same period was recruited by the GRU. It said he made several trips to Ukraine, including during the 2013-14 unrest. In spring 2014 mass demonstrations in central Kiev over the government's decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the EU ended in bloodshed and the ousting of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. Soon afterwards Russian troops annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and unrest broke out in mainly Russian-speaking eastern areas of the country. The unrest became a full-scale insurgency, and rebels seized large swathes of territory. Since then, thousands of people have died in fighting between the rebels and Ukrainian government forces. Moscow denies sending regular troops and heavy weapons to the separatists, but admits that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. Dr Mishkin is believed to have lived in this St Petersburg building about a decade ago The tiny village of Loyga in the Russian far north is not the kind of place you would expect to be at the centre of an international spy scandal. With fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, it has rail access but no paved roads. It's too small even to show up on Google Maps. But Loyga has proved crucial to piecing together the story of the real ""Alexander Petrov"" - the second man the UK authorities suspect over the Skripal poisoning case in Salisbury. Read more: Novichok suspect traced to tiny village Former GRU officer Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia survived being poisoned with Novichok on 4 March. The attack left Mr Skripal and Yulia critically ill, but Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. London's Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service said last month that there wasenough evidence to charge Dr Mishkin and Mr Chepigawith attempted murder over the Salisbury attack. Police issued CCTV of the two suspects in Salisbury on the day of the attack on Sergei Skripal Detectives said the pair arrived in the UK using passports bearing the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov on 2 March, although they had said it was likely the men were travelling under aliases. The movements of the suspects, who are alleged to have smeared Novichok on a door handle of Mr Skripal's home, were captured in a series of CCTV images that were released by police. The event sparked a series of accusations and denials between the UK and Russian governments, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent It took longer for investigators at the Bellingcat website to identify Alexander Mishkin because he has an even sparser digital footprint than the first man to be named, Anatoly Chepiga. But using databases and passport details they concluded that this was the real name of the man who came to Salisbury as Alexander Petrov. Facial recognition experts were asked to examine two photos 15 years apart and use techniques of simulated age progression to establish the match. Last Thursday,four GRU officers were exposed for trying to hack into communications of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weaponsin the Netherlands at the time it was investigating the Salisbury poisoning. Dr Mishkin's identification will raise more questions about how easy it has been to expose supposedly undercover intelligence officers and undermine Russia's official account that the two men who came to Salisbury were there to see the cathedral spire. Recent reports in the Russian media suggest that Vladimir Putin - himself a former spy chief - is unhappy with the GRU's performance - and that a purge could be on the way.

Bodyguard is 'airbrushing reality'Victoria writer Daisy Goodwin says the series' unrealistic female representation is problematic.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played To pretend that sexism and racism no longer exists in the Police ""is airbrushing reality"" Daisy Goodwin tells World at One Victoria screenwriter Daisy Goodwin says TV dramas are ""airbrushing reality"" by having too many powerful female characters. She refers to the recent successes of BBC dramas Bodyguard and Killing Eve, which both feature female leads. Both saw women in prominent positions, as the Home Secretary in Bodyguard and as an MI5 agent in Killing Eve. Goodwin told the BBC that these narratives pretended ""sexism and racism in our institutions"" had gone away. Keeley Hawes played the Home Secretary Julia Montague Bodyguard, which was the BBC's most watched drama in 10 years, featured a number of women in high profile roles including Gina McKee as Anne Sampson, head of the Metropolitan Police's counter terrorism unit, and Pippa Haywood as Lorraine Craddock, head of the Met's specialist protection branch. This was alongside Keeley Hawes playing Home Secretary Julia Montague and Anjli Mohindra as suicide bomber Nadia Ali. Killing Eve, written by Fleabag actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge, saw two women go head-to-head - Jodie Comer as assassin Villanelle and Sandra Oh as Eve Polastri, an MI5 agent with a female boss and assistant. Bodyguard David Budd, played by Richard Madden, was outnumbered by women in the series ""There's something slightly troubling about the fact that there's lots of women in power but even the snipers [in Bodyguard] were women,"" Goodwin told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""All the police officers were women and I just don't believe that is necessarily an accurate representation of what goes on in the police at the moment. ""I think its unrealistic to pretend on television that women and men are treated equally and that's not the case,"" Goodwin added. She said it was a ""two way split"" as ""on one hand you want to promote positive role models for little girls but [on the other] let them know it's not that easy and you might have to deal with a lot of negative remarks."" Jodie Comer (top) plays assassin Villanelle, with Sandra Oh as Eve in Killing Eve The ITV writer, who has also written a number of novels, said she thinks progress could be made with more dramas that ""reflect reality and the Me Too debate"". ""I think it's extraordinary that the Me Too scandal erupted a year ago and we have seen nothing on screen that really reflected it. ""It's a much more live issue now than it has ever been.

The White House revolving door,"On Mr Trump's reality TV show, his catchphrase was ""You're fired!"" Donald Trump's old catchphrase was ""you're fired"" - and while he has been president, his senior team has had a very high turnover. Here is a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with the most recent. William Barr will step down on 23 December, President Trump said Mr Barr, 70, came out of semi-retirement in 2019 to replace Jeff Sessions for the cabinet role. During his lengthy legal career, he also served as attorney general under President George HW Bush in the early 1990s. Democratic critics of Mr Barr accused him of shielding his ex-boss from justice. But despite his support for the president, Trump and many of his supporters turned on Mr Barr over his unwillingness to support the president's election lawsuits. His resignation comes into effect on 23 December - less than a month before his term is due to end, when President Trump leaves office. Tensions flared between the two after Mr Barr said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in November's election. He was also criticised by the president for not publicly disclosing during the race that his justice department was investigating Joe Biden's son Hunter. Mr Barr's resignation letter to President Trump began by saying he ""appreciated the opportunity to update"" the president on the Department of Justice's review of voter fraud allegations in the recent election and ""how these allegations will continue to be pursued"". One year, ten months A former Microsoft executive, Mr Krebs had led the agency since its inception in 2018 in the aftermath of alleged Russian interference in 2016's presidential elections. As director he was responsible for improving cybersecurity across all levels of government, and safeguarding the security of the 2020 elections. Mr Krebs had been praised by both Democrats and Republicans for his handling of the latest election. But he reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over aCisa website called Rumor Control,external, which debunked election misinformation, much of it amplified by the president himself. Hours before he was fired, he posted a tweet that appeared to take aim at Mr Trump's allegation that voting machines in various states had switched ballots to Mr Biden. President Trump said he ""terminated"" Mr Krebs for ""highly inaccurate"" remarks on voting integrity. Two years. Mark Esper was appointed in 2019. He replaced an acting secretary of defence who was standing in after James Mattis left in 2018 over differences with Donald Trump on Syria, among other things. Mr Esper's relations with the president turned out to be equally rocky, towards the end at least. He was ""terminated"" in the post in a tweet from Mr Trump, who announced the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christopher Miller, was replacing him. The secretary disagreed with the president on a number of issues, most publicly on the use of active-duty military forces to quell street protests. Mr Esper was also far more conciliatory towards Nato than Mr Trump. Mr Esper had reportedly been preparing to resign - or to be sacked - since the president's election defeat. Just short of 17 months. Mrs Conway served as Donald Trump's campaign manager in the three months up to his election in November 2016. She then became senior counsellor at the White House, and one of the president's closest advisers. She became noted for her colourful and high-profile defences of the president, and her sparring with journalists. She said she wanted to spend more time focusing on her children. Her decision to step down came hours after one of her daughters, Claudia, tweeted that her mother's job had ""ruined [her] life"" - a message that later went viral. Among Mrs Conway's many colourful lines, one of the most famous was ""alternative facts"", the phrase she used to describe then White House press secretary Sean Spicer's highly questioned figures about the number of people attending Mr Trump's inauguration. Four years, first as election campaign manager, then senior adviser. Mr Parscale served as digital media director for Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The 44-year-old was promoted to campaign manager for the president's 2020 re-election bid in February 2018. He has been a warm-up act for Mr Trump at rallies. Mr Parscale has reportedly been blamed by the US president's inner circle for a poorly attended rally in Oklahoma in June. He boasted that more than one million people registered to attend the event, but the local fire department said fewer than 6,200 showed up. Mr Parscale blamed a blocked security gate, protesters and the media for the disappointing turnout. Mr Trump announced on social media that Mr Parscale was being replaced by Bill Stepien, a former aide to ex-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The president did not offer any reasons for the decision and praised Mr Parscale's work on digital and data strategies. Two years, five months. Mr Parscale is still working as a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Mr Mulvaney assumed the role of acting White House chief of staff in January 2019. He previously served as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Despite his key White House roles, he was never part of the Trump inner circle. My Mulvaney's departure had been long rumoured and followed some high-profile slip-ups. Most notably, he was perceived to have implicated the president in the impeachment inquiry in an off-the-cuff remark at the White House podium, in which he shrugged off criticism over an alleged corrupt deal with Ukraine by saying: ""We do that all the time."" Mr Trump was reportedly outraged by the gaffe. In a written statement, Mr Mulvaney said: ""Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election."" Mr Trump announced on 6 March that Mr Mulvaney was being replaced by North Carolina lawmaker Mark Meadows. One year, two months. Mr Mulvaney is now working as US special envoy to Northern Ireland. Mr Sondland was appointed as US ambassador to the European Union in June 2018. Before entering into politics, he was best known as a multi-millionaire hotelier. He originally backed a Trump rival in the 2016 presidential race, but when Mr Trump was elected, he donated $1m (Â£781,000) to his inaugural committee. Mr Sondland was fired after testifying against Mr Trump in the impeachment proceedings. In his testimony, he accused the president of seeking a ""quid pro quo"" with Ukraine. On 7 February, Mr Sondland said he had been advised that the president intended ""to recall [him] effective immediately"". In a statement issued by his lawyer, he said: ""I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo for his consistent support, and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the US mission to the European Union."" Just over one and a half years. Lt Col Alexander Vindman is a decorated Iraq war veteran who served as the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council. He was born in Ukraine, then a Soviet republic, and moved to the US with his family when he and his twin brother, Yevgeny, were aged three. Lt Col Vindman's lawyer said he was fired after testifying as a witness in Mr Trump's impeachment case. His lawyer said he was escorted from the White House, while his twin brother, a senior lawyer for the National Security Council, was also sent back to the Department of the Army. During the impeachment proceedings, Lt Col Vindman described a phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart as ""improper"" and said it had left him in ""shock"". Mr Trump defended the decisionto fire him, describing the Ukraine expert as ""very insubordinate"". He said Lt Col Vindman had incorrectly reported the contents of a ""perfect"" phone call. One year, seven months. Lt Col Vindman announced in July that he had retired from the military after 21 years of service because his future would be ""forever limited"". His lawyer said the 45-year-old had been the victim of a ""campaign of bullying, intimidation and retaliation"" by the president. Mr Spencer, a former Marines pilot-turned-investment banker, was sworn in as the 76th secretary of the US Navy in August 2017. During his time in the post, he also performed stints as acting secretary of defence and deputy secretary of defence. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said he asked Mr Spencer to resign over ""his lack of candour"" regarding the case of a Navy Seal convicted of posing with a corpse while serving in Iraq. The case of Edward Gallagherhas sparked tensions between US President Donald Trump and military officials. The president reinstated Chief Petty Officer Gallagher's rank after he was demoted following his conviction, and later hit out at plans to hold a disciplinary review that could have resulted in him being stripped of his Seals membership. In a statement announcing the firing, Mr Esper alleged Mr Spencer had proposed a deal with the White House behind his back to resolve the case. Mr Trump, however, said he was not happy with ""cost overruns"" and how Gallagher's trial was run, and suggested this was why Mr Spencer was fired. In his resignation letter, Mr Spencer said it was apparent that he and Mr Trump did not have the same view of ""good order and discipline"". ""I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took,"" he wrote. Two years, three months. Before joining the cabinet, Mr McAleenan worked as commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection. He oversaw the president's tough policies aimed at curbing immigration across the Mexican border. In a tweet, President Donald Trump said Mr McAleenan wanted to ""spend more time with his family and go into the private sector."" During his tenure, analysts described a turbulent relationship between the two. Mr McAleenan has also criticised the ""uncomfortable"" tone of debate about immigration in America. Six months Mr Bolton assumed the post in April 2018, becoming Mr Trump's third national security adviser after Michael Flynn and HR McMaster. At that time, the president's decision to appoint Mr Bolton came as a surprise. He remained an unapologetic cheerleader of the 2003 Iraq war, which the US president himself once lambasted as ""a big mistake"". Mr Bolton was praised, however, by conservative admirers as a straight-talking foreign policy ""hawk"". Mr Trump announced Mr Bolton's departure in a tweet, writing that his national security adviser's services were ""no longer needed"". But Mr Bolton quickly fired back, writing on Twitter that he had actually offered his resignation, but Mr Trump had told him ""let's talk about it tomorrow"". Mr Bolton's exit follows an argument with Mr Trump over the administration's peace talks with the Taliban. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters: ""[The president] didn't like a lot of his policies, they disagree."" According to White House sources, the National Security Council - which advises the president - had become a separate entity during Mr Bolton's tenure. A former senior Trump administration official, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that Mr Bolton did not attend meetings, and followed his own initiatives. ""He's running his own show,"" said the official. One year, four months. Just a few days after his departure, Mr Bolton resumed his former job as the head of two political action committees: the John Bolton PAC and John Bolton Super PAC. So-called PACs promote the views of their members on selected issues, and have become an important tool for funnelling large funds into the political process and influencing elections. Mr Bolton released a book in June 2020 - The Room Where it Happened -about his time in the White House. In it, he paints a picture of a president ignorant of basic geopolitical facts and whose decisions were frequently driven by a desire for re-election. The White House had sought to block the book's release citing national security concerns. Read more: Ten biggest claims in John Bolton's Donald Trump book As director of national intelligence, Mr Coats oversaw all 17 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA. His office also had the authority to receive whistleblower complaints and decide if they should be referred to Congress. But Mr Coats' assessments were routinely contradicted by President Trump, who has been critical of the US intelligence community. In January, the president called his intelligence chiefs passive and naive in their assessment of the threat posed by Iran. On 28 July, President Donald Trump tweeted Mr Coats would step down in mid-August and Texas congressman John Ratcliffe would be nominated to replace him. In his resignation letter to the president, Mr Coats said America's intelligence community had become ""stronger than ever"" during his two-and-half-year tenure. ""As a result, I now believe it is time for me to move on to the next chapter of my life,"" he wrote. Mr Coats, a former senator and diplomat, said in February the president had asked him to stay in the post, yet their differences on foreign policy appeared irreconcilable at times. But the timing of his removal has been questioned by critics. The announcement came three days after a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which was the subject of a whistleblower complaint. The White House released a rough transcript of the call which shows Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic frontrunner for the 2020 presidential elections. Two and a half years. Mr Acosta, a former federal prosecutor, was sworn in as Secretary in April 2017 - the first Hispanic appointee to the Cabinet. He was chosen for the role after Mr Trump's first choice, fast-food billionaire Andrew Puzder, withdrew. During his tenure, Mr Acosta oversaw initiatives to expand on promote workplace apprenticeships. But he was criticised for proposing massive cuts to the International Labor Affairs Bureau, a section of the department that combats human trafficking, child labour and forced labour. Mr Acosta had been defending his role in a 2008 plea deal that saw a light sentence for financier Jeffrey Epstein after he pleaded guilty to prostitution charges. Epstein was charged in July with new sex trafficking charges related to that case. Top Democrats had called on Mr Acosta to resign for engaging in ""an unconscionable agreement"" with Epstein. Mr Acosta said he negotiated the deal to ensure Epstein did not walk free, and that he was happy about the new case moving forward. While announcing his resignation, the former US attorney from Florida said he felt the ""right thing was to step aside"" so his past controversies would not overshadow the administration's accomplishments. Mr Trump, who stood next to Mr Acosta while he spoke to reporters, noted: ""This was him, not me."" He said Mr Acosta was ""a great Labour Secretary"". Just over two years. Ms Sanders started out as deputy press secretary before replacing Sean Spicer in the top post - the third woman to ever hold the White House role. While Press Secretary, she was accused of lying to journalists and frequently criticised the media for spreading ""fake news"" about the Trump administration. Press briefings also became increasingly rare during her tenure as Mr Trump took charge of his own messaging. Mrs Sanders hosted fewer news conferences than any of the preceding 13 press secretaries, according to the American Presidency Project. Exact reasons are unclear, but President Trump announced her resignation on Twitter and lauded her as a ""warrior"". During her resignation speech, Ms Sanders said her role had been ""the honour of a lifetime"". Nearly two years. Ms Sanders is a regular contributor on television news channel Fox News, and is active among conservative groups. Rod Rosenstein eventually submitted a resignation letter, effective from 11 May, after months of rumours about his departure. It came shortly after the release of the report into claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election - an investigation he oversaw. Reports say he specially timed his departure to allow for Robert Mueller's probe to wind down first. His relationship with the president was always publicly fraught - with the lawyer frequently coming under fire on Mr Trump's Twitter feed. There were even reports in 2018 that Mr Rosenstein at one point planned to secretly record the president in order to justify his removal under the 25th amendment of the US constitution. Despite this, Mr Rosenstein's resignation letter paid tribute to Mr Trump. In it, Rosenstein said he was ""grateful"" for the opportunity to serve under him and even signed it off borrowing his campaign slogan of ""America first"". Just over two years from his confirmation. Kirstjen Nielsen became Homeland Security Secretary in December 2017. Her sprawling department, responsible for domestic security, covers everything from borders to responding to national emergencies. She faced criticism for enforcing some of the most controversial elements of President Trump's domestic agenda, such as the separation of children from their migrant parents at the Mexican border. In a resignation letter she said it was the ""right time for me to step aside"". There have been tensions between her and the president for months, who blamed her for a rise in migrants at the Mexican border. Days earlier President Trump withdrew his nominee to lead another key department dealing with immigration, saying he wanted to go in a ""tougher direction"". It is widely thought he wants someone ""tougher"" at Homeland Security too. 16 months. Six months after her resignation, the White House announced that she would be rejoining the Homeland Security department as a member of its National Infrastructure Advisory Council. In June 2020, the Australian government announced that it had hired her to help prepare a cyber security strategy. Brock Long was appointed administrator of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency by President Trump in April 2017 and confirmed by the Senate two months later. Fema is responsible for co-ordinating the response to disasters and in his tenure he oversaw 220 of them. He was quickly battered by two hurricanes. Harvey hit Texas with catastrophic effect in August 2017, while Maria a month later devastated Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US. He was one of those who bore heavy criticism for the response afforded to Puerto Rico. Mr Long gave no explicit reason for his departure, saying in a statement that it was ""time to go home to my family"". During his tenure, he was investigated for using government vehicles to commute from his home in North Carolina to Washington. He was later ordered to pay back the government $151,000 (Â£117,000) for the cost of several private journeys he claimed on expenses. 21 months from confirmation. Mr Long is executive chairman of Hagerty Consulting, an emergency management consultancy firm where he worked before joining FEMA. A former Navy SEAL, Ryan Zinke was picked to lead the agency that oversees federal land, including national parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone. He served as a congressman in his home state of Montana before the cabinet appointment. President Trump tweeted that Mr Zinke would be leaving the administration at the end of 2018. He did not offer any further details and it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired. ""Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation,"" Mr Trump said. Mr Zinke was under a number of investigations for his conduct in office.They include a land deal in Montana,externalinvolving Mr Zinke and the chairman of oilfield services Halliburton. Almost two years. In January 2019, Mr Zinke became managing director of Artillery One, an investment firm specialising in the technology and energy sectors. While details of the role are unclear, the company said Mr Zinke would help to ""pursue investing and development opportunities globally"". The retired Marine general was initially nominated to oversee Homeland Security before Mr Trump promoted him to chief of staff in July 2017, replacing Reince Priebus. However, on 8 December Mr Trump announced that Gen Kelly would leave his post by the end of the year. Key Trump aide John Kelly to leave job By December 2018 his relationship with the president was said to have deteriorated, with some reports saying the pair were no longer on speaking terms. Earlier in the year Mr Kelly was forced to deny that he had called Mr Trump an ""idiot"" after the quote was included in a book by the veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward. About one year, five months. (He was previously Homeland Security secretary from January to July 2017.) Mr Kelly serves on the board of Caliburn International, a professional services firm where we worked . The professional services company has several government contracts, including one to operate a migrant detention centre in Florida. A distinguished former Marine Corps general, Gen Mattis served in the Gulf War, the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War. Before his retirement in 2013 he served as head of US Central Command, and went on to several private sector roles before being tapped to join President Trump's cabinet. He positioned himself as one of the cooler heads throughout the president's term, and was referenced by Democrats and Republicans alike as a ""grown-up"" in the room - a far cry from his ""Mad Dog Mattis"" nickname. The move came just one day after the president controversially announced the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. Although not referring directly to that, in his resignation letter Gen Mattis said the president had the right to have a defence secretary ""whose views are better aligned"" with his. The two had diverging public views on a number of subjects, including Mr Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,"" Gen Mattis wrote. President Trump was so angered with the letter than he accelerated Gen Mattis' departure date and said he was ""essentially fired."" Just under two years. Gen Mattis has returned to his former role as Fellow at the Hoover Institution - a think tank based at Stanford University. As a Fellow, the institute said he plans ""to focus his research and writing on domestic and international security policy."" In June 2020, he denounced Mr Trump's use of military force to quell anti-racism protests near the White House, and accused his former boss of setting up a ""false conflict"" between the military and civilian society. The former governor of South Carolina was the first non-white woman to be appointed to Mr Trump's cabinet, and the first female, minority governor of her state. She had limited foreign policy experience prior to her role as US envoy and was a vocal critic of Mr Trump during his campaign. As ambassador, she affirmed sanctions on Russia would continue, and that the US military could be deployed in the response to North Korean missile tests. But she frequently clashed with the president over several foreign policy issues, including a proposed ban on immigration to the US from several Muslim-majority countries. Trump names former critic as UN envoy In a news conference with Mr Trump, Mrs Haley announced she was stepping aside after a ""rough"" eight years as governor and envoy. She will be leaving her post at the end of 2018, but said she did not yet know what her next steps would be. Mrs Haley said she wanted to make sure Mr Trump's administration ""has the strongest person to fight"" for the US at the UN. While accepting her resignation, Mr Trump thanked her and said she did a ""terrific job"", making the role ""very glamorous"". One year, eleven months In April 2019, Ms Haley began sitting on the board of directors at Boeing. Critics suggested that she received the appointment as a reward for the tax breaks and subsidies which Boeing received while she was governor. The following March, the company announced that she had resigned because she opposed their move to seek financial support from the government amid the coronavirus crisis. The Alabama Republican was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump's presidential candidacy, in early 2016. During the campaign, he became one of Mr Trump's closest national security advisers and, in government, was a supporter of the president's policies on immigration and law enforcement. Mr Sessions became a frequent target of the president's ire as soon as he stepped aside, in March 2017, from the investigation over alleged Russian collusion with Mr Trump's campaign. The recusal allowed his deputy Rod Rosenstein to oversee the inquiry, which led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. At various times, Mr Trump publicly belittled Mr Sessions as ""beleaguered"", ""VERY weak"", and ""DISGRACEFUL"". But Mr Sessions reacted to most of the insults in silence. US media reported that Gen Kelly had called Mr Sessions to say the president wanted him to step down. Mr Trump did not speak to Mr Sessions himself, and announced the departure on Twitter. In his resignation letter, Mr Sessions made clear the decision was not his own, saying: ""Dear Mr President, at your request I am submitting my resignation."" One year, nine months In July 2020, Mr Sessions lost the Republican nomination for his old Senate seat in Alabama, losing to a candidate backed by Mr Trump. Mr Trump tweeted his delight at the result. Conceding defeat, Mr Sessions said he still had no regrets over recusing himself from the investigations into allegations of Russian interference. The lawyer served as the attorney general of Oklahoma from 2011 - 2017. He had sued the EPA, the agency which he presided over, a number of times in his role as the state's attorney general. Donald Trump announced that Mr Pruitt had resigned due to ""unrelenting attacks"" on himself and his family. Since taking office, Mr Pruitt was mired in series of scandals concerning his spending habits and alleged misuse of office, and is the subject of at least a dozen investigations into his conduct. He angered many liberals and environmentalists by severely curtailing the agency's activities and repealing many measures designed to protect the environment. The long list of Scott Pruitt controversies While accepting Mr Pruitt's resignation, Mr Trump tweeted that he had done ""an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him"". One year, four months A lieutenant general with the US Army, HR McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive. He replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job after he misled Vice-President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Time magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he ""might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker"". Mr Trump reportedly disliked his ""gruff and condescending"" manner and the pair reportedly disagreed on the administration's policy towards Russia, North Korea and Iran. Gen Kelly, White House chief of staff at the time, also had little positive to say about him. Thirteen months. Gen McMaster works as a fellow and lecturer at Stanford University. He is also a board member of Spirit of America, a charity which ""improves the safety and success"" of US military personnel and diplomats deployed abroad. In 2020, he is set to release a memoir called ""Battlegrounds"". The former president of the Goldman Sachs bank was appointed as head of the National Economic Council as Mr Trump took office, so becoming the president's top economic adviser. In his time at the White House, he helped push through sweeping reforms on taxes, one of the most significant policy achievements of the administration. But the two were not reported to be close, and rumours of Mr Cohn's departure continued to swirl. A staunch globalist, Mr Cohn had reportedly vowed to quit if Mr Trump pressed ahead with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US. According to US media, Mr Cohn initially planned to resign after Mr Trump blamed ""both sides"" for violence at a deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. Fourteen months. Since leaving, Mr Cohn has become a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Mr Tillerson was the first Secretary of State to be appointed under the Trump administration. A former oil executive, Mr Tillerson pushed for an end to sanctions on Russia and for the resumption of peace talks with North Korea. But his tenure was reportedly mired by clashes with the president over policy, and by the resignation of several high-ranking career diplomats. Mr Trump said his differences with Mr Tillerson came down to personal ""chemistry"". Indications of the pair's deteriorating relationship first surfaced after reports that Mr Tillerson had called the president a ""moron"". The comment was allegedly made after Mr Trump had pushed for a tenfold increase in America's nuclear arsenal. In a subsequent media appearance, the president challenged Mr Tillerson to ""compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win"". President Trump announced his departure in a tweet, though Mr Tillerson's spokesperson said he had not told about it beforehand. Fourteen months. Ms Hicks served as Mr Trump's press secretary and handled media requests during his campaign. She became his fourth director of strategic communications for the Trump White House after Anthony Scaramucci was fired after just 10 days in the job. The fashion model-turned-spokeswoman previously worked as a publicist for Ivanka Trump's fashion label before entering politics with Mr Trump's bid for the White House. Her resignation came a day after she testified to a congressional panel investigating Russian influence on the 2016 election, telling them she had occasionally told ""white lies"" for her boss. Her departure came only weeks after another top aide to Mr Trump, Rob Porter - with whom Ms Hicks was reported to have been in a relationship - quit amid allegations by two ex-wives of abuse. Six years in the Trump Organization, and three years with Mr Trump during his campaign and presidency. After leaving the White House, Ms Hicks became chief communications officer at Fox Corporation, an American broadcasting firm. In February 2020, she returned to the White House, taking on the role of counsellor to the president and reporting to Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. A doctor and former healthcare executive, Mr Shulkin had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama. President Trump had hailed him as ""fantastic"" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team. Mr Shulkin had come under fire for alleged improper behaviour by department staff on a trip to Europe in 2017, including his own acceptance of tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament. He denied wrongdoing but agreed to reimburse the government for his wife's air fare for the trip. Mr Shulkin won praise from veterans' groups, but his lack of action on privatising the Veterans Health Administration had angered conservatives. In parting, he condemned the ""toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive"" environment in Washington. Fourteen months In October 2019, the former VA Secretary published a book tracing his 13 months in the Trump administration. Rob Porter, pictured holding the document for President Trump, was accused of abuse by his two ex-wives A former political aide, Mr Porter was described as Mr Trump's ""right-hand man"" during his tenure. As Staff Secretary he helped to manage the flow of paperwork reaching Trump, from policy memos to speeches and news briefing documents. He was also responsible for circulating documents among senior staff for comment. Mr Porter resigned soon after two of his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical and emotional abuse. One, Colbie Holderness, supplied a photo of herself with a black eye to the media. He denies all the accusations of abuse. The Daily Mail, which broke the story, reported that Mr Porter did not receive security clearance for his White House job after the FBI interviewed his ex-wives during background checks. After his resignation, questions quickly arose over how early the president's chief of staff, Gen Kelly, had been made aware of the accusations by the FBI, and if they had played a role in his diminished security clearance. One year. Since leaving, the Daily Mail reported that Mr Porter was secretly hired to help with President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the campaign's chief operating officer, Michael Glassner, denied the accusation. Andrew McCabe, a career FBI agent, served as the bureau's acting director for nearly three months after the president sacked James Comey. He was sacked days before he could retire with pension rights. The attorney has faced repeated criticism from President Trump, who claims his ties to Democrats made him partial in the ongoing Russia investigation. His wife, Jill McCabe, ran a failed Democratic bid for a state senate seat in Virginia in 2015, during which she received $500,000 (Â£355,000) from a political action group allied with Hillary Clinton - a move which Mr Trump apparently found unforgiveable. He was fired by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said an internal review found he leaked information and misled investigators. Mr McCabe denied the claims and said he was being targeted because of his involvement in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Before his departure, he had been under an internal investigation into the FBI's handling of two key inquiries during the 2016 presidential campaign: the revelations that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server while secretary of state; and suspicions that Russia was interfering to help Mr Trump win the presidency. Two years as FBI deputy director, including a year under Mr Trump's administration. Mr McCabe has retired from the FBI and is a contributor to news broadcaster CNN. The former Georgia congressman was a long-standing opponent of the Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare. Mr Price was confirmed by the Senate along party lines, amid allegations of insider trading while he worked on healthcare laws - which he denied. As health secretary, Mr Price was involved in President Trump's repeated failures to push through bills repealing Obamacare. An analysis of transport spending by Politico discovered that Mr Price had, between May and late September, spent more than $1m on flights. Some $500,000 of that was on military flights approved by the White House, but private charter flights made up at least $400,000 where commercial flights were available. Mr Trump said he was ""not happy"". Almost eight months. Steve Bannon joined the Trump campaign after leading the right-wing Breitbart News website, which rose to prominence through its attacks on mainstream Republicans, as well as those on the left. The website helped to elevate the so-called ""Alt-right"", which critics label a white supremacist group. Like other aides to Mr Trump, he made his fortune as an investment banker, but later turned to financing film and television programmes such as the popular 90s sitcom Seinfeld. Some of Mr Trump's most influential advisers, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been pushing for his departure for months. His firing came amid a public backlash to Mr Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which an anti-racist protester was killed by a 20-year-old man with Nazi sympathies. Fired one year after being named campaign chief. After his departure, Mr Bannon briefly rejoined Breitbart News as executive chairman. He drew ire from President Trump after the publication of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury, which detailed several comments made by Mr Bannon that were critical of the administration. Mr Bannon remains active within politics and has served as an informal advisor to right-wing parties across Europe, Brazil and Israel. As part of this work he co-founded of The Movement, a Brussels-based organisation helping to promote the election of right-wing populist parties across Europe. The brash, Wall Street bigwig has known President Trump for years, and defended him in TV interviews. While in the job, he appeared to accuse then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him. Mr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine. Although he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's outbursts may have cost him any post alongside Gen Kelly, who was replacing Reince Priebus as chief of staff. Mr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Gen Kelly was sworn-in. Ten days (although his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus 15 days.) Mr Scaramucci is a contributor to several media outlets and has founded his own media group, The Scaramucci Post. He is also a trustee of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Foundation. Mr Scaramucci has been a vocal critic of President Trump since his departure, and has been the target of several visceral tweets by the commander-in-chief. The former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority. He grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, played key roles. President Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak. The announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Six months. Mr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. Over the course of his time behind the podium he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live. Unlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president. He stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be ""too many cooks in the kitchen"". Six months. Mr Spicer is a public affairs officer with the US Navy and was appointed by President to serve on the US Naval Academy's Board of Visitors. He has also written a book called The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President in which he referred to Trump as ""unicorn riding a unicorn across a rainbow"". In a surprise public appearance, he entered as a contestant on popular TV show Dancing with the Stars in 2019. Mr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. He was criticised first by Democrats for the timing, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought. The president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation. However Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a ""showboat"" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking of the ""Russia thing"" when he made the decision to sack him. Three years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump. Since leaving he has been highly critical of the Trump administration. In August 2019, a Department of Justice report concluded that, after losing his job, Mr Comey divulged unclassified information from a memo he had written on his private conversations with Mr Trump. It ruled that he broke FBI rules by giving the contents of a memo to a friend so that it could be shared with a reporter. But the inspector general did not recommend Mr Comey be sued for the breach. Technically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president. His departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Mr Flynn has admitted to lying to the FBI about their pair discussing US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak. 23 days. Mr Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI.In June 2020, a federal court moved to dismiss charges against him. The president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Ms Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order. A White House statement said Ms Yates had ""betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States"". It also described her as ""weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration"". 10 days. She previously served as deputy attorney general from May 2015 until January 2017. Ms Yates is a partner at law firm King & Spalding, and lectures at Georgetown University Law Centre. It is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on. At the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News. Mr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard. But there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president. Seven years, seven months. Less than two months under Mr Trump. Mr Bharara is a Scholar in Residence at New York University Law School, and co-hosts a legal podcast called ""Cafe Insider"". Paul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it. He was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair. The Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a statement wishing him well. But a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US. He has since been jailed for hiding $55m (Â£42m) from US tax authorities - money he was paid by pro-Russia politicians. Three months. Manafort is serving a more than seven-year sentence for fraud. He was released from prison in May 2020 after his lawyers argued that he was at high risk of contracting coronavirus. He is serving the rest of his sentence under home confinement.

Loneliness threatens young as well as old,"The loneliness strategy will be aimed at all age groups, not just the elderly Loneliness should be recognised as a problem for all age groups, says Tracey Crouch, the minister about to reveal England's first loneliness strategy. She says there needs to be a ""national conversation"" to end the stigma about admitting to feeling lonely. ""The government can't make friends for us,"" she told a conference in London. But Ms Crouch said the strategy will help to improve ""social connections"" and to get better evidence about what really works in reducing loneliness. The loneliness minister says attitudes to taking loneliness seriously are ""where we were with mental health a decade ago"". The loneliness strategy, commissioned by the prime minister and expected next week, will not be focused on the elderly, but would recognise how feelings of loneliness could deeply affect people at many times in their lives. ""It's a common misconception that it only happens in later life,"" the minister told a conference organised by the Campaign to End Loneliness, supported by a coalition of charities. Tracey Crouch is the first minister for loneliness Ms Crouch said she had been shocked by the negative impact of isolation, which can affect young people, new parents, the bereaved, those who had lost touch with their family, as well as those in old age. The minister for loneliness said it was a major health problem that needed to be tackled as much as smoking or obesity. I'm surrounded by people but feel so lonely Loneliness more likely to affect young people Loneliness - the last taboo The strategy will work across departments, including transport, education and health. The minister recognised that some local services which could reduce loneliness have been affected by austerity. ""Decisions taken at central government level and local government level may well have impacted some people's connectivity in their communities. ""There's no point pretending that has not happened,"" said Ms Crouch. The strategy will also try to create a clearer picture of the extent of the problem. The minister said the Office for National Statistics would produce a more ""consistent"" definition for measuring loneliness, which would provide better evidence on what works in reducing it. But Ms Crouch told the conference that loneliness was rising up the political agenda. ""The government now recognises loneliness as one of the biggest health challenges we face.""

Google phones launch in privacy storm,"Google has opted to keep to one rear camera on the new phones despite an industry trend for two or more Google has launched its latest smartphones under the shadow of a data exposure scandal. The Pixel 3 handsets introduce new photography features including a much higher-quality digital zoom than before. The company suggests the innovation shows it has no need to place more than one camera on the handsets' rear. The launch comes a dayafter it emerged that a Google+ bug,externalwas not made public when it was discovered in the Spring. The flaw led to personal data belonging to 500,000 members of the social network not being properly protected. Google has announced it is now ending access to the service to the wider public. The smaller Pixel 3 has a 5.5in screen while the Pixel 3 XL has a 6.3in display - both larger than last year's models The Pixel phones will not be directly affected by the move, but do make use of several of the firm's cloud-based technologies including Google Photos - an image storage service that was spun out from Google+ three years ago. One industry-watcher said part of the company's motivation for offering the Pixel 3 and larger Pixel 3 XL was to promote ""the best of Google"", adding that the message would now be harder to convey. ""The value proposition of Pixel is not just the hardware but the whole Google experience,"" explained Carolina Milanesi from the consultancy Creative Strategies. ""If you're starting to question Google and whether or not you want to be entrenched in its services, then the value that you'll see in the handsets will decline."" Despite positive reviews for previous editions of the Pixel, they have been niche products. This year's Pixel event was introduced by hardware chief Rick Osterloh rather than chief executive Sundar Pichai Google attained a peak smartphone market share of just 0.53% in the final three months of 2017, according to market research firm IDC, and has since seen that drop to 0.14%. Many of the benefits of the new phones are derived from them comingwith the latest version of Androidand integrating Google's services more seamlessly. For example, the firm's virtual assistant can now be triggered by squeezing the devices' sides. But the Pixel team also hopes several photography-related features will have special appeal. Unusually, the handsets now have more cameras on their fronts than rears. A second wide-angle lens has been added to the phones' face to make it easier to take group shots without the need for a selfie stick. Software is automatically applied to the resulting images to correct for distortions. Google says the Pixel 3 can capture 184% more of the scene in a selfie than Apple's iPhone XS In addition, algorithms originally developed for thefirm's standalone Clips camerahave been integrated to automatically take photos at the best moment - for example just as subjects smile or open their eyes - to avoid the need for a button tap. However, the firm has kept to a single rear camera on both models despite a trend among other firms to build more into their premium models. The Galaxy S9 and iPhone XS, for example, have two back cameras. Huawei's P20 Pro and LG's V40 have three. Lenovo is teasinga four-camera module,external. And leaks suggestNokia is working on a phone with five,external. One advantage of having more lenses is that each can offer a different focal length, letting users optically zoom in without a substantial loss in quality. But Google's Super Res mode aims to emulate this using digital zoom alone. The Pixel 3 does not feature the notch found on the larger model as its screen covers less of the front It does this by first sampling pixels taken from slightly different points-of-view, captured as a result of small vibrations in the owner's hand. It then uses software to combine the information into a higher-resolution image from which the cropped-in view is extracted. If the phone is locked to a tripod or otherwise steadied, the camera sensor's image stabiliser slightly moves it about to get the same effect. A second computational photography mode called Night Sight is also promised as a future update to take photos in low-light conditions without a flash. It works by taking several frames at different exposures and then merging the data together while using machine learning-trained software to add back colour. Night Sight uses artificial intelligence to add colour to low light photos This approach contrasts with that of Samsung, which introduced a dual-aperture lens to allow more light in when required. The executive responsible, Mario Queiroz, said Google had deliberately sought out software-based solutions. ""You can brute-force your way to functionality by putting in a bunch of hardware,"" he explained. ""But I think you may be wasting hardware in that case and potentially making your phone more costly."" One expert suggested this approach could backfire. ""Despite the fact Google has already proved that having a single lens offering exceptional performance can pay off, to the uneducated consumer there's a natural assumption that two lenses are better and three lenses spectacularly so,"" commented Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. An optional stand for the phones unlocks extra functionality Other new features include: Top Shot - a facility that automatically tries to identify the best image from a burst of photographs taken in quick succession Sunrise Mode - a feature that changes the colour of the screen to mimic dawn ahead of a morning wake-up alarm, if the phone is placed in an optional dock Duplex -a robo-calling technology unveiled in May- will start making restaurant-booking phone calls on Pixel owners' behalf in four US cities before the year's end Titan - a new chip that secures biometric and other data, which Google says should make the devices harder to hack The Pixel 3 starts at Â£739 - slightly less than the iPhone XR - while the Pixel 3 XL starts at Â£869 - slightly more than Samsung's Galaxy Note 9. They will be released in the US next week, and Europe at the start of November. Top Shot recommends which frame to select from a series of images taken in sequence The firm also showed off a new Chrome OS tablet - the Slate - which comes with a detachable keyboard similar to that of Microsoft's Surface. In addition, its smart speaker range gained a screen-based model called the Home Hub, which will compete with Amazon's Echo Show. Google said it had deliberately built the device without a camera in order to reduce privacy concerns around positioning it in personal places like the bedroom. Google also unveiled a tablet and screen-enabled smart speaker in addition to its phones Ms Milanesi said it was an example of a tech firm making ""choices based on the level of trust in its brand"" rather than what was technologically possible. Unlike its competitor, the Home Hub provides access to YouTube.

"NHS waste scandal firm loses contractsHealthcare Environmental Services had been collecting clinical waste, including body parts.Health","A firm has been stripped of NHS contracts after hundreds of tonnes of clinical waste from hospitals was allowed to pile up at its sites. Health Minister Stephen Barclay said new arrangements have been made to replace the service by Healthcare Environmental Services (HES). HES says although it did also collect some body parts, this anatomical waste was correctly stored as per guidelines. It removed waste from a number of hospitals in England and Scotland. The Environment Agency first raised the alarm about the problem at the end of July, the government said. The government says there was ""absolutely no risk"" posed to the health of patients or the wider public. In a statement to Parliament, Mr Barclay said NHS Improvement concluded that HES ""failed to demonstrate that they were operating within their contractual limits. ""Consequently, 15 NHS Trusts served termination notices to HES formally to terminate their contracts at 4pm on Sunday,"" he said. New arrangements have been made with Mitie to ""step in and replace this service"" and ""NHS services continue to operate as normal"", Mr Barclay told MPs. Mr Barclay said the primary concern was that too much waste was being held in a number of waste storage and treatment sites by HES.

NHS waste scandal firm loses contracts,"A firm has been stripped of NHS contracts after hundreds of tonnes of clinical waste from hospitals was allowed to pile up at its sites. Health Minister Stephen Barclay said new arrangements have been made to replace the service by Healthcare Environmental Services (HES). HES says although it did also collect some body parts, this anatomical waste was correctly stored as per guidelines. It removed waste from a number of hospitals in England and Scotland. The Environment Agency first raised the alarm about the problem at the end of July, the government said. The government says there was ""absolutely no risk"" posed to the health of patients or the wider public. In a statement to Parliament, Mr Barclay said NHS Improvement concluded that HES ""failed to demonstrate that they were operating within their contractual limits. ""Consequently, 15 NHS Trusts served termination notices to HES formally to terminate their contracts at 4pm on Sunday,"" he said. New arrangements have been made with Mitie to ""step in and replace this service"" and ""NHS services continue to operate as normal"", Mr Barclay told MPs. Mr Barclay said the primary concern was that too much waste was being held in a number of waste storage and treatment sites by HES. ""While the waste was stored securely, it was not being processed and disposed of within the correct regulatory timescales. At no point has there been an impact on public health or any delay to the ability of the NHS to carry out operations,"" he said. The Environment Agency said HES was in breach of its environmental permits at four of its six sites which deal with clinical waste - by having more waste on site than their permit allows and storing waste inappropriately.

Passenger jailed for air rage death threat,"Kevin O'Hare was a passenger on the Boeing 737 flight to Belfast A County Armagh man who threatened to kill a crew member and punched the seat of an autistic child during a flight has been jailed for 10 months. Kevin O'Hare, 27, also swung his fists at the female cabin attendant on the four-hour Jet2 flight from Fuerteventura to Belfast on 5 August. The 12-year-old was screaming as a result of O'Hare punching the seat in front of him. O'Hare screamed and swore at police when he was arrested in Belfast. The defendant, of Keggall View in Camlough, had been drinking since 11:00 BST before boarding the evening flight to Belfast International Airport, his lawyer told Antrim Magistrates' Court. He was handed a five-month prison sentence for making threats to kill and five months for assaulting cabin crew. During sentencing, the district judge said O'Hare's behaviour was ""appalling"", adding that it was becoming ""all too prevalent"" on aircraft. In his view, the ""custody threshold"" had been crossed and a ""clear message"" must be sent that this type of behaviour would not be tolerated, added the judge. O'Hare ""doesn't recollect anything in relation to the incident"" and acknowledges that his behaviour was ""completely disgraceful and unacceptable"", added the lawyer. He said his client had ""a longstanding difficulty with alcohol, going back over 10 years"". There was ""no physical contact at any stage"" between the defendant and the crew member, the lawyer said, but his client accepted he would have caused the woman to fear an assault ""while flailing his arms about"". O'Hare was currently seeking help for his issues with alcohol, said the lawyer, and submitted three references to the court on his client's behalf. A prosecution lawyer said the defendant showed no remorse during his police interview. He was fined Â£200 for failing to obey a lawful command, and a further Â£200 for entering an aircraft when drunk. The district judge said O'Hare was also in breach of a crown court suspended sentence, adding that while he had no power to activate this, the court would write to Newry Crown Court.

Your mid-terms daily digest A really simple guide to the US mid-terms - BBC News Trump 'likes Taylor Swift 25% less' On Monday, the singer-songwriter Taylor Swift endorsed two Democrats for the US mid-term elections, prompting Mr Trump to tell reporters that he likes ""Taylor's music about 25% less now"". A history of Taylor Swift v Kanye West Swift's comments appear to have contributed to a spike in online voter registrations, especially among young people, according to the voter registration site Vote.org. However, Vote.org said it was not possible to measure the direct impact of Swift's decision to wade into politics - taking into account looming registration deadlines in a number of states and other factors. Swift's remarks once again puts her at odds with West, with whom she has had an on-off public feud since he interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards. In September, West, who is married to Kim Kardashian, wore a hat with Donald Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again"" during his performance of Ghost Town on the US comedy show Saturday Night Live. He ended his segment by delivering an impromptu off-air speech praising the president, posted online by members of the audience. ""So many times I talk to a white person and [they] say: 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'"" he said. ""Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago.""

The rapper has also urgedNFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, the first player to kneel during the pre-game national anthem in 2016,to ""tell your experience directly"" to Mr Trump. John Legend attacked Donald Trump throughout and after the US election cycle Last month, Trump said Nike had sent a ""terrible message"" when they named the 30 year old as the face of the brand's new advertising campaign. In April, West, who recently said he wishes to be referred to as ""Ye"", released Ye vs The People, a track which expressed support for the US president. He has also called Mr Trump his ""brother"" and has suggested both he and the president have ""dragon energy"". West has previously announced his own plan to run for president in 2020, but has since tweeted ""#2024"", making it unclear whether he will challenge Mr Trump at the next election.

Turks to search Saudi consulate for missing writer,"This image appears to show Jamal Khashoggi entering the consulate last week Turkey says it will conduct a search of Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul over the missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The country's foreign ministry said Saudi Arabia was ""open to co-operation"" and a requested search of the building could now go ahead as part of the investigation. Mr Khashoggi was last seen visiting the consulate last week and Turkey says he may have been murdered there. Saudi Arabia denies the suggestion. It says the journalist left the consulate shortly after arriving, while Turkey says he was not seen leaving the building. The country has demanded Saudi Arabia prove he left- despite not giving evidence of the claim he was killed inside. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Missing Saudi writer gets blank column A critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mr Khashoggi was living in self-imposed exile in the US and writing opinion pieces for the Washington Post before his disappearance. BBC Newshour interviewed the journalist just three days before his visit to the consulate, and in an off-air conversation asked if he would ever return to his home country. ""I don't think I'll be able to go home,"" he told the BBC, saying that in Saudi Arabia ""the people who are arrested are not even dissidents"" and saying he wished he had a platform at home to write and speak freely at this time of ""great transformation"" in his country.

Last week, Crown Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News that his government was ""very keen to know what happened to him"", and that Mr Khashoggi had left ""after a few minutes or one hour"". Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins Britain has apparently told the Saudis they need to show Mr Khashoggi is alive, and the best way to do that would be for him to appear on television. If that doesn't happen soon, it's clear that Britain and its allies are likely to conclude that Saudi Arabia has crossed an unacceptable line. In the wake of the Salisbury attack, and the international punishment meted out to Russia, it would then be increasingly difficult for Western governments to avoid action against the Saudi kingdom, however close their military and economic ties. Crown Prince Mohammed's brother and the Saudi ambassador to the US, Khaled, has insisted all the reports about his disappearance or death ""are completely false and baseless"". ""Jamal has many friends in Saudi Arabia, and I am one of them,"" he said in a statement, saying the two had kept in touch while he was living abroad ""despite differences"".

He told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not return. She eventually called the police. Turkish officials say Mr Khashoggi was killed on the premises and his body was then removed. ""We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,"" an unnamed source told Reuters. A source quoted by The Washington Post said the journalist was killed by a 15-member Saudi team,externalsent ""specifically for the murder"". The head of the Turkish-Arab Media Association, Turan Kislakci, told the New York Times thatTurkish police officers providing security for the consulate had checked their security cameras,external, which did not show the journalist leaving on foot. Turkey reportedly saysit is scouring road cameras for a black van believed to have carried Mr Khashoggi's body from the consulate,external, while the Washington Post releasedCCTV footage of the journalist entering the building,externalon Monday. Saudi Arabia says the allegations are baseless. It has allowed journalists into the consulate to show Mr Khashoggi is not there, reportedly even opening cupboards.

At least 449 homeless dead in one year,"The investigation into the number of homeless people to die across the UK in a single year is a first attempt at cataloguing the issue At least 449 homeless people have died in the UK during the last 12 months, an investigation has found. The figures produced bythe Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ),externalare the first attempt to catalogue the number of homeless people to die in a year. The ages of the deceased ranged between 18 and 94, and 69% of them were men. A government spokeswoman said Â£1.2bn was being invested to tackle ""all forms of homelessness"" and it intended to end rough sleeping by 2027. Howard Sinclair, chief executive of homeless charity St Mungo's, referred to the ""entirely preventable"" deaths as a ""national scandal"". The causes of death included assault, drug overdoses, illness, and suicide. At least one of the deceased showed signs of prolonged starvation. Some bodies had gone undiscovered for so long that forensic tests were needed to identify the deceased. From the 348 deceased where the ages were known,,externalthe average age for the homeless men was 49, and for women it was 53 years old.

Sofa surfers: The young hidden homeless Brighton-based homeless man Andrew O'Connell died in August after being assaulted Andrew O'Connell, who was homeless in Brighton, was attacked just before midnight on 7 August. The 54-year-old was discovered at Royal Pavilion Gardens the next day and was taken to hospital, but later died. The man from Kent was described by his family as ""a kind, intelligent man with a free spirit who loved to travel"". They added: ""As a family we are utterly devastated, hurt and angry."" Sergio Lemori, 32, who is also homeless,has been charged with Mr O'Connell's murder. Shelter chief executive Polly Neate said: ""We see, first-hand, the suffering [homelessness] causes. ""From families trapped in cramped and dingy B&Bs, to those forced to endure the dangers of sleeping rough."" She called on the government to build more social homes and ""ensure housing benefit is enough to cover the cost of rent"". TBIJ's investigation, which wasproduced in conjunction with Channel 4 News,external, revealed the death toll could be significantly higher as there is no official definition of homelessness used by local authorities. No official statistics exist that count the number of deceased homeless people, but the Office of National Statistics said it has begun work on an official database. TBIJ said that its figures for Scotland - where it reported 42 deaths - were particularly likely to be ""a big underestimate"". In Northern Ireland, the figures are comparatively high. Statistics obtained by investigative news website The Detail showed that148 people registered as homeless died while waiting for social housing.between October 2017 and August 2018.

The Republican woman who took on Trump,"On Tuesday night South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley delivered the official Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address - but there was more to it than that. Her 15-minute speech also served as an unofficial rebuke of Donald Trump and the in-your-face style of campaigning that has rocketed him to the top of a crowded Republican presidential field. And while her speech won positive reviews from many in the mainstream media and high marks from at least one focus group watching the night's events, it also exposed the deep fissures within her Republican Party. After a taking a few minutes to express disappointment with Mr Obama's seven years in office, Ms Haley got down to what has become the defining battle for the future of a Republican Party that, while achieving electoral success in Congress and state capitals over the past few years, has been roiled by a growing frustration with its politics and politicians. Many Republican voters feel their party is out-of-touch with their priorities and ineffective in advancing a conservative agenda. It's a vein of resentment that Mr Trump has built an entire campaign around. Nikki Haley says people like Donald Trump are engaging in ""irresponsible talk"" ""We as Republicans need to own that truth,"" Ms Haley said. ""We need to recognise our contributions to the erosion of the public trust in America's leadership. We need to accept that we've played a role in how and why our government is broken. And then we need to fix it."" She recounted her own background as a child of Indian immigrants and the importance of welcoming ""properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion"" - a sharp contrast to Mr Trump's recent call for temporarily blocking the entry of all Muslims into the US. The 43-year-old governor also noted the tolerance her state displayed following themass shootingby a white supremacist in a predominantly black Charleston church last June. ""We didn't have riots, we had hugs,"" she said. Then she offered her most pointed lines, whichshe confirmed,externalon Wednesday were aimed directly at Mr Trump and others on the national stage who engage in ""irresponsible talk"". ""In many parts of society today, whether in popular culture, academia, the media or politics, there's a tendency to falsely equate noise with results,"" she said. ""Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference. That is just not true."" On Wednesday morning Mr Trump responded to the perceived criticism, saying Ms Haley was ""very weak"" on illegal immigration. He added that she ""has no trouble asking me for campaign contributions"". ""Perhaps if I weren't running she'd be in my office asking me for money,"" he said. ""But now that I'm running she wants to take a weak side on immigration."" born in Bamberg, S Carolina, to Indian parents S Carolina's first woman governor, elected in 2011 and re-elected in 2014 youngest current governor in the US heavily tipped to be Republican nominee's running mate her website boasts of huge job creation and infrastructure investment - without tax rises married to Michael Haley, who served in Helmand, Afghanistan two children Rena, 17, and Nalin, 14 While Ms Haley's speech was pitched as a call for tolerance and an attempt to put a welcoming face on the Republican Party, the reaction from some conservative quarters was anything but accepting. ""Trump should deport Nikki Haley,""tweeted,externalconservative firebrand Ann Coulter, a passionate supporter of the billionaire-turned-candidate. According to Breitbart's John Nolte, Ms Haley - chosen to give the Republican response by the Republican leaders in Congress - was just the latest attempt by a party establishment that is desperate to derail Mr Trump's campaign. ""To use the State of the Union response to publicly attack her own frontrunner must be unprecedented, and certainly serves as more proof to Trump's supporters that the Republican Establishment is much more interested in DC media love than winning elections and advancing their legislative agenda,"" he writes. ""For the good of the country, this suicidal Republican Establishment temple must come down and be ground into dust,"" he concludes. Another Breitbart writerreferred to,externalMs Haley by her full name - Nimrata Randhawa Haley - and expressed mock surprise that she would have ""no clue about America's heritage"". Amanda Carpenter, a former staffer for Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican presidential hopeful who also regularly rails against his party's leadership, was equally dismissive. ""Nikki Haley's speech would've been good except for the GOP self-loathing,"" shetweeted,external. Ms Haley gained national prominence after the shootings last June at a predominantly black Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina Thanks to her performance following the Charleston shootings, where she successfully coaxed South Carolina's legislature into removing the controversial Confederate battle flag from the state capitol grounds, Ms Haley has been advanced by some as a possible vice-presidential candidate for whoever ends up winning the party's presidential nomination. They pitch her as a young, charismatic face of a party seeking to broaden its base of support to counter the diverse electoral coalition assembled by Mr Obama during the past two presidential elections. If this week is any indication, however, such a move may only deepen the divides within the party. ""The Haley speech was an echo of George W Bush, Jeb, Lindsey Graham-style Republicanism,""tweeted,externalconservative radio host Laura Ingraham.

Uber drivers stage strikes across UK,"Uber drivers are staging strikes in several UK cities in a protest over pay and working conditions. ""Hundreds"" of drivers are expected to switch off their apps from 1pm, making themselves unavailable for work, union organisers said. Protests are also being held outside the ride-hailing app's offices in London, Nottingham and Birmingham. Uber defended its pay record, saying it had rolled out numerous benefits for employees in the last few months. The rallies are being organised by The United Private Hire Drivers (UPHD) branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB). It is demanding a fare increase to Â£2 a mile, a reduction in commission paid by drivers to Uber, and an end to what it calls ""unfair"" driver deactivations. The IWGB is also calling on Uber to honour an employment tribunal verdict in 2016 which rejected the ride-hailing app's claim that drivers are self-employed and not entitled to minimum wage or paid holidays. James Farrar, head of the UPHD branch, said ""hundreds"" are expected to join the strikes. ""If you look at social media feeds its viral at the moment. In the history of our union, I've never seen anything quite like it."" Images of protests are being posted on social media. Additional police supervision was called to Uber's London headquarters after several demonstrators tried to storm the building. Allow Twitter content?

Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson was among those expressing support for the strike on Twitter. John McDonnell, the party's shadow chancellor, also called on people to ""respect the app picket line."" An Uber spokesperson said the company stood by its pay record, adding that it had introduced sickness, injury, maternity and paternity protections ""over the last few months."" The firm did not say how the strikes would affect its service. Tuesday's walkout comes afterstrikes by employees of UberEats, McDonalds, Wetherspoons and TGI Fridayslast week over pay disputes. In a separate protest on the same day, 50 UberEats couriers, Uber drivers and supporters temporarily occupied the lobby of Uber's London headquarters. Uber's London headquarters was briefly invaded during protests last week Uber was recently valued at $72bn, making it one of the most valuable privately held firms in the world. But the company's expansion into food delivery and bike sharing have eaten into recent earnings. In August, the firm reported a 51% annual increase in income from its taxi app business, but adjusted losses in the previous three months were up by almost a third on the previous quarter.

DUP 'can't talk Brexit in vacuum',"Arlene Foster was speaking after talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels The DUP leader has warned she will not support any Brexit deal that could lead to new economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster was speaking after a meeting with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. The government is expected to give details of its backstop plan in the coming days. Mrs Foster said it would be studied carefully. ""What we need to see is the legal text,"" she said. What do Brexit backstop proposals mean? Q & A: Brexit and the Irish border How could Theresa May get a Brexit deal through Parliament? ""We cannot talk in a vacuum. We need to see what has been proposed and we will check that against what we have called our red line."" Mrs Foster said she hadn't been shown a text of a ""hybrid backstop"" plan being worked up by UK officials. Diplomatic sources have suggested to the BBC that it is unlikely the UK would present a document outlining an alternative to the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. ""Instead the negotiations are about where the two sides converge,"" said the BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming. ""Talks this week are intense and fluid but there is said to be a sense of optimism and movement."" The Irish border is a major issue in Brexit negotiations Ireland's foreign minister says that efforts to reach a deal on the withdrawal agreement will probably have to continue into November. Simon Coveney says he expects the UK to bring forward new text on the border backstop, though he does not expect it to be published, instead confined to negotiations. Mr Coveney said he hoped a new text would be ""helpful"" but does not know if it would be enough for a significant step forward by next week's EU summit. He said he would know more after meeting the EU's chief Brexit negotiator on Monday and Tuesday. The backstop arrangement is effectively an insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. It is what will happen if a deal is agreed but the border cannot be kept as frictionless as it is now. The EU believes the backstop should mean Northern Ireland effectively staying in the single market for goods and the customs union until the UK comes up with a solution to the border issue. Prime Minister Theresa May wants a backstop that would see the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a limited period of time after the transition period - something the EU has said is unacceptable. Mrs Foster has warned there will be ""catastrophic"" consequences for the Northern Irish economy if any trade barriers are introduced between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The large number of journalists waiting to hear Arlene Foster's take on her meeting with Michel Barnier tells you everything about the DUP's meteoric rise up the political pecking order. Small regional parties do not normally attract the attention of the international media. However, the DUP is the party which Theresa May relies on to stay in power, and the party can - theoretically at least - vote down a backstop deal. There was general astonishment in the media centre when Mrs Foster said she hadn't yet seen the UK's so-called hybrid backstop plan. If it does contain provision for light-touch regulatory checks on goods between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, she left no doubt that would be unacceptable to the DUP. Mrs Foster added that she would wait to see the text before commenting in detail on the issue. When she does, the DUP might have a tough decision to make, and so might the Prime Minister. Representatives of Northern Ireland's two main unionist parties - the DUP and the Ulster Unionists - met Mr Barnier earlier on Tuesday to discuss Brexit. Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann was guardedly optimistic about the possibility of ""a good deal for the UK which involves NI and the EU"". Please upgrade your browser ""The feeling we're getting coming from the negotiators, the ambassadors and from part of the negotiating team that we met seem to be indicating we are going towards a deal,"" he said following his party's talks with Mr Barnier. ""We are seven to ten days from this deal having to be on the table. ""I don't want to be overly optimistic or to spook the horses but I think serious negotiations are going on.""

Mr Barnier recently called for ""less drama"" over the so-calledBrexit backstopregarding the Irish border. The EU negotiator held talks with four of NI's other parties last Friday. Mrs Foster had earlier warned that the party would not supporta Brexit deal that could lead to any new checkson goods coming into NI from elsewhere in the UK. Michel Barnier is the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Speaking ahead of Tuesday's meeting, she said: ""The United Kingdom single market must be protected with no new borders between Northern Ireland and Great Britain being created. From day one this has been the DUP's only red line. ""Over 70% of all goods leaving Belfast port are destined for Great Britain. To create a barrier to that trade would be catastrophic.""

Following their meeting with Mr Barnier last week, Sinn FÃ©in and the SDLP said they rejected the possibility of Stormont having a say over what kind of backstop may emerge. Proposals being worked on by the British government are said to include some kind of role for MLAs, but the nationalist parties are fearful that this would give rise to a veto for the DUP. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar wants a Brexit withdrawal agreement by November On Saturday, EU officials expressed optimismthat a Brexit deal could be struck by the end of the year. But Irish taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar said there was still ""a fair bit of work to be done"". NI secretary Karen Bradley told the Conservative Party conference the government would ""never ever allow a border down the Irish Sea"". Meanwhile, Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe has said that the Irish government's ""central case"" is that a Brexit deal will be done in the coming weeks between Britain and the European Union. But the Republic of Ireland is continuing to plan for the possibility that no deal is agreed. Speaking as he set out Ireland's 2019 budget in parliament, he said spending plans were ""based on a central case that there will be agreement in the coming weeks"". ""However, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has influenced decisions,"" he added. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Reality Check: What do Brexit backstop proposals mean?

Spy poisoning: What we know,"Police released CCTV showing two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU On 4 March, a former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned by a nerve agent, in an attack ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. An extraordinary series of accusations and denials from the highest levels of governments came in the months that followed, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. The attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, left them hospitalised for weeks. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in June in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury, after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday 4 March with his daughter Yulia Skripal flew into London's Heathrow Airport from Russia at about 14:40 GMT on Saturday, 3 March On Sunday, 4 March, at about 09:15 GMT, Mr Skripal's car was seen in Salisbury around London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road At 13:30 GMT his car was seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre Mr Skripal and his daughter arrived at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct at 13:40 GMT Police said the pair went to The Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at 14:20 GMT, where they stayed until 15:35 GMT At 16:15 GMT, emergency services received the first report of an incident Police found the pair on a bench outside Zizzi in an ""extremely serious condition"" Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill after attending the incident, was treated in hospital but discharged on 22 March Det Sgt Nick Bailey was seriously ill 48 people were assessed in hospital in relation to the incident Ms Skripal was released from hospital on 9 April and her father was discharged on 18 May. Both were taken to a secure location Police believe the Skripals were ""targeted specifically"" and are treating the case as attempted murder. Detectives believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok at the front door of their home. Traces of Novichok were alsofound at the Mill and Zizzi, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant at the same time weretold to wash their clothes and possessions. Officers later focused searches in and around Mr Skripal's home and a nearby children's play area at Montgomery Gardens was cordoned off by police. Police appealed for anyone who saw the pair in Mr Skripal's red BMW - licence plate number HD09 WAO - on the morning of the attack. Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident A vehicle that is believed to have been used by Mr Skripal's friend to pick up Yulia from the airport on 3 March was removed from Durrington, Wiltshire, by the Army on 19 March. Witness Jamie Paine said he saw a woman on a bench frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". A doctor, who was shopping with her husband in the city centre on Sunday, said Ms Skripal was ""slumped in her seat, completely unconscious"" and had lost control of her bodily functions. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" The investigation has so far involved 250 specialist counter-terrorism officers and about 180 military personnel, who were deployed to Salisbury to help remove vehicles and objects that may have been contaminated. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, stressed the risk of harm to the public was ""low"" but there was some concern that prolonged exposure could cause health problems. Personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire identified the nerve agent. Its head saidthe precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tested samples of the chemical. Russia accused Britain of blocking access to the OPCW inquiry, but its proposal for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals, who go by the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are suspects in the attempted murder. They are understood to have arrived at Gatwick Airport on Russian passports from Moscow on 2 March, and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. The following day they visited Salisbury for reconnaissance before contaminating Mr Skripal's front door with Novichok on 4 March, police say. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that same night. The men, whose movements were captured on various CCTV cameras, are thought to be aged about 40 and operating under aliases. The officers are thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, and the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, Theresa May has said. In an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, the men said they were tourists, in the UK to visit the ""wonderful town"" of Salisbury andsee its famous cathedral. Details have since emerged showing the man calling himself Alexander Petrov has made around 10 trips to Europe in the last two years. Documents first obtained by the investigative group Bellingcat, shared with the BBC, show that as well as visiting Paris, Geneva and Amsterdam, he appears to have visited the UK three times. He seems to have visited once in September 2016, again between 28 February and 5 March 2017 and finally in March this year- during the period Sergei Skripal was poisoned. On the final visit, the pair both travelled on genuine Russian passports. Recently published pages from Mr Petrov's passport dossiers contain unusual stamps and a blank page where there is normally biographical data - all evidence which may point to the men being undercover intelligence officers, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said. An investigation by Bellingcat has claimed thereal identity of the man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov is actually Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga- a highly decorated military officer. Bellingcat later said the suspect calling himselfAlexander Petrov is Alexander Mishkin, a doctorwho has worked for Russian intelligence since 2010. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians Since the attack, the Kremlin's media machine has responded with a combination of denials and sarcasm. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two suspects are civilians, not criminals and he hoped the men would tell their story soon. A day later an interview with the men was broadcast by Russia's state-run international broadcaster. The Russian foreign ministry had previously called Mrs May's allegations ""insane"", and said the names and photographs of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to Moscow"". At a UN Security Council meeting in September to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and its own citizens. Mission implausible: Russians mock improbable spy duo Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Previously, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or possibly the United States. Another theory - offered by Russia's EU ambassador, Vladimir Chizhov - suggested a UK research laboratory in Wiltshire could be the source. No. Prosecutors will not apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. Sue Hemming, of the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said there was enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"" and it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to charge them with the Salisbury attack. Police say officers continue to work with the CPS on the Amesbury incident. Could the suspects be returned to the UK? Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK. In recent years Mr Skripal is thought to have given lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. A friend from college, Vladimir Svyatski, described Mr Skripal as ""very active, with a positive attitude and creative"". Former colleague Oleg Ivanov told the BBC he was ""the life and soul of the party"". Hiscondition improved from critical to stableon 6 April, and Salisbury District Hospital said he was  responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". He was discharged on 18 May and moved to a secure location. Read more about the poisoned spy Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father His daughter, Yulia, regularly travelled to the UK from her Moscow home to visit her father, relatives told the BBC. ""She told me she liked everything [in the UK],"" childhood friend Irina Petrova said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, Ms Petrova said, and had been the ""perfect kid"", achieving excellent grades at school. Ms Skripal, who friends say worked for multinationals including Nike and PepsiCo, was ""always smiling, just like her mother"", Ms Petrova added. The 33-year-old was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April and taken to a secure location. It is not known what long-term effects she might suffer. This video can not be played CCTV shows Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died in 2012 after suffering from cancer. His elder brother and son have died in the past two years. Some of the deaths, the family believe, happened in suspicious circumstances. The grave of Liudmila Skripal, Sergei's wife, is in London Road Cemetery in Salisbury His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure. He is buried in Salisbury, close to his mother. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6 and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. On 5 April, an unverified recording purported to be between Yulia Skripal and her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, was broadcast on Russian TV. In the recording, Viktoria said she hoped to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be Yulia's tells her that no-one will give her one. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the recording. In the weeks after the poisoning, Theresa May pointed the finger at Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats and their families from the UK. She also said: Ministers and the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia Russian state assets would be frozen if there was evidence they would be used as a weapon against UK nationals and residents Checks on private flights, customs and freight would be increased All planned high-level contacts between the UK and Russia would be suspended The state invitation to Russian's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was retracted In solidarity, 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Germany and France, expelled 145 Russian officials - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow initially responded in kind, expelling 23 British diplomats, 60 US diplomats and several from other countries. It also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Russia then increased that number to 50, as its ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals. Together they have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were poisoned by Novichok Police are linking the attack on the Skripals to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowleywere exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser, labelled Nina Ricci Premier Jour. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing a small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. Scotland Yard said the bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok nerve agents The possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning ofAlexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. An investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that there have been at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia.

Website behind the revelation,"British journalist Eliot Higgins founded Bellingcat in 2014 The apparent unmasking of a Russian man accused of the Salisbury poisoning has made headlines around the world, but for many the source of the revelation may still be unfamiliar. Bellingcat, a website which describes itself as ""the home of online investigations"", publishedthe bombshell piece,externalon Wednesday. It said that one of the suspects was not a civilian on a sightseeing trip, the explanation put forward by Russian President Vladimir Putin, but rather a highly-decorated military officer named Anatoliy Chepiga. British officials haven't commented, butthe BBC understands there is no dispute over the identification.Russia has dismissed the claim as ""groundless"". The website behind the story was founded in 2014 by British journalist Eliot Higgins, with the help of a crowd-funding campaign. What happened to the Skripals? At the time of its creation, he was a lone blogger known as Brown Moses who was operating out of his living room in Leicester. He had been made redundant from his job as an administrative and finance worker for a group that housed refugees and, in 2013, he began to focus on his blog full-time. Despite having no formal journalism training or experience, he quickly gained a reputation in the relatively new field of open-source, citizen journalism, in which people analyse publicly available materials to uncover new facts about major stories. His focus was conflict zones, primarily in the Middle East, and he initially looked into the use of chemical weapons in Syria by examining videos and pictures online. This video can not be played Eliot Higgins, known as 'Brown Moses', talks about his analysis of the Syria conflict ""I just enjoyed doing it so much and I was getting more and people reading it,"" he tells the BBC. ""I saw more and more people who were doing their own kind of open-source investigation and more people who were becoming interested in it."" He saw an opportunity to build something bigger than his blog, and decided to try to raise funds for Bellingcat through the funding site Kickstarter. The name comes from the idiom 'to bell the cat', which means to take on a dangerous task. In a post announcing the creation of Bellingcat,,externalMr Higgins said the website would have two main objectives. Firstly, ""[bringing] together a group of writers and activists who through using open source tools have transformed journalism"" and, secondly, ""[attracting] others to come and learn how to use these same tools"". The latter has been an ever-present feature on the site, which has a dedicated section that offers advice and information to budding citizen journalists. There is an eclectic mix of guides, ranging fromhow to identify burnt villages by satellite imagery,externaltohow to collect sources from Syria if you don't read Arabic.,external ""I intended the website originally as a place to have guides and case studies for people who could then learn how to do it themselves,"" he says. ""On the other side, I wanted our own investigations, and a place where people could share what they found interesting and post their own findings."" The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was brought down over eastern Ukraine as conflict raged on the ground In the past few years, the website has been behind a number of high-profile investigations that have received widespread media coverage. It spearheaded an examination of the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 which came down over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. The West and Ukraine say pro-Russian rebels shot down the flight, while Moscow has repeatedly blamed Ukrainian forces. But in 2016,Bellingcat said it had identified Russian soldiers who were likely to have been involved. It linked personnel from the 2nd Battalion of the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade to the tragedy following an open-source investigation. Bellingcat said it then submitted all uncensored names and supporting evidence to the Dutch investigators, who are continuing their criminal inquiry into the disaster. Russia 'liable' for downing MH17 airliner Last year,Mr Higgins told the website Motherboard about the important role social media played,externalin that investigation. ""We had photographs shared online, people discussing the photographs, people tweeting about it,"" he said. ""It created ripples, and what we try to do is identify them, and understand them in the context of all the other material. That gives us a very solid case."" Other notable Bellingcat investigations have looked into the bombing of hospitals in Aleppo, Mexican drug lords and the war in Iraq. All of these hinged on using publicly available information to uncover new facts. Its work on the Skripal poisoning involved using some similar methods. Bellingcat released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) Bellingcat says its investigators searched images on several online search engines, browsed photos of a military academy yearbook, searched specific terms online and scoured leaked Russian databases. It then obtained extracts from the passport file of Anatoliy Chepiga, which contained a photograph that strongly resembled the Salisbury suspect originally named as Ruslan Boshirov. ""The Skripal story has been a coalition of people from different backgrounds working together,"" Mr Higgins says. ""To be able to build that community and be part of that is something I'm proud of."" He says the reaction to the investigation has been satisfying. ""It's been really nice to actually see a Bellingcat story make such an impact [in the UK]"", he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The website has been criticised by Russia - which has disputed the Skripal investigation andpublicly questioned whether Bellingcat is an arm of the UK government.,external But Mr Higgins often responds to these allegations directly on social media and is relaxed about it. ""We're used to getting [criticism] both from the social media public and the Russian government itself,"" he says. ""It would be more surprising if they didn't react to our pieces!"" Despite what he describes as ""day-to-day internet drama"", the website has continued to grow. Mr Higgins says its funding comes from crowd-funded donations and workshops he holds on open-source investigations. There has also been a flurry of donations from the public following the release of the Skripal investigations. ""Up until about a year ago, we were mostly volunteers and I had three or four people working with me,"" he says. ""Over the last year we have expanded to 10 members of staff plus a translation team and our volunteers. So we've expanded quite significantly."" He is now aiming at expanding Bellingcat's work. ""We're focusing on a few key areas, we're looking at Yemen and Libya as areas to expand into so we're involved in a couple of projects there,"" he says. ""Everyone here is motivated because they enjoy the process rather than focusing on a particular topic,"" he adds. ""They enjoy the process of doing an investigation and finding out stuff and making discoveries."" ""I think that's the biggest motivating factor and why they enjoy it.""

Virgin Galactic to reach space 'in weeks',"Entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson has said that Virgin Galactic is ""weeks"" away from its first trip into space. ""We should be in space within weeks, not months. And then we will be in space with myself in months and not years,"" the firm's founder and chief executivetold news website CNBC,external. He said the firm would be taking people into space ""not too long after"" that. Sir Richard is in a race with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to send the first fee-paying passengers into space. He founded the commercial spaceflight company in 2004. The company first promised sub-orbital spaceflight trips for tourists by the start of 2009. But delays and a fatal crash in 2014 prevented Sir Richard's original ambitions. Earlier this year, Virgin Galactic completed a supersonic test flight of its SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship, its first since the crash. The 67-year-old multi-millionaire was initially expected to take part in a space flight before April this year. In an interview withBBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme, Sir Richard said he was receiving astronaut, centrifuge and fitness training. He also insisted there was huge demand for commercial space flights. ""If I have a room full of 10 people, eight out of 10 would love to go to space if they could afford it,"" Sir Richard told CNBC. ""It is up to us to produce as many spaceships as we can to cater with that demand."" His announcement comes shortly after rival SpaceX unveiled the first private passenger it plans to fly around the Moon. The mission is planned for 2023, and would be the first lunar journey by humans since 1972. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has said his space travel firm Blue Origin will launch a manned mission into space by 2019. Mr Bezos didn't clarify if he meant crew or fare-paying passengers. Earlier this month, Blue Origin also announced that it is launching a non-profit group with Airbus, the European Space Agency, Agencia Espacial Mexicana, and French construction company Vinci Construction to explore ways to colonise the moon.

DUP 'can't talk Brexit in vacuum'Arlene Foster warns against the creation of UK economic barriers after talks with Michel Barnier.Northern IrelandComments,"Arlene Foster was speaking after talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels The DUP leader has warned she will not support any Brexit deal that could lead to new economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster was speaking after a meeting with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. The government is expected to give details of its backstop plan in the coming days. Mrs Foster said it would be studied carefully. ""What we need to see is the legal text,"" she said. What do Brexit backstop proposals mean? Q & A: Brexit and the Irish border How could Theresa May get a Brexit deal through Parliament? ""We cannot talk in a vacuum. We need to see what has been proposed and we will check that against what we have called our red line."" Mrs Foster said she hadn't been shown a text of a ""hybrid backstop"" plan being worked up by UK officials. Diplomatic sources have suggested to the BBC that it is unlikely the UK would present a document outlining an alternative to the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. ""Instead the negotiations are about where the two sides converge,"" said the BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming. ""Talks this week are intense and fluid but there is said to be a sense of optimism and movement."" The Irish border is a major issue in Brexit negotiations Ireland's foreign minister says that efforts to reach a deal on the withdrawal agreement will probably have to continue into November. Simon Coveney says he expects the UK to bring forward new text on the border backstop, though he does not expect it to be published, instead confined to negotiations. Mr Coveney said he hoped a new text would be ""helpful"" but does not know if it would be enough for a significant step forward by next week's EU summit. He said he would know more after meeting the EU's chief Brexit negotiator on Monday and Tuesday. The backstop arrangement is effectively an insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. It is what will happen if a deal is agreed but the border cannot be kept as frictionless as it is now. The EU believes the backstop should mean Northern Ireland effectively staying in the single market for goods and the customs union until the UK comes up with a solution to the border issue. Prime Minister Theresa May wants a backstop that would see the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a limited period of time after the transition period - something the EU has said is unacceptable. Mrs Foster has warned there will be ""catastrophic"" consequences for the Northern Irish economy if any trade barriers are introduced between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The large number of journalists waiting to hear Arlene Foster's take on her meeting with Michel Barnier tells you everything about the DUP's meteoric rise up the political pecking order. Small regional parties do not normally attract the attention of the international media. However, the DUP is the party which Theresa May relies on to stay in power, and the party can - theoretically at least - vote down a backstop deal. There was general astonishment in the media centre when Mrs Foster said she hadn't yet seen the UK's so-called hybrid backstop plan. If it does contain provision for light-touch regulatory checks on goods between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, she left no doubt that would be unacceptable to the DUP. Mrs Foster added that she would wait to see the text before commenting in detail on the issue. When she does, the DUP might have a tough decision to make, and so might the Prime Minister. Representatives of Northern Ireland's two main unionist parties - the DUP and the Ulster Unionists - met Mr Barnier earlier on Tuesday to discuss Brexit. Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann was guardedly optimistic about the possibility of ""a good deal for the UK which involves NI and the EU"". Please upgrade your browser ""The feeling we're getting coming from the negotiators, the ambassadors and from part of the negotiating team that we met seem to be indicating we are going towards a deal,"" he said following his party's talks with Mr Barnier. ""We are seven to ten days from this deal having to be on the table. ""I don't want to be overly optimistic or to spook the horses but I think serious negotiations are going on.""

Mr Barnier recently called for ""less drama"" over the so-calledBrexit backstopregarding the Irish border. The EU negotiator held talks with four of NI's other parties last Friday. Mrs Foster had earlier warned that the party would not supporta Brexit deal that could lead to any new checkson goods coming into NI from elsewhere in the UK. Michel Barnier is the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Speaking ahead of Tuesday's meeting, she said: ""The United Kingdom single market must be protected with no new borders between Northern Ireland and Great Britain being created. From day one this has been the DUP's only red line. ""Over 70% of all goods leaving Belfast port are destined for Great Britain. To create a barrier to that trade would be catastrophic.""

Following their meeting with Mr Barnier last week, Sinn FÃ©in and the SDLP said they rejected the possibility of Stormont having a say over what kind of backstop may emerge. Proposals being worked on by the British government are said to include some kind of role for MLAs, but the nationalist parties are fearful that this would give rise to a veto for the DUP. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar wants a Brexit withdrawal agreement by November On Saturday, EU officials expressed optimismthat a Brexit deal could be struck by the end of the year. But Irish taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar said there was still ""a fair bit of work to be done"". NI secretary Karen Bradley told the Conservative Party conference the government would ""never ever allow a border down the Irish Sea"". Meanwhile, Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe has said that the Irish government's ""central case"" is that a Brexit deal will be done in the coming weeks between Britain and the European Union. But the Republic of Ireland is continuing to plan for the possibility that no deal is agreed. Speaking as he set out Ireland's 2019 budget in parliament, he said spending plans were ""based on a central case that there will be agreement in the coming weeks"". ""However, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has influenced decisions,"" he added. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Reality Check: What do Brexit backstop proposals mean?

"Sturgeon: SNP offer 'hope and optimism'Nicola Sturgeon is to close the SNP conference in Glasgow with a message of ""hope and optimism"".Scotland politicsComments","This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""It is now up to us to honour those who went before and win our countryâs independence."" Nicola Sturgeon has called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her SNP conference speech. The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent. She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in 2014. Ms Sturgeon also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless. The first minister was speaking on the final day of the SNP's three-day conference in Glasgow. She used her speech to hit out at ""unfolding calamity"" and ""despair"" at Westminster, contrasting this by painting an independent Scotland as ""a beacon of progressive values"". Brian Taylor: Sturgeon focused on politics of the possible Watch Nicola Sturgeon's speech in full Recap: How Nicola Sturgeon's speech unfolded The SNP leader kicked off the conference by announcing that the party's 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled at Parliament. And she closed it with a speech also packed with constitutional arguments, describing Brexit as a ""serious problem"" and repeatedly promoting the cause of independence. Nicola Sturgeon: ""Never, ever, let anyone tell us that Scotland doesnât have the talent and resources to be a successful independent country."" Ms Sturgeon hailed the ""passion"" of independence supporters,nodding to the tens of thousands who marched through Edinburgh the day before the conference began. And she acknowledged the frustration that has been voiced by some campaigners over the fact that plans for a fresh referendum have not been forthcoming. She said: ""Our job is to take that passion and blend it with pragmatism, perseverance and patience to persuade those not yet persuaded. ""If we do that, then believe me - the momentum for independence will be unstoppable."" In essence, Ms Sturgeon was telling her party two things from an SNP point of view. One, that passion alone is insufficient to achieve their objective. They must operate with a calm, temperate approach. They must be prepared to see the alternative view - to acknowledge and understand those who dislike independence. Secondly, she was making plain that an independence referendum must be deferred - at least until there is clarity over Brexit and possibly substantially beyond that. She was addressing an audience who yearn for independence. They want it tonight, if not sooner. And yet her underlying tone was all about elongation of time scales. Read more from Brian Ms Sturgeon went on to say that ""the future relationship between the UK and the EU will determine the context in which Scotland would become independent"". She said: ""But as we wait - impatiently, at times, I know - for this phase of negotiations to conclude and for the fog of Brexit to clear, be in no doubt about this. ""The last two years have shown why Scotland needs to be independent. And I am more confident than ever that Scotland will be independent."" The UK government has placed itself in opposition to a second referendum either on independence or on Brexit. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said Scotland ""had an independence referendum four years ago and voted decisively to remain in the UK"", adding that ""now is not the time"" for a fresh vote. ""Hope"" is the theme of the SNP conference Ms Sturgeon announced some new policies in her speech, including: increased bursaries for trainee nurses, of up to Â£10,000 by 2020 more money for Social Bite to tackle homelessness a new ""fair work first"" strategy of investment in skills and training and payment of the living wage an ""advanced manufacturing fund"" to help small businesses modernise and grow She also called on the UK government to halt the rollout of Universal Credit ""now"", saying the policy was leaving people unable to eat and urging ministers to ""find some compassion"". Ms Sturgeon said the Westminster administration was a ""shambles"" which ""stumbles from disaster to disaster"", saying that ""a political system that throws up Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson as contenders for Prime Minister has clearly gone very badly wrong"". Brexit 'boosts case for Scottish independence' Sturgeon - SNP MPs would back new Brexit vote Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", she said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"". And she warned any parties ""itching to open up our NHS as part of a trade deal with Donald Trump"" to ""prepare for the political fight of your lives"". The march in Edinburgh is the latest in a series of events to held by All Under One Banner Earlier on Tuesday, the Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, also urged activists to be patient over a second independence referendum, which he said should only take place when voters are ""persuaded, ready and determined to win"". Mr Russell had earlier been confronted by an SNP councillor at a fringe event who said members were ""very frustrated with constantly being told to just wait"", saying there was ""a sense that time is slipping away"". The MSP said: ""Our job as a party and as a government is to both make sure that Scotland flourishes, no matter the circumstances but also to ensure that - at the right moment - the choice of independence can be made. ""The right moment - not the most comfortable moment or the moment that best relieves our natural impatience. The moment at which our country is persuaded, ready and determined to win."" The Scottish Conservatives said that while Ms Sturgeon had called for ""patience"" from her supporters, ""most people lost patience with the SNP a long time ago"". MSP Annie Wells said: ""Astonishingly, in a speech littered with references to independence, there was just a glancing reference to education. ""It was a staggering omission and it tells you all you need to know. Education isn't her number one priority - the only priority the SNP has is separating our country in two."" And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Ms Sturgeon had ""delivered plenty of rhetoric for the party faithful but dodged any detail on the new economic prospectus for separation"". He added: ""The so called 'Growth Commission' - in reality a cuts commission - has been the elephant in the room at the SNP conference. The first minister could not bear to tell her activists that her new plan for independence means a decade of unprecedented austerity."" Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell said that ""independence in the EU is the right choice for Scotland"", saying his party would ""redouble efforts to build a convincing case for this alongside the SNP"". And Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said Ms Sturgeon ""needs to stop trying to turn Brexit into the break-up of the UK"".

Prison pepper spray 'will worsen' conflict,"This video can not be played Custodial manager Ash Bateman demonstrates the spray Issuing prison officers with cans of pepper spray will worsen the current ""culture of conflict"", a former prison governor has told BBC News. John Podmore, who worked at high-security Belmarsh Prison in London, said there was ""a real risk the pepper sprays will be turned on the officers"". Prison officers in England and Wales are to be given synthetic pepper spray to help deal with disorder and violence, under new plans. Prison officers have praised the move. But the announcement came as the Prison Governors Association (PGA) accused the government of failing to react quickly enough to a ""crisis"" in jails. Head of prisons asked to quit amid crisis I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister The chemical incapacitant known as PAVA has been trialled in four jails - Hull, Preston, Risley in Warrington, and Wealstun in North Yorkshire. It will be carried by officers in all publicly-run prisons for men from 2019. The Ministry of Justice said the move, which will cost Â£2m, followed the ""successful"" six-month trials. But Mr Podmore said it was part of a ""downward spiral"", adding: ""The POA [the trade union for prison officers] are already now asking for Tasers. What next? Sidearms, rifles in conning towers on perimeters?"" Asked whether officers should be able to defend themselves against violent prisoners, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Good luck with one can of pepper spray against half a dozen prisoners. ""There is talk [from ministers] of this being a deterrent - I think for many prisoners it will be a challenge and there is a real risk the pepper sprays will be turned on the officers."" The MoJ said the spray would only be deployed in limited circumstances when there is serious violence or an imminent risk of it taking place and officers will receive training before being allowed to carry it. In a speech to the PGA conference later, president Andrea Albutt is to acknowledge there is a ""more positive feel"" in jails after staffing levels were increased and security boosted. But she will say there has been a ""subtle campaign"" to blame governors for problems and that ministers do not have the ""humility"" to admit their policies - which had included budget cuts - were wrong. An MoJ spokeswoman said: ""Senior managers in prisons do vital work and we are grateful for their dedication and commitment. ""We acknowledge the ongoing challenges they face and, as the president notes, we have taken meaningful action to address them which is starting to yield results.""

Second Salisbury suspect 'highly decorated',"CCTV footage issued by the Met Police of the man now identified as Alexander Mishkin The second suspect in the Salisbury poisoning case was a doctor and highly decorated Russian military intelligence officer, an investigative website says. Bellingcat said it used a combination of online material and leaked documents to identify Alexander Mishkin, 39, as a person linked to the attack in March. It said President Vladimir Putin had presented him with the Hero of the Russian Federation award in 2014. When asked about the naming of Dr Mishkin, the Kremlin would not comment. Last month, Bellingcat named the first suspect as Anatoliy Chepiga, a claim also rejected by Russia which says it was not prepared to discuss reports or media articles on the case. At a news conference held in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday, Bellingcat investigator Cristo Grozev said Dr Mishkin - like Mr Chepiga - was a member of the GRU and given the celebrated award for ""actions in Ukraine"". Novichok suspect traced to tiny village The website behind the Skripal revelation Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far He said Dr Mishkin's grandmother has a photograph that has ""been seen by everybody in the village"" of President Putin shaking his hand and giving him the award. The BBC has contacted two people who knew Dr Mishkin as a child in Loyga in the north of Russia, and they confirmed from photographs that he was the man seen in images released by police after the Salisbury attack. Bellingcat has issued three photos of the man identified as Alexander Mishkin, including his passport image Bellingcat, a UK-based website, said both Dr Mishkin's real passport and the false passport he travelled to the UK on in the name of Alexander Petrov carried the same date of birth. Outlining in detail how it identified the Salisbury suspect as Dr Mishkin, Bellingcat said,externalit had pieced together his identity using various databases online, including telephone and car insurance records, and later obtained copies of his passport and driving licence. It also used social media to contact hundreds of people who may have been at military academy with Dr Mishkin. Most people did not respond to the inquiry but one, who requested complete anonymity, said they had recognised Dr Mishkin as the suspect who wasinterviewed under the name of Alexander Petrov by the RT television channel. Mr Grozev said: ""That person told us everybody from his class, his department, was contacted two weeks ago and told not to talk to the media."" Bellingcat said Dr Mishkin completed his medical studies at a faculty which trains doctors for Russia's naval armed forces and around the same period was recruited by the GRU. It said he made several trips to Ukraine, including during the 2013-14 unrest. In spring 2014 mass demonstrations in central Kiev over the government's decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the EU ended in bloodshed and the ousting of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. Soon afterwards Russian troops annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and unrest broke out in mainly Russian-speaking eastern areas of the country. The unrest became a full-scale insurgency, and rebels seized large swathes of territory. Since then, thousands of people have died in fighting between the rebels and Ukrainian government forces. Moscow denies sending regular troops and heavy weapons to the separatists, but admits that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. Dr Mishkin is believed to have lived in this St Petersburg building about a decade ago The tiny village of Loyga in the Russian far north is not the kind of place you would expect to be at the centre of an international spy scandal. With fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, it has rail access but no paved roads. It's too small even to show up on Google Maps. But Loyga has proved crucial to piecing together the story of the real ""Alexander Petrov"" - the second man the UK authorities suspect over the Skripal poisoning case in Salisbury. Read more: Novichok suspect traced to tiny village Former GRU officer Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia survived being poisoned with Novichok on 4 March. The attack left Mr Skripal and Yulia critically ill, but Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. London's Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service said last month that there wasenough evidence to charge Dr Mishkin and Mr Chepigawith attempted murder over the Salisbury attack. Police issued CCTV of the two suspects in Salisbury on the day of the attack on Sergei Skripal Detectives said the pair arrived in the UK using passports bearing the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov on 2 March, although they had said it was likely the men were travelling under aliases. The movements of the suspects, who are alleged to have smeared Novichok on a door handle of Mr Skripal's home, were captured in a series of CCTV images that were released by police. The event sparked a series of accusations and denials between the UK and Russian governments, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent It took longer for investigators at the Bellingcat website to identify Alexander Mishkin because he has an even sparser digital footprint than the first man to be named, Anatoly Chepiga. But using databases and passport details they concluded that this was the real name of the man who came to Salisbury as Alexander Petrov. Facial recognition experts were asked to examine two photos 15 years apart and use techniques of simulated age progression to establish the match. Last Thursday,four GRU officers were exposed for trying to hack into communications of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weaponsin the Netherlands at the time it was investigating the Salisbury poisoning. Dr Mishkin's identification will raise more questions about how easy it has been to expose supposedly undercover intelligence officers and undermine Russia's official account that the two men who came to Salisbury were there to see the cathedral spire. Recent reports in the Russian media suggest that Vladimir Putin - himself a former spy chief - is unhappy with the GRU's performance - and that a purge could be on the way.

Criminal probe over medical waste,"A criminal investigation has been launched after a backlog of medical waste was allowed to build up at several disposal sites. It emerged on Thursday that the waste from hospitals had not been disposed of in a timely fashion by contractor Healthcare Environmental Services. The Environment Agency said the firm was in breach of permits. HES said it had previously highlighted the need to invest in the UK's ""ageing"" incinerator network for clinical waste. The Department of Health in England said there was no risk to the public. A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency in England said it had found HES to be in breach of environmental permits at five sites which deal with clinical waste. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) also confirmed that it issued enforcement notices at sites in Dundee and Shotts last month, where its officers are conducting ""ongoing monitoring"". A Cobra meeting to discuss the issue was chaired by English Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month,according to the Health Service Journal,external, which first reported the story. A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency said: ""We are taking enforcement action against the operator, which includes clearance of the excess waste, and have launched a criminal investigation. ""We are supporting the government and the NHS to ensure there is no disruption to public services and for alternative plans to be put in place for hospitals affected to dispose of their waste safely."" Princess Anne toured Healthcare Environmental's Lanarkshire plant during a visit earlier this year SEPA said it was working closely with the Environment Agency and ""robustly monitoring sites in Scotland"". HES has a transfer station for waste in Dundee and a storage, processing and incineration site at Shotts. SEPA said the company had not gone over its agreed regulatory limits for either of the two Scottish sites. A UK government spokesman said it was monitoring the situation closely and had made sure that public services - including NHS Trusts - had contingency plans in place. He added: ""There is absolutely no risk to the health of patients or the wider public. ""Our priority is to prevent disruption to the NHS and other vital public services and work is under way to ensure organisations can continue to dispose of their waste safely and efficiently."" The Scottish government said there had been no reports of any impact on services from NHS boards in Scotland. A spokesman added: ""In the event of any disruption to service at NHS sites across Scotland, NHS Scotland already has contingency plans ready to put into place to ensure there is no impact on services to patients or staff."" Company director Garry Pettigrew with Princess Anne during her visit Healthcare Environmental Services describes itself on its website as the ""UK's leading independent provider of healthcare waste management"". Its latest company accounts show it had a turnover of just over Â£31m in the year to the end of April 2017. They credited an 18% increase in sales to a new treatment plant in Newcastle. Company directors Garry and Alison Pettigrew were paid Â£299,521 between them. They also shared dividends of Â£480,000. The company owns land and buildings worth Â£3.7m. HES said it had highlighted the reduction in the UK's high-temperature incineration capacity for the last few years to the UK government, NHS bodies and the Environment Agency. The company said all of its waste was stored ""in accordance with strict regulations"". ""Anatomical waste is not stored on any of our facilities for longer than is allowed by permitted guidelines,"" HES said. A spokesman added:  ""We have welcomed visits from the EA a number of times over the past few months and have pointed out to them that the amount of waste produced by the NHS for incineration far outweighs the entire incineration capabilities of the UK, and not just HES. ""We are not the only company to feel the strain on our services, with many of our competitors continually breaching storage regulations."" Healthcare Environmental Services' headquarters is in Shotts in Lanarkshire The firm also has a depot in Dundee Jonathan Ashworth, Labour's shadow health and social care secretary in England, called on Matt Hancock to make a statement in the House of Commons on the ""staggering revelations"" next week. ""When something of this scale is going on which the government has known about for some time they have a responsibility to come to Parliament and explain to Parliament whether they've got credible contingency plans and to reassure MPs who will represent those 50 hospital trusts,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. ""Given the scale of this, it's hugely disappointing that the secretary of state has not done this,"" he added. Unison's head of health, Sara Gorton, described the situation as ""simply horrific"", saying it was ""unlikely that such a distressing situation would have happened had the service remained in-house"".

Reality Check: How do you dispose of medical waste?,"It's emerged that a private company contracted by the NHS has been allowing medical waste to build up at its disposal sites. Healthcare Environment Services (HES) collects around 584 tonnes of ""incineration-only"" waste and 1,972 tonnes of non-hazardous waste per month from trusts, according to the Health Service Journal. A small proportion of this will be ""anatomical waste"" - actual body parts - which is kept in secure refrigerated units. The rest will be made up of waste, including discarded blood and used medical supplies (needles, swabs, bandages, dressings, gloves) which have been in contact with bodily fluids. It might also include toxic chemicals and medicines, like chemotherapy drugs which kill cells. Some of the waste is also from dentists, veterinary clinics and nursing homes, as well as hospitals. In England, approximately 273,559 tonnes of medical waste was disposed of in 2017. This waste must be dealt with safely in order to prevent infection spreading and to stop people coming into contact with harmful substances. Anatomical waste, which includes recognisable body parts and placenta, has to be incinerated in licensed facilities and transported in special UN-approved containers. It is against the law to send infectious waste straight to landfill. This means separating it out from other waste to prevent contamination. Some other medical waste which is categorised as being ""offensive"" can nevertheless be sent to landfill, for example hygiene waste like incontinence pads and dressings and gowns which haven't come into contact with bodily fluids. HES says the amount of anatomical waste it collects in England each week only amounts to 1% of the overall tonnage of waste collected. The waste is not stored for longer than is allowed by permitted guidelines, it says. Although HES has been accused of storing too much waste without incinerating it, the government has stressed there is no risk to patient or public safety from the recent rule breach. But it emerged on Thursday that it did hold a high-level COBRA meeting about the backlog last month. A government spokesperson said: ""We are monitoring the situation closely and have made sure that public services - including NHS Trusts - have contingency plans in place"". HES has pointed to pressure on the UK's high-temperature incineration capacity as a factor contributing to the backlog. There were four fewer incinerators available in 2014 - the last time the figure was updated - than there were in 2012. At the same time as incinerator numbers have been falling, local authorities have been incinerating more waste as part of an EU-wide initiative to eliminate the use of landfill. And that's put more pressure on the system. From time to time, medical waste is exported abroad to be incinerated. For example in the Netherlands, the market for importing waste - particularly from the UK and Germany - has grown considerably since 2010. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Website behind the Skripal revelation,"British journalist Eliot Higgins founded Bellingcat in 2014 The apparent unmasking of a Russian man accused of the Salisbury poisoning has made headlines around the world, but for many the source of the revelation may still be unfamiliar. Bellingcat, a website which describes itself as ""the home of online investigations"", publishedthe bombshell piece,externalon Wednesday. It said that one of the suspects was not a civilian on a sightseeing trip, the explanation put forward by Russian President Vladimir Putin, but rather a highly-decorated military officer named Anatoliy Chepiga. British officials haven't commented, butthe BBC understands there is no dispute over the identification.Russia has dismissed the claim as ""groundless"". The website behind the story was founded in 2014 by British journalist Eliot Higgins, with the help of a crowd-funding campaign. What happened to the Skripals? At the time of its creation, he was a lone blogger known as Brown Moses who was operating out of his living room in Leicester. He had been made redundant from his job as an administrative and finance worker for a group that housed refugees and, in 2013, he began to focus on his blog full-time. Despite having no formal journalism training or experience, he quickly gained a reputation in the relatively new field of open-source, citizen journalism, in which people analyse publicly available materials to uncover new facts about major stories. His focus was conflict zones, primarily in the Middle East, and he initially looked into the use of chemical weapons in Syria by examining videos and pictures online. This video can not be played Eliot Higgins, known as 'Brown Moses', talks about his analysis of the Syria conflict ""I just enjoyed doing it so much and I was getting more and people reading it,"" he tells the BBC. ""I saw more and more people who were doing their own kind of open-source investigation and more people who were becoming interested in it."" He saw an opportunity to build something bigger than his blog, and decided to try to raise funds for Bellingcat through the funding site Kickstarter. The name comes from the idiom 'to bell the cat', which means to take on a dangerous task. In a post announcing the creation of Bellingcat,,externalMr Higgins said the website would have two main objectives. Firstly, ""[bringing] together a group of writers and activists who through using open source tools have transformed journalism"" and, secondly, ""[attracting] others to come and learn how to use these same tools"". The latter has been an ever-present feature on the site, which has a dedicated section that offers advice and information to budding citizen journalists. There is an eclectic mix of guides, ranging fromhow to identify burnt villages by satellite imagery,externaltohow to collect sources from Syria if you don't read Arabic.,external ""I intended the website originally as a place to have guides and case studies for people who could then learn how to do it themselves,"" he says. ""On the other side, I wanted our own investigations, and a place where people could share what they found interesting and post their own findings."" The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was brought down over eastern Ukraine as conflict raged on the ground In the past few years, the website has been behind a number of high-profile investigations that have received widespread media coverage. It spearheaded an examination of the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 which came down over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. The West and Ukraine say pro-Russian rebels shot down the flight, while Moscow has repeatedly blamed Ukrainian forces. But in 2016,Bellingcat said it had identified Russian soldiers who were likely to have been involved. It linked personnel from the 2nd Battalion of the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade to the tragedy following an open-source investigation. Bellingcat said it then submitted all uncensored names and supporting evidence to the Dutch investigators, who are continuing their criminal inquiry into the disaster. Russia 'liable' for downing MH17 airliner Last year,Mr Higgins told the website Motherboard about the important role social media played,externalin that investigation. ""We had photographs shared online, people discussing the photographs, people tweeting about it,"" he said. ""It created ripples, and what we try to do is identify them, and understand them in the context of all the other material. That gives us a very solid case."" Other notable Bellingcat investigations have looked into the bombing of hospitals in Aleppo, Mexican drug lords and the war in Iraq. All of these hinged on using publicly available information to uncover new facts. Its work on the Skripal poisoning involved using some similar methods. Bellingcat released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) Bellingcat says its investigators searched images on several online search engines, browsed photos of a military academy yearbook, searched specific terms online and scoured leaked Russian databases. It then obtained extracts from the passport file of Anatoliy Chepiga, which contained a photograph that strongly resembled the Salisbury suspect originally named as Ruslan Boshirov. ""The Skripal story has been a coalition of people from different backgrounds working together,"" Mr Higgins says. ""To be able to build that community and be part of that is something I'm proud of."" He says the reaction to the investigation has been satisfying. ""It's been really nice to actually see a Bellingcat story make such an impact [in the UK]"", he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The website has been criticised by Russia - which has disputed the Skripal investigation andpublicly questioned whether Bellingcat is an arm of the UK government.,external But Mr Higgins often responds to these allegations directly on social media and is relaxed about it. ""We're used to getting [criticism] both from the social media public and the Russian government itself,"" he says. ""It would be more surprising if they didn't react to our pieces!"" Despite what he describes as ""day-to-day internet drama"", the website has continued to grow. Mr Higgins says its funding comes from crowd-funded donations and workshops he holds on open-source investigations. There has also been a flurry of donations from the public following the release of the Skripal investigations. ""Up until about a year ago, we were mostly volunteers and I had three or four people working with me,"" he says. ""Over the last year we have expanded to 10 members of staff plus a translation team and our volunteers. So we've expanded quite significantly."" He is now aiming at expanding Bellingcat's work. ""We're focusing on a few key areas, we're looking at Yemen and Libya as areas to expand into so we're involved in a couple of projects there,"" he says. ""Everyone here is motivated because they enjoy the process rather than focusing on a particular topic,"" he adds. ""They enjoy the process of doing an investigation and finding out stuff and making discoveries."" ""I think that's the biggest motivating factor and why they enjoy it.""

Man held over Bulgarian journalist murder,"Vigils for the dead journalist have been held around the country A man has been questioned over the killing of Bulgarian journalist Viktoria Marinova, police say. They said he would be freed without charge and they had nothing further to announce. He is described as a Romanian citizen of Ukrainian descent. Ms Marinova's body was found in a park in the northern city of Ruse, near the River Danube, on Saturday. She had also been raped. On Monday hundreds of mourners held vigils around the country. It is not known if the killing is linked to Ms Marinova's work at a local TV station, but Bulgaria is said to be the worst country in the European Union for press freedom. Ruse police chief Teodor Atanasov said the man's alibi was checked and that he was not a suspect. He would be released ""very shortly"", he added. On Monday the town's regional prosecutor, Georgy Georgiev, said Ms Marinova had suffered blows to the head and was suffocated in the fatal attack, adding that her ""mobile phone, car keys, glasses and part of her clothes were missing"". Ms Marinova is the third high-profile journalist to be killed in the EU this year The 30 year old worked as a presenter on a current affairs talk programme called Detector. Its first episode featured an interview with two Bulgarian investigative journalists exploring alleged fraud involving EU funds linked to businessmen and politicians. The pair, Attila Biro and Dimitar Stoyanov, were arrested in September while looking into the case. AP news agency quoted prosecutors as saying on Monday that they had opened an investigation into the alleged fraud. Marinova is the third high-profile journalist to be murdered in the EU in the past year, and the fourth since the start of 2017. Swedish reporterKim Wall was killed by Danish inventor Peter Madsenafter boarding his homemade submarine to do an interview in Copenhagen in August 2017. In October 2017,Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bombnear her home, while in February this yearSlovakian journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancÃ©e Martina Kusnirova were shot dead. Both Caruana Galizia and Kuciak were known for their work exposing corruption. Bulgaria is considered the worst country in the EU when it comes to press freedom, according to Reporters Without Borders. The organisation saysinvestigative journalists in the country are often subjected to pressure,external, ""from mere warnings to intimidation and physical assaults on themselves or their property"".

Second Skripal attack suspect 'is doctor',"The suspect identified by police as Alexander Petrov is actually named Alexander Mishkin, Bellingcat says The name of the second suspect in the Salisbury case is actually Alexander Mishkin, the BBC understands. The Bellingcat investigative website says the man who travelled under the alias Alexander Petrov is in reality a military doctor working for Russian intelligence, the GRU. Last month, Bellingcat named the first suspect as Anatoliy Chepiga, a claim rejected by Russia. When asked about the naming of Mr Mishkin, the Kremlin would not comment. More details about how it uncovered the identity will be released on Tuesday. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in March. The British open-source website said it had identified the suspect using testimonies from people the suspect knew,externaland a scanned copy of his passport. It said both his real passport and the false passport he travelled to the UK on in the name of Alexander Petrov carried the same date of birth. Bellingcat claims he was recruited by Russian intelligence while he was completing his medical studies, and made several trips to Ukraine, including during the 2013 unrest. Skripal suspect was 'honoured by Putin' Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far The website behind the Skripal revelation Bellingcat has issued three photos of the man identified as Alexander Mishkin, including his passport image Police issued CCTV of the two suspects in Salisbury on the day of the attack on Sergei Skripal By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent It took longer for investigators at the Bellingcat website to identify Alexander Mishkin as he has an even sparser digital footprint than the first man to be named, Anatoly Chepiga. But using databases and passport details they concluded that this was the real name of the man who came to Salisbury as Alexander Petrov. Facial recognition experts were asked to examine two photos 15 years apart and use techniques of simulated age progression to establish the match. Last Thursday,four GRU officers were exposed for trying to hack into communications of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weaponsin the Netherlands at the time it was investigating the Salisbury poisoning. Mishkin's identification will raise more questions about how easy it has been to expose supposedly undercover intelligence officers and undermine Russia's official account that the two men who came to Salisbury were there to see the Cathedral spire. Recent reports in the Russian media suggest that Vladimir Putin - himself a former spy chief - is unhappy with the GRU's performance - and that a purge could be on the way. A spokesman for the Home Office said it would not comment as it was a police investigation. The Metropolitan Police said they would not comment on the ""speculation"". However, officials are not disputing Bellingcat's identification of the men. Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia survived being poisoned with Novichok on 4 March. The suspects are alleged to have smeared the nerve agent on a door handle of his home in Salisbury. The attack left Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia critically ill, but Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. The event sparked a series of accusations and denials between the UK and Russian governments, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. This video can not be played A BBC team showed photographs to residents in Anatoliy Chepiga's old village, to see if they could identify him Conservative MP Bob Seely, a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said: ""It is appalling that a medical doctor appears to have been part of a team of GRU operatives... ""Whilst this operation has been a botched embarrassment for the Kremlin from beginning to end, it's worth remembering that we may not know about the GRU's successful operations."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The Russian side has asked the British, from the start, to provide information on the case, and details. ""We've got nothing through official channels. ""We won't explain or comment on topics that are leaked through the media."" This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? The GRU, also known as the Main Intelligence Directorate, is the intelligence arm of the Russian military. It is different to the former KGB (now known as the SVR and FSB) as it conducts undercover military operations and collects intelligence around the globe. In recent years the GRU has been accused of undercover involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, which saw Russia annex Crimea in 2014. Following the attempted poisoning in Salisbury, UK investigators said one of the two suspects had been travelling under the name Ruslan Boshirov. In September, Bellingcat revealed he was actually a military intelligence officer named Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga. He served in Chechnya and Ukraine and was made a ""Hero of the Russian Federation"" in 2014, the website said. Bellingcat was founded in 2014 by British journalist Eliot Higgins, with the help of a crowd-funding campaign. Describing itself as ""the home of online investigations"", Bellingcat says it uses open-source computer software and social media as part of its work. The website has also carried out investigations into the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in Ukraine, the wars in Syria and Iraq, and Mexican drug lords.

'Sabotage' in Ukraine ammo dump blasts,"Smoke could be seen rising from miles away Explosions and fire have hit an ammunition depot in Ukraine in a possible act of sabotage, officials say, leading to the evacuation of thousands of people. Videos on social media showed the blaze and explosions on the horizon near Ichnya, Chernihiv region. About 12,000 people were moved from the area around the depot, about 109 miles (176km) north-east of the capital Kiev, emergency services say. There were no casualties. Deputy commander of the General Staff, Rodyon Tymoshenko, told a news conference the incident began with four explosions across the depot. ""The intensity of the blasts suggests that it was most probably sabotage,"" he said. Security services are now investigating the incident. Authorities evacuated residents from the area around the base Debris, including this hand grenade, was flung into the air Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman earlier tweeted that local authorities would provide accommodation for the evacuated, and that emergency services were on hand to help people. The initial explosion at the base occurred at about 03:30 local time (00:30 GMT). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

From 04:22 a 20km radius airspace closure came into effect, emergency services say. Rail and road links in the area are also suspended, and gas and electricity supplies have been disrupted. Ammunition depot explosions have happened before in Ukraine, as the country continues its fight against pro-Russian separatists in its eastern regions. Ukraine names Russia as 'aggressor' state Blast kills top Ukraine rebel leader In September 2017,28,000 people were evacuated after a huge fire raged at a military arms depot in central Ukraine, while in March that same yearan ammo dump at a base near Kharkiv suffered a series of explosions. Moscow denies sending troops and weapons to help separatists in the conflict, but admits that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev Ammunition depot explosions are unfortunately regular occurrences here. In part that is due to the large amount of Soviet-era munitions that Ukraine still has and in part because much of it is being stored inadequately, or even kept in the crates in the open rather than secured underground. Each time another depot combusts the question is raised as to whether the fault lies with the shoddy storage or whether more sinister forces are at play. This time it took just seven hours from the first explosion for the defence ministry to come forward and put its case. Information was presented that guided the public very firmly away from military negligence towards the idea that this was sabotage. Sabotage in the Ukrainian context is almost always a thinly veiled suggestion that Russia, either directly or through its rebel proxies, is responsible.

Trump apologises to Kavanaugh over 'lies',"This video can not be played Brett Kavanaugh spoke of his record of promoting women President Donald Trump has apologised to his new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh for what he described as a ""campaign of lies"" during the confirmation hearings. He was referring to the acrimonious debate over Mr Kavanaugh's nomination, after sexual assault allegations were made against him. Mr Kavanaugh said he was not bitter despite the ""contentious"" confirmation. He has denied the claims made by several women. The judge was confirmed by the Senate on Saturday, in a 50-48 vote that largely followed party lines. It is seen as a major victory for President Trump, tilting the balance in the nation's highest court in favour of conservatives for years to come. The political fallout from the Kavanaugh vote Can we tell if Democrats will win US election? One of the women accusing the judge, Prof Christine Blasey Ford, said Mr Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a house party in 1982 when they were high school students. She provided testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee and Mr Trump initially called her a ""compelling"" witness - but he later questioned her credibility and mocked her at a rally. As the White House ceremony got under way on Monday, Mr Trump said: ""On behalf of our nation, I want to apologise to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure."" And he decried a ""campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception"", adding that ""under historic scrutiny"", he had been ""proven innocent"". Last week, the FBI completed a report on sexual misconduct allegations against Mr Kavanaugh - but the findings have not been released to the public. This video can not be played Trump: ""The main base of the Democrats have shifted so far left we'll end up being Venezuela."" This video can not be played Donald Trump's nominee has been embroiled in a bitter battle over sexual assault allegations. Prof Ford has been unable to move back home because of ""unending"" death threats, according to one of her lawyers. Mr Trump says Democrats will lose in the 6 November congressional elections, which will shape the remainder of his presidency. The 53-year-old justice told the White House gathering that he would not let the ""bitter"" confirmation process affect his work on the highest court in the land. ""The Senate confirmation process was contentious and emotional,"" Justice Kavanaugh said. ""That process is over. My focus now is to be the best justice I can be,"" he added. Without mentioning the sexual assault allegations, he touted his record of promoting women - and the fact he has become the first justice to have an all-female staff. He will take his seat on Tuesday - on the far right of the bench, next to Justice Elena Kagan - hearing immigration and other cases. A handful of Democratic lawmakers, including congressmen Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and Ted Lieu of California, have pressed for Justice Kavanaugh's removal over the allegations. But top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has said trying to impeach the new justice ""would not be my plan"". A petition to impeach Justice Kavanaugh has more than 150,000 signatures. Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court Ms Pelosi says she will file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to make public the confidential FBI investigation into the claims against Justice Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh also faces more than a dozen judicial misconduct complaints over his public statements as a nominee to the Supreme Court.

NHS waste handler stripped of contracts,"A firm has been stripped of NHS contracts after hundreds of tonnes of clinical waste from hospitals was allowed to pile up at its sites. Health Minister Stephen Barclay said new arrangements have been made to replace the service by Healthcare Environmental Services (HES). HES says although it did also collect some body parts, this anatomical waste was correctly stored as per guidelines. It removed waste from a number of hospitals in England and Scotland. The Environment Agency first raised the alarm about the problem at the end of July, the government said. The government says there was ""absolutely no risk"" posed to the health of patients or the wider public. In a statement to Parliament, Mr Barclay said NHS Improvement concluded that HES ""failed to demonstrate that they were operating within their contractual limits. ""Consequently, 15 NHS Trusts served termination notices to HES formally to terminate their contracts at 4pm on Sunday,"" he said. New arrangements have been made with Mitie to ""step in and replace this service"" and ""NHS services continue to operate as normal"", Mr Barclay told MPs. Mr Barclay said the primary concern was that too much waste was being held in a number of waste storage and treatment sites by HES. ""While the waste was stored securely, it was not being processed and disposed of within the correct regulatory timescales. At no point has there been an impact on public health or any delay to the ability of the NHS to carry out operations,"" he said. The Environment Agency said HES was in breach of its environmental permits at four of its six sites which deal with clinical waste - by having more waste on site than their permit allows and storing waste inappropriately. The EA has launched a criminal investigation. HES said it had highlighted a reduction in the UK's high-temperature incineration capacity for the last few years to the UK government, NHS bodies and the Environment Agency. Mr Barclay insisted there was ""significant"" additional incineration capacity. The waste disposal firm is to retain its NHS contracts in Scotland despite being stripped of them in England and Wales. The Scottish Government said the decision did not apply here and existing contracts were unaffected. Are you a current or former employee of Healthcare Environmental Services? Please get in touch.

Prison pepper spray 'will worsen' conflictThe ex-governor of a high-security jail criticises a plan to issue prison officers with the spray.UKComments,"This video can not be played Custodial manager Ash Bateman demonstrates the spray Issuing prison officers with cans of pepper spray will worsen the current ""culture of conflict"", a former prison governor has told BBC News. John Podmore, who worked at high-security Belmarsh Prison in London, said there was ""a real risk the pepper sprays will be turned on the officers"". Prison officers in England and Wales are to be given synthetic pepper spray to help deal with disorder and violence, under new plans. Prison officers have praised the move. But the announcement came as the Prison Governors Association (PGA) accused the government of failing to react quickly enough to a ""crisis"" in jails. Head of prisons asked to quit amid crisis I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister The chemical incapacitant known as PAVA has been trialled in four jails - Hull, Preston, Risley in Warrington, and Wealstun in North Yorkshire. It will be carried by officers in all publicly-run prisons for men from 2019. The Ministry of Justice said the move, which will cost Â£2m, followed the ""successful"" six-month trials. But Mr Podmore said it was part of a ""downward spiral"", adding: ""The POA [the trade union for prison officers] are already now asking for Tasers. What next? Sidearms, rifles in conning towers on perimeters?"" Asked whether officers should be able to defend themselves against violent prisoners, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Good luck with one can of pepper spray against half a dozen prisoners. ""There is talk [from ministers] of this being a deterrent - I think for many prisoners it will be a challenge and there is a real risk the pepper sprays will be turned on the officers."" The MoJ said the spray would only be deployed in limited circumstances when there is serious violence or an imminent risk of it taking place and officers will receive training before being allowed to carry it. In a speech to the PGA conference later, president Andrea Albutt is to acknowledge there is a ""more positive feel"" in jails after staffing levels were increased and security boosted. But she will say there has been a ""subtle campaign"" to blame governors for problems and that ministers do not have the ""humility"" to admit their policies - which had included budget cuts - were wrong. An MoJ spokeswoman said: ""Senior managers in prisons do vital work and we are grateful for their dedication and commitment. ""We acknowledge the ongoing challenges they face and, as the president notes, we have taken meaningful action to address them which is starting to yield results.""

Paedophile sued by alleged Filipino victims,"A convicted British paedophile is being sued for damages by five young people who claim they were sexually exploited by him overseas, in what is thought to be the first case of its kind. The five are to give evidence to the High Court via video link about abuse they said they suffered while Douglas Slade was living in the Philippines. Slade says the claims against him are a ""total fabrication"". He wasjailed for 24 years in 2016 for abusing five boys in the UK. The judge in the case said Slade, who had been extradited to the UK the year before, was ""wholly unrepentant"" over the offences that he had committed between 1965 and 1980. Slade was a founder member of the Paedophile Information Exchange and actively campaigned for sex between children and paedophiles to be legalised in the 1970s and 1980s. Slade is appearing via video link from Albany prison on the Isle of Wight for the High Court case, which has been adjourned until Wednesday. It is believed to be the first time alleged foreign victims of sexual abuse, said to have taken place abroad, have brought an action against a British national in the UK. 'One of the vilest men in Britain' Slade moved to the Philippines in 1985, buying a house in a poor neighbourhood. Families complained that he enticed children into his home and sexually abused them. He lived in the country for 30 years and despite several investigations, was never successfully prosecuted there. The four young men and one teenage boy at the centre of the new case are suing Slade for ""personal injuries arising out of sexual abuse"" and will give evidence from Manila. The youngest was 10 at the time the abuse is alleged to have started. One of them told the BBC he was repeatedly sexually abused by Slade, saying: ""Many people avoid me and think that I have a disease because of what I did. I'm teased. I am too embarrassed to get out of the house."" The father of one of those suing Slade urged other alleged victims and their families to ""fight for their rights"". He added: ""They should be like us, we did not get blinded by money, we fought for it because we fought for the rights of our children."" Alan Collins, their solicitor, said those who travel abroad to sexually abuse children and young people need to get the message that ""you are not beyond reach"". Father Shay Cullen, a campaigner whose work helped secure Slade's extradition, wants the case to serve as a warning to travelling sex offenders. Father Cullen, who runs an organisation called Preda in the Philippines which helps vulnerable children, said: ""We will pursue (them) whenever possible and we continue to search and catch them here in the Philippines and where they will be, we will pursue them with legal action. ""This is a horrendous crime and the children continue to suffer all their lives."" The case is expected to last three days.

Sidearms, rifles in conning towers on perimeters?"" Asked whether officers should be able to defend themselves against violent prisoners, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Good luck with one can of pepper spray against half a dozen prisoners. ""There is talk [from ministers] of this being a deterrent - I think for many prisoners it will be a challenge and there is a real risk the pepper sprays will be turned on the officers."" The MoJ said the spray would only be deployed in limited circumstances when there is serious violence or an imminent risk of it taking place and officers will receive training before being allowed to carry it. In a speech to the PGA conference later, president Andrea Albutt is to acknowledge there is a ""more positive feel"" in jails after staffing levels were increased and security boosted. But she will say there has been a ""subtle campaign"" to blame governors for problems and that ministers do not have the ""humility"" to admit their policies - which had included budget cuts - were wrong. An MoJ spokeswoman said: ""Senior managers in prisons do vital work and we are grateful for their dedication and commitment.

NHS waste handler stripped of contractsHealthcare Environment Services has been stripped of NHS contracts.Health,"A firm has been stripped of NHS contracts after hundreds of tonnes of clinical waste from hospitals was allowed to pile up at its sites. Health Minister Stephen Barclay said new arrangements have been made to replace the service by Healthcare Environmental Services (HES). HES says although it did also collect some body parts, this anatomical waste was correctly stored as per guidelines. It removed waste from a number of hospitals in England and Scotland. The Environment Agency first raised the alarm about the problem at the end of July, the government said. The government says there was ""absolutely no risk"" posed to the health of patients or the wider public. In a statement to Parliament, Mr Barclay said NHS Improvement concluded that HES ""failed to demonstrate that they were operating within their contractual limits. ""Consequently, 15 NHS Trusts served termination notices to HES formally to terminate their contracts at 4pm on Sunday,"" he said. New arrangements have been made with Mitie to ""step in and replace this service"" and ""NHS services continue to operate as normal"", Mr Barclay told MPs. Mr Barclay said the primary concern was that too much waste was being held in a number of waste storage and treatment sites by HES. ""While the waste was stored securely, it was not being processed and disposed of within the correct regulatory timescales. At no point has there been an impact on public health or any delay to the ability of the NHS to carry out operations,"" he said. The Environment Agency said HES was in breach of its environmental permits at four of its six sites which deal with clinical waste - by having more waste on site than their permit allows and storing waste inappropriately. The EA has launched a criminal investigation. HES said it had highlighted a reduction in the UK's high-temperature incineration capacity for the last few years to the UK government, NHS bodies and the Environment Agency. Mr Barclay insisted there was ""significant"" additional incineration capacity. The waste disposal firm is to retain its NHS contracts in Scotland despite being stripped of them in England and Wales. The Scottish Government said the decision did not apply here and existing contracts were unaffected. Are you a current or former employee of Healthcare Environmental Services? Please get in touch.

White tiger kills zookeeper in Japan,"It's not clear what triggered the white tiger's attack (file photo) A rare white tiger has mauled a zookeeper to death in its enclosure at a zoo in Japan, officials say. Akira Furusho, 40, was found bleeding from the neck in the tiger's cage at the zoo in the southern city of Kagoshima. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead. The male tiger, named Riku, was sedated with a tranquiliser before rescue workers and police arrived. It is to be kept alive following a request from the victim's family. ""We plan not to kill Riku and continue to keep it because the bereaved family asked us to do so,"" said Takuro Nagasako, a zoo official said, quoted by the AFP news agency. White tiger kills man at Delhi zoo Zoo attacks and the people who survive them Meet the man who's survived a snake, bear and shark attack The attack took place late on Monday at the Hirakawa Zoological Park in Kagoshima. It is thought it happened as Mr Furusho went to clean the tiger's enclosure. Tigers are normally removed from the display pen to a separate area before staff enter. Police are now investigating how the zoo looks after the four white tigers it keeps.

US trade war would make world 'poorer',"The International Monetary Fund has warned a trade war between the US and China risks making the world a ""poorer and more dangerous place"" in its latest assessment of the global economy. The IMF has lowered its forecast for global growth this year and next. It said that a full-blown trade war between the US and China would put a significant dent in economic recovery. Its chief economist said further trade barriers would hit households, businesses and the wider economy. ""Trade policy reflects politics and politics remain unsettled in several countries, posing further risks,"" said Maurice Obstfeld. US-China trade war: a tale of two Chinas US-China trade row: The story so far Most recently, China announced new trade tariffs on $60bn of US goods, including products such as liquefied natural gas, produced in states loyal to the US President Donald Trump. In a tweet, Mr Trump warned Beijing against seeking to influence the forthcoming US midterm elections. ""There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!"" he said. US tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports came into effect last month. Global economic growth is now expected to reach 3.7% in 2018 and 2019, down from the IMF's previous prediction of 3.9% in July. It said that risks to the short-term outlook had ""shifted to the downside"". Downgrades to global growth also reflected predictions of a slower expansion in the eurozone as well as turbulence in a number of emerging market economies. Crisis-hit Venezuela is expected to enter its sixth year of recession in 2019, with inflation predicted to hit ten million per cent next year. Argentina, which recently agreed an IMF bailout, is also predicted to see its economy shrink in 2018 and 2019. The US and China's escalation of trade tariffs is expected to hit growth in both countries in 2019, when the boost from President Trump's sweeping tax cuts will also start to wane. Mr Obstfeld said the world would become a ""poorer and more dangerous place"" unless world leaders worked together to raise living standards, improve education and reduce inequality. The IMF warned that the world faced a permanent hit to growth if the US followed through on a threat to impose a 25% on all imported cars, and global tariffs hit business confidence, investment and borrowing costs. In this worst case scenario, the US economy would take a significant hit, while economic growth in China would drop below 5% in 2019, compared with a current prediction of 6.2%. The UK economy is expected to expand by 1.4% this year and 1.5% in 2019. The IMF said a ""no-deal"" Brexit remained a risk. It believes Brexit will fundamentally change parts of the UK economy, leaving some workers out of a job. It said the government would need to do more to retrain or relocate workers in industries that are ""likely to be more affected by higher trade barriers after Brexit"". While the IMF said UK interest rate rises would need to rise over the next few years to keep a lid on inflation, it urged the Bank of England to remain ""flexible"" and ready to move in either direction depending on the outcome of Brexit negotiations. The IMF predicts that UK public borrowing will keep falling over the next few years. However, Chancellor Philip Hammond is still expected to borrow around Â£16bn in 2023 to plug the gap between tax revenues and public spending.

Synthetic pepper spray for prison officers,"This video can not be played Custodial manager Ash Bateman demonstrates the spray Issuing prison officers with cans of pepper spray will worsen the current ""culture of conflict"", a former prison governor has told BBC News. John Podmore, who worked at high-security Belmarsh Prison in London, said there was ""a real risk the pepper sprays will be turned on the officers"". Prison officers in England and Wales are to be given synthetic pepper spray to help deal with disorder and violence, under new plans. Prison officers have praised the move. But the announcement came as the Prison Governors Association (PGA) accused the government of failing to react quickly enough to a ""crisis"" in jails. Head of prisons asked to quit amid crisis I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister The chemical incapacitant known as PAVA has been trialled in four jails - Hull, Preston, Risley in Warrington, and Wealstun in North Yorkshire. It will be carried by officers in all publicly-run prisons for men from 2019. The Ministry of Justice said the move, which will cost Â£2m, followed the ""successful"" six-month trials. But Mr Podmore said it was part of a ""downward spiral"", adding: ""The POA [the trade union for prison officers] are already now asking for Tasers. What next? Sidearms, rifles in conning towers on perimeters?"" Asked whether officers should be able to defend themselves against violent prisoners, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Good luck with one can of pepper spray against half a dozen prisoners. ""There is talk [from ministers] of this being a deterrent - I think for many prisoners it will be a challenge and there is a real risk the pepper sprays will be turned on the officers."" The MoJ said the spray would only be deployed in limited circumstances when there is serious violence or an imminent risk of it taking place and officers will receive training before being allowed to carry it. In a speech to the PGA conference later, president Andrea Albutt is to acknowledge there is a ""more positive feel"" in jails after staffing levels were increased and security boosted. But she will say there has been a ""subtle campaign"" to blame governors for problems and that ministers do not have the ""humility"" to admit their policies - which had included budget cuts - were wrong. An MoJ spokeswoman said: ""Senior managers in prisons do vital work and we are grateful for their dedication and commitment.

How Brexit could change your fag packets,"The UK has struck a deal with Australia to use graphic warnings from its tobacco packaging Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, it has emerged.

However, the government said in August they must change becausethe European Commission owned the copyright,external. Now it says the Australian government has agreed to supply alternatives.

Morrisons appealing over data leak payouts,"More than 5,000 current and former employees are seeking compensation from Morrisons A legal battle for compensation by thousands of Morrisons staff whose personal details were posted online by a disgruntled employee has reached the Court of Appeal. The High Court ruled last yearthat the supermarket was liable for the release of information and its employees were entitled to compensation. The case is the first data leak class action in the UK. The proceedings are due to take place on Tuesday. Morrisons' appeal has significant implications for other organisations, who could also be found liable to pay compensation for the acts of rogue employees. Morrisons liable for staff data leak Data leak: Morrisons worker jailed In 2014 Andrew Skelton, then a senior internal auditor at Morrisons' Bradford headquarters, leaked the payroll data of more than 100,000 employees, including their names, addresses, bank account details and salaries. A court subsequently heard that he harboured a ""considerable grudge"" against the company after he was accused of dealing drugs known as legal highs at work. In July 2015 Skelton was found guilty of fraud and disclosing personal data and jailed for eight years. Morrisons spent more than Â£2m on measures to tackle the breach. But last year the High Court ruled the supermarket was vicariously liable as, despite Skelton's criminality, he was acting in the course of his employment when he leaked the information online. This meant a group of more than 5,000 former and current employees, exposed to the risk of identity theft and potential financial loss, were entitled to compensation. The supermarket said it could not be held directly or vicariously liable for the criminal misuse of the data and is to challenge the decision at a hearing on Tuesday. Nick McAleenan, of JMW Solicitors,  who is representing the claimants, described the dispute as a ""classic David and Goliath case"". He said by seeking to reverse the High Court ruling, Morrisons was denying the claimants any compensation for ""the considerable distress and inconvenience caused by Mr Skelton's actions"". ""It cannot be right that there is no legal recourse where employee information has been handed to one of the largest companies in the UK and then leaked on such a large scale, in such circumstances,"" he said.

Mesh 'last option' for incontinence,"The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs Women who need treatment for urinary incontinence should only be offered mesh surgery as a last resort, new draft guidelines for the NHS advise. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says non-surgical options, like pelvic muscle exercises, are the first to turn to. The NHS in England has already put restrictions on mesh operations after safety concerns. Many women say the implants cause agony by cutting into tissue. It is estimated that more than 100,000 UK women have had a mesh fitted. The net-like fabric can be attached into the wall of the vagina to act as a scaffold to support organs, such as the bladder, to keep them in the right place to help manage incontinence or another condition called prolapse. Hundreds sue NHS over 'barbaric' treatment Mesh led to 'excrutiating pain' What's the issue with mesh implants? This video can not be played Claire Cooper was left unable to have sex because of the pain Mesh operations have not been banned altogether during the NHS ""pause"" - carefully selected patients continue to have access in discussion with their consultant. The new guidelines for England make it clear that any woman considering having the surgery for incontinence or prolapse should be fully aware of the possible risks: pain and/or painful intercourse infection vaginal bleeding or discharge bowel problems Patients and doctors should report any complications associated with the implants to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Details of the complications should be logged in a national registry. Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE, said: ""Where surgical mesh/tape could be an option, there is almost always another intervention recommended in our guideline, which does not involve surgical mesh/tape. If a surgeon cannot provide a full range of choices to the patient, then she should be referred to one who can."" The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and The British Society of Urogynaecology both welcomed the NICE guidelines. But Kath Sansom, from the campaign group Sling The Mesh, said the guidelines did not go far enough. ""Our ideal scenario is to see pelvic mesh stopped. Full stop. The risks are too great. It is totally unacceptable that women come out of a 'simple little operation' with shattered lives.""

Rare white tiger kills zookeper in Japan,"It's not clear what triggered the white tiger's attack (file photo) A rare white tiger has mauled a zookeeper to death in its enclosure at a zoo in Japan, officials say. Akira Furusho, 40, was found bleeding from the neck in the tiger's cage at the zoo in the southern city of Kagoshima. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead. The male tiger, named Riku, was sedated with a tranquiliser before rescue workers and police arrived. It is to be kept alive following a request from the victim's family. ""We plan not to kill Riku and continue to keep it because the bereaved family asked us to do so,"" said Takuro Nagasako, a zoo official said, quoted by the AFP news agency. White tiger kills man at Delhi zoo Zoo attacks and the people who survive them Meet the man who's survived a snake, bear and shark attack The attack took place late on Monday at the Hirakawa Zoological Park in Kagoshima. It is thought it happened as Mr Furusho went to clean the tiger's enclosure. Tigers are normally removed from the display pen to a separate area before staff enter. Police are now investigating how the zoo looks after the four white tigers it keeps. In 2017,a British zookeeper was killed by a tigerin its enclosure in a Cambridgeshire zoo whilein Russia, a keeper survived a tiger attackin the city of Kaliningrad. White tigers are an endangered species White tigers are a rare variant of the orange Bengal sub-species and owe their colour to a recessive gene Today, they are exclusively in captive programmes where the limited numbers are interbred to maintain the distinctive fur colour A number of the white tigers found in zoos have health issues, such as eyesight problems and deformities The last known free-ranging white tiger is known to have been shot in 1958, before which sporadic sightings in the wild were made in India Zoo attacks and the people who survive them White tiger kills man at Delhi zoo Briton killed by sea snake in Australia Zoo worker killed by tiger 'loved job' Briton injured in attack by own lion Man mauled by bear survives shark attack Zookeeper recovering from tiger attack New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Trump tariffs make world 'more dangerous',"The International Monetary Fund has warned a trade war between the US and China risks making the world a ""poorer and more dangerous place"" in its latest assessment of the global economy. The IMF has lowered its forecast for global growth this year and next. It said that a full-blown trade war between the US and China would put a significant dent in economic recovery. Its chief economist said further trade barriers would hit households, businesses and the wider economy. ""Trade policy reflects politics and politics remain unsettled in several countries, posing further risks,"" said Maurice Obstfeld. US-China trade war: a tale of two Chinas US-China trade row: The story so far Most recently, China announced new trade tariffs on $60bn of US goods, including products such as liquefied natural gas, produced in states loyal to the US President Donald Trump. In a tweet, Mr Trump warned Beijing against seeking to influence the forthcoming US midterm elections. ""There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!"" he said. US tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports came into effect last month. Global economic growth is now expected to reach 3.7% in 2018 and 2019, down from the IMF's previous prediction of 3.9% in July. It said that risks to the short-term outlook had ""shifted to the downside"". Downgrades to global growth also reflected predictions of a slower expansion in the eurozone as well as turbulence in a number of emerging market economies. Crisis-hit Venezuela is expected to enter its sixth year of recession in 2019, with inflation predicted to hit ten million per cent next year. Argentina, which recently agreed an IMF bailout, is also predicted to see its economy shrink in 2018 and 2019. The US and China's escalation of trade tariffs is expected to hit growth in both countries in 2019, when the boost from President Trump's sweeping tax cuts will also start to wane. Mr Obstfeld said the world would become a ""poorer and more dangerous place"" unless world leaders worked together to raise living standards, improve education and reduce inequality. The IMF warned that the world faced a permanent hit to growth if the US followed through on a threat to impose a 25% on all imported cars, and global tariffs hit business confidence, investment and borrowing costs. In this worst case scenario, the US economy would take a significant hit, while economic growth in China would drop below 5% in 2019, compared with a current prediction of 6.2%. The UK economy is expected to expand by 1.4% this year and 1.5% in 2019. The IMF said a ""no-deal"" Brexit remained a risk. It believes Brexit will fundamentally change parts of the UK economy, leaving some workers out of a job. It said the government would need to do more to retrain or relocate workers in industries that are ""likely to be more affected by higher trade barriers after Brexit"". While the IMF said UK interest rate rises would need to rise over the next few years to keep a lid on inflation, it urged the Bank of England to remain ""flexible"" and ready to move in either direction depending on the outcome of Brexit negotiations. The IMF predicts that UK public borrowing will keep falling over the next few years. However, Chancellor Philip Hammond is still expected to borrow around Â£16bn in 2023 to plug the gap between tax revenues and public spending.

UK film and TV sees record investmentThe BFI says UK screen industries generated a record Â£7.9bn in 2016 thanks to tax breaks.Business,"The Crown is one of the high-end television dramas singled out as benefitting from the tax relief The British Film Institute (BFI) says the UK film and TV industry generated a record Â£7.9bn in 2016, helped by government tax reliefs. A BFI-commissioned report found that Â£632m in tax relief prompted additional spending of more than Â£3bn on the creation of films, high-end television, such as The Crown, and computer games. It said HM Revenue and Customs got more than that money back, gaining Â£2bn tax. The BFI says this proves the value of such tax reliefs to the wider economy. The report looked at the effects of tax reliefs granted across the UK's screen industries, which include film, high-end television programmes, video games and animation programmes, and children's TV. The BFI claims the money generated 137,000 jobs in 2016 alone. Another beneficiary is tourism. Films with a strong UK story, place and culture such as Harry Potter, Paddington and Kingsman have featured prominently in UK tourism campaigns. The BFI said high-end television production in the UK has also boomed since the introduction of the tax relief in 2013.  Major shows which have been hits around the world include Game of Thrones, The Crown, The Night Manager and Black Mirror. The report estimated that visitors to the UK spent almost Â£600m in film-related tourism. UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond welcomed the report, saying: ""From TV shows like The Crown, to films like Darkest Hour, and animations like Peppa Pig, our creative industries are intrinsic to the rich cultural fabric of the UK."" He said they had supported tens of thousands of jobs and helped to develop clusters of excellence across the UK, such as those in Dundee (video games), Cardiff (TV) and Church Fenton in North Yorkshire (film and TV). The BFI said it commissioned the report, called Screen Business, to provide the solid evidence of success needed to attract continued public and private investment in the screen industries. It said this would help policymakers to help create the best possible conditions for future growth.

Save the Children staff 'harassed'A review of workplace culture followed sexual misconduct claims against two former executives.UK,"Almost one in five staff at Save the Children UK has said they experienced harassment or discrimination in the past three years. The charity ordered a review of its workplace culture following revelations about its handling of sexual misconduct claims against two former executives. It has apologised for past failures in its ""organisational culture"". But one ex-employee said ""not a lot has changed"" at the charity in terms of its leadership since she was there in 2015. The review led by ethics expert Suzanne Shale was commissioned in February after sexual abuse claims against Oxfam GB staff in Haiti became public and threw a spotlight on the entire charity sector. Sexual harassment allegations that had been made by women against Save the Children's former chief executive Justin Forsyth and its former director of policy, Brendan Cox, werelater revealed by the BBC. Both men apologised for their past behaviour but said they did not accept all the claims that had been made against them. But MrForsyth subsequently resigned from his role as deputy director of Unicef, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities. Charity 'failed' on harassment claims - leaked report Save the Children chairman resigns New inquiry into Save the Children charity Some 28% of the 700 current members of staff who responded to the review said they had experienced discrimination or harassment - 19% of the charity's total 1,068 staff, not including volunteers. The most common complaint from staff was of people's opinions being ignored but some said they had experienced ""spontaneous anger"" and had felt humiliated and ridiculed. Dr Shale's report said there were ""a small number of incidents of gender harassment and unwanted sexual attention"" in the last three years although no evidence of sexual coercion. Incidents highlighted included: Some women being told they were too outspoken ""with the implication they should 'tone it down' if they wanted to progress"" A small number receiving comments on their dress at work that suggested to them that appearance was being judged as more importance than competence Unwanted sexual attention - written or verbal with comments about dress, sexual innuendo, sexualised remarks or intrusive questions about personal life or invitations to meet that had become uncomfortable Some ""suggestive gestures, staring or touching in areas such as the waist"" - sometimes associated with drinking at work events Comments about women being less reliable because of pregnancy or that they were less committed because of child care responsibilities Dr Shale said while most staff found Save the Children a ""supportive and collegiate"" employer ""any experiences of interpersonal mistreatment at work are disturbing"". The review called on the charity to provide better oversight and governance of staff. Chief executive Kevin Watkins pledged swift action on the findings, saying staff would be consulted on a new plan to ensure improvements in working culture. The charity would also aim to improve the diversity of its staff following recommendations from Dr Shale. ""Our brilliant, passionate, hard-working staff are committed to our mission of bringing hope to some of the world's most vulnerable children. They have a right to be protected against harassment of any kind,"" Mr Watkins said. He added: ""There have been failures in our organisational culture and processes, including widely reported historic cases in which there were abuses of power and authority. ""To the women affected, I unreservedly and unconditionally apologise on behalf of Save the Children. It must never happen again."" Justin Forsyth stepped down from his current job after complaints about his behaviour at Save The Children in 2015 became public Claire Rowney, an executive director of Save the Children, suggested the problems at the charity were of a comparable level to organisations such as the civil service and NHS. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme 90% of staff felt very proud to work at Save the Children, adding: ""Progress has been made over the last three years and we have taken action to make sure staff feel more protected in the workplace, including mandatory training for all staff."" However, former Save the Children employee Alexia Pepper de Cairies, whose complaint about the culture in the charity helped sparked a review in 2015, said she was ""disappointed"" by the report, saying it had not acted on earlier recommendations. Ms de Cairies said: ""I thought it said a lot of the same things that we saw in 2015 when I worked at the charity. Not a lot has changed in terms of the leadership of the charity.""
