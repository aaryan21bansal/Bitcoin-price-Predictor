Bellew 'will give Haye a tough fight',"David Haye weighed in at 16st 9oz for his fight with Tony Bellew, who weighed 15st 3lb 8oz David Haye v Tony Bellew Venue:O2 Arena, LondonDate:4 MarchTime:22:00 GMT approx Coverage:Full commentary on BBC Radio 5 live and live text updates on the BBC Sport website. Tony Bellew has been ""underestimated"" in the build-up to Saturday's heavyweight fight with David Haye, says former world champion Richie Woodhall. WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew, 34, weighed in at 15st 3lb 8oz, lighter than 36-year-old Haye (16st 9oz). The pair again traded insults at London's O2 Arena, where Haye starts as odds-on favourite with the bookmakers. ""I can't believe people aren't giving him a bigger chance,"" said Woodhall, a BBC Radio 5 live pundit. Listen to Costello and Bunce boxing podcast Quiz: Who said these classic boxing put-downs? Haye v Bellew: Their rivalry in their own words ""I don't think it's a foregone conclusion. Everyone is saying a Haye early knockout but I think it will be a tough fight for him."" Bermondsey-born Haye was cheered by a big crowd at Friday's weigh-in as he prepares to fight at a venue just six miles from where he grew up. Only once in his 30-fight career has he weighed in heavier than for this bout. The former WBA heavyweight champion mocked the physique of Bellew, who said he was ""over the moon"" to see his rival so heavy. Bellew, who as recently as 2013 was fighting two weight classes lower, reiterated his belief Haye would be short on stamina in just his third fight since returning from over three years out of the sport. Woodhall believes Haye will be ""extremely dangerous"" early in the fight and expects Bellew to build his tactics around dragging a knockout specialist - who has been in just three 12-round contests - into the latter rounds. ""It's a classic case of who will land the big shot,"" added 1988 Olympic bronze medallist Woodhall. ""Bellew's first goal will be to get through the first four rounds, when we know Haye is at his most explosive. If he gets through he will not be home and dry by any means but his fight will then start and he can think about trying to break Haye down. ""The one thing against Haye is he's only fought a couple of times since 2012. I think he will solely rely on getting Bellew out early."" This video can not be played David Haye v Tony Bellew: Fighters trade insults at press conference Haye has been criticised for graphic descriptions of how he intends to hurt his opponent, while Bellew has actively pursued the fight, calling his foe out publicly from the ring after a routine win in October. The feud has meantboth fighters have been kept apart by securityin fight week, and the pre-fight face-off was also conducted with people between them. British Boxing Board of Control general secretary Robert Smith has expressed his disappointment in their behaviour. ""When it's all over, they will look back and neither one of them will be proud of beforehand,"" added Woodhall, 48. ""You have to have a balance. We all want the fight to sell but you don't want people pointing the finger at the sport of boxing. ""Psychologically, I think Bellew has played a blinder. Haye has to control his emotions early on. If he ends up swinging early on, missing the target, then the tide turns. I think Bellew wants Haye to come out very aggressively."" Haye is attempting to improve his record of 28 wins from 30 fights, while Bellew has 28 wins, two losses and one draw on his record. Ohara Davies is unbeaten in 14 fights, while Derry Mathews is preparing for his 52nd contest The bitterness between Haye and Bellew has been mirrored by super-lightweight rivals Derry Mathews and Ohara Davies. The pair have engaged in insulting social media exchanges and expletive-laden rants before a bout which is the biggest of Davies' 14-fight career, and could help 33-year-old Mathews keep hopes of another world-title shot alive. Woodhall expects the welterweight fight between Sam Eggington and American Paulie Malignaggi to potentially steal the show. Malignaggi, 36, has been a world champion at two weights and has shared a ring with stellar names such as Amir Khan, Adrian Broner and Danny Garcia. Wales' IBF featherweight championLee Selbywill contest a non-title bout against Spain's Andoni Gago, while Ireland's London 2012 Olympic champion Katie Taylor enters her third fight as a professional when she faces Italy's Monica Gentili, who has six wins and as many losses in her career.

Report questions Salazar testosterone use,"Salazar (centre) coaches US athlete Galen Rupp as well as Britain's Olympic champion Mo Farah Further details of a secret report by doping authorities into Mo Farah's coach Alberto Salazar suggest he broke rules over banned steroid testosterone. Salazar has been under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) since aBBC Panorama programmein 2015. The leaked interim report states the American has thus far failed to provide ""acceptable justification for possessing testosterone"" at his Nike Oregon Project (NOP) running camp. Salazar stronglydenies breaking rules. The 58-year-old claims he is being ""persecuted"". The Usada report, hacked by the suspected Russian group Fancy Bears and passed to the Sunday Times Insight investigations team, has been seen by the BBC. According to the report, dating from March 2016, Salazar and several of his athletes have impeded Usada investigators, and ""almost certainly"" broke anti-doping rules over the infusion of a legal supplement L-carnitine. This video can not be played Farah breaks European record in his final indoor race The report also states Salazar risked the health of his athletes, including Farah, by issuing potentially harmful prescription medicines, including thyroid replacement drugs, to boost performance, despite there being no obvious medical need. But his possession of the banned anabolic steroid testosterone around the NOP athletes he coaches, first revealed by Panorama in June 2015, could also lead to him being banned from the sport. Salazar insists he has a valid prescription for the drug. The report: alleges Salazar broke anti-doping rules by failing to establish an ""acceptable justification"" for possession of testosterone. states that a testosterone ""experiment"" conducted in conjunction with Nike doctor Jeffrey Brown to see how much rubbed testosterone gel would trigger a positive dope test was ""unlawful"". raises ""suspicions and concerns"" about Salazar's practice of giving star athlete Galen Rupp personal massages before big races, despite Nike employing massage therapists. The allegations about Salazar's testosterone use emerged after former NOP coach Steve Magness, athlete Kara Goucher and masseur John Stiner spoke to BBC Panorama. The trio are among dozens who have been interviewed by Usada as part of its ongoing investigation. Rule 21.2.6 of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code stipulates that athlete support personnel are strictly prohibited from possessing banned drugs without ""valid justification"". Salazar produced a12,000-word public response,externalto the BBC and ProPublica's allegations, including a letter from a specialist stating he required the testosterone for his personal use because he had been diagnosed with hypogonadism, which results in low testosterone. He also said the testosterone experiment, which used his own sons as ""guinea pigs"", was designed to protect against his athletes being sabotaged by someone rubbing testosterone gel on them after a race so that they would test positive. According to the leaked report, five days after the Panorama programme, Usada wrote to Salazar, asking him to provide ""all medical records for you referring to [a] condition for which you have been prescribed testosterone"". The report states Salazar's lawyer produced seven documents in support of his condition, but concluded ""the documents â¦ do not establish Mr Salazar has suffered from hypogonadismâ¦ or that he requires testosterone replacement therapy. ""Despite Usada's request that he do so, Mr Salazar has still produced no laboratory testing records, blood test data, examination notes, chart notes or differential diagnosis substantiating that Mr Salazar suffers from hypogonadism."" The report states ""as of March 17, 2016, Mr Salazar's lawyer had still not provided additional documentation to Usadaâ¦[and therefore] has not established acceptable justification for possessing testosterone and his admitted possession of testosterone appears to have been a violation of sport anti-doping rules"". The report adds that the concerns listed above are ""before even mentioning the Nike Oregon Project document which lists Galen Rupp having received 'testosterone medication' when he was a 16-year-old and being coached by Salazar, as well as Mary Decker Slaney's sanction for an elevated testosterone level while she was being coached by Salazar ."" Salazar's athletes include Britain's Olympic champion Mo Farah and the USA's London 2012 10,000m silver medallist Galen Rupp (right) Salazar and Rupp, the London 2012 10,000m silver medallist, strongly deny any wrongdoing. In a series of emails in response to BBC questions, Salazar said he would never permit doping at the Oregon Project, and that all the allegations against him were ""biased and false"". ""I have never rubbed any prohibited substance on Galen or any of my other athletes. These allegations and innuendo against me are malicious nonsense. I have not seen the report and the parts relayed to me are false - demonstrably false and directly refuted by documentary evidence provided to Usada."" He said: ""I believe I've done more than any coach to continuously disprove false allegations where no violation has occurred. While I am frustrated that for years now I have had to answer in the media the same, rehashed, false accusations, I take comfort in knowing, that actions speak louder than words. ""The Oregon Project athletes continue to earn success through talent, hard work, dedication and fair play. ""I voluntarily provided Usada with medical records, including blood test results, documenting that I have suffered from a diagnosed disability for more than 20 years. Usada has not requested anything additional since my last response. I find this issue very disturbing, as under US law Usada is required to make a reasonable accommodation for my disability, not persecute me. ""I feel that I am not required to continually, for years and without explanation, share my very personal and private medical records with Usada over a disability that has been diagnosed by multiple doctors for decades. Any insinuation by Usada that I do not suffer from this condition is offensive to me and my treating physicians, and is inexcusable."" The BBC has specifically asked Salazar on three separate occasions in recent days whether he produced any further medical evidence to Usada after 17 March, 2016 the date the leaked report was compiled. He has declined to answer this question. The leaked Usada report comes after months of speculation the agency's investigation had withered away. Nine months ago, Farah said he felt vindicated after standing by Salazar. UK Athletics had alsogiven Farah the all clearto keep working with him following its own investigation, saying that it had ""no reason to be concerned"". On Thursday, it confirmed it would continue to have a close relationship with Salazar, who remains a consultant to UKA, unless he was charged with a doping offence. Farah himself, according to the report, remains under investigation over an alleged 2014 infusion of the legal supplement L-carnitine, specifically whether it breached the legal limit of 50ml. He strongly denies breaking any rules. Farah said last week that Usada should go ahead and publish its findings. It is understood the delay in publishing at least in part is because Usada is looking to the courts to force Dr Jeffrey Brown, the Nike doctor accused of conspiring with Salazar, to hand over his medical records. Dr Brown, who also denies any wrongdoing, is based in Houston, Texas, and the Texan Medical Board (TMB) is carrying out its own investigation into him. The TMB did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Last week, Usada said: ""We understand that the licensing body [TMB] is still deciding its case and as we continue to investigate whether anti-doping rules were broken, no further comment will be made at this time. Salazar has been under Usada investigation since 2015 ""Importantly, all athletes, coaches and others under the jurisdiction of the World Anti-Doping Code are innocent and presumed to have complied with the rules unless and until the established anti-doping process declares otherwise. It is unfair and reckless to state, infer or imply differently."" Salazar has been Farah's coach since 2011, and has masterminded his rise to become Britain's greatest ever distance runner with a haul of four Olympic gold medals. But questions will persist about his continuing loyalty to a man the doping authorities appear to believe has violated not just the sport's doping code, but its ethical ones too.

Scared to vomit - how my phobia means chicken scares me,"Hannah Ellis: ""Sometimes I worry if I'm ever going to cope with having a family"" Nobody likes being sick. But Hannah Ellis says her fear of vomiting is so intense that ""chicken scares me"" and she panics if friends or family fall ill. The 19-year-old from Sheffield has emetophobia, a condition affecting thousands people in the UK. My flatmates are probably wondering why I'm eating pasta and tomato sauce for the fourth evening in a row. It's not because I'm skint, the truth is that chicken or the thought of reheating food is terrifying. My phobia of vomiting - even the word churns my stomach - dictates nearly every aspect of my life. Being a university fresher is always nerve-wracking but for me it's been 10 times harder. Nights out are a struggle because I can't drink too much or look after my friends if they're unwell. If my boyfriend, friends or family get ill I don't think: ""Are they OK?"" My first thought is: ""Oh God, am I going to get ill?"" It makes me feel guilty. Hannah, a journalism student, hopes to travel to Thailand but says ""it's not feasible"" right now I used to be scared to eat at all in case I would throw up. Now, when I make a sandwich it has to be slightly toasted because I keep my bread in the freezer in case it goes mouldy. I'll bin anything I opened two days ago if it says ""once opened eat within two days"". It began at the age of 10 when I got food poisoning on a holiday to Egypt, but I've blocked that out now. I haven't been sick since. I was lucky because a family friend's daughter had it. She told my mum what it was, and that it was a thing with a name. Doctors I went to said I had anxiety but I'm not an anxious person, it's just sick that scares me. They sent me to counselling which didn't help, they just thought it was a deeper issue. I was hypnotised but that didn't work - maybe I'm too cynical. I've found my own way of dealing with it, trying not to think about it all day and getting on with my life. I'm a lot better than I used to be. I gave my flatmates the lowdown before I moved in and they're really considerate. It was really hard to make new friends at secondary school because I was scared to eat at people's houses and always had to pick the restaurant. Now I only ever panic when someone near me is contagiously sick, or when I actually feel sick. ""Pasta's fine, it won't make me sick"" says Hannah, who avoids eating out But sometimes I think, ""Oh God, am I ever going to have a family?"" because I can't bear the thought of morning sickness or my own children being ill. My parents told me that when I have my own kids it'll feel different - so I'm clinging onto that. I'd love to be able to travel without being scared one day. I'd go to Thailand, but it's not a feasible option at the moment. Emetophobes might restrict their diet, avoid eating out and even prevent pregnancy due to the fear of morning sickness. They may refuse to go to school or work if there is a sickness bug going around. ""It's truly debilitating"", explains Nicky Lidbetter, chief executive of charity, Anxiety UK. ""I've known women who have not become mothers because of it."" The number of UK sufferers is thought to be in the hundreds of thousands with around 80% of these being women. There are no exact figures due to lack of research and misdiagnosis. Anxiety UK, which receives around 15,000 inquiries a year to its telephone helpline, says around one in 20 callers report signs of emetophobia. Most are women, Ms Lidbetter says. ""We think it's because women are more likely to fear the social ramifications of being sick."" But ""we don't have an accurate picture"" of the phobia according to Alexandra Keyes of the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, a researcher in emetophobia at King's College London. ""It's classified as an 'other' type phobia"", says Ms Keyes. ""This is unhelpful for clinicians, who may misdiagnose someone as having an eating disorder or OCD."" Emetophobia usually emerges after someone has had a traumatic experience of vomiting, especially in childhood. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most common treatment for sufferers and is available on the NHS, says Ms Keyes. King's College London is trialling intensive sessions where sufferers are presented with ""feared situations"" - including sitting next to a hospital patient or visiting a restaurant where they do not know the hygiene rating. ""We also make up concoctions of fake vomit and use role play to confront someone with a sick person,"" Ms Keyes adds. Hypnotherapy is another treatment option, but it is not typically available on the NHS. Ms Lidbetter says: ""It really helps people relax and feel more in control."" Sufferers can find out more about the condition, and meet like-minded people online.

'I saved commuter who dropped her phone on tracks',"The powerful lure of smartphones has created a heads-down culture in many public places. John Mervin in New York came across someone who just might benefit from a little digital detox. I'd never saved someone's life before, so I wasn't sure of the protocol. Speechless incomprehension on my part didn't seem appropriate. But then neither did the young woman's giddy laughter, or her jaunty departure from what could so easily have been the scene of her death. It took my daughter's torrent of questions, as we turned away, to force the world back into a semblance of order: ""Daddy - what was she doing? Why was she on the tracks? What would have happened if a train came?"" As we climbed the stairs into New York's gleaming winter sunshine, I tried to explain what we had just seen. We'd arrived at Rockefeller Center station on the D train. As in many of New York's underground stations, trains pull in at both sides of the platform. Or, rather, they seem to erupt into the station first on one side, then on the other. When the stations are busy, the platforms feel like narrow, crowded islands of safety. We picked our way along this one, my wife and youngest daughter in front, my eldest daughter and I at the rear. Abruptly, my wife stopped. ""Uh, what's this?"" she said. I looked over her shoulder. There at our feet lay a young woman of about 20. She was on her stomach with the top half of her body on the platform, while her legs dangled over the tracks kicking pathetically. She was stuck. She had also, clearly, been down on the tracks. And just as each commuter imagines, as they stand on the platform edge pondering the end of it all, she had discovered that climbing back up from the tracks is really hard. The lip of the platform sticks out so far that you have to climb out as well as up. That leaves you straining to keep half your body on the platform while the other half flails wildly for some purchase in mid-air. But unlike in our morbid imaginings, this woman was not in the grips of panic, anticipating her imminent decapitation by the F train which would be screeching into the station in the next few minutes, if not seconds. She was laughing! Giggling! So was her friend who half-heartedly leant down to assist. The assistance was somewhat compromised by the fact that the friend was holding her mobile phone. Was she hoping to capture this moment with a picture? Or composing a text? It's well known that people's compulsive checking of their phones  can be deadly. Among young people in America, texting is now the number one cause of car crashes. Maybe it's also a leading cause of leaving friends to perish when they fall in the river or on to the train tracks. In any case, I stepped forward. Absurd as it might seem, my immediate concern was which part of her body it was OK to touch. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST For the mechanics of dragging her to safety the obvious place to grab would have been her inner thigh. But that seemed indecent. An assault even. Well, what about the belt loop on the back of her jeans? No! That would wrench her clothing into some painful, awkward position. But for goodness sake, she was about to be killed. This wasn't the time to fret about the niceties! So I leant out as far as I could, got hold of her leg somewhere near the knee and, together with her finally-engaged friend, hauled the young woman on to the platform. New York's transit authority constantly warns passengers not to go on to the tracks for any reason. But there is a constant stream of stories of people who have done so and been hit, and crushed, by trains, or of people who have fallen and then been struck. There are even a few stories of miraculous escapes. In 2015, 50 people were hit and killed by subway trains here. Not that many in a city of eight million, but enough so that for all their drab functionality the stations have an air of profound, nascent danger. The islands of safety are surrounded by a lethal void. Though maybe it doesn't seem that way to someone still young enough to be fearless. The woman I helped did get out alive. And you can guess why she'd been on the tracks. Still laughing, but maybe chastened by my look of horror she said: ""Thanks. Sorry. My phone fell down there. It would have taken them forever to get it back."" While I turned to clutch my daughter's hand and head upstairs, the young woman and her friend sauntered away. I wonder when she'll be scared?

Spies unlike us - how MI6 is seeking unlikely recruits,"This video can not be played The cinema advert is the first in the service's history Cinemagoers may think they already know what it takes to be a spy. Generations of James Bond fans have cheered 007 as he shoots and sleeps his way through a world of sinister villains and exotic women. The image is hi-tech, violent, romantic and more than a little cynical. It's a world-beating brand, but one today's spymasters are doing their best to keep at arm's length. And so, for the first time, MI6, officially known as the Secret Intelligence Service, is taking on the Bond image on 007's home turf - the silver screen. On Monday, MI6 launches its first ever cinema advert, aimed at attracting different types of candidate. A young woman of ethnically indeterminate background is shown demonstrating people skills and emotional intelligence in a range of everyday situations. This woman, we're told, does not work for MI6. ""But she could,"" the advert concludes. Steely-eyed, white male killers, it seems, need not apply. ""There is a perception out there that we want [Bond actor] Daniel Craig, or Daniel Craig on steroids,"" the SIS' current head of recruitment told theGuardian,external. ""He would not get into MI6,"" says the recruitment chief, identified only as Sarah. Recruiters have long worried about the pervasiveness of the image first portrayed in the pages of Ian Fleming's novels and then seared into public consciousness via the biggest movie franchise of all time. The aim of the advert is to wean the public off this grotesquely misleading stereotype. According to the accompanying press release, the advert aims ""to attract people who rule themselves out of a career in MI6 based on their misconceptions about the agency."" It sounds like a long shot, but those behind it seem optimistic. ""The whole point,"" Sarah says, ""is about getting people who would never, ever think of joining."" ""People tend to deselect themselves,"" adds Mark, head of HR. ""We want to prevent that. We want the service to be representative, but also to draw in the capabilities of the workforce at large."" It's part of a continuing drive to recruit from the widest, most diverse cross-section of society, with a particular focus on women and ethnic minorities, both still under represented in the service. Another aspect of new effort sees a return of the old ""tap on the shoulder"" method employed for decades, mostly in the cloisters of Oxford and Cambridge universities. But if the method will be the same, the locations will be different. ""Diverse organisations,"" is how Mark puts it, without elaborating. Some say that the agency's elite image may be punctured by the revelation that a 2:2 degree will make you eligible. Mark says work experience in other sectors is sometimes just as important as a good degree. Other recruiting tactics display a little playfully appropriate subterfuge to seek out those with interpersonal skills and the ability to influence people. Unbranded fliers invite you to click ongoodwithpeople.uk,externaland take a series of tests. Only those who succeed in the online games find out that they have what it takes for a life in the intelligence services. This correspondent scored well on the ""emotion detector"", but not so well on the ""human polygraph"". And when it came to the ""mind changer,"" I failed a text message exercise designed to persuade a friend to attend a surprise party. I have not been invited to join MI6. The advert will run for a month, in cinemas in London, the West Midlands and north west England, partly reflecting the sort of urban areas recruiters look to but also the fact that MI6 can't afford a nationwide release. And will it be shown in cinemas where Bond or similar spy capers are showing? Emphatically not.

PM May comes out fighting for United Kingdom,"This video can not be played Theresa May made a strong defence of why the United Kingdom should remain intact Theresa May came to Glasgow with a clear message for Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP - stop obsessing about independence and concentrate instead on governing Scotland. She accused the SNP of ""tunnel vision"" about the constitution. Saying ""the SNP play politics as if it is a game"" and accusing them of neglecting devolved public services like schools. It is not hard to see why the Prime Minster wants to stop the talk of another referendum on Scottish independence. The last thing she needs is to be fighting another referendum campaign whilst also trying to negotiate the UK's exit from the EU. Even though the assembled Conservatives at the conference here today insist they would easily win another referendum. PM Theresa May makes case for 'our precious Union' The Prime Minister knows she could easily prevent another referendum by simply refusing to allow it. The Scottish government has to ask the UK government to devolve the power to hold another vote before it can go ahead. That's how it worked in 2014 and how it would have to work again. Mrs May won't currently answer questions about whether she would block indyref2, as it will inevitably come to be known. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson applauds Theresa May alongside her party colleagues At the moment she says she will not answer hypothetical questions. But it's possible that fairly soon this may be a very real dilemma. She says there is no need for another vote, but she knows that if she refused to allow a referendum that could provoke a constitutional crisis that could generate support for independence amongst Scottish voters. Nicola Sturgeon says there is another way the PM could avoid indyref2. She could agree to the Scottish government's proposals that advocate Scotland remaining in the EU single market. But nothing that Theresa May said today suggests she will agree to to that. UK government ministers say that everyone is eager to secure the greatest possible access to the single market but that there will be no separate, bespoke deal for Scotland. So will there be another indyref? Very possibly. With all the talk of another vote being ""very likely"" and ""all but inevitable"", Nicola Sturgeon has already marched her troops so far up the hill it's hard to see how she can march them back down again without massive loss of face and political capital. Today we got an extensive preview of the unionist case. Mrs May talked at length about the benefits being part of the United Kingdom has bestowed on Scotland and the rest of the UK. And warned of the economic dangers of independence. It was a serious and substantial speech about why she believes the UK is ""Better Together"". If there is to be another referendum you can expect to hear these arguments repeated again and again. This may have been a dress rehearsal for the campaign to come.

"'We were nine round the table, now I am the only one'","Clarence Chessum survived only a few weeks on the front and left behind two children If you think of the Imperial War Museum as a place full of tanks, interactive displays and a Spitfire hanging above an exhibition hall - its beginnings were very different. As the museum marks its centenary, it is making public the very personal mementoes in its first collection. ""Dear sir, I have sent some of the incidents of my dear son's life. Have no relics. You may find a use for them. His loss can never be made up. Was almost always with us. ""We were nine round the table, now I am only one. ""Excuse me troubling you with all this but it's life as it is."" This video can not be played The Imperial War Museum is marking its centenary by showcasing some early exhibits The letter was from Sarah Chessum, a mother whose son had been killed in the trenches of the World War One in March 1917. She was responding to a call from a new type of museum being created as a memorial for a war still being fought. That museum, now the Imperial War Museum, is celebrating its centenary by making some of these earliest items public for the first time. The museum began by asking for personal keepsakes of soldiers who had died - such as last letters, photographs or personal items - with the request printed on ration books. It was as much a memorial shrine as a museum, with bereaved relatives such as Sarah Chessum hand-delivering or posting these poignant items. Charlotte Czyzyk, a World War One historian at the museum, says even a century later these letters are ""heartbreaking"". Sarah's son, Clarence, had left for France in January 1917, and barely eight weeks later he was dead. He was aged 37, a bookbinder from north London, a slight figure of 5ft 3in, who had left two children. Joy Hunter met Stalin at the Potsdam Conference in 1945 and gathered pieces of Hitler's desk Another letter came from Gilbert Salisbury, a Canadian soldier who survived the War, but whose wife had died in 1918 from Spanish flu. ""The end of the War means for the world at large peace and happiness, where it means for me desolation and sorrow,"" he wrote, in his contribution to the museum. Thousands of families sent in pictures and letters - stored at the museum's first location, in Crystal Palace, in south London. Weapons and equipment were also collected - with the very first acquisition a lifebuoy from the Lusitania, a liner sunk by a German submarine in 1915. The idea of creating a museum in 1917 reflected the need to respond to the unprecedented scale of the conflict. ""There was still no end in sight for the War,"" says Ms Czyzyk. While the War was still being fought, items were gathered from the front The previous year had seen the monumental battles of the Somme on land and Jutland at sea. There was conscription, and more women were going into work. The War was touching every part of society. ""This was a type of war that had never been seen before,"" says Ms Czyzyk. The war museum would be a form of memorial, and its building blocks would be the stories and pictures of ordinary families caught up in these extraordinary events. ""They're saying, 'This was my boy, I'd like you to have this photograph to help remember him.' That would have been a really big thing for that family,"" says Ms Czyzyk. A lifebuoy from the Lusitania was an early acquisition Millions visited the museum in Crystal Palace and then in South Kensington. And then in 1936, the museum moved to its current home in Lambeth - in a building previously occupied by the Bethlem Hospital for the mentally ill. At the outbreak of the World War Two, the museum's collection had its own call-up, with some ""historic' weapons on display pressed back into action. The modern Imperial War Museum group includes one of the wartime nerve centres - the Cabinet War Rooms, where Winston Churchill worked underground while London faced Nazi air raids. The museum's collection of war objects was headed by a lifebuoy from the Lusitania Joy Hunter worked as a secretary in this underground communications centre - and as well as the fog of war, she had to contend with the fog of Churchill's cigars. Now aged 91, she remembers the strange subterranean world, where an evening could end with the staff watching a film with Churchill, in his pyjamas and drinking whisky, in a makeshift cinema. ""We found him very affable to civilians - other people will tell you different stories - but he was always very pleasant to us and would say stop and say good morning or whatever,"" she says. ""I've a feeling that it was a relief for him to have civilians, perhaps it made him feel more normal."" Millions of visitors came to see the war relics put on show in Crystal Palace She remembers how difficult it was to keep the prime minister underground during air raids, when he wanted to go up on to the rooftops to watch. Mrs Hunter says it is hard for people now to understand how they worked - ""in total war and total secrecy and total silence"". Mrs Hunter typed the battle orders for D-Day and on the defeat of the Nazis, she flew to the Potsdam conference where Churchill met Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and US president Harry Truman. She got to meet the Soviet leader in person. ""I kept very quiet about shaking Stalin's hand because I thought people might think it wasn't quite the thing to have done,"" she says. The museum collected war equipment - some of which was put back into action in World War Two ""I can say it now without blushing too much."" But the appalling conditions in Berlin left her ""stunned"". The city was filled with the ""stench of death"", she says, with the population looking like ""zombies"" and begging for food. She had seen the damage from air raids on London, but Berlin was much worse. She went to the victory parade in the city, but took no pleasure from it. ""I felt very awkward. I didn't feel very victorious at all. I just thought this is horrendous,"" she says. Joy Hunter was at the Potsdam conference, where Churchill met Stalin and Truman Mrs Hunter brought home part of the shattered city - in pieces of marble from Hitler's desk, which she had found in the ruins of the Nazi leader's chancellery. Her own memories are now the stuff of museum displays - but she says anyone looking back should not glorify war. ""Of course, we should remember, but you can't live in the past,"" she says. ""We should remember and take it with us and make sure that it doesn't happen again. But who knows?""

What we know about Nadiya's new TV cooking show,"Nadiya won the 2015 series of The Great British Bake Off Ever since the BBC lost The Great British Bake Off to Channel 4 last year, many have been watching the BBC's moves closely. Clearly, the corporation couldn't commission a similar show to Bake Off, as it no longer owns the format. But it also has millions of viewers who are now hungry for more cookery programmes. So, in October, BBC Two announced it would air new food-based series The Big Family Cooking Showdown - and it's now been confirmed it will star former Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain. She will co-host it with Zoe Ball, while chefs Rosemary Shrager and Giorgio Locatelli will serve as judges. Sixteen families will invite the four stars of the show into their own kitchens to cook their favourite family recipes and will be whittled down through a series of challenges across 12 hour-long episodes. The Big Family Cooking Showdown will air in the autumn This isn't the first BBC programme Nadiya will have appeared in since Bake Off - she's already fronted a two-part documentary and will alsostar in an eight-part seriesabout British food. After she was announced as the co-presenter of The Big Family Cooking Showdown, some have suggested the programme sounded similar to The Great British Bake Off. But Buzzfeed's TV editor Scott Bryan said he thought that wasn't the case. He pointed to the fact it will be broadcast on the more niche BBC Two, and not the flagship BBC One channel which The Great British Bake Off aired on. Having said that, Bake Off originally started on BBC Two in 2010 with small viewing figures, and moved to its bigger sister-channel after it had become a ratings hit. So if the new cookery programme is popular, it's possible it could make a similar leap a few years down the line. Another reason it's being seen by some as a rival to Channel 4's Bake Off is because the two programmes could be broadcast around the same time of year. The 2016 Christmas specials of Bake Off were the last episodes of the show the BBC aired The BBC confirmed the first series of The Big Family Cooking Showdown will go out in the autumn - which might also be when the new Bake Off will air. Channel 4 have not yet confirmed an exact start date but it willdefinitely be some time in 2017, and it's likely that the they would want the series to be completed before the year is out. The fact that Nadiya is so closely associated with the GBBO brand is perhaps another reason the new show being likened to Bake Off. The comparisons may be inevitable, but one thing we can be sure of is that the BBC will ensure the new programme has a completely different format to its former ratings hit. Nadiya Hussain was 2015 Bake Off champion By David Sillito, BBC media correspondent ""Big"" has replaced ""Great"", ""Bake Off"" has become ""Cooking Showdown"" and it's got a four-person presenting and judging team. The comparisons are easy to make. However, the idea was germinating before Bake Off made off to Channel 4. But what began as an attempt to tap in to GBBO's homely magic of nice people trying their best now looks like a rival, albeit one without a tent or Mary Berry. Pitching this as a copycat rival to the Great British Bake Off makes a great headline but doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. Of course, that doesn't mean something else more like Bake Off might appear on the airwaves. TV companies spend millions on formats but legal protection for the ideas is far from clear legally, with disputes rarely making it to court. The one thing that would probably stop it though is the fear that after creating a ""copycat"" it fails to draw in the viewers. That's a headline the TV bosses would really like to avoid.

Are food bloggers fuelling racist stereotypes?,"""Food media is predominantly generated by white people for white people, so when the subject veers toward anything outside of the Western canon, it's not uncommon to see things generalised, exotified, or misrepresented. "" Filipino-AmericanCeleste Noche,external, who is a food and travel photographer, shared her thoughts on the ""exotified"" depiction of certain recipes within the blogging and gourmet community on the podcastThe Racist Sandwich,external. ""I think microaggressions in social media are reflective of food media as a whole in that appropriation,"" Noche tells BBC Trending, ""These microaggressions can be as simple as a lack of research."" Whether it's taking photos of dishes with chopsticks sticking straight up into rice or noodles (which can be seen as offensive in some Asian cultures)"", she says, ""or dramatisation in the props used to style ethnic foods (why are Asian dishes so often styled on bamboo mats or banana leaves with chopsticks?)"". ""Chopsticks sticking straight up into rice or noodles can be seen as offensive in some Asian cultures,"" says Noche Noche added that established food blogs like that of Andrew Zimmern also fed into stereotypes. ""(His)recipe for Filipino short ribs,externalis styled with chopsticks even though Filipinos traditionally eat with spoons and forks or their hands"". Zimmern has not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. Similarly the food site Bon Appetit received some criticism for publishing a video last year about noodles claiming ""Pho is the new Ramen."" Several commenters attacked the video for the ""simplification of Asian culture"" as ""pho is from Vietnam and ramen from Japan"". The video was fronted by a white American chef who spoke on the 'correct way to eat pho"". Messages under Bon Appetit's video ""Pho is the new Ramen"" After a little more than 24 hours on the website Bon Appetit removed the video altogether, both from their Facebook and YouTube channels, and apologised for any offence they may have caused. Noche's assertion comes at a time ofmuch discussion,externalabout the so-called ""cultural misrepresentations"" of food. Pembroke College of Cambridge university said they were taking complaints from ethnic minority students about their menu ""seriously"". ""Dear Pembroke catering staff, stop mixing mango and beef and calling it 'Jamaican stew',""a student,externalposted on the college's Facebook page. ""I'm actually half Jamaican, pls show me where in the Caribbean they mix fruit and meat."" Another complained about a ""Tunisian rice"" recipe which, well, doesn't exist in Tunisia. The college said they would be ""going through the dishes on the menu to see if any are ones that are not very well named"". Pembroke College Cambridge has said they will review their menu following criticism However, not everyone agreed. Evening Standard,externaljournalist Sam Leith wrote ""And if, in an age when basic civilisational freedoms are under threat, the next generation of highly educated students is devoting its attention to complaining about whether their lunch is authentic enough, God help us all."" Some Facebook commenters,externalagreed with him, saying that the famous college had ""been blind sided by politically correct Nazis"". Celeste Noche says ""food media is predominantly generated by white people for white people"" and ""misrepresents"" ethnic communities Noche however, feels that the issue speaks to a wider discussion on the portrayal of minorities. ""We need to break away from the idea that white and western is the base standard for media portrayals - whether in food, film, literature, etc - and start trusting and hiring people of colour to represent themselves.""

Why tomato is the world's favoured fruit,"Tomato - top fruit (?) If you were asked to name the world's favourite fruit, the tomato may not be the one that comes to mind. But yes - it is a fruit, and yes - more tomatoes are produced globally than any other fruit. Here, Dr Michael Mosley explains the science behind its popularity. Some people claim that the mango is the most popular fruit in the world, on the grounds that they are eaten in more countries than any other fruit. From Asia to the Americas, people avidly consume them, not just as a sweet dessert, but in chutneys, ice cream and even cereal. They are certainly enormously popular in countries like India and China,with over 43m tonnes of mangoes being grown every year,external. But if you measure popularity in terms of worldwide production, they are way behind the apple, and even further behind the banana. There are over 100m tonnes of bananas produced every year, with India being the top producer. For a longer life 'eat 10-a-day' The chilling truth about ketchup The secret of why we like chocolate In the UK we eat more than five billion every year, most of which are a type called the Cavendish banana. This was first cultivated and grown in Britain at Chatsworth house, an English stately home in the Peak District, by head gardener Joseph Paxton. He named themMusa cavendishii, after his employers, the Cavendishes. Cavendish bananas arestill grown in hothouses on the estate and eaten by the owners and their guests. But dwarfing all other fruits is something we may not immediately think of as a fruit: the tomato. Cooked or raw, as a sauce, a juice or a paste, the tomato is incredibly popular. With at least 170m tonnes of tomatoes being produced every year, the tomato tops even the mighty banana. Most people think of the tomato as a vegetable, but technically it is a fruit because it has seeds, which puts it in the same botanical class as a berry. Tomatoes were first introduced to Europe by the Spanish, who brought them back from the Americas. The Aztecs, who cultivated and grew them, called themtomatl. This gave rise to the Spanish word ""tomate"", from which we get the English word tomato. There are more than 20,000 different varieties La Tomatina takes place every year in the small Spanish town of BuÃ±ol. During the festival at least 40,000 people pelt each other with tomatoes According toGuinness World Records,external, the largest tomato ever grown weighed in at 3.96kg on 30 August 2016. La Tomatina is called the ""biggest food fight in the world"" There was, initially, considerable resistance to eating tomatoes in Britain. One of the first people to grow them was a 16th Century barber-surgeon called John Gerard. His book,Gerard's Herbal, describes them as beautiful but poisonous. These days, of course, tomatoes are seen as a healthy food choice. They are low in calories and rich in vitamin C, potassium, folate and vitamin K. They also contain lots of a powerful antioxidant called lycopene, which has been linked to a number of health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease and some cancers. There is even some evidence that consuming tomato paste (which is particularly rich in lycopenes) can protect your skin against sunburn. But it's not the lycopene content that tickles our taste buds. It's the fact that they have a strong umami flavour. Umami is a Japanese word that translates as ""pleasant savoury taste"". It is one of only five tastes that our tongues can detect. The others are bitter, sour, sweet and salty. Umami is hard to describe, but you know it when you experience it. It is an earthy flavour that you are more likely to associate with meat than a fruit. If you add umami flavouring to something like soup, it makes the soup taste thicker, more substantial. Lots of foods have a umami component, including, surprisingly, human breast milk. But the fruit that is richest in umami is the tomato. For my new BBC2 series,The Secrets of Your Food, I decided to extract the pure umami flavour from tomatoes by chopping some up, then spinning them in a centrifuge. I then filtered out the obvious lumps and simmered what remained to concentrate the taste. I was left with a clear fluid that no longer smelt ""tomatoey"" at all. Instead it tasted salty, earthy, meaty. What my tongue sensed when I sipped that fluid was a substance called glutamate. Glutamate is an amino acid, one of the building blocks of protein. And protein is essential to the building and running of every cell in our bodies. Whenever you eat a food that contains glutamate, the glutamate molecules in the food trigger special receptors on your tongue. This then sends a signal to your brain which registers that taste as being ""umami"". So, when you bite into a tomato or savour the taste of tomato paste on your pizza, what your taste buds are really doing is telling you is to eat this food because it is rich in glutamate, which will help keep you healthy and strong. And that, I think, helps explain the tomato's universal popularity. The Secrets of Your Food continues on BBC2 at 2100GMT on Friday 3rd March . Join the conversation on ourFacebook page,external.

The gay Syrian refugee forming a new life in the UK,"Samar fled Syria fearing for his life, when his father discovered he was gay. Now, he is living in the UK, where he can finally be open about his sexuality. Samar - not his real name - has two Facebook profiles. On one, he is a proud gay man starting his life again in the UK after fleeing Syria following death threats. He posts selfies wearing a rainbow scarf and attending gay pride marches. On the other he keeps in touch with his worried mother, who asks when he will marry a nice Arabic girl. As a teenager in the city of Aleppo, Samar knew he was living on borrowed time. ""I was always nervous, always anxious,"" the dark-haired and softly spoken 21-year-old tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I knew I felt good talking to boys. I found things on the internet about 'gay' and I thought: 'Yes, this is me'. And then: 'Oh, I live in a very dangerous country'."" Syria is one of 80 countries around the world where homosexuality is a criminal offence. It is officially punishable by up to three years in prison, but Samar grew up listening to his father and their friends talking about killing gay men and knew that the law would not protect him. Samar aged one, with his two brothers But it was not until one of his brothers reported him to their father when he was 17, after overhearing him talking to a gay friend, that the danger became real. It was 2013 and Samar now faced a life-changing decision - stay in a country at civil war, where he risked being killed for being gay, or flee his home and begin a journey into the unknown. ""I packed a bag, I told no-one and I left,"" he says. ""My heart was breaking."" Samar travelled from Turkey to Greece on an inflatable dinghy Samar spent the next two years trying to start a new life in Turkey, before deciding to make the journey to Western Europe. He saved up for a ticket to board an inflatable dinghy to Greece in late 2015. As he travelled onwards, he crossed seven borders over two months - sleeping in the street and surviving on water, bread and dates. He was arrested by police trying to cross into Hungary, before being released. At Calais in France, he stowed away inside a fridge on a truck and hoped that the air would not run out before they reached the UK. Samar slept rough during his journey across Europe The UK received more than 44,000 asylum applications, including for dependent relatives, in the year ending June 2016, with around 30% granted permission to stay for up to five years. There are no official statistics on applications on the grounds of sexual orientation, because the data is not collected. In 2015, a cross-party inquiry raised serious concerns about abuses of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)  asylum seekers by staff in nine detention centres across England and Scotland, amid reports of self-harm and suicide. An October 2016 report by equality charity Stonewall and the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group (UKLGIG) highlighted a ""culture of disbelief"", where some asylum seekers had been asked to ""prove"" their sexuality by going to embarrassing lengths, including being asked for videos showing them having sex. New Home Office guidance banned this practice in August 2016. Paul Twocock, from Stonewall, says the treatment was ""unacceptable"" and has called for more staff training and an end to detention.

Samar survived the ordeal. With a five-year right to remain visa, he now lives with a family in Cambridge after they volunteered their spare room via a charity that rehouses refugees. The couple, a lawyer and retired academic, pay for his English classes. In the evenings they cook together, help him with his homework and even threw him a surprise birthday party when he turned 21. His host mother anxiously texts him if he is running late. ""No-one has worried about me for so long,"" Samar says, ""it's a really nice feeling. It's a lovely family, I really love them."" Living in a liberal city in a country where homosexuality has been legal for 50 years this July, and where same-sex marriage was introduced in 2013, he is taking advantage of being openly gay for the first time. ""I went in a gay nightclub,"" he says. ""It was amazing. It was my first time to see gay and lesbian people together dancing, kissing. The music was pretty terrible, but I loved the smoke machine."" He has been on a few dates, mostly arranged online. But while the majority of people are kind, his refugee status sometimes overshadows romance. ""They ask me a lot of questions,"" he says. ""They want to know what happened to me in Syria, how I got here. It brings up bad memories. ""I want to make friends, because this life without friends, it's nothing. But love is different. For me love is necessary. I hope to find someone, if I am lucky."" Samar is under no illusions over what his life could have been like had he stayed in Syria. He was sent a photo a few months ago showing what had happened to a school friend who criticised so-called Islamic State. The body had been tied to a lamp post and left out for dogs to eat. ""Even if the war ends I cannot go back,"" Samar explains. ""My father will never accept a gay son. ""My mum worries about me. She sends me messages and asks: 'When will marry to a nice girl?' One day I hope I can tell her why I had to leave."" Watchthe Victoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

Will Jeff Sessions survive?,"Sessions was one of Trump's closest advisers during the campaign The era of good feelings following Donald Trump's well-received speech to Congress Tuesday night lasted, oh, about 23 hours. Now Russia, and the Trump campaign's connections to it, are back in the headlines. At this point there are a few things that are known with certainty. Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak twice last year at a time when the then-senator was actively supporting and advising Donald Trump's presidential campaign. After Mr Sessions was nominated to be Mr Trump's attorney general - the top US government law official - he was asked, during Senate testimony and in writing, whether he had met with anyone connected to the Russian government with regard to the 2016 elections. ""I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I did not have communications with the Russians,"" he said during his confirmation hearings. Now Mr Sessions has announced that he will recuse himself from all existing and future department investigations involving the Trump presidential campaign. Behind these facts are a host of questions, and the answers are somewhat uncertain. Here are some of the most pressing. Mr Kislyak, who has served as Russia's US ambassador since 2008, made headlines earlier this year for his contacts with another prominent member of Mr Trump's inner circle, Michael Flynn. The former general, who the president named as his national security adviser, came under federal investigation for his contacts with Russian officials after the presidential campaign. While Mr Flynn acknowledged that he spoke to Mr Kislyak in late December, he originally asserted that he did not discuss sanctions the US government had imposed on Russia in response to concerns about possible Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Leaked reports from the intelligence community revealed that this was not the case, and the president subsequently asked for Mr Flynn's resignation. When asked about Mr Sessions' contacts with Mr Kislyak, a Justice Department spokesperson told the Washington Post that the senator had ""more than 25 conversations"" with ambassadors in his capacity as a high-ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Post followed up by contacting the other 26 members of that committee, and the 20 who responded said they had not spoken with the Russian ambassador. ""I've been on the Armed Services Committee for 10 years,""tweeted,externalDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill. ""No call or meeting with Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of the Foreign Relations Committee."" Acloser look,externalat Mrs McCaskill's Twitter feed revealed several instances - in 2013 and 2015 - where she wrote about meeting the Russian ambassador, however. She says those meetings were not in her capacity as a committee member and were never one-on-one. Former Republican congressman Mike Rogers, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said such meetings for a senator on the committee would be ""routine."" Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia expressed a similar view. ""I've met with the Russian ambassador with a group, in my capacity, with a group of other senators,""he said,externalduring a television interview Thursday morning. ""That's in my official capacity. That's nothing. That's my job."" This, then, is the million-dollar question - and what Democrats in Congress and Trump opponents everywhere seem to be focusing on. ""If there was nothing wrong, why not come clean and tell the entire truth?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked during a press conference on Thursday morning. Democrats are demanding Sessions resign Since the Washington Post story came out, the attorney general and his representatives have offered an array of responses to this, ranging from forgetfulness to not thinking it was important/relevant. ""I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,"" Sessions told a news conference on Thursday afternoon. Democrats weren't buying it. ""When Senator Sessions testified under oath that 'I did not have communications with the Russians,' his statement was demonstrably false, yet he let it stand for weeks,"" said Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland. ""And he continued to let it stand even as he watched the president tell the entire nation he didn't know anything about anyone advising his campaign talking to the Russians."" During the Flynn controversy, Mr Trump defended his embattled national security adviser by saying that contacts with foreign leaders, including Russians, weren't just permissible but advisable. That defence fell apart because clear evidence came out that Mr Flynn had been evasive not only to the press and public but to the administration itself. Mr Sessions has since said that he did indeed meet with the ambassador twice and probably should have mentioned it during his confirmation hearings, but he was responding to questions about ongoing contact with Russian operatives. Critics are saying he is parsing words. Like Flynn, the original evasion has become a bigger story than the original contacts. Who is Attorney General Jeff Sessions? Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake A 'Trump slump' for tourism? There at present is an ongoing inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, along with other intelligence agencies, into possible Russian meddling with the 2016 presidential elections, including any connections to members of the Trump campaign team. In late January FBI officials interviewed Mr Flynn, for instance, on his contacts with Mr Kislyak. In addition, two congressional panels - the House and Senate intelligence committees - are already planning on looking into the matter, although no concrete steps have yet to be taken. They may subpoena Trump officials, including Mr Flynn, to testify on the extent of their interaction with the Russian government. Some Democrats have called for the creation of a special ""select"" committee to focus solely on the investigation, rather than relying on existing committees that have other obligations. So far, these calls have not gained traction. Others, including Mr Schumer, have demanded a special independent counsel to be named to lead the inquiry - similar to the duties performed by Kenneth Starr during the Bill Clinton administration. The danger for the White House is that these types of investigations are difficult to control and can expand greatly in scope as they progress. The Starr investigation, for instance, started as an inquiry into an old Clinton real-estate deal and eventually ended in a recommendation that the president be impeached for lying about sexual relations with a White House intern. After bipartisan calls for Mr Sessions to recuse himself from oversight, as attorney general, of the FBI's Russia investigation reached a fevered pitch, the attorney general relented. He notably said, however, that the decision was made in consultation with career Justice Department officials and was due to his involvement with the Trump campaign and not because of the recent revelations. This video can not be played Jeff Sessions: The ""remarks are unbelievable to me and are false"" Democrats have upped the ante, however, calling for Mr Sessions' outright resignation. ""Jeff Sessions simply does not have the confidence of the American people,""tweeted,externalCongresswoman Yvette Clarke of New York. ""He should resign now."" Given the attorney general's close relationship with the president, a resignation seems unlikely. Then again, the same could be said for Mr Flynn, and he was ultimately shown the door. What should be of particular concern to Republicans is that the Sessions revelations fit a growing pattern of obfuscation and evasion on the part of the president's inner circle when it comes to contact with the Russian government. It's the kind of thing that will prompt more questions, more investigations and more speculation about what else is out there.
