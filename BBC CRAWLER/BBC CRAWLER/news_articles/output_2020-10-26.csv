Toughest restrictions considered for Lanarkshire,"The Scottish government is considering placing North and South Lanarkshire under the highest level of Covid restrictions. A leaked letter to council umbrella body Cosla says the ""level of concern"" in those areas means the use of level four measures cannot be ruled out. The government says no decisions have yet been made and that the situation in Lanarkshire may be ""stabilising"". A newfive-level system of restrictions,externalwill come into effect next Monday. The framework is due to be debated by MSPs on Tuesday, with an announcement on the level for each council area expected later this week. How will Scotland's five-level system work? Scotland to introduce five-level alert system Covid in Scotland: Increase in cases 'slowing' The system will allow different restrictions to be imposed in local areas, depending on the rate of the infection. The leaked letter to Cosla says decisions have yet to be made, but that level four restrictions are currently being considered for North and South Lanarkshire. The letter says this is due to the ""level of concern"" indicated by the data - although there are ""some signs"" that the situation may be stabilising. It says decisions will not be made until ""the latest possible point"". However, it adds that the use of level four ""cannot be ruled out"" to avoid ""still greater harm, including many deaths"". The national clinical director, Professor Jason Leitch, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with John Beattiethere was ""hope there are some green shoots"" as the number of cases in Lanarkshire appeared to be decelerating. But he added: ""Lanarkshire is probably the area that still worries us most."" The leaked letter says no other changes are being considered for the remaining central belt areas which are currently under tougher restrictions than the rest of Scotland. They are expected to be put into level three, although there are some signs of ""progress"" in Edinburgh and East Lothian. However, concerns over therising numbers of cases in Dundeemean that consideration is being given to moving it to level three. Like the other parts of the country, it is currently under restrictions which would place it in level two of the new system. The letter says consideration is being given to moving five areas down to level one because of ""encouraging signs in the data"". They are Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles. If this happened, there would be ""additional safeguards"" on socialising within homes and on travel to and from areas with higher rates of infection. Commenting on the leaked letter, a Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""No decisions have been taken on what level local authorities will be in and any speculation is premature. ""Parliament will consider the framework tomorrow and decisions will only be taken once parliament has had that opportunity and on the basis of the most up to date information on prevalence of the virus."" Level four is the closest to a full lockdown, similar to the one introduced in March. It will only be used if ""absolutely necessary"", at a time when cases were very high and there was a risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. Last week,NHS Lanarkshire said it was treating more patients for Covid in its hospitals than at the height of the first wave of the pandemic,external. Socialising would not be allowed in people's homes, but six people from two households could still meet outdoors and there would be no limit on outdoor exercise. Other steps would include a ban on non-essential travel, guidance to stay at home, and the closure of all hospitality premises, hairdressers, barbers, beauticians, leisure centres and gyms. However, schools would remain open. Reporting bylocal democracy reporterJoseph Anderson RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

Stock markets slide as Covid-19 cases rise,"US stock markets suffered their sharpest drop in weeks as concerns about the economic impact of surging coronavirus cases sent shares tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.3%, after dropping more than 3% earlier in the day. The S&P 500 fell 1.8% and the Nasdaq 1.6%. Stocks in Europe, where a rise in virus cases has prompted new restrictions, also declined. Shares in travel and energy firms took some of the heaviest losses. In the United States, cruise lines Royal Caribbean Group, Carnival and Norwegian all dropped more than 8%, while in the UK,British Airways owner IAG closed 7.6% lower. Travel firms have been some of the most sensitive to warnings about the virus, which experts worry will intensify as winter approaches. On Monday, Michael Ryan, an emergencies expert for the World Health Organization, said that Europe would need ""much more comprehensive"" measures to get the virus under control. ""Right now we're well behind this virus in Europe, so getting ahead of it is going to take some serious acceleration in what we do,"" he said. On Monday, France's CAC 40 ended 1.9% lower, while Germany's Dax index dropped 3.7%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 fell nearly 1.2%. US President Donald Trump has vowed to avoid widespread restrictions on activity, similar to the lockdown restrictions seen this spring, saying such limits are not worth the economic cost. But such decisions are typically handled by local leaders in America, some of whom, such as the mayors of El Paso, Texas and Newark, New Jersey, tightened rules on Monday. Over the last week, the number of new virus cases reported daily in the US has repeatedly passed 80,000, sending the seven day average to a new high of nearly 69,000 - roughly double what it was in September. The number of hospitalisations has jumped 40% in the past month and death rates are also rising, though more slowly. On a per capita basis, the number of new cases in the US over the past seven days remains lower than some other countries, including the UK, Spain and France, which have announced new restrictions recently. But analysts say the economy is unlikely to mend until concerns about Covid-19 are resolved. Amid those strains, investors are also worried about the impasse in Washington over the need to fund additional coronavirus economic relief. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been trying to broker a deal for the White House, said the two sides remained far apart. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, who leads Democrats in the House of Representatives made similar comments. Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

President Trumpsays it's his constitutional right to fill the vacancy on the court during the remainder of his first term in office, and has put forward conservative judge, Amy Coney Barrett. One issue that the Supreme Court could soon rule on is the legal right to abortion in the US - something the president and Judge Barrett have opposed in the past.

The California senator follows President Trump, who voted in Florida over the weekend, and Vice-President Mike Pence, who cast his ballot in Indiana last week on Friday. Some 60m Americans have already cast ballots, shattering previous records for early voting. Trump is campaigning in Pennsylvania US President Donald Trump has heaped praise on his Supreme Court nominee at an afternoon campaign rally in Pennsylvania. âJust a few hours from now the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Courtâ, he said to a big cheer from his supporters. âThat was a good choice wasnât it?â he added. He described Judge Barrett as âfantasticâ and one of the nationâs âmost brilliant legal mindsâ. Democrats have opposed the appointment. Early numbers show youth turnout far outpacing that of past presidential contests. In Florida, a key battleground state, 257,720 voters aged 18-29 had already cast their ballots as of 21 October. This is a more than fivefold increase from 2016. Young early voters we spoke to said a sense of urgency was driving them. ""The country's democracy is at stake,â one told us. Read more about young voters and the issues that matter to them here Biden makes a surprise campaign stop in Chester, PA The Democratic presidential candidate made a surprise campaign stop in Chester, a town in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he spoke to the press about Trump, coronavirus and the imminent confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Speaking outside a campaign field office, Biden denounced Trump's response to the Covid-19 pandemic - the centre of his closing pitch to voters - seizing on comments from the White House chief of staff earlier that the administration was ""not going to control the pandemic"". He also accused the White House of holding ""super-spreader events"", referring to a Rose Garden reception earlier this month, where a dozen Republicans celebrating Trump's nomination of Barrett, a conservative judge, are believed to have caught the virus. Another reception is due to held tonight after Barrett is expected to be confirmed. ""I just hope he is willing to have learned a lesson,"" Biden said, adding that the event should have tests, masks, social distancing and crowd limits.  As we mentioned earlier, more than 60 million people in the US are said to have already cast their ballots for the 3 November election. States across the country have begun opening up sites for early in-person voting, with images showing Americans waiting in long queues for the chance to vote. Measures are also in place to keep voting safe amid the coronavirus pandemic, with voters wearing face masks and casting their ballots in socially distanced booths. With Conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett expected to be confirmed to the US Supreme Court in the coming hours, here are the key facts:  Find out more about Judge Amy Coney Barrett in her own wordshere.  The grave was covered with ""I Voted"" stickers in 2016 A plastic cover has been placed over the gravestone of womenâs suffrage leader Susan B Anthony to protect it from âI votedâ stickers. In 2016, the tombstone in Rochester, New York, was covered in stickers from voters paying their respects to the womenâs rights activist. It was the first election in which Americans were able to vote for a female major-party presidential candidate, in Hillary Clinton. But Patricia Corcoran, president of the non-profit Friends of Mount Hope Cemetery, told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle newspaper thata restoration project in the spring had revealed damage to the marble caused by the stickers and the efforts to remove them.,external Corcoran said plastic covers would be placed over the graves of Susan B Anthony and her sister, fellow suffragist Mary S Anthony, so that the sticker ritual could continue without risking damage. âAbove all we wanted to protect this iconic gravesite,â she explained. The plastic sleeves were in place in time for Saturday - the first day of in-person early voting, and quickly attracted stickers, the newspaper reported. Today we're focusing on LGBT voters of all political views. Darius Caldwell is an Air Force veteran voting for Joe Biden. He grew up in a Southern Baptist household and is a self-described ""recovering Republican"". Why does this election matter to you? I've never taken my right to vote for granted. As a recovering Republican, due largely to the rise of Trumpism, I can understand the importance of this election and the value that all of us must place on the preservation of our democratic institutions. Does being LGBT influence your vote? Up until now, being a gay man never factored into my voting preferences. Even as a Republican, I wittingly neglected my social views in favor of the notion of limited government and fiscal conservatism and I saw the party as an ideal vessel to secure them both over time. However, since Trump's rise to the American presidency, Republicans have sought to subvert and denigrate the customs and courtesies of governance by acting as scapegoats and appeasers of Trump. These votersare members of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from them throughout the week. Join the conversation: President Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Mr Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25 (Â£5.50). President Trumphas reiterated his promise to bring down US troop levels overseas, while continuing to invest in the military. The president says he will continue to challenge international alliances and maintain trade tariffs on China. Mr Bidenhas promised to repair relationships with US allies. He says he would do away with unilateral tariffs on China, and instead hold them accountable with an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". Today we're focusing on LGBT voters of all political views. Mike Harlow is a writer, artist, and a former liberal who left the Democratic Party a few years ago. He was once an enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama, but now wholeheartedly supports Donald Trump, who he says has kept his promises and totally transformed the Republican Party. What inspired you to vote in this election? Iâve always been an extremely engaged voter. As a New Yorker, it feels like we donât get a choice in elections. Far-left Democrats have run our city into the ground, and the local Republican Party does absolutely nothing to offer an alternative or seriously compete in elections. Iâm hoping if Trump performs well in NYC, it might be a wake up call to local Republicans that itâs time to get to work and do something! Literally, anything! Does being LGBT influence your vote? Yes and no. The only way being gay impacts my vote is one of rebellion. We have largely attained equal rights, and we are now free to vote on bigger issues of war, peace, country, and economics. The LGBT community is NOT a wing of the Democrats. The idea that all LGBT people (as well as all minorities) must conform and think alike is the definition of bigotry. These votersare members of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from them throughout the week. Join the conversation: The head of the World Health Organization has cautioned countries against ""giving up"" in the fight against the spread of coronavirus. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he understood the mental and physical toll the pandemic was taking on people across the world, but added: ""We cannot give up, we must not give up."" ""Leaders must balance the disruption to lives and livelihoods with the need to protect health workers and health systems as intensive care fills up,"" he said. Ghebreyesus' comments came aftera senior aide to US President Donald Trump admitted that the US was ""not going to control the pandemic"". Instead White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Covid-19 could only be defeated by ""mitigation areas"" like vaccines and therapeutics. About 225,000 Americans have died since the pandemic began, the highest figure of any country. The US recorded 83,718 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University  - just short of the record 83,757 reported on Friday. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Some say America is now a house divided. In many American families, their houses are indeed divided by political differences, putting strains on their relationships. But a Chinese American family in Maryland made it work. Thirty-one-year-old Cathy Shao has decided to vote for Biden in the US presidential election, while her husband Chenren Shao, 35, will be voting for Trump a second time. The couple
has been married for eight years, raising their three daughters together. âI know
she's Democrat, and she knows that I'm a Republican,â Mr Shao says the
political difference has never been a problem for their marriage. âI think
being humble is the key of not being offended,â he says, âWe're not trying to
persuade each other.â When Mr
Shao speaks, Mrs Shao looks at him lovingly. Other than agreeing to disagree,
Mrs Shao believes their common goal bonds the family together. âWe want to
provide a better environment for our children.â Though
Americans have become less willing to date their political opponents in the Trump
era, politically mixed marriages are not uncommon. A high-profile example is
Kellyanne Conway, a former counselor to President Trump, and George Conway, who
is a harsh critic of the President. What does
managing a politically divided but happy marriage tell us about how to govern a
politically divided country? As American
politics has become more polarised, Mrs Shao says she always appreciates a
different perspective from her spouse. âAll
Republicans should get married with Democrats, then we naturally have different
views,â she says with a laugh. Mrs Shao
hopes the two major political parties will recognise that their common goal is
âto make the country better, rather than attacking each otherâ. More from thoseexcerpts of Barack Obamaâs new memoir,externalon his time in the White House. The former president says he grew increasingly frustrated in 2010 with elements within the Tea Party protests who promoted conspiracy theories, including the racist claim that Obama was a Muslim not born in the US. ""One thing felt certain,"" he writes. ""A pretty big chunk of the American people, including some of the very folks I was trying to help, didnât trust a word I said. ""I wanted to believe that the ability to connect was still there,"" he says of his hope that he could convince opponents to support his healthcare reform bill. ""My wife wasnât so sure. One night, Michelle caught a glimpse of a Tea Party rally on TVâwith its enraged flag-waving and inflammatory slogans. She seized the remote and turned off the set, her expression hovering somewhere between rage and resignation. 'Itâs a trip, isnât it?' she said. 'What is?' 'That theyâre scared of you. Scared of us.' She shook her head and headed for bed."" This video can not be played US election 2020: President Trump casts his vote More than 60 million Americans have already cast their vote in the election, according to data compiled by the United States Elections Project. This includes more than 40 million mail ballots and 20 million in-person votes, it says. Around one-third of the votes cast came from the three most populous states - California, Texas and Florida, the data shows. With eight days to go until the election, the total number of early votes cast already exceeds that of 2016, according to US media reports. US President Donald Trump cast his vote early and in person in the swing state of Florida on Saturday. The president's daughter Ivanka - and her husband Jared Kusher - were pictured on Monday with what appeared to be ballot forms. Allow Twitter content?

Shrai PopatBBC News, Washington In a recent poll for the media monitoring organisation GLAAD, 76% of LGBTQ voters said they support Joe Biden in the 2020 election, while only 17% back President Trump. But that hasn't stopped Trump from trying to maintain a pro-LGBTQ image. Ina video,externalannouncement in August, Richard Grenell - the country's first openly gay cabinet member - called Trump the most âpro-gay president in American history.â But critics describe an array of the presidentâs policies as anti-LGBTQ, particularly when it comes to trans people. For example, in 2019 the Trump administration banned transgender service members from the military. And for the trans community in the US, this election feels particularly urgent. This year alone has seen 33 trans or gender non-conforming people fatally shot or killed,according to Human Rights Campaign,external. The majority of those killed have been trans women of colour. âIn this election, the lives that we deserve are at stake for queer and trans people,â Raquel Willis, a writer and activist, said. She added that that a Biden win could ultimately mean that LGBT people of colour are emboldened to run for office in elections to come. Read about the black transgender push to keep the fight alive at LGBT Pride. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Click hereif you want to know more about this project or send in a question of your own. Tony Broadhurst, 75, from New Zealand asks:In the US, why is the right, Republicans, represented red & the left, Democrats, represented blue? This is the opposite of the rest of the world. We talk a lot about the red and blue state divide in US politics these days - but this colour set-up has actually only been firmly in place since the 2000s. Before then, US media organisations used red and blue for both parties, going back and forth on the colour scheme. In 1976, ABC had Republicans as yellow. And NBC used red for Democrats and blue for Republicans until the 1980s - citing the way things are done in the UK. But things had generally settled into red-Republican blue-Democrat by the 1990s. However, it wasn't until the lengthy 2000 election, when the New York Times and USA Today papers both published full-colour maps using that scheme, that things were set in stone. As a Times editor toldSmithsonian Magazine,external:  ""I just decided red begins with âr,â Republican begins with âr.â It was a more natural association."" A USA Today editor also pointed out that aesthetically, as most of the central US leans Republican, it just looks better to have the lighter colour taking up the most space. So about that White House celebratory event for Amy Coney Barrett taking place tonight which we reported earlier? Well, the mayor of Washington DC thinks folks should stay away if they aren't willing to leave if the situation becomes unsafe. ""For all you know you could be packed in a Rose Garden event with somebody sitting next to you hacking,"" Mayor Muriel Bowser said. ""Ask yourself â if that's happening, are you going to get up and leave in the middle of the president's remarks? If you're not, you shouldn't go."" She also pointed out that some of those who attendedthe ""superspreader"" event last monththat could have been where the president caught his case of Covid-19 were ""embarrassed"" they had done so. Bowser added that 642 people have died in the nation's capital already. ""You can believe that you can go to the White House and get Covid and nothing is going to happen to you, perhaps. Or you could die from it."" A conservative-leaning newspaper in New Hampshire has endorsed a Democratic candidate for the presidency first time in more than 100 years. The New Hampshire Union Leader backed Libertarian Gary Johnson during the 2016 campaign, having previously only backed Republicans, according to Axios. ""We
were hopeful with Trumpâs win that he might change, that the weight and
responsibility of the Oval Office might mold a more respectful and presidential
man,""the New Hampshire Union Leader wrote in an editorial published on Sunday,external. But although it praised some of the president's accomplishments during his first term in office, the newspaper commented: ""President
Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America."" In particular, the newspaper criticised Trump's handling of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic. ""We have
found Mr Biden to be a caring, compassionate and professional public servant,"" the newspaper wrote, in spite of its ""significant"" policy differences with the Democratic candidate. ""He has repeatedly expressed his desire to be a president for all of America,
and we take him at his word."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Tesco 'wrong' to say period products not essential,"This video can not be played Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government had ""made a mess of the messaging"" over the essential items issue Tesco was ""simply wrong"" to tell a woman she could not buy period products during lockdown, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. The supermarket apologised after saying it could not sell sanitary towels and tampons from a store in Cardiff. The Welsh Government has banned the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets during a 17-day lockdown. Opposition parties have called that ""absolute madness"" and said better communication was needed with shops. The Welsh Government said revised guidance will be published on Tuesday. Mr Gething told the Welsh Government briefing that supermarkets would now be able to use their ""discretion"". Tesco had blocked off the aisle after a ""break-in"" at the store in St Mellons, Cardiff They have been told toclose parts of their storesthat sell items such as clothes, bedding and toys during Wales' firebreak lockdown. Under Welsh Government guidance, shops which have been allowed to remain open are not allowed to sell goods classed as ""non-essential"" during the 17 days, which would normally be sold by businesses that have been made to close. This includes homeware, electrical goods, telephones, clothes, toys and games, and garden products. The policy has been criticised in a petition signed by more than 60,000 people. Homeware and bedding has been taped off in Tesco in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan One customer wrote on Twitter she was ""raging and in tears"" after not being able to buy period products at Tesco's St Mellons store in Cardiff, after the aisle was blocked off. In a tweet that was later deleted, Tesco responded to the complaint by saying it had been told not to sell the items during the lockdown. ""This is wrong - period products are essential,"" the Welsh Government tweeted in response. The supermarket later issued a statement saying the area had been closed off following a break-in at the store, which the police were investigating. South Wales Police confirmed it was investigating a burglary which happened between 02:30 GMT and 04:30 on Monday when an estimated ""Â£20,000 worth of beauty products were stolen"". Tesco said the reply to the customer, which had implied sanitary towels were non-essential, ""was sent by mistake"". In Tesco's Penarth store, carbon Monoxide and smoke alarms were covered in sheeting In Tesco in Penarth shelves containing smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors were covered in plastic sheeting, with the store putting up a sign saying they were ""non essential"". But under the Welsh Government guidelines shops can sell products you can normally buy fromfood and drink stores, newsagents, pharmacies and DIY and hardware stores,external- as they remain open. Wales national lockdown in new year 'likely' 'Think of others during firebreak,' says archbishop On Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said meetings would be held with the supermarkets to make clear they could use ""some discretion"" to sell non-essentials to those in ""genuine need"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing he said he was ""very sorry"" a woman had been incorrectly told she could not buy sanitary products. Mr Gething said shoppers and retailers should use ""common sense"" and there would be a ""very small number"" of cases where there would be a genuine need to buy a non-essential item in a supermarket. ""For the great majority of us though of course, we will be able to manage for the next two weeks - with the hardship, with the interruption that causes, yes -Â  but to avoid the much greater hardship and much greater interruption to people's lives and their ability to still see family and friends in the future,"" he said. Books have been covered in cellophane The Welsh Government has come under pressure to abandon the measure and a petition against the ban is now the largest ever submitted to the Senedd. Secretary of State for WalesSimon Hart has urged,externalMr Drakeford to ""scrap the policy"" while Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies called for Members of the Senedd to be recalled ""virtually"" to debate the matter. ""This is absolute madness by the Welsh Government, preventing people from buying the products which they want to buy,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price called on ministers to admit they had sent out confused messaging about a policy, and the public health message had got ""lost"". ""If they'd had the conversations with the retail sector earlier, so we heard from the minister that they had a meeting on Thursday, I would suggest that was too late,"" he said. ""That has eroded public trust over the weekend and obviously that is concerning because it's the public support, the public health message is ultimately the one thing that keeps us all safe.""

Tim Batcup, who has had to close his Swansea book shop during the lockdown, said the Welsh Government had made the ""right call"". But he said that while some supermarkets had stopped selling books, others were still selling them, and the messaging was a ""bit mixed"". ""I don't really understand the fuss... I don't know why people can't go a couple of weeks without a pair or pants or a candle,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""I think it's a sincere attempt at levelling up, how effective it will be I don't know. It might drive people towards the online giants, but they all seem to clean up anyway."" The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off Nicky Small, who has had to close her craft shop in Llandudno, said she believed wool and other craft items were essential as the hobbies were helping many through the pandemic. ""I think there's a balance, what is one person's non-essential could be another person's essential,"" she said. ""The difficulty is anybody trying to dictate what essential is, because that will depend on who you are, what you are needing to get, if you have been waiting for payday."" Head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, Sara Jones, said the rules were confusing, and banning people from buying certain items set a dangerous precedent. ""I think this policy is the wrong way to go about it, because rather than levelling the playing field, it's just creating winners and losers, it's pushing people online,"" she said. She said allowing an element of discretion would go against the purpose of the policy, as people would have to approach staff for items and spend more time in store. ""It's distorting competition, which I think is setting a bit of a dangerous precedent,"" she said.

Nottingham to move to tier 3 restrictions,"Nottingham has consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in England Nottingham and parts of the surrounding county will move into the top tier of Covid restrictions, it has been confirmed. People living in the city, along with Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowe, face the toughest restrictions. The measures come into force at one minute past midnight on Thursday and will expire after 28 days. It comes after the city consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in the country. About eight million people in England will be living in the tier three - ""very high"" alert level by the end of the week. This means pubs that do not serve substantial meals have to close, and there are further restrictions on households mixing. The affected parts of Nottinghamshire join Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, South Yorkshire and Warrington in the highest tier. Details of the lockdown will be formally announced on Tuesday, but in a joint statement local councils said the measures ""have been agreed to achieve a sustained reduction in infection rates"" and to ""protect our vulnerable residents, the NHS and social care services"". Residents and businesses who are affected will receive ""a package of support similar to those secured in other parts of the country"". Though it did havethe highest figures in the UKearlier this month, Nottingham's seven-day rate of infection has dropped again, according to the latest data. The city had the 24th highest rate of infection per 100,000 people in England, at 443.7, in the week up to the 23 October, down from 677.4 the previous week. It is still the highest in the county, but the surrounding boroughs are all seeing an increase, with Broxtowe's infection rate having risen from 310.4 to 342.9, Gedling's up from 373.2 to 418.2 and Rushcliffe rising from 359.1 to 393.5. David Mellen, leader of Nottingham City Council, appealed to residents to ""work together"" and stick to ""very difficult"" restrictions. Though the seven-day infection rate for the city has dropped steadily after being the highest in the UK earlier this month, he said there were still concerns over rising rates among older age groups and hospital occupancy levels. ""We've got a growing number of people, way over 200 people, in our hospitals with Covid, and an increasing number in [intensive care units], so we are concerned about those numbers,"" he told BBC Radio Nottingham. ""Obviously we had many people die in Nottingham [and] Nottinghamshire earlier in the year and we don't want to add to that number with many more deaths as a result of this."" Mr Mellen also said the level of financial support from the government - which is to cover additional track and trace costs, enforcement and extra support to affected businesses - is ""not enough"". He said he did not feel Nottingham had been ""fully funded by the government, and we do believe that if we do a really good job on track and trace, which is absolutely necessary, it will cost us more than what is being offered"". ""We tried to argue for more money, but the kind of formula that's been applied in four other [local] authority areas wasn't going to be changed for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire."" Jason Weston from Ye Olde Salutation Inn said it was ""looking very, very dark"" for the pub Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood criticised the government for what she said was ""woeful"" communication over the move into the toughest restrictions. ""It's more than a week since Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock said they were talking to [Nottinghamshire] about going into tier three, yet talks didn't even begin until Thursday and MPs weren't even briefed until Friday,""she tweeted,external. Jason Weston, who runs Ye Olde Salutation Inn in the centre of Nottingham, said he will not have to close because the pub serves meals, but with capacity already down to 20% of what it was in summer because of the 22:00 curfew he said it was ""almost irrelevant"" whether they were allowed to open or not. ""I'm very worried,"" he said. ""We're watching the bank balance go down week by week - it's looking very, very dark."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

Hay Festival co-founder suspended,"Peter Florence was made a CBE in 2018 for services to literature and charity The director and co-founder of the Hay literary festival has been suspended after a complaint by a member of staff. Peter Florence was suspended at the start of October pending the outcome of grievance proceedings, the festival has confirmed. Mr Florence set up the festival with his parents in 1988. It is one of the biggest events in world literature. The matter is unrelated toa claim that a festival employee was sexually assaulted by a senior Gulf royal. The Hay Festival has attracted many leading writers and public figures to Hay-on-Wye, in Powys, including former US President Bill Clinton, who called it the ""Woodstock of the mind"". Mr Florence was made a CBE in 2018 for services to literature and charity, and he chaired the jury of the 2019 Man Booker Prize for Fiction. Caroline Michel, the festival chairwoman, said Mr Florence had been signed off sick, which had delayed the conclusion of the grievance procedure. Tania Hudson has been appointed interim chief executive, alongside the international director, Cristina Fuentes La Roche. The Hay Festival was not held as a physical event this year because of the pandemic Ms Michel added: ""The Hay Festival Board would like to reassure all supporters and sponsors that the festival is in good hands. ""We are not at liberty to offer any further comment on personnel issues until this matter is resolved."" Normally the festival brings thousands of visitors to Hay every spring, but this yearit was forced to go onlinebecause of the coronavirus pandemic. Festival officials say the claim against Mr Florence is a separate matter to allegations made by one of its employees, Caitlin McNamara, who has said she was sexually assaulted by Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan while in Abu Dhabi.

Turkey's Erdogan urges boycott of French products,"Mr Erdogan's calls for a boycott come after months of rising tensions between France and Turkey Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on Turks to boycott French goods amid a row over France's tougher stance on radical Islam. In a televised speech, he urged world leaders to protect Muslims ""if there is oppression against Muslims in France"". Mr Erdogan has angrily criticised French President Emmanuel Macron for pledging to defend secularism against radical Islam. It comes after a teacher was killed for showing Prophet Muhammad cartoons. Samuel Paty was beheaded on 16 October by 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov outside Paris, after presenting the images to his pupils during a class about freedom of speech. Mr Macron has paid tribute to Mr Paty, and said France ""will not give up our cartoons"". Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France French Muslims fear state aims to control their faith Don't stigmatise Muslims says Macron amid veil row Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are offensive to many Muslims. But state secularism - or laÃ¯citÃ© - is central to France's national identity. Curbing freedom of expression to protect the feelings of one particular community undermines unity, the state says. Mr Erdogan called for the boycott in a televised speech on Monday. ""Never give credit to French-labelled goods, don't buy them,"" he said in the capital Ankara. He said Muslims are now ""subjected to a lynch campaign similar to that against Jews in Europe before World War II"", adding that ""European leaders should tell the French president to stop his hate campaign"". Over the weekend, Mr Erdogan said Mr Macron needed a mental health check for speaking out so forcefully on Islam -comments that caused France to recall its ambassador to Turkeyfor consultations. It came after Mr Macron pledged to defend secularism and tackle radical Islam in the wake of the killing of Mr Paty. This video can not be played Rallies have been held in Paris, Toulouse, Lyon and other French cities in support of the teacher killed, Samuel Paty Two weeks before the attack,Mr Macron described Islam as a religion ""in crisis""and announced new measures to tackle what he called ""Islamist separatism"". France has Western Europe's largest Muslim population, and some accuse the authorities of using secularism to target them. European leaders have come out in support of France. Germany expressed ""solidarity"" with Mr Macron after the Turkish president's comments, with government spokesman Steffen Seibert calling the remarks ""defamatory"" and ""completely unacceptable"" and foreign minister Heiko Maas calling Mr Erdogan's personal attacks ""a particular low point"". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the Netherlands ""stands firmly with France and for the collective values of the European Union"", while Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also expressed his ""full solidarity"" with Mr Macron. ""Personal insults do not help the positive agenda that the EU wants to pursue with Turkey,""he wrote in a tweet,external. But Turkey is not the only country to criticise Mr Macron's comments. Pakistan's Prime MinisterImran Khan accused the French president of ""attacking Islam""in a tweet on Sunday, whileFrench products have been removed from some shopsin Kuwait, Jordan and Qatar. There have also been protests in a number of countries, including Bangladesh, Iraq, Libya and Syria. A placard placed in a supermarket in Amman, Jordan tells people that French products are being boycotted Meanwhile French footballerPaul Pogba has denied reports that he planned to quit international footballover Mr Macron's comments about Islam. The Manchester United midfielder dismissed the ""total fake headlines"" in a post on Instagram and said he was taking legal action against publishers. Citing Turkey's statistical institute, Reuters news agency reports that France is the 10th biggest source of imports into Turkey. The French company Renault is reportedly one of the leading car brands by sales in the country. Mr Erdogan's calls for a boycott come after months of rising tensions between France and Turkey. While both countries are Nato members, they support differing sides inthe ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as in Libya's civil war. France suspends Nato mission role amid Turkey row The Eastern Mediterranean tinderbox Mr Macron has also clashed with Mr Erdogan over Turkish oil and gas exploration in disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean.France deployed jets and a frigate to the regionin August amid the tensions. And in January,Mr Macron accused the Turkish president of breaking a promise to stay out of the conflict in Libya.

Stock markets shudder at rising Covid cases,"US stock markets suffered their sharpest drop in weeks as concerns about the economic impact of surging coronavirus cases sent shares tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.3%, after dropping more than 3% earlier in the day. The S&P 500 fell 1.8% and the Nasdaq 1.6%. Stocks in Europe, where a rise in virus cases has prompted new restrictions, also declined. Shares in travel and energy firms took some of the heaviest losses. In the United States, cruise lines Royal Caribbean Group, Carnival and Norwegian all dropped more than 8%, while in the UK,British Airways owner IAG closed 7.6% lower. Travel firms have been some of the most sensitive to warnings about the virus, which experts worry will intensify as winter approaches. On Monday, Michael Ryan, an emergencies expert for the World Health Organization, said that Europe would need ""much more comprehensive"" measures to get the virus under control. ""Right now we're well behind this virus in Europe, so getting ahead of it is going to take some serious acceleration in what we do,"" he said. On Monday, France's CAC 40 ended 1.9% lower, while Germany's Dax index dropped 3.7%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 fell nearly 1.2%. US President Donald Trump has vowed to avoid widespread restrictions on activity, similar to the lockdown restrictions seen this spring, saying such limits are not worth the economic cost. But such decisions are typically handled by local leaders in America, some of whom, such as the mayors of El Paso, Texas and Newark, New Jersey, tightened rules on Monday. Over the last week, the number of new virus cases reported daily in the US has repeatedly passed 80,000, sending the seven day average to a new high of nearly 69,000 - roughly double what it was in September. The number of hospitalisations has jumped 40% in the past month and death rates are also rising, though more slowly. On a per capita basis, the number of new cases in the US over the past seven days remains lower than some other countries, including the UK, Spain and France, which have announced new restrictions recently. But analysts say the economy is unlikely to mend until concerns about Covid-19 are resolved. Amid those strains, investors are also worried about the impasse in Washington over the need to fund additional coronavirus economic relief. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been trying to broker a deal for the White House, said the two sides remained far apart. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, who leads Democrats in the House of Representatives made similar comments. Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

North and South Lanarkshire are being considered for the harshest coronavirus restrictions, according to the Scottish government, ahead of a parliamentary debate onScotland's new five-tier Covid restrictionson Tuesday. A letter to the umbrella body for Scotland's councils says ministers are considering implementing the toughest restrictions in the two council areas. They are the only local authorities in the country where the ""level of concern"" is such that the highest level of restrictions could be imposed. Read more here. A further 20,890 coronavirus cases have been recorded across the UK in the past 24 hours, according tothe latest government figures,external, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 894,690. The government also announced a further 102 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It brings the total UK death toll to 44,998. The figures compare to 19,790 cases and 151 deaths reported on Sunday. After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in the UK in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply from the end of August. Track the spread of the virus across the country, and look-up cases in your area, here. Nottingham and the surrounding areas' move into the strictest level of Covid restrictions, tier three, comes after the city consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in the country. There are now 7.9 million people in England living in tier three - the ""very high"" alert level. People living in Nottingham, as well as nearby Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowe, will join Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, South Yorkshire and Warrington in the highest tier. The tier three rules mean pubs that do not serve substantial meals must close, and imposes strict limits on households mixing. Read our explainer on the rules in place across the UK. The debate over whether the government should provide food for pupils who are eligible for free school meals over the half-term holiday is rumbling on, withthe prime minister standing by his refusal to do so. The government did step in over the summer holidays after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford, agreeing it was fair to do so as pupils had not been at school during term time because of the coronavirus pandemic. As you can see from the chart below, many of the areas with the highest percentage of pupils eligible for the support are also those in the higher tiers of restrictions, with Knowsley, Manchester and now Nottingham among those in the very high level. Nottingham has consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in England More now on the move into tier three restrictions for Nottingham and surrounding areas. The move was announced ina statement from council leaders,externaland had been widely expected following days of talks. Specific details of the measures  will be formally announced on Tuesday and ""have been agreed to achieve a sustained reduction in infection rates, especially to help protect our vulnerable residents, the NHS and social care services"", the councils say. They confirm there will be additional rules to the standard tier three baseline measures ""specific to these areas of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire"". A package of financial support, similar to those secured in other areas of the country in tier three, has been agreed to help residents and businesses who will be impacted by the new restrictions. Read more about the move here. Nottingham, Broxtowe, Gedling and Rushcliffe council areas are to move to tier three coronavirus restrictions following discussions between government and council leaders. The measures will come into force at 00:01 on Thursday and last 28 days. More than 1.4 million people in South Yorkshire are now in England's top tier of Covid restrictions Hospitals in South Yorkshire are coming under increasing pressure from a surge in coronavirus cases. Rotherham Hospital has 96 patients who have tested positive for the virus, as of this morning, compared to 78 at the height of the first wave. A spokesman for Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust said six in-patients are in critical care. It comes after Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said the number ofpatients with coronavirus admitted to its hospitals had doubled in a week. It said if rates continued to rise then it would, in the next two weeks, have more patients than at any point during the pandemic. Both Rotherham and Doncaster, along with Sheffield and Barnsley and other parts of South Yorkshire,entered the strictest tier of coronavirus restrictions at the weekendamid concerns over rising cases in the area. Normally at this time of year families will be making plans for a last holiday before winter grips the country but this year, amid the coronavirus pandemic, things are very different. WithEnglandnow split into three tiers it depends which category you are in as to whether you can travel for a holiday. Until 9 November,Walesis under a ""firebreak"" lockdown. People have been told to stay at home and not travel, except for essential purposes. If you're coming from elsewhere in the UK you cannot travel to Wales during the 17-day lockdown. Northern Irelandis currently under a four-week period of harsher restrictions, and residents have been advised against any unnecessary travel. You can still travel to Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK, but hotels, guesthouses and B&Bs are closed to tourists, as are campsites. You can travel anywhere withinScotland, unless there are local restrictions in place advising you not to do so. Thegovernment has advised people not to travel into or out of the central belt region- which stretches from Glasgow to Edinburgh - until 1 November, if possible.

Toymakers are expecting strong sales during the critical end-of-year festive season aftera pandemic-fuelled surge in demand for items such as Barbies and board games. Hasbro, the maker of games such as Monopoly and Jenga, told investors earlier today that it was poised for a ""good holiday season"". The forecast followed rival Mattel's report last week of its biggest sales jump in a decade, as its Barbie dolls hit their highest quarterly sales since 2003. The gains have come as families buy toys and games in an attempt to fend off boredom amid coronavirus lockdowns. ""The toy industry as a whole grew meaningfully and continues to demonstrate its resilience in challenging economic times,"" said Mattel chief executive Ynon Kreiz. In the first nine months of the year, Hasbro sales grew 13% from 2019 - bucking the wider plunge in consumer spending around the world. At Mattel, sales are down 2% from 2019 - but some brands, such as Barbie, are having their strongest run in years. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Letnany, near Prague, is now home to a field hospital, built by the army in just seven days The Czech Republic was praised for its swift response to the coronavirus crisis back in spring, but seven months on it's now recording 15,000 new cases a day and has the second highest per capita death rate over seven days in the world. Colonel Ladislav Slechta, a commander in the Czech Army, has just overseen the building of a field hospital. He is used to building such hospitals in Afghanistan or Iraq. Not on the outskirts of Prague. ""There's no time at this moment to think about emotions. But I'm sure they're coming, because it's really an unusual situation,"" he told me. ""We were discussing it, and going back in history, we think the last time this type of facility was deployed in this country was during the First World War."" So what went wrong? Thousands of people celebrated the end of coronavirus in the city of Prague in the summer Czech efforts to fight the virus haven't been helped by the man who wrote the rules being caught in the act of breaking them. Czech Health Minister Roman Prymula says he will resign as soon as his successor is named, after the tabloid Blesk published a late-night photograph of him emerging maskless from a restaurant, holding his wallet. All pubs and restaurants are supposed to be closed to customers, and can only provide hatch service until 8pm. Read more from Rob here. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check In the closing days of the US election campaign, President
Trumpâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic has become a major issue. One significant point of contention has been the wearing of
face coverings - something some supporters of the president have often been unwilling
to do, notably at his rallies. Posts shared thousands of times on Facebook are falsely
claiming that Dr Anthony Fauci, Americaâs top infectious disease expert - who
strongly recommends that people wear face coverings - once wrote a paper saying face
masks led to mass deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic. However, the posts cite a report co-authored by Dr Fauci in
2008 which makes absolutely no mention of masks. The study found the majority of deaths during the 1918
pandemic were not caused by the virus alone but that most victims succumbed to
bacterial pneumonia following the influenza infection. Dr Fauci, who has frequently questioned President Trump's
handling of the pandemic, has beentargeted by misinformation campaigns before. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said infection rates have been rising and it was time ""to take action"" in Warrington, which has been moved into England's top tier of coronavirus restrictions. The area, in north-west England, will join Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, Lancashire and Liverpool City region in tier three from tomorrow. Under tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres and soft play areas will also have to close in Warrington, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the Cheshire town, which is home to about 210,000 people. The restrictions will be reviewed in 28 days' time. The
government will provide a financial support package of Â£1.68m to Warrington, as well as
Â£4.2m in business support funding. Here's more detail about the different restrictions around the UK. The UK government has confirmed Warrington, in north-west England, will move into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. The new measures will come into force from tomorrow. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has reported a record number of daily new coronavirus cases. Officials say 17,347 people have tested positive over the past 24 hours, binging the total tally in Russia to 1,531,224. With 219 further deaths recorded, the total Covid-19 death toll now stands at 26,269. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The pandemic is now hitting the regions east of Moscow. It is true that the situation is quite difficult... It requires incredibly energetic efforts on the part of the
federal government and regional governments."" It come as the authorities across Russia
have been introducing new, stricter measures, including:  If you are just joining us, welcome, here is a round-up of the main developments so far today: Bonfire Night is fast approaching in the UK, but with many public firework displays being cancelled this year due to social
distancing measures, a dogs charity is asking people to be considerate if they decide to put on private displays in their gardens. The Dogs Trust said: âDogs have approximately four times
more sensitive hearing than humans, so the loud cracks and bangs of fireworks
can often be a terrifying experience for them. Fireworks also tend to be
sudden, unpredictable and bright. This combination can be distressing and have
a lasting impact on dogs. ""This
year, dog owners are faced with the added worry that more fireworks will be set
off in the local neighbourhood due to large-scale gatherings being cancelled."" The charity advises people wishing to hold a private display to choose quieter fireworks, limit the display to 30 minutes or less, and let dog owners in neighbouring homes know in advance. Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Several hospitals in Belgium have requested that doctors and nurses who test positive for Covid-19, continue to work if they have no symptoms. The decision has been made by 10 hospitals in Liege, which are dealing with a surge in coronavirus admissions. The city is one of the worst affected areas of Europe and hospitals have started transferring patients elsewhere and cancelled all non-urgent surgery. The situation is exacerbated by a lack of doctors and nurses available. A quarter of medical staff in Liege are reported to be off work with Covid-19. But another 10% of staff who have tested positive but are asymptomic have been asked to continue working. The president of the Belgian Association of Medical Unions, Dr Philippe Devos, acknowledged the obvious risk of transferring the virus to patients, but says theyâve been left with no choice in order to avoid the hospital system collapsing within days.

The protesters want the government to provide more funding to support the sector. In July, the government announced a package of Â£1.57bn for the struggling arts sector. It is one of many protests from those in the industry to have taken place during the outbreak, withmusiciansandtheatre workersalso protesting outside Parliament earlier this month.  Some of the dancers wore ""I am Fatima"" t-shirts, which referenceda widely-criticised government-backed advertfrom earlier this month which suggested a ballet dancer should retrain. The ad pictured a dancer - ""Fatima"" - and encouraged her to give up on dancing and ""reskill"" in cyber security. The ad was pulled after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden disowned it. Â© 2025 BBC.

'Going to bed with hunger pains',"Danielle (right) and her sister ""I find it hard to remember ever having a cooked meal at home,"" says Danielle, who relied on free school meals as a child. ""I would eat spaghetti hoops cold out of the tin. ""We would have sliced white bread because it was 13p from [discount supermarket] Kwik Save, then put margarine on it and put it under the grill. ""Me and my sister thought we were going to open a cafÃ©."" Danielle, 39, is now a successful senior manager for a charity, living in London, but growing up she lived with food insecurity. She has told the BBC how, as a child, she often had to resort to shoplifting or ""bin-diving"" for essential food at weekends or during the school holidays - once, when she was as young as 10. ""Food poverty in Britain isn't really spoken about because of shame,"" she says. ""When the holidays hit, hunger doesn't go."" Is there really no money for free school meals? Leeds United matches players' Â£25K for free meals Restaurants rally for Rashford's free meal crusade Danielle is calling on the government to ""support young people"" as the row aboutthe decision not to extend free school mealsfor children in England into the half-term holiday continues. The government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford, did the same for the summer holiday. Ministers say that providing help through councils is the best way to reach those that need it. ""I was brought up in a household where we didn't have food at home,"" Danielle recalls. Her mother was ill, and couldn't work. A single-parent household, Danielle says she and her two siblings were often left to ""fend for themselves"", in addition to caring for their mum. ""Some days it was hard for her to get out of bed. She really put in a lot of effort but she couldn't cope. I don't hold it against her because she tried,"" Danielle stresses. They would usually receive child benefits payments on a Monday. ""So we would often take a day off school and have lots of food then,"" says Danielle, ""but nothing afterwards."" Packets of jelly were common because they cost 20p and ""would go quite far"", or instant custard - ""things to fill you up"". At the weekend, meals would frequently consist of dry cereal and dry bread. ""I remember going to bed with hunger pains and coming home to an empty fridge,"" she says. ""You learn to shut off the signals from your brain that tell you you're hungry."" This habit stayed with her into adult life. ""I don't realise I'm hungry, and then it gets to 4pm and I realise I've been dissociating and suddenly have to eat. ""As a young adult I didn't know how to cook, so would just eat for survival. Something to take away the hunger."" Danielle could sometimes eat at friends' houses or at Sunday school as a child, but her main source of hot meals was school. She explains that because her mum was on benefits, that qualified her and her siblings for free school meals - which were limited to certain children. ""I have really strong memories of them,"" she says. ""Apple crumble and custard [her favourite pudding to this day], baked potatoes, roast dinners. ""I also have fond memories of sitting at the table with all of my friends."" But beyond that, she was forced to find other ways of sourcing food, when they had run out of essentials and she was ""starving"". This included ""bin-diving"" for surplus food behind supermarkets, paying 10p for scraps from the local fish and chip shops, and shoplifting. ""It wasn't frequent, but when we were desperate,"" she says. Danielle was caught shoplifting a jar of Marmite aged 10 - carefully selected from the shelves because it could ""last weeks"" by only spreading a small bit on each piece of bread. And, while on the earlier occasion she was only told not to return to the shop, at 14-years-old she had her fingerprints taken, was placed in a police cell and later cautioned over shoplifting. ""I think that was for stealing jelly."" Danielle says the incident came up on her record when she was applying for a job in later life, leaving her devastated. ""I feel like I'm quite a moral person. For it to tarnish your career when all you are trying to do is eat,"" she says. ""I'm not proud of it and I would never do it now, but it was survival."" As soon as Danielle was old enough to get various part-time jobs, she stopped shoplifting, and went on to get three ""A"" grade A-Levels and a First-class degree at university. But she says that she could have gone ""either way"". ""I did have a supportive education system and that enabled me to not continue down the wrong path,"" she says. ""Because of the support that we have in the UK it allows people to go from poverty into middle class and be able to earn a living. ""Unless we support young people, give them opportunities, like food and education, then that wouldn't be able to happen."" This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Responding to the row over free school meals, Danielle argues that those who are making the decisions are doing so from ""a place of privilege"" without an understanding of ""what it's like to be a child and to be hungry"". She also stresses that there are ""all sorts"" of family dynamics that can lead to financial difficulty, including debt, mental health issues, and addiction. ""It can happen to anyone,"" she says. As Danielle hit her 30s, she developed a new relationship with food - teaching herself to cook from scratch and eventually batch cooking for the week. ""One of my friends set up a supper club and said I was their inspiration,"" she said. ""I just thought it's funny going from no food, to all my friends saying I was such an amazing cook.""

Is there no money for free  meals?,"Marcus Rashford's campaign over the summer forced the government to U-turn on free school meals Amid the talks over Manchester's request for an extra Â£30m a month for jobs support, or indeed the tens of millions for half-term free school meals in England, and the debate over a tougher lockdown, the government and its top supporters are citing the idea that there is no money left. Certainly, this morning's public finances showed the government borrowing in the first half of the financial year at a record high, the highest levels of government debt in 60 years and the deficit this year heading for its highest ever level outside of a world war. This is before the statisticians have accounted for likely losses from tens of billions of government-guaranteed lending to businesses. September's numbers alone saw a fivefold increase in borrowing, up from Â£7.7bn last September to Â£36.1bn, driven by more spending on the furlough scheme, health and self-employment, as well as far less VAT and income taxes received. UK borrowing surges as Covid support continues How much harm would a circuit-breaker do? The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) this afternoon also published a chart showing that of the Â£262bn that the Treasury has borrowed by issuing gilts, Â£246bn has been bought by the Bank of England. The central bank has indirectly created and lent most of the extra money required by the government. Overall, the government has not had to raise the funds from the private sector or abroad. So, no, we aren't really running out of cash. The best evidence for that is that the government will indeed be announcing more borrowed money for some of its schemes in the coming days and weeks. And there is ample evidence that market demand for government debt is still strong. For example, the European Union found huge demand this week for its new ""social bonds"" to help Spain and Italy fund pandemic jobs support. However, these Bank of England purchases do, in theory, have to be sold back into the market after the crisis. With a large stock of debt, the government's finances are now very sensitive to even relatively small rises in the rate at which it borrows. It seems unlikely right now, but is far from unthinkable over the next several years. The government had already planned to borrow more to invest in infrastructure as part of its ""levelling-up agenda"". Much higher levels of spending on health and pensions are already baked in to the spending cake as society ages. So getting the public finances in shape does matter, as a medium-term priority. Right now, though, it is difficult to argue that ""no money"" is the constraint on extending free school meals, or furlough support. Particularly not on a day when it was confirmed pensions will rise by two percentage points more than inflation, at a time when average earnings are negative. The cost of that triple lock policy, just as an example, is about Â£1.5bn in extra state pension costs in the coming year, according to Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. These are political decisions to allocate money where the government feels an obligation to prioritise. How much harm would a circuit-breaker do?

Some 60m Americans have already cast ballots, shattering previous records for early voting. Trump is campaigning in Pennsylvania US President Donald Trump has heaped praise on his Supreme Court nominee at an afternoon campaign rally in Pennsylvania. âJust a few hours from now the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Courtâ, he said to a big cheer from his supporters. âThat was a good choice wasnât it?â he added. He described Judge Barrett as âfantasticâ and one of the nationâs âmost brilliant legal mindsâ. Democrats have opposed the appointment. Early numbers show youth turnout far outpacing that of past presidential contests. In Florida, a key battleground state, 257,720 voters aged 18-29 had already cast their ballots as of 21 October.

Speaking outside a campaign field office, Biden denounced Trump's response to the Covid-19 pandemic - the centre of his closing pitch to voters - seizing on comments from the White House chief of staff earlier that the administration was ""not going to control the pandemic"". He also accused the White House of holding ""super-spreader events"", referring to a Rose Garden reception earlier this month, where a dozen Republicans celebrating Trump's nomination of Barrett, a conservative judge, are believed to have caught the virus. Another reception is due to held tonight after Barrett is expected to be confirmed. ""I just hope he is willing to have learned a lesson,"" Biden said, adding that the event should have tests, masks, social distancing and crowd limits.

In 2016, the tombstone in Rochester, New York, was covered in stickers from voters paying their respects to the womenâs rights activist. It was the first election in which Americans were able to vote for a female major-party presidential candidate, in Hillary Clinton.

As a recovering Republican, due largely to the rise of Trumpism, I can understand the importance of this election and the value that all of us must place on the preservation of our democratic institutions. Does being LGBT influence your vote? Up until now, being a gay man never factored into my voting preferences. Even as a Republican, I wittingly neglected my social views in favor of the notion of limited government and fiscal conservatism and I saw the party as an ideal vessel to secure them both over time. However, since Trump's rise to the American presidency, Republicans have sought to subvert and denigrate the customs and courtesies of governance by acting as scapegoats and appeasers of Trump. These votersare members of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from them throughout the week. Join the conversation: President Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Mr Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25 (Â£5.50). President Trumphas reiterated his promise to bring down US troop levels overseas, while continuing to invest in the military. The president says he will continue to challenge international alliances and maintain trade tariffs on China. Mr Bidenhas promised to repair relationships with US allies. He says he would do away with unilateral tariffs on China, and instead hold them accountable with an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". Today we're focusing on LGBT voters of all political views. Mike Harlow is a writer, artist, and a former liberal who left the Democratic Party a few years ago. He was once an enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama, but now wholeheartedly supports Donald Trump, who he says has kept his promises and totally transformed the Republican Party. What inspired you to vote in this election? Iâve always been an extremely engaged voter. As a New Yorker, it feels like we donât get a choice in elections. Far-left Democrats have run our city into the ground, and the local Republican Party does absolutely nothing to offer an alternative or seriously compete in elections. Iâm hoping if Trump performs well in NYC, it might be a wake up call to local Republicans that itâs time to get to work and do something! Literally, anything! Does being LGBT influence your vote? Yes and no. The only way being gay impacts my vote is one of rebellion. We have largely attained equal rights, and we are now free to vote on bigger issues of war, peace, country, and economics. The LGBT community is NOT a wing of the Democrats. The idea that all LGBT people (as well as all minorities) must conform and think alike is the definition of bigotry. These votersare members of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from them throughout the week. Join the conversation: The head of the World Health Organization has cautioned countries against ""giving up"" in the fight against the spread of coronavirus. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he understood the mental and physical toll the pandemic was taking on people across the world, but added: ""We cannot give up, we must not give up."" ""Leaders must balance the disruption to lives and livelihoods with the need to protect health workers and health systems as intensive care fills up,"" he said. Ghebreyesus' comments came aftera senior aide to US President Donald Trump admitted that the US was ""not going to control the pandemic"". Instead White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Covid-19 could only be defeated by ""mitigation areas"" like vaccines and therapeutics. About 225,000 Americans have died since the pandemic began, the highest figure of any country. The US recorded 83,718 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University  - just short of the record 83,757 reported on Friday. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Some say America is now a house divided. In many American families, their houses are indeed divided by political differences, putting strains on their relationships. But a Chinese American family in Maryland made it work. Thirty-one-year-old Cathy Shao has decided to vote for Biden in the US presidential election, while her husband Chenren Shao, 35, will be voting for Trump a second time. The couple
has been married for eight years, raising their three daughters together. âI know
she's Democrat, and she knows that I'm a Republican,â Mr Shao says the
political difference has never been a problem for their marriage. âI think
being humble is the key of not being offended,â he says, âWe're not trying to
persuade each other.â When Mr
Shao speaks, Mrs Shao looks at him lovingly. Other than agreeing to disagree,
Mrs Shao believes their common goal bonds the family together. âWe want to
provide a better environment for our children.â Though
Americans have become less willing to date their political opponents in the Trump
era, politically mixed marriages are not uncommon. A high-profile example is
Kellyanne Conway, a former counselor to President Trump, and George Conway, who
is a harsh critic of the President. What does
managing a politically divided but happy marriage tell us about how to govern a
politically divided country? As American
politics has become more polarised, Mrs Shao says she always appreciates a
different perspective from her spouse. âAll
Republicans should get married with Democrats, then we naturally have different
views,â she says with a laugh. Mrs Shao
hopes the two major political parties will recognise that their common goal is
âto make the country better, rather than attacking each otherâ. More from thoseexcerpts of Barack Obamaâs new memoir,externalon his time in the White House. The former president says he grew increasingly frustrated in 2010 with elements within the Tea Party protests who promoted conspiracy theories, including the racist claim that Obama was a Muslim not born in the US. ""One thing felt certain,"" he writes. ""A pretty big chunk of the American people, including some of the very folks I was trying to help, didnât trust a word I said. ""I wanted to believe that the ability to connect was still there,"" he says of his hope that he could convince opponents to support his healthcare reform bill. ""My wife wasnât so sure. One night, Michelle caught a glimpse of a Tea Party rally on TVâwith its enraged flag-waving and inflammatory slogans. She seized the remote and turned off the set, her expression hovering somewhere between rage and resignation. 'Itâs a trip, isnât it?' she said. 'What is?' 'That theyâre scared of you. Scared of us.' She shook her head and headed for bed."" This video can not be played US election 2020: President Trump casts his vote More than 60 million Americans have already cast their vote in the election, according to data compiled by the United States Elections Project. This includes more than 40 million mail ballots and 20 million in-person votes, it says. Around one-third of the votes cast came from the three most populous states - California, Texas and Florida, the data shows. With eight days to go until the election, the total number of early votes cast already exceeds that of 2016, according to US media reports. US President Donald Trump cast his vote early and in person in the swing state of Florida on Saturday.

Shrai PopatBBC News, Washington In a recent poll for the media monitoring organisation GLAAD, 76% of LGBTQ voters said they support Joe Biden in the 2020 election, while only 17% back President Trump. But that hasn't stopped Trump from trying to maintain a pro-LGBTQ image. Ina video,externalannouncement in August, Richard Grenell - the country's first openly gay cabinet member - called Trump the most âpro-gay president in American history.â But critics describe an array of the presidentâs policies as anti-LGBTQ, particularly when it comes to trans people. For example, in 2019 the Trump administration banned transgender service members from the military. And for the trans community in the US, this election feels particularly urgent. This year alone has seen 33 trans or gender non-conforming people fatally shot or killed,according to Human Rights Campaign,external. The majority of those killed have been trans women of colour. âIn this election, the lives that we deserve are at stake for queer and trans people,â Raquel Willis, a writer and activist, said. She added that that a Biden win could ultimately mean that LGBT people of colour are emboldened to run for office in elections to come. Read about the black transgender push to keep the fight alive at LGBT Pride. Ritu PrasadBBC News writer, Florida Weâve been asking our readers for their most pressing questions about the US election. Now itâs our turn to respond. Click hereif you want to know more about this project or send in a question of your own. Tony Broadhurst, 75, from New Zealand asks:In the US, why is the right, Republicans, represented red & the left, Democrats, represented blue? This is the opposite of the rest of the world. We talk a lot about the red and blue state divide in US politics these days - but this colour set-up has actually only been firmly in place since the 2000s. Before then, US media organisations used red and blue for both parties, going back and forth on the colour scheme. In 1976, ABC had Republicans as yellow. And NBC used red for Democrats and blue for Republicans until the 1980s - citing the way things are done in the UK. But things had generally settled into red-Republican blue-Democrat by the 1990s. However, it wasn't until the lengthy 2000 election, when the New York Times and USA Today papers both published full-colour maps using that scheme, that things were set in stone. As a Times editor toldSmithsonian Magazine,external:  ""I just decided red begins with âr,â Republican begins with âr.â It was a more natural association."" A USA Today editor also pointed out that aesthetically, as most of the central US leans Republican, it just looks better to have the lighter colour taking up the most space. So about that White House celebratory event for Amy Coney Barrett taking place tonight which we reported earlier? Well, the mayor of Washington DC thinks folks should stay away if they aren't willing to leave if the situation becomes unsafe. ""For all you know you could be packed in a Rose Garden event with somebody sitting next to you hacking,"" Mayor Muriel Bowser said. ""Ask yourself â if that's happening, are you going to get up and leave in the middle of the president's remarks? If you're not, you shouldn't go."" She also pointed out that some of those who attendedthe ""superspreader"" event last monththat could have been where the president caught his case of Covid-19 were ""embarrassed"" they had done so. Bowser added that 642 people have died in the nation's capital already. ""You can believe that you can go to the White House and get Covid and nothing is going to happen to you, perhaps. Or you could die from it."" A conservative-leaning newspaper in New Hampshire has endorsed a Democratic candidate for the presidency first time in more than 100 years. The New Hampshire Union Leader backed Libertarian Gary Johnson during the 2016 campaign, having previously only backed Republicans, according to Axios. ""We
were hopeful with Trumpâs win that he might change, that the weight and
responsibility of the Oval Office might mold a more respectful and presidential
man,""the New Hampshire Union Leader wrote in an editorial published on Sunday,external. But although it praised some of the president's accomplishments during his first term in office, the newspaper commented: ""President
Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America."" In particular, the newspaper criticised Trump's handling of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic. ""We have
found Mr Biden to be a caring, compassionate and professional public servant,"" the newspaper wrote, in spite of its ""significant"" policy differences with the Democratic candidate. ""He has repeatedly expressed his desire to be a president for all of America,
and we take him at his word."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Nottingham to move to tier 3 restrictionsSome parts of the surrounding county will also face the toughest Covid rules.Nottingham,"Nottingham has consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in England Nottingham and parts of the surrounding county will move into the top tier of Covid restrictions, it has been confirmed. People living in the city, along with Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowe, face the toughest restrictions. The measures come into force at one minute past midnight on Thursday and will expire after 28 days. It comes after the city consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in the country. About eight million people in England will be living in the tier three - ""very high"" alert level by the end of the week. This means pubs that do not serve substantial meals have to close, and there are further restrictions on households mixing. The affected parts of Nottinghamshire join Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, South Yorkshire and Warrington in the highest tier. Details of the lockdown will be formally announced on Tuesday, but in a joint statement local councils said the measures ""have been agreed to achieve a sustained reduction in infection rates"" and to ""protect our vulnerable residents, the NHS and social care services"". Residents and businesses who are affected will receive ""a package of support similar to those secured in other parts of the country"". Though it did havethe highest figures in the UKearlier this month, Nottingham's seven-day rate of infection has dropped again, according to the latest data. The city had the 24th highest rate of infection per 100,000 people in England, at 443.7, in the week up to the 23 October, down from 677.4 the previous week. It is still the highest in the county, but the surrounding boroughs are all seeing an increase, with Broxtowe's infection rate having risen from 310.4 to 342.9, Gedling's up from 373.2 to 418.2 and Rushcliffe rising from 359.1 to 393.5. David Mellen, leader of Nottingham City Council, appealed to residents to ""work together"" and stick to ""very difficult"" restrictions. Though the seven-day infection rate for the city has dropped steadily after being the highest in the UK earlier this month, he said there were still concerns over rising rates among older age groups and hospital occupancy levels. ""We've got a growing number of people, way over 200 people, in our hospitals with Covid, and an increasing number in [intensive care units], so we are concerned about those numbers,"" he told BBC Radio Nottingham. ""Obviously we had many people die in Nottingham [and] Nottinghamshire earlier in the year and we don't want to add to that number with many more deaths as a result of this."" Mr Mellen also said the level of financial support from the government - which is to cover additional track and trace costs, enforcement and extra support to affected businesses - is ""not enough"". He said he did not feel Nottingham had been ""fully funded by the government, and we do believe that if we do a really good job on track and trace, which is absolutely necessary, it will cost us more than what is being offered"". ""We tried to argue for more money, but the kind of formula that's been applied in four other [local] authority areas wasn't going to be changed for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire."" Jason Weston from Ye Olde Salutation Inn said it was ""looking very, very dark"" for the pub Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood criticised the government for what she said was ""woeful"" communication over the move into the toughest restrictions. ""It's more than a week since Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock said they were talking to [Nottinghamshire] about going into tier three, yet talks didn't even begin until Thursday and MPs weren't even briefed until Friday,""she tweeted,external. Jason Weston, who runs Ye Olde Salutation Inn in the centre of Nottingham, said he will not have to close because the pub serves meals, but with capacity already down to 20% of what it was in summer because of the 22:00 curfew he said it was ""almost irrelevant"" whether they were allowed to open or not. ""I'm very worried,"" he said. ""We're watching the bank balance go down week by week - it's looking very, very dark."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

A third of Post Office cash machines to closeThe move raises concerns that rural and deprived communities face being cut off from access to cash.,"The Post Office is to cut a third of its cash machines in the next 18 months with 600 ATMs to be shut by March 2022. The move has raised concerns that rural and deprived communities face being cut off from access to cash. ATMs set for closure are little-used and have other free cash facilities close by, the Post Office said. It added that in areas where it is closing cash machines, customers can still withdraw cash over the counter free of charge. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, said the business was keeping 60 non-commercially viable ATMs ""to serve the community's needs"". Currently the Post Office does not run any of the cash machines at its branches; they are operated by Bank of Ireland, which is pulling out of the business. That has prompted the review, which will mean closing 600 ATMs, while the Post Office has said it will spend Â£16m to maintain and upgrade other machines. Will we be getting our cash from shops, not ATMs? Could churches double up as bank branches in cash-stricken areas? It said by mid-2023 all ATMs it keeps will be replaced with new devices that have the latest cash dispensing technology and security measures. ""This is one of the largest investment programmes in the free to use ATM market for over a decade,"" said Mr Kearsley. The Post Office will also become a member of the Link ATM network. Cash use has declined sharply during the coronavirus pandemic, with many businesses asking customers to pay by alternatives such as cards. Correspondingly the use of cash machines has slumped. In central London it has fallen by up to 80%, according to figures published by Link, the cash machine network. Across the UK, cash machine withdrawals between April and September fell by 48% compared to the same time last year. In London and Westminster the number of withdrawals dropped 81%, while there were 71% fewer in Saffron Walden and Glasgow Central. ""Every city, town and village has a different story,"" said Link's head of financial inclusion Nick Quin. ""In places like city centres, it's less busy overall, so there are fewer people using ATMs. ""In some rural areas, though, there have been fewer tourists or perhaps the local shop, where the ATM is hosted, temporarily closed."" There are currently 42,000 free-to-use ATMs across the UK and 13,000 charging ATMs. In the early stages of the pandemic around 7,200 ATMs closed. These were mainly in premises that shut due to government restrictions, such as shops, airports, garden centres, pubs, or they were closed for social distancing purposes, such as at train stations and supermarkets. By the end of September more than half of them had reopened. ""What's clear is that there are places around the country, where more people rely on cash,"" said Link's Nick Quin. ""They're often some of the most deprived places in the country. That's important because while there are more people who prefer to use cards and shop online, there are a lot of people out there where digital payments still don't work."" The Access to Cash Review revealed eight million people were at risk in the UK from the demise of cash. New trials planned for cash-stricken communities The town with one cash machine for 8,000 people ""Our research demonstrates that the majority of people are uncomfortable at the pace at which we are moving towards a cashless society,"" said David Fagleman, from financial consultancy Enryo. ""Not everyone is comfortable with making digital payments and we have to ensure that the rush to digitise does not leave people behind. Cash is still a very important payment method."" But going cashless also has benefits, said Amy Gavin from fintech consultancy 11:FS. ""Electronic payments are faster, some feel safer not carrying cash around, and electronic payments can also help consumers with budgeting."" However, she added: ""It remains true that a reduction in cash use in society disproportionately negatively impacts its most vulnerable segments - such as older people and those with very low incomes who use cash to manage their budgets."" The government has proposed to legislate to protect cash and one option is for cashback to become more widely available in shops. Will we be getting our cash from shops, not ATMs?

Jack Ma's Ant Group eyes record $34bn market debut,"Jack Ma's Ant shares are reportedly worth $17bn Chinese financial technology giant Ant Group looks set to make the world's largest stock market debut. Ant, backed by Jack Ma, billionaire founder of e-commerce platform Alibaba, is to sell shares worth about $34.4bn (Â£26.5bn) on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets. Advisers to Ant set the share price on Monday amid reports of very strong demand from major investors. The previous largest debut was Saudi Aramco's $29.4bn float last December. Ant, an online payments business, is only selling about 11% of its shares. But the pricing values the whole business at about $313bn. Mr Ma's Ant shares are reportedly worth about $17bn, taking his net worth to close to $80bn and confirming him as China's richest man. Ant runs Alipay, the dominant online payment system in China, where cash, cheques and credit cards have long been eclipsed by e-payment devices and apps. In fact, Alipay says the total volume of payments on its platforms in China for the year ending in June was a massive $17.6tn. According to Alibaba's most recent annual report, Alipay has 1.3 billion users. Most are in China, with the rest coming from its nine e-wallet partners elsewhere in Asia. Ant also offers wealth management, insurance and money transfer services. The company is expected to make its dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong next week, underlining the latter exchange's growing importance as a financing hub. Hong Kong will stay a key financial hub say experts The Trump administration has threatened to limit Chinese firms' access to US capital markets, a move that is part of the long-running trade row between Washington and Beijing. In response, China called on its flagship tech giants to list on domestic stock markets. Chinese tech firms, including NetEase and JD.Com, have already raised billions by selling their shares via the Hong Kong stock market. According to the Bloomberg news agency, Mr Ma told a conference in China on Saturday that the flotation would be of huge significance for Shanghai and Hong Kong. ""This was the first time such a big listing, the largest in human history, was priced outside New York City,"" he told the Bund Summit. ""We wouldn't have dared to think about it five years, or even three years ago,"" said Mr Ma. Major investors to have signed up to the share offering ahead of flotation, scheduled for 5 November, include Singapore state investor Temasek Holding and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds GIC and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Analysts said the flotation offered investors a chance to secure a slice of Asia's fast-growing tech sector. ""Digital commerce and infrastructure platforms in Asia provide an unprecedented opportunity for Asian and global investors to be part of the next wave of value creation in Asia,"" said Varun Mittal, an emerging markets expert at consultancy EY, in Singapore. ""Earlier this year, India saw a rush of international investors keen to invest in infrastructure and platforms ecosystem, which is being replicated in the Chinese ecosystem now.""

'Generation Covid' hit hard by the pandemic,"Young people, particularly those from deprived backgrounds, have had their earnings and job prospects hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, adding to fears for the long-term impact on their futures. BBC Panorama found people aged 16-25 were more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job, while six in 10 saw their earnings fall, according to new research. It also highlighted the impact of school closures on young people and added to growing evidence that students from poorer backgrounds have fallen behind their more privileged peers. A quarter of pupils - some 2.5 million children - had no schooling or tutoring during lockdown, the survey by the London School of Economics (LSE) suggests. But, the study adds, nearly three quarters of private school pupils had full days of teaching (74%) - almost twice the proportion of state school pupils (38%). Lockdown had 'major impact' on mental health 'This pandemic has left me with nothing job wise' Young people 'most likely to lose job' in lockdown The study's authors warn it could lead to poorer pupils suffering ""permanent 'educational scarring'"" when it comes to key academic milestones such as exams and securing a university place. Sixteen-year-old Roberta, who was working towards her GCSEs when lockdown came, says she did not get the ""closure"" of taking her exams and got no education or support from her school in the six months of lockdown. Roberta says it has been a struggle to keep up with her peers from privately educated backgrounds In September, she started at a new, highly competitive school in London - the Harris Westminster sixth form - which aims to provide a ""life-changing education"" for bright but disadvantaged students. ""That break of six months did so much damage,"" she says. ""Usually I'd be able to be sitting for hours and be able to revise and really absorb it in my mind. ""Now I get kind of restless after one or two hours."" Out of the 325 students in Roberta's year group, a third are from deprived backgrounds and 20 were previously privately educated. Although Roberta is now back in the classroom and adapting to life in Year 12, she says it has been ""stressful"" trying to keep up with her peers from privately educated backgrounds. ""I think coming into this school, I didn't realise the disparity would be this big in the classroom. There are people that don't know anything and people that know almost the whole content. ""You can tell who will do well in their A-levels, and who isn't. And where will I be?"" And even though schools like Roberta's are doing their best to make sure their students don't miss out, four in 10 pupils across the UK are still not getting the same number of teaching hours as they did before lockdown. Rasheed Graham from north-west London also feels his future is now hanging in the balance due to Covid-19. The 23-year-old had secured a place on a fully-funded pilot's training course, before the coronavirus outbreak brought it to a halt. This video can not be played Rasheed lost his fully funded place on a pilots training course due to the pandemic Rasheed was told the flying school was closing and the airline could not afford to fund the training anymore. In order to continue, he needs to find Â£60,000 to cover the costs. ""This is why the cadetship is worth its weight in gold, because if you don't come from wealth or money, it gives you the opportunity to pursue a career as a pilot if you didn't have the means before,"" he told Panorama. Rasheed is trying to crowd fund the money to pay for his course and has raised almost Â£22,000 so far. ""This could work out or it couldn't. I've actually accepted both eventualities,"" he says. ""But I'd rather look back and realise that I'd tried to do something to return to flight training than sit back, and let the opportunity go by."" Unsurprisingly, the upheaval and uncertainty created by the pandemic has also taken a toll on young people's mental health. Research conducted by theSamaritans and the University of Glasgow foundyoung adults (18-29 years) were more likely to report depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts than older people. Kiylee White-Lee, assistant principal at Harris Westminster sixth form told Panorama: ""We've seen a massive increase in students with anxiety and not just anxiety about the future, but having things like sensory overload of being back in a situation where you're surrounded by people. ""We've seen a big increase in students with eating disorders this year. And increase in depression as well. So, we've had to, where possible, direct them to the nursing and the counselling, but within the first two weeks, those two things were completely saturated, pretty much,"" she said. ""Schools will still go on educating young people. That's what we're here to do but we're not in the bedroom with them, checking in on them, checking that they're okay, checking that there's somebody at home looking after them. ""It's hard to switch off from that. How do you switch off from worrying about 600 students that you know need you?"" The Department for Education said it is giving every school more money and has provided Â£58m to help schools with the extra costs of Covid while the Department for Work and Pensions said its plan for jobs focuses on supporting people in need. It includes the Kickstart scheme, offering the minimum wage for six months work experience, and an investment in apprenticeships, traineeships and work coaches. With coronavirus cases rising and London now under England's ""high"" tier two restrictions, Roberta's future feels even more uncertain - but she is still hopeful. ""I don't know how the future's going to pan out but perhaps society can come out better than we were before,"" she says.

"Jack Ma's Ant Group eyes record $34bn market debutThe Chinese firm is set for the biggest public share offering ever, eclipsing Saudi Aramco's $29bn flotation.Business","Jack Ma's Ant shares are reportedly worth $17bn Chinese financial technology giant Ant Group looks set to make the world's largest stock market debut. Ant, backed by Jack Ma, billionaire founder of e-commerce platform Alibaba, is to sell shares worth about $34.4bn (Â£26.5bn) on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets. Advisers to Ant set the share price on Monday amid reports of very strong demand from major investors. The previous largest debut was Saudi Aramco's $29.4bn float last December. Ant, an online payments business, is only selling about 11% of its shares. But the pricing values the whole business at about $313bn. Mr Ma's Ant shares are reportedly worth about $17bn, taking his net worth to close to $80bn and confirming him as China's richest man. Ant runs Alipay, the dominant online payment system in China, where cash, cheques and credit cards have long been eclipsed by e-payment devices and apps. In fact, Alipay says the total volume of payments on its platforms in China for the year ending in June was a massive $17.6tn. According to Alibaba's most recent annual report, Alipay has 1.3 billion users. Most are in China, with the rest coming from its nine e-wallet partners elsewhere in Asia. Ant also offers wealth management, insurance and money transfer services. The company is expected to make its dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong next week, underlining the latter exchange's growing importance as a financing hub. Hong Kong will stay a key financial hub say experts The Trump administration has threatened to limit Chinese firms' access to US capital markets, a move that is part of the long-running trade row between Washington and Beijing. In response, China called on its flagship tech giants to list on domestic stock markets. Chinese tech firms, including NetEase and JD.Com, have already raised billions by selling their shares via the Hong Kong stock market. According to the Bloomberg news agency, Mr Ma told a conference in China on Saturday that the flotation would be of huge significance for Shanghai and Hong Kong. ""This was the first time such a big listing, the largest in human history, was priced outside New York City,"" he told the Bund Summit. ""We wouldn't have dared to think about it five years, or even three years ago,"" said Mr Ma. Major investors to have signed up to the share offering ahead of flotation, scheduled for 5 November, include Singapore state investor Temasek Holding and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds GIC and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Analysts said the flotation offered investors a chance to secure a slice of Asia's fast-growing tech sector. ""Digital commerce and infrastructure platforms in Asia provide an unprecedented opportunity for Asian and global investors to be part of the next wave of value creation in Asia,"" said Varun Mittal, an emerging markets expert at consultancy EY, in Singapore. ""Earlier this year, India saw a rush of international investors keen to invest in infrastructure and platforms ecosystem, which is being replicated in the Chinese ecosystem now.""

A third of Post Office cash machines to close,"The Post Office is to cut a third of its cash machines in the next 18 months with 600 ATMs to be shut by March 2022. The move has raised concerns that rural and deprived communities face being cut off from access to cash. ATMs set for closure are little-used and have other free cash facilities close by, the Post Office said. It added that in areas where it is closing cash machines, customers can still withdraw cash over the counter free of charge. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, said the business was keeping 60 non-commercially viable ATMs ""to serve the community's needs"". Currently the Post Office does not run any of the cash machines at its branches; they are operated by Bank of Ireland, which is pulling out of the business. That has prompted the review, which will mean closing 600 ATMs, while the Post Office has said it will spend Â£16m to maintain and upgrade other machines. Will we be getting our cash from shops, not ATMs? Could churches double up as bank branches in cash-stricken areas? It said by mid-2023 all ATMs it keeps will be replaced with new devices that have the latest cash dispensing technology and security measures. ""This is one of the largest investment programmes in the free to use ATM market for over a decade,"" said Mr Kearsley. The Post Office will also become a member of the Link ATM network. Cash use has declined sharply during the coronavirus pandemic, with many businesses asking customers to pay by alternatives such as cards. Correspondingly the use of cash machines has slumped. In central London it has fallen by up to 80%, according to figures published by Link, the cash machine network. Across the UK, cash machine withdrawals between April and September fell by 48% compared to the same time last year. In London and Westminster the number of withdrawals dropped 81%, while there were 71% fewer in Saffron Walden and Glasgow Central. ""Every city, town and village has a different story,"" said Link's head of financial inclusion Nick Quin. ""In places like city centres, it's less busy overall, so there are fewer people using ATMs. ""In some rural areas, though, there have been fewer tourists or perhaps the local shop, where the ATM is hosted, temporarily closed."" There are currently 42,000 free-to-use ATMs across the UK and 13,000 charging ATMs. In the early stages of the pandemic around 7,200 ATMs closed. These were mainly in premises that shut due to government restrictions, such as shops, airports, garden centres, pubs, or they were closed for social distancing purposes, such as at train stations and supermarkets. By the end of September more than half of them had reopened. ""What's clear is that there are places around the country, where more people rely on cash,"" said Link's Nick Quin. ""They're often some of the most deprived places in the country. That's important because while there are more people who prefer to use cards and shop online, there are a lot of people out there where digital payments still don't work."" The Access to Cash Review revealed eight million people were at risk in the UK from the demise of cash. New trials planned for cash-stricken communities The town with one cash machine for 8,000 people ""Our research demonstrates that the majority of people are uncomfortable at the pace at which we are moving towards a cashless society,"" said David Fagleman, from financial consultancy Enryo. ""Not everyone is comfortable with making digital payments and we have to ensure that the rush to digitise does not leave people behind. Cash is still a very important payment method."" But going cashless also has benefits, said Amy Gavin from fintech consultancy 11:FS. ""Electronic payments are faster, some feel safer not carrying cash around, and electronic payments can also help consumers with budgeting."" However, she added: ""It remains true that a reduction in cash use in society disproportionately negatively impacts its most vulnerable segments - such as older people and those with very low incomes who use cash to manage their budgets."" The government has proposed to legislate to protect cash and one option is for cashback to become more widely available in shops. Will we be getting our cash from shops, not ATMs?

Covid-19: Welsh Government updateDetails and reaction to today's televised briefing by Health Minister Vaughan Gething.WalesMan appears in court on Sala flight chargesDavid Henderson denies offences related to the plane crash which killed footballer Emiliano Sala.Wales,"Another six people have died with Covid-19 in Wales and there are 1,158 new confirmed cases, Public Health Wales said on Monday Health Minister Vaughan Gething says a Cardiff supermarket was wrong to tell a woman she was not allowed to buy sanitary products during lockdown The Tesco store in St Mellons later said the aisle had actually been closed off because of a break-in It comes as ministers review the rules stopping supermarkets from selling non-essential items during lockdown The ban prompts the biggest-ever petition to the Senedd, with more than 60,000 people objecting Hit West End shows may not return to the Wales Millennium Centre without a Covid-19 vaccine, the venue's artistic director warns Catherine Evans, Lola Mayor and Andy Roberts That's all from us on today's live page - thanks for joining us for
the latest developments on coronavirus in Wales. The main stories so far on Monday:  Until the next live blog, stay up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Six more people have died and 1,158 have tested positive for Covid-19 in Wales, according to Public Health Wales. It brings the number of deaths since the pandemic started to 1,783. There has been a total of 43,839 confirmed cases in Wales. England's voucher scheme does not cover school holidays, but ones in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do. Read more here. Wales's health minister has condemned the ""irresponsible
behaviour"" of those who were filmed tearing down covers over
non-essential items in supermarkets over the weekend. Vaughan Gething added that ""people giving them
encouragement and a platform to do so with the divisive sort of political
messaging we've seen need to take a step back."" He said such actions were ""making life very
difficult for shop workers. They deserve to be treated with more respect."" Supermarkets have been told to close parts of their stores that sell items such as clothes, bedding and toys during Wales' firebreak lockdown. The policy has been criticised in a petition signed by more than 60,000 people. Retailers have called the rules confusing, and say banning people from buying certain items sets a dangerous precedent. Opposition politicians have called the guidelines ""absolute madness"" and badly communicated, as Wales faces another two weeks of restrictions. First Minister Mark Drakeford said implementation of the rules may be tweaked, but it would not be reversed. This video can not be played What do shoppers think of the firebreak rules? Labour has attacked the UK government's decision toreinstate VAT on personal protective equipment (PPE)such as face masks as ""unbelievable"". The party says reintroducing the tax - which was suspended in May - could cost families nearly Â£100 over six months. Face masks are mandatory in places such as shops to slow the spread of Covid. The UK government said: ""The VAT relief was designed to accelerate supply of PPE to the health and social care sectors... when they needed it most."" And a spokesperson said the government had committed to provide free PPE for Covid-19 needs to adult social care until March 2021. Last week was ""one of the deadliest"" in Wales since the pandemic started, the health minister told today's press briefing. More than 60 people died with Covid-19 over a seven-day period, said Vaughan Gething. He added that a further six deaths would be reported by Public Health Wales later today. There are also 616 confirmed cases of patients with coronavirus in Welsh hospitals,the highest figure since May 24and up 26% on last Sunday. Fifty-six people are in critical care in Wales with Covid-19, an increase of 14%. ""This is not an easy time for any of us in Wales,"" Mr Gething said. ""For the next two weeks, we must all live with a new and very tough set of regulations."" Plaid Cymru's leader has called for
""humility"" from the Welsh Government to admit they ""have
made a complete mess of the messaging"" aroundbanning the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets. Adam Price said poor communication had ""eroded public trust"" over the weekend. But he did not support a change in the
policy, calling instead for ministers to push the public health reasoning
behind the decision. Mr Price told BBC Wales: ""The
objective of closing non-essential retail for this period is to try to limit
the number of contacts so they can limit the number of infections, and that's
somehow got completely lost in the messaging. ""If they'd had the conversations with
the retail sector earlier, so we heard from the minister that they had a
meeting on Thursday, I would suggest that was too late. ""That has eroded public trust over the
weekend and obviously that is concerning because it's the public support, the
public health message is ultimately the one thing that keeps us all safe."" The Plaid leader also accused the Conservatives of being
""opportunistic"" in their criticism of the policy. Mr Price said: ""You've got to do it in a constructive way and not in a way, I
think, is doing it for party political advantage and having the effect of
eroding public trust in the public health policy as a whole."" The public should""respond sensibly""to the latest lockdown restrictions and ""think of others"", the Archbishop of Wales has said. The Most Reverend John Davies also expressed his hope Christmas ""in some form"" can be celebrated this year. The archbishop told the BBC'sPolitics Walesprogramme: ""It's very, very easy to knock people who are in government, at whatever level, when things are difficult. ""I think that everybody at every level is really trying to do their very best in what are immensely unexpected and difficult circumstances."" He appealed to all governments to ""act with people in the greatest need at the forefront of their minds, to understand just how stressful, debilitating, frightening it can be to be in the situation that we see so many people in."" The archbishop said the Welsh Government'sdecision to introduce a new national lockdown""wasn't unexpected"" but that it was nevertheless ""disappointing"". Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said supermarkets have discretion to sell non-essential items to customers ""in genuine need"" during the firebreak lockdown. He said Welsh Government ministers were meeting retailers on Monday afternoon to review the regulations and guidance and ensure ""that it is being applied fairly and consistently"". ""If there are anomalies, we will look at whether the guidance needs to be revised or strengthened to make it clear that supermarkets have some discretion to sell to people who are in genuine need,"" Mr Gething said. He added that to ""unravel"" the effectiveness of the firebreak now would make it ""a less effective measure"". ""That's not what this government is going to do,"" he said. Shoppers
and retailers should use âcommon senseâ in the âvery small numberâ of cases
where there is a genuine need to buy a non-essential item in a supermarket, according to Wales' health minister. Most
people would âbe able to manageâ during the two-week lockdown, Vaughan Gething said. He confirmed that supermarket chains will be given âsome discretionâ on the rules. Mr Gething said: âThe point about discretion is we do recognise there have been
exceptional circumstances. ""They have been well advertised and talked-about
examples of people who really do have a desperate need to buy individual items
and itâs about that. âSo
you can either have an approach where you do rely on peopleâs common sense and
ability to talk to retailers about what really is an emergency and make sure
thatâs provided, rather than being deaf to the real concerns and complaints
that a very small number of people would go through, through these next two
weeks."" The health minister added that people's compliance with the rules would ""avoid the much greater hardship and much greater interruption to
peopleâs lives and their ability to still see family and friends in the
futureâ. A senior Welsh Conservative has called for the ban on supermarket sales of non-essential goods to ""be dropped today"". Health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said the ""chaos and confusion"" ofa woman incorrectly told she was not allowed to buy sanitary products at a supermarketwas a direct result of the ban. ""This ludicrous policy has caused real anger, and it's not fair on staff working in our supermarkets and the general Welsh public who are now at their wits' end with Labour ministers,"" Mr Davies said. ""The Welsh Labour Government has rushed out a policy that was not even understood by the country's largest supermarket and that's the fault of the First Minister and his colleagues."" Supermarkets in Wales have had to cover up or block off shelves stocked with non-essential goods Ending the restrictions on the sale of non-essential items will give ""more people more reasons to leave the house"", Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething told Monday's press conference the rules are in place to ""interrupt the chain of transmission and reduce the harm the virus is causing"". He added that allowing supermarkets to sell non-essential goods would be ""unfair"" to smaller retailers. Mr Gething also said that public health advice would need to be revisited if non-essential retail is allowed to reopen. ""I certainly don't want to be in a position where we have to roll back on the choice we've made - that's the shortest possible intervention to make the maximum difference,"" he said. ""We looked at a package of measures to keep Wales safe. That was the advice we had, that was the advice that we published, and we've acted on that advice. ""If we want to unravel that now, we'll be in a very different place, a less effective measure, and that's not what this government is going to do. ""It's about how we make the rules we have effective, clear, consistently applied and how we all act together, to keep well safe, and to save lives"". More lockdown measures are âpossibleâ in the future, Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething was asked at the press briefing whether it was""likely"" that Wales would face another lockdown in the new yearas Deputy Economy and Transport Minister Lee Waters told BBC Radio Wales on Sunday. Mr Gething said: âNone of us can say what's likely. âWe want to have a national pattern for all of us to live our lives by to get to the end of the year. âWeâll need to look at what's happening through that time, weâll need to revise and look at where we are as we get thereâ. Mr Gething added:  âMeasures are possible for the future but that depends on how successful we are in coming together as a nation."" Wales' health minister is ""genuinely
concerned"" about the effects of the ongoing debate over non-essential retail. Vaughan Gething said it had
""taken us away from the reason why the firebreak has been
introduced"". ""It is important that people trust in what the
government is doing and why,"" he said. ""The weekend's messages have moved us away from the
reality of the mounting death toll that we're seeing and the fact that we will
see more harm coming over the next two weeks. ""The package of measures we put in place included the
closure of non-essential retail as one of the elements that makes up what we're
trying to do to save lives. ""That's the message we all need to reflect on
and remember as we go about our choices, as we go about the next few
weeks."" Boris Johnson has defended his refusal to extend free school meals for children in England over the half-term holiday, saying he was ""very proud"" of the government's support so far. ""I totally understand the issue of holiday hunger,"" the prime minister said. ""The debate is, how do you deal with it."" He said the UK government will ""do everything in our power to make sure that no kid, no child goes hungry"". Pressure has risen on the PM, including from his own MPs, to rethink the issue. Mr Johnson also said he had not spoken to footballer Marcus Rashford - who has been leading a high-profile campaign to extend free school meals into the holidays - since the summer. The Welsh and Scottish governments have both promised to make provision during the holidays for children entitled to free school meals. Travelling to see friends or family because of a bereavement is a ""reasonable measure"" to take during the short lockdown period, Wales' health minister has said. But Vaughan Gething said that people doing so should ""respect the rules on social distancing"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's press briefing, he added: ""What I wouldn't want to see is people gathering to support each other - in circumstances where they've lost a loved one - potentially being a meeting where they spread coronavirus with that much greater harm. ""I don't want to see a further loss of life. That's why we've had to change the rules, that's why the firebreak is in place."" Hit West End shows may not return to the Wales Millennium Centre before there is a Covid-19 vaccine, the venue has warned. Visiting tours of The Lion King and Phantom of the Opera to Cardiff have been cancelledas the Â£125m venue, which shut in March, remains closed. Artistic director Graeme Farrow said it hoped to stage ""test events"" with about 150 people in the audience in January. However he said the venue cannot ""flick a switch"" and fill a 1,800 capacity hall. Productions were cancelled when the UK shut down because of the Covid-19 crisis in March, and the WMC remains shut to the general public ""until April 2021 at the earliest"". The Lion King is among the shows which were due to visit Cardiff Tesco were âsimply wrongâ totell a woman she could not buy period products during lockdown, Wales' health minister has said. The supermarket has since apologised and admitted it had incorrectly applied rules that say they can only sell essential items until November 9. It later said an area of its store in St
Mellons, Cardiff had been cordoned off due to a break-in. The issue has prompted protests and calls
for the Senedd to be recalled. Speaking at a Welsh Government briefing, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said meetings would be held with
the supermarkets this afternoon to make clear they could use âsome discretionâ
to sell non-essentials to those in âgenuine needâ. He said he was âvery sorryâ a woman was
wrongly told sanitary products could not be sold. âThis is simply wrong,â Mr Gething said. âItâs an incorrect reading of both the regulations and the guidance. And Iâm
very sorry this woman was given this information.â During the lockdown supermarkets are
unable to sell items other high-street stores canât provide as they have been
told to close. Tesco later said the aisle in question had been cordoned off due to a break-in People in Wales have been told to stay at home during the nation's17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown. The major restrictions to people's lives will last until Monday 9 November. Pubs, bars and restaurants, gyms, and all non-essential shops have been made to close.

North and South Lanarkshire are being considered for the harshest coronavirus restrictions, according to the Scottish government, ahead of a parliamentary debate onScotland's new five-tier Covid restrictionson Tuesday.

They are the only local authorities in the country where the ""level of concern"" is such that the highest level of restrictions could be imposed. Read more here. A further 20,890 coronavirus cases have been recorded across the UK in the past 24 hours, according tothe latest government figures,external, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 894,690. The government also announced a further 102 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It brings the total UK death toll to 44,998. The figures compare to 19,790 cases and 151 deaths reported on Sunday.

The debate over whether the government should provide food for pupils who are eligible for free school meals over the half-term holiday is rumbling on, withthe prime minister standing by his refusal to do so. The government did step in over the summer holidays after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford, agreeing it was fair to do so as pupils had not been at school during term time because of the coronavirus pandemic. As you can see from the chart below, many of the areas with the highest percentage of pupils eligible for the support are also those in the higher tiers of restrictions, with Knowsley, Manchester and now Nottingham among those in the very high level. Nottingham has consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in England More now on the move into tier three restrictions for Nottingham and surrounding areas.

They confirm there will be additional rules to the standard tier three baseline measures ""specific to these areas of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire"". A package of financial support, similar to those secured in other areas of the country in tier three, has been agreed to help residents and businesses who will be impacted by the new restrictions. Read more about the move here. Nottingham, Broxtowe, Gedling and Rushcliffe council areas are to move to tier three coronavirus restrictions following discussions between government and council leaders.

Rotherham Hospital has 96 patients who have tested positive for the virus, as of this morning, compared to 78 at the height of the first wave. A spokesman for Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust said six in-patients are in critical care. It comes after Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said the number ofpatients with coronavirus admitted to its hospitals had doubled in a week. It said if rates continued to rise then it would, in the next two weeks, have more patients than at any point during the pandemic. Both Rotherham and Doncaster, along with Sheffield and Barnsley and other parts of South Yorkshire,entered the strictest tier of coronavirus restrictions at the weekendamid concerns over rising cases in the area. Normally at this time of year families will be making plans for a last holiday before winter grips the country but this year, amid the coronavirus pandemic, things are very different.

Toymakers are expecting strong sales during the critical end-of-year festive season aftera pandemic-fuelled surge in demand for items such as Barbies and board games. Hasbro, the maker of games such as Monopoly and Jenga, told investors earlier today that it was poised for a ""good holiday season"". The forecast followed rival Mattel's report last week of its biggest sales jump in a decade, as its Barbie dolls hit their highest quarterly sales since 2003. The gains have come as families buy toys and games in an attempt to fend off boredom amid coronavirus lockdowns. ""The toy industry as a whole grew meaningfully and continues to demonstrate its resilience in challenging economic times,"" said Mattel chief executive Ynon Kreiz. In the first nine months of the year, Hasbro sales grew 13% from 2019 - bucking the wider plunge in consumer spending around the world. At Mattel, sales are down 2% from 2019 - but some brands, such as Barbie, are having their strongest run in years. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Letnany, near Prague, is now home to a field hospital, built by the army in just seven days The Czech Republic was praised for its swift response to the coronavirus crisis back in spring, but seven months on it's now recording 15,000 new cases a day and has the second highest per capita death rate over seven days in the world. Colonel Ladislav Slechta, a commander in the Czech Army, has just overseen the building of a field hospital. He is used to building such hospitals in Afghanistan or Iraq. Not on the outskirts of Prague. ""There's no time at this moment to think about emotions. But I'm sure they're coming, because it's really an unusual situation,"" he told me. ""We were discussing it, and going back in history, we think the last time this type of facility was deployed in this country was during the First World War."" So what went wrong? Thousands of people celebrated the end of coronavirus in the city of Prague in the summer Czech efforts to fight the virus haven't been helped by the man who wrote the rules being caught in the act of breaking them. Czech Health Minister Roman Prymula says he will resign as soon as his successor is named, after the tabloid Blesk published a late-night photograph of him emerging maskless from a restaurant, holding his wallet. All pubs and restaurants are supposed to be closed to customers, and can only provide hatch service until 8pm. Read more from Rob here. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check In the closing days of the US election campaign, President
Trumpâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic has become a major issue. One significant point of contention has been the wearing of
face coverings - something some supporters of the president have often been unwilling
to do, notably at his rallies. Posts shared thousands of times on Facebook are falsely
claiming that Dr Anthony Fauci, Americaâs top infectious disease expert - who
strongly recommends that people wear face coverings - once wrote a paper saying face
masks led to mass deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic. However, the posts cite a report co-authored by Dr Fauci in
2008 which makes absolutely no mention of masks. The study found the majority of deaths during the 1918
pandemic were not caused by the virus alone but that most victims succumbed to
bacterial pneumonia following the influenza infection. Dr Fauci, who has frequently questioned President Trump's
handling of the pandemic, has beentargeted by misinformation campaigns before. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said infection rates have been rising and it was time ""to take action"" in Warrington, which has been moved into England's top tier of coronavirus restrictions. The area, in north-west England, will join Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, Lancashire and Liverpool City region in tier three from tomorrow. Under tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres and soft play areas will also have to close in Warrington, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the Cheshire town, which is home to about 210,000 people. The restrictions will be reviewed in 28 days' time. The
government will provide a financial support package of Â£1.68m to Warrington, as well as
Â£4.2m in business support funding. Here's more detail about the different restrictions around the UK. The UK government has confirmed Warrington, in north-west England, will move into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. The new measures will come into force from tomorrow. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has reported a record number of daily new coronavirus cases. Officials say 17,347 people have tested positive over the past 24 hours, binging the total tally in Russia to 1,531,224. With 219 further deaths recorded, the total Covid-19 death toll now stands at 26,269. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The pandemic is now hitting the regions east of Moscow. It is true that the situation is quite difficult... It requires incredibly energetic efforts on the part of the
federal government and regional governments."" It come as the authorities across Russia
have been introducing new, stricter measures, including:  If you are just joining us, welcome, here is a round-up of the main developments so far today: Bonfire Night is fast approaching in the UK, but with many public firework displays being cancelled this year due to social
distancing measures, a dogs charity is asking people to be considerate if they decide to put on private displays in their gardens. The Dogs Trust said: âDogs have approximately four times
more sensitive hearing than humans, so the loud cracks and bangs of fireworks
can often be a terrifying experience for them. Fireworks also tend to be
sudden, unpredictable and bright. This combination can be distressing and have
a lasting impact on dogs. ""This
year, dog owners are faced with the added worry that more fireworks will be set
off in the local neighbourhood due to large-scale gatherings being cancelled."" The charity advises people wishing to hold a private display to choose quieter fireworks, limit the display to 30 minutes or less, and let dog owners in neighbouring homes know in advance. Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Several hospitals in Belgium have requested that doctors and nurses who test positive for Covid-19, continue to work if they have no symptoms. The decision has been made by 10 hospitals in Liege, which are dealing with a surge in coronavirus admissions. The city is one of the worst affected areas of Europe and hospitals have started transferring patients elsewhere and cancelled all non-urgent surgery. The situation is exacerbated by a lack of doctors and nurses available. A quarter of medical staff in Liege are reported to be off work with Covid-19. But another 10% of staff who have tested positive but are asymptomic have been asked to continue working. The president of the Belgian Association of Medical Unions, Dr Philippe Devos, acknowledged the obvious risk of transferring the virus to patients, but says theyâve been left with no choice in order to avoid the hospital system collapsing within days.

The protesters want the government to provide more funding to support the sector. In July, the government announced a package of Â£1.57bn for the struggling arts sector. It is one of many protests from those in the industry to have taken place during the outbreak, withmusiciansandtheatre workersalso protesting outside Parliament earlier this month.  Some of the dancers wore ""I am Fatima"" t-shirts, which referenceda widely-criticised government-backed advertfrom earlier this month which suggested a ballet dancer should retrain. The ad pictured a dancer - ""Fatima"" - and encouraged her to give up on dancing and ""reskill"" in cyber security. The ad was pulled after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden disowned it. Â© 2025 BBC.

Turkey's Erdogan urges boycott of French goods,"Mr Erdogan's calls for a boycott come after months of rising tensions between France and Turkey Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on Turks to boycott French goods amid a row over France's tougher stance on radical Islam. In a televised speech, he urged world leaders to protect Muslims ""if there is oppression against Muslims in France"". Mr Erdogan has angrily criticised French President Emmanuel Macron for pledging to defend secularism against radical Islam. It comes after a teacher was killed for showing Prophet Muhammad cartoons. Samuel Paty was beheaded on 16 October by 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov outside Paris, after presenting the images to his pupils during a class about freedom of speech. Mr Macron has paid tribute to Mr Paty, and said France ""will not give up our cartoons"". Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France French Muslims fear state aims to control their faith Don't stigmatise Muslims says Macron amid veil row Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are offensive to many Muslims. But state secularism - or laÃ¯citÃ© - is central to France's national identity. Curbing freedom of expression to protect the feelings of one particular community undermines unity, the state says. Mr Erdogan called for the boycott in a televised speech on Monday. ""Never give credit to French-labelled goods, don't buy them,"" he said in the capital Ankara. He said Muslims are now ""subjected to a lynch campaign similar to that against Jews in Europe before World War II"", adding that ""European leaders should tell the French president to stop his hate campaign"". Over the weekend, Mr Erdogan said Mr Macron needed a mental health check for speaking out so forcefully on Islam -comments that caused France to recall its ambassador to Turkeyfor consultations. It came after Mr Macron pledged to defend secularism and tackle radical Islam in the wake of the killing of Mr Paty. This video can not be played Rallies have been held in Paris, Toulouse, Lyon and other French cities in support of the teacher killed, Samuel Paty Two weeks before the attack,Mr Macron described Islam as a religion ""in crisis""and announced new measures to tackle what he called ""Islamist separatism"". France has Western Europe's largest Muslim population, and some accuse the authorities of using secularism to target them. European leaders have come out in support of France. Germany expressed ""solidarity"" with Mr Macron after the Turkish president's comments, with government spokesman Steffen Seibert calling the remarks ""defamatory"" and ""completely unacceptable"" and foreign minister Heiko Maas calling Mr Erdogan's personal attacks ""a particular low point"". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the Netherlands ""stands firmly with France and for the collective values of the European Union"", while Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also expressed his ""full solidarity"" with Mr Macron. ""Personal insults do not help the positive agenda that the EU wants to pursue with Turkey,""he wrote in a tweet,external. But Turkey is not the only country to criticise Mr Macron's comments. Pakistan's Prime MinisterImran Khan accused the French president of ""attacking Islam""in a tweet on Sunday, whileFrench products have been removed from some shopsin Kuwait, Jordan and Qatar. There have also been protests in a number of countries, including Bangladesh, Iraq, Libya and Syria. A placard placed in a supermarket in Amman, Jordan tells people that French products are being boycotted Meanwhile French footballerPaul Pogba has denied reports that he planned to quit international footballover Mr Macron's comments about Islam. The Manchester United midfielder dismissed the ""total fake headlines"" in a post on Instagram and said he was taking legal action against publishers. Citing Turkey's statistical institute, Reuters news agency reports that France is the 10th biggest source of imports into Turkey. The French company Renault is reportedly one of the leading car brands by sales in the country. Mr Erdogan's calls for a boycott come after months of rising tensions between France and Turkey. While both countries are Nato members, they support differing sides inthe ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as in Libya's civil war. France suspends Nato mission role amid Turkey row The Eastern Mediterranean tinderbox Mr Macron has also clashed with Mr Erdogan over Turkish oil and gas exploration in disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean.France deployed jets and a frigate to the regionin August amid the tensions. And in January,Mr Macron accused the Turkish president of breaking a promise to stay out of the conflict in Libya.

'Generation Covid' hit hard by the pandemicPeople aged 16-25 were more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job,"Young people, particularly those from deprived backgrounds, have had their earnings and job prospects hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, adding to fears for the long-term impact on their futures. BBC Panorama found people aged 16-25 were more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job, while six in 10 saw their earnings fall, according to new research. It also highlighted the impact of school closures on young people and added to growing evidence that students from poorer backgrounds have fallen behind their more privileged peers. A quarter of pupils - some 2.5 million children - had no schooling or tutoring during lockdown, the survey by the London School of Economics (LSE) suggests. But, the study adds, nearly three quarters of private school pupils had full days of teaching (74%) - almost twice the proportion of state school pupils (38%). Lockdown had 'major impact' on mental health 'This pandemic has left me with nothing job wise' Young people 'most likely to lose job' in lockdown The study's authors warn it could lead to poorer pupils suffering ""permanent 'educational scarring'"" when it comes to key academic milestones such as exams and securing a university place. Sixteen-year-old Roberta, who was working towards her GCSEs when lockdown came, says she did not get the ""closure"" of taking her exams and got no education or support from her school in the six months of lockdown. Roberta says it has been a struggle to keep up with her peers from privately educated backgrounds In September, she started at a new, highly competitive school in London - the Harris Westminster sixth form - which aims to provide a ""life-changing education"" for bright but disadvantaged students. ""That break of six months did so much damage,"" she says. ""Usually I'd be able to be sitting for hours and be able to revise and really absorb it in my mind. ""Now I get kind of restless after one or two hours."" Out of the 325 students in Roberta's year group, a third are from deprived backgrounds and 20 were previously privately educated. Although Roberta is now back in the classroom and adapting to life in Year 12, she says it has been ""stressful"" trying to keep up with her peers from privately educated backgrounds. ""I think coming into this school, I didn't realise the disparity would be this big in the classroom. There are people that don't know anything and people that know almost the whole content. ""You can tell who will do well in their A-levels, and who isn't. And where will I be?"" And even though schools like Roberta's are doing their best to make sure their students don't miss out, four in 10 pupils across the UK are still not getting the same number of teaching hours as they did before lockdown. Rasheed Graham from north-west London also feels his future is now hanging in the balance due to Covid-19. The 23-year-old had secured a place on a fully-funded pilot's training course, before the coronavirus outbreak brought it to a halt. This video can not be played Rasheed lost his fully funded place on a pilots training course due to the pandemic Rasheed was told the flying school was closing and the airline could not afford to fund the training anymore. In order to continue, he needs to find Â£60,000 to cover the costs. ""This is why the cadetship is worth its weight in gold, because if you don't come from wealth or money, it gives you the opportunity to pursue a career as a pilot if you didn't have the means before,"" he told Panorama. Rasheed is trying to crowd fund the money to pay for his course and has raised almost Â£22,000 so far. ""This could work out or it couldn't. I've actually accepted both eventualities,"" he says. ""But I'd rather look back and realise that I'd tried to do something to return to flight training than sit back, and let the opportunity go by."" Unsurprisingly, the upheaval and uncertainty created by the pandemic has also taken a toll on young people's mental health. Research conducted by theSamaritans and the University of Glasgow foundyoung adults (18-29 years) were more likely to report depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts than older people. Kiylee White-Lee, assistant principal at Harris Westminster sixth form told Panorama: ""We've seen a massive increase in students with anxiety and not just anxiety about the future, but having things like sensory overload of being back in a situation where you're surrounded by people. ""We've seen a big increase in students with eating disorders this year. And increase in depression as well. So, we've had to, where possible, direct them to the nursing and the counselling, but within the first two weeks, those two things were completely saturated, pretty much,"" she said. ""Schools will still go on educating young people. That's what we're here to do but we're not in the bedroom with them, checking in on them, checking that they're okay, checking that there's somebody at home looking after them. ""It's hard to switch off from that. How do you switch off from worrying about 600 students that you know need you?"" The Department for Education said it is giving every school more money and has provided Â£58m to help schools with the extra costs of Covid while the Department for Work and Pensions said its plan for jobs focuses on supporting people in need. It includes the Kickstart scheme, offering the minimum wage for six months work experience, and an investment in apprenticeships, traineeships and work coaches. With coronavirus cases rising and London now under England's ""high"" tier two restrictions, Roberta's future feels even more uncertain - but she is still hopeful. ""I don't know how the future's going to pan out but perhaps society can come out better than we were before,"" she says.

Johnson refuses to move on free school meals row,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'We don't want to see children going hungry' Boris Johnson has defended his refusal to extend free school meals for children in England over the half-term holiday, saying he was ""very proud"" of the government's support so far. ""I totally understand the issue of holiday hunger,"" he said. ""The debate is, how do you deal with it."" He said the government will ""do everything in our power to make sure that no kid, no child goes hungry"". Pressure has risen on the PM, including from his own MPs, to rethink the issue. Mr Johnson also said he had not spoken to Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford - who has been leading a high-profile campaign to extend free school meals into the holidays - since the summer. Is there really no money for free school meals? Five charts on free school meals and poverty The UK government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after Rashford's campaigning, did the same for the summer holiday. But it has refused to do so again. A petition created by the England striker calling for provision to continue in the holidays had gained more than 900,000 signatures by Monday evening. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have already introduced food voucher schemes. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Readingto launch a review of hospital food,Mr Johnson said ""I totally salute and understand"" where Rashford was coming from. But he said the government was supporting families with a Universal Credit increase of Â£20 a week, introduced in April. The government also said it gave Â£63m to councils -first announced in June,external- to help people who are struggling to afford food and essentials. However, the Local Government Association said this funding was intended to be spent before the end of September and had been ""outstripped"" by demand. Mr Johnson said: ""We are very proud of the support we have given, I have said repeatedly throughout this crisis that the government will support families and businesses, jobs and livelihoods, across the country. ""We're going to continue to do that. ""We don't want to see children going hungry this winter, this Christmas, certainly not as a result of any inattention by this government - and you are not going to see that."" Downing Street doesn't want to do a U-turn; at least not in too obvious a fashion. So it isn't stumping up the cash to extend holiday food vouchers in England. But listen carefully to Boris Johnson and it's clear that he might stump up cash in other ways, for pretty much the same purpose. So, for example, could councils be given further funds to help struggling families? Then ministers can try and argue that they're simply carrying on with an existing policy that they believe is more effective. The PM was at pains today to show that he both recognises and cares about this issue. But some Tories fear that, because of cack-handed communications, Downing Street lost the PR battle on compassion days ago. One mother, Nicola Palmer from Leicestershire, said the meal vouchers had been an ""absolute lifeline"" for her family during the Easter and summer holidays. She receives Universal Credit but said that, after paying bills, she and her partner and their two children ""would be lucky"" to have Â£40 a month to live on. ""Me and my partner have been disabled. I've been disabled since 2017 with multiple sclerosis. My partner has been disabled for a lot longer than that with Crohn's disease and a few other health issues,"" she said. Ms Palmer said the vouchers helped her and her partner feed their two children when they were struggling with money She said one day last week - which was their half-term - she and her partner had no dinner at all, to make sure the children could eat. ""Yes, we are in receipt of Universal Credit, however due to our low income and having to pay for bills as well as trying to put a meal on the table, the very slight increase on this has not made any difference for us whatsoever."" Lucy Houghton, 36, from Norfolk, also relies on free school meal vouchers and saidthere are times she will not eat so her children can. ""It's going to be tough this week,"" she said. ""It's all very well businesses offering free food, but I'm in a rural location and would need fuel to get there. And it's humiliating. I hate asking for help from anybody and I know I'm not alone in that."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the government had been ""incredibly generous"" during the pandemic, with support such as wage subsidies, increases to benefits and business rates relief. He added: ""If there is still need or if this Covid crisis continues to kick in and more lockdowns happen, of course the government will look at other alternatives, or other solutions. We're not going to sit there in a static environment."" Labour said Mr Johnson's ""warm words"" would ""do nothing"" for the children at risk of going hungry this week. ""Labour will not not give up on the children and families let down by this government, and we will hold the prime minister to his word, forcing another vote in Parliament if necessary,"" said shadow education secretary Kate Green. Rashford's campaignhas led to businesses includingfish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants and cafes promising to dish out free food to eligible children over half-term, which began on Monday in many areas. And Manchester Unitedsays it will distribute 5,000 meals,external- cooked at the Old Trafford kitchen facilities - to children eligible for free school meals across Greater Manchester. Some charities have set up websites and maps allowing parents to search for places nearby providing free meals. What's happening to free school meals during holidays? MP urged to quit over 'mocking' free meals post David Pickard, head of community operations at Midland Mencap, said he expected ""hundreds"" of families to access free lunches from its community centre in Birmingham this week. Mother-of-three Aisha, who spoke to a reporter as she collected food donations from a community centre in Birmingham, said: ""I am usually really good with my budget. Their father, who I'm divorced from, usually pays for their uniforms but he got ill and he couldn't work, so I bought them this time. ""But the Â£200 I used came from money I use to pay my bills, because the school said if I brought in the receipts I could get some help from them. ""I did that - but it's been seven or eight weeks now, and I haven't heard anything back from the school, so I'm struggling."" Some councils - including several Tory-run local authorities -have promised to supply meal vouchersor food parcels for children facing hardship. Cafe staff in Liverpool prepare sandwich bags for children, as businesses offer to help Last week, Conservative MPs voted against Labour's attempt to extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling and voting for Labour's motion. Stuart Anderson, Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, saidhe had received threats and his office had been vandalisedafter he opposed the plan to offer free school meals in the holidays.

Is there really no money for free  meals?,"Marcus Rashford's campaign over the summer forced the government to U-turn on free school meals Amid the talks over Manchester's request for an extra Â£30m a month for jobs support, or indeed the tens of millions for half-term free school meals in England, and the debate over a tougher lockdown, the government and its top supporters are citing the idea that there is no money left. Certainly, this morning's public finances showed the government borrowing in the first half of the financial year at a record high, the highest levels of government debt in 60 years and the deficit this year heading for its highest ever level outside of a world war. This is before the statisticians have accounted for likely losses from tens of billions of government-guaranteed lending to businesses. September's numbers alone saw a fivefold increase in borrowing, up from Â£7.7bn last September to Â£36.1bn, driven by more spending on the furlough scheme, health and self-employment, as well as far less VAT and income taxes received. UK borrowing surges as Covid support continues How much harm would a circuit-breaker do? The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) this afternoon also published a chart showing that of the Â£262bn that the Treasury has borrowed by issuing gilts, Â£246bn has been bought by the Bank of England. The central bank has indirectly created and lent most of the extra money required by the government. Overall, the government has not had to raise the funds from the private sector or abroad. So, no, we aren't really running out of cash. The best evidence for that is that the government will indeed be announcing more borrowed money for some of its schemes in the coming days and weeks. And there is ample evidence that market demand for government debt is still strong. For example, the European Union found huge demand this week for its new ""social bonds"" to help Spain and Italy fund pandemic jobs support. However, these Bank of England purchases do, in theory, have to be sold back into the market after the crisis. With a large stock of debt, the government's finances are now very sensitive to even relatively small rises in the rate at which it borrows. It seems unlikely right now, but is far from unthinkable over the next several years. The government had already planned to borrow more to invest in infrastructure as part of its ""levelling-up agenda"". Much higher levels of spending on health and pensions are already baked in to the spending cake as society ages. So getting the public finances in shape does matter, as a medium-term priority. Right now, though, it is difficult to argue that ""no money"" is the constraint on extending free school meals, or furlough support. Particularly not on a day when it was confirmed pensions will rise by two percentage points more than inflation, at a time when average earnings are negative. The cost of that triple lock policy, just as an example, is about Â£1.5bn in extra state pension costs in the coming year, according to Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. These are political decisions to allocate money where the government feels an obligation to prioritise. How much harm would a circuit-breaker do?

School meals row continues as half-term begins,"Cafe staff in Liverpool prepare sandwich bags for children, as businesses offer to help Ministers are continuing to insist they will not fund free school meals for children at risk of going hungry in England over the half-term holiday. Many councils are providing meal vouchers, while hundreds of businesses are offering parcels to those in need. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing mounting pressure from former ministers and some Tory MPs to reverse the move. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said providing money through councils was the ""best way"" to support people. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have already introduced food voucher schemes. The UK government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after a high-profile campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford, did the same for the summer holiday. But it has refused to do so again. A petition created by the Manchester United striker calling for provision to continue in the holidays had gained nearly 870,000 signatures by Monday morning. Is there really no money for free school meals? What's happening to free school meals during holidays? 'I remember going to bed with hunger pains' Mr Hancock defended the government's refusal to budge, saying it had increased Universal Credit and allocated Â£63m to local authorities. ""Often it's councils who know best on the ground,"" he said. But the children's commissioner, Anne Longfield, said money going to local councils ""gets tied up then in processes, in distribution, in bureaucracies"", and that might not help some children. She said the beauty of the free school meals scheme ""is that it gets directly to children"", adding: ""There'll be children who are desperate for that help and that's something that really makes this a very urgent priority for Boris Johnson when he gets to his desk today."" The Conservative leader of Warwickshire County Council told the BBC they had already spent all the money allocated under the Â£63m fund -which was announced in June,external- and it was not enough to fund school meals too. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Earlier, there was also confusion about whether Mr Johnson had responded to a letter from Rashford. Asked about it on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said: ""There has been communication between the two, as far as I understand it."" When pressed further, he said: ""I understand that there has been communication but I'm obviously not in charge of the prime minister's correspondence. If there hasn't been, I'm sure that that will be followed up."" ButRashford later tweeted:,external""Hmm, unless he's referring to the call we had following the U-turn in June?"" Downing Street sources said they are not aware of any direct communication between the prime minister and Rashford since the summer, when they spoke on the phone. The footballer's campaign has recently led tobusinesses including fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants and cafespromising to dish out free food to eligible children over half-term. A cafe in Sheerness, Kent, puts out a menu for free breakfast for local children Some charities have set up websites and maps allowing parents to search for places nearby providing free meals. Cafe-owner Kim Mahony Hargreaves in Wembley, London, is providing a lunchbox with a sandwich, fruit, oat flapjack, yoghurt and apple juice to children that need it. ""My partner was a teacher and has seen first hand the impact free school meals can have on children for whom it may be the only food they eat all day,"" she said. ""Some children wouldn't even eat the food themselves but take it home for their families to share."" Mr Hancock said he had been looking at Rashford's Twitter feed - where the footballer had retweeted offers from restaurants and cafes all across he country. ""As central government, we put in extra money. The councils, they're stepping up to the plate and lots of businesses and individuals are as well. I think that's brilliant. ""I saw Marcus Rashford said what we need is collaboration, people working together. I totally agree."" A chef in a restaurant in Leeds prepares food boxes for children during half term Last week, Conservative MPs voted against Labour's attempt to extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling and voting for Labour's motion. Sir David Amess, one of those to vote against the motion for free school meals, had his constituency office of Southend West targeted on Sunday, as local people wrote messages on empty plates and left them outside. ""The situations people find themselves in are just unbearable,"" said organiser Sadie Hasler, 40, from Southend. ""The stigma that comes with maybe being a single parent, and trying to do the best thing by your child, and society just kind of constantly wants to keep elbowing you in the ribs for it."" The messages on the plates criticised the government while others read: ""I'm hungry"" Several Tory MPs oppose the government's stance. Conservative MP and former welfare minister Caroline Nokes told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour the government had to ""take another look at it"". And fellow Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said ""it would be wise"" for the government to reconsider in time for the Christmas holidays, adding it would be ""a sensible thing to do to bring people together"". Some councilshave promised to supplymeal vouchers for children facing hardship. Conservative-led Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council said it would provide food parcels for families from Monday, tweeting: ""No child should go hungry."" And Kensington and Chelsea council - which is also Tory-run - said nearly 3,300 youngsters would receive Â£15 vouchers from their schools to cover the cost of meals during the holiday, adding: ""No kid should go hungry."" Fiona Crump, owner of the Castle Beach Cafe in Falmouth, is one of several business owners to make free lunch bags during half term Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party will force a new Commons vote on the issue if the government had not changed its position before the Christmas Commons recess, saying: ""It's not too late to do the right thing."" Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible for free school meals. In England, about 1.3 million children claimed for free school meals in 2019 - about 15% of state-educated pupils.

the latest developments on coronavirus in Wales. The main stories so far on Monday:  Until the next live blog, stay up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Six more people have died and 1,158 have tested positive for Covid-19 in Wales, according to Public Health Wales. It brings the number of deaths since the pandemic started to 1,783. There has been a total of 43,839 confirmed cases in Wales. England's voucher scheme does not cover school holidays, but ones in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do. Read more here. Wales's health minister has condemned the ""irresponsible
behaviour"" of those who were filmed tearing down covers over
non-essential items in supermarkets over the weekend. Vaughan Gething added that ""people giving them
encouragement and a platform to do so with the divisive sort of political
messaging we've seen need to take a step back."" He said such actions were ""making life very
difficult for shop workers. They deserve to be treated with more respect."" Supermarkets have been told to close parts of their stores that sell items such as clothes, bedding and toys during Wales' firebreak lockdown. The policy has been criticised in a petition signed by more than 60,000 people. Retailers have called the rules confusing, and say banning people from buying certain items sets a dangerous precedent. Opposition politicians have called the guidelines ""absolute madness"" and badly communicated, as Wales faces another two weeks of restrictions. First Minister Mark Drakeford said implementation of the rules may be tweaked, but it would not be reversed. This video can not be played What do shoppers think of the firebreak rules? Labour has attacked the UK government's decision toreinstate VAT on personal protective equipment (PPE)such as face masks as ""unbelievable"". The party says reintroducing the tax - which was suspended in May - could cost families nearly Â£100 over six months. Face masks are mandatory in places such as shops to slow the spread of Covid. The UK government said: ""The VAT relief was designed to accelerate supply of PPE to the health and social care sectors... when they needed it most."" And a spokesperson said the government had committed to provide free PPE for Covid-19 needs to adult social care until March 2021. Last week was ""one of the deadliest"" in Wales since the pandemic started, the health minister told today's press briefing. More than 60 people died with Covid-19 over a seven-day period, said Vaughan Gething. He added that a further six deaths would be reported by Public Health Wales later today. There are also 616 confirmed cases of patients with coronavirus in Welsh hospitals,the highest figure since May 24and up 26% on last Sunday. Fifty-six people are in critical care in Wales with Covid-19, an increase of 14%. ""This is not an easy time for any of us in Wales,"" Mr Gething said. ""For the next two weeks, we must all live with a new and very tough set of regulations."" Plaid Cymru's leader has called for
""humility"" from the Welsh Government to admit they ""have
made a complete mess of the messaging"" aroundbanning the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets. Adam Price said poor communication had ""eroded public trust"" over the weekend. But he did not support a change in the
policy, calling instead for ministers to push the public health reasoning
behind the decision. Mr Price told BBC Wales: ""The
objective of closing non-essential retail for this period is to try to limit
the number of contacts so they can limit the number of infections, and that's
somehow got completely lost in the messaging. ""If they'd had the conversations with
the retail sector earlier, so we heard from the minister that they had a
meeting on Thursday, I would suggest that was too late. ""That has eroded public trust over the
weekend and obviously that is concerning because it's the public support, the
public health message is ultimately the one thing that keeps us all safe."" The Plaid leader also accused the Conservatives of being
""opportunistic"" in their criticism of the policy. Mr Price said: ""You've got to do it in a constructive way and not in a way, I
think, is doing it for party political advantage and having the effect of
eroding public trust in the public health policy as a whole."" The public should""respond sensibly""to the latest lockdown restrictions and ""think of others"", the Archbishop of Wales has said. The Most Reverend John Davies also expressed his hope Christmas ""in some form"" can be celebrated this year. The archbishop told the BBC'sPolitics Walesprogramme: ""It's very, very easy to knock people who are in government, at whatever level, when things are difficult. ""I think that everybody at every level is really trying to do their very best in what are immensely unexpected and difficult circumstances."" He appealed to all governments to ""act with people in the greatest need at the forefront of their minds, to understand just how stressful, debilitating, frightening it can be to be in the situation that we see so many people in."" The archbishop said the Welsh Government'sdecision to introduce a new national lockdown""wasn't unexpected"" but that it was nevertheless ""disappointing"". Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said supermarkets have discretion to sell non-essential items to customers ""in genuine need"" during the firebreak lockdown. He said Welsh Government ministers were meeting retailers on Monday afternoon to review the regulations and guidance and ensure ""that it is being applied fairly and consistently"". ""If there are anomalies, we will look at whether the guidance needs to be revised or strengthened to make it clear that supermarkets have some discretion to sell to people who are in genuine need,"" Mr Gething said. He added that to ""unravel"" the effectiveness of the firebreak now would make it ""a less effective measure"". ""That's not what this government is going to do,"" he said. Shoppers
and retailers should use âcommon senseâ in the âvery small numberâ of cases
where there is a genuine need to buy a non-essential item in a supermarket, according to Wales' health minister. Most
people would âbe able to manageâ during the two-week lockdown, Vaughan Gething said. He confirmed that supermarket chains will be given âsome discretionâ on the rules. Mr Gething said: âThe point about discretion is we do recognise there have been
exceptional circumstances. ""They have been well advertised and talked-about
examples of people who really do have a desperate need to buy individual items
and itâs about that. âSo
you can either have an approach where you do rely on peopleâs common sense and
ability to talk to retailers about what really is an emergency and make sure
thatâs provided, rather than being deaf to the real concerns and complaints
that a very small number of people would go through, through these next two
weeks."" The health minister added that people's compliance with the rules would ""avoid the much greater hardship and much greater interruption to
peopleâs lives and their ability to still see family and friends in the
futureâ. A senior Welsh Conservative has called for the ban on supermarket sales of non-essential goods to ""be dropped today"". Health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said the ""chaos and confusion"" ofa woman incorrectly told she was not allowed to buy sanitary products at a supermarketwas a direct result of the ban. ""This ludicrous policy has caused real anger, and it's not fair on staff working in our supermarkets and the general Welsh public who are now at their wits' end with Labour ministers,"" Mr Davies said. ""The Welsh Labour Government has rushed out a policy that was not even understood by the country's largest supermarket and that's the fault of the First Minister and his colleagues."" Supermarkets in Wales have had to cover up or block off shelves stocked with non-essential goods Ending the restrictions on the sale of non-essential items will give ""more people more reasons to leave the house"", Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething told Monday's press conference the rules are in place to ""interrupt the chain of transmission and reduce the harm the virus is causing"". He added that allowing supermarkets to sell non-essential goods would be ""unfair"" to smaller retailers. Mr Gething also said that public health advice would need to be revisited if non-essential retail is allowed to reopen. ""I certainly don't want to be in a position where we have to roll back on the choice we've made - that's the shortest possible intervention to make the maximum difference,"" he said. ""We looked at a package of measures to keep Wales safe. That was the advice we had, that was the advice that we published, and we've acted on that advice. ""If we want to unravel that now, we'll be in a very different place, a less effective measure, and that's not what this government is going to do. ""It's about how we make the rules we have effective, clear, consistently applied and how we all act together, to keep well safe, and to save lives"". More lockdown measures are âpossibleâ in the future, Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething was asked at the press briefing whether it was""likely"" that Wales would face another lockdown in the new yearas Deputy Economy and Transport Minister Lee Waters told BBC Radio Wales on Sunday. Mr Gething said: âNone of us can say what's likely. âWe want to have a national pattern for all of us to live our lives by to get to the end of the year. âWeâll need to look at what's happening through that time, weâll need to revise and look at where we are as we get thereâ. Mr Gething added:  âMeasures are possible for the future but that depends on how successful we are in coming together as a nation."" Wales' health minister is ""genuinely
concerned"" about the effects of the ongoing debate over non-essential retail. Vaughan Gething said it had
""taken us away from the reason why the firebreak has been
introduced"". ""It is important that people trust in what the
government is doing and why,"" he said. ""The weekend's messages have moved us away from the
reality of the mounting death toll that we're seeing and the fact that we will
see more harm coming over the next two weeks. ""The package of measures we put in place included the
closure of non-essential retail as one of the elements that makes up what we're
trying to do to save lives. ""That's the message we all need to reflect on
and remember as we go about our choices, as we go about the next few
weeks."" Boris Johnson has defended his refusal to extend free school meals for children in England over the half-term holiday, saying he was ""very proud"" of the government's support so far. ""I totally understand the issue of holiday hunger,"" the prime minister said. ""The debate is, how do you deal with it."" He said the UK government will ""do everything in our power to make sure that no kid, no child goes hungry"". Pressure has risen on the PM, including from his own MPs, to rethink the issue. Mr Johnson also said he had not spoken to footballer Marcus Rashford - who has been leading a high-profile campaign to extend free school meals into the holidays - since the summer. The Welsh and Scottish governments have both promised to make provision during the holidays for children entitled to free school meals. Travelling to see friends or family because of a bereavement is a ""reasonable measure"" to take during the short lockdown period, Wales' health minister has said. But Vaughan Gething said that people doing so should ""respect the rules on social distancing"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's press briefing, he added: ""What I wouldn't want to see is people gathering to support each other - in circumstances where they've lost a loved one - potentially being a meeting where they spread coronavirus with that much greater harm. ""I don't want to see a further loss of life. That's why we've had to change the rules, that's why the firebreak is in place."" Hit West End shows may not return to the Wales Millennium Centre before there is a Covid-19 vaccine, the venue has warned. Visiting tours of The Lion King and Phantom of the Opera to Cardiff have been cancelledas the Â£125m venue, which shut in March, remains closed. Artistic director Graeme Farrow said it hoped to stage ""test events"" with about 150 people in the audience in January. However he said the venue cannot ""flick a switch"" and fill a 1,800 capacity hall. Productions were cancelled when the UK shut down because of the Covid-19 crisis in March, and the WMC remains shut to the general public ""until April 2021 at the earliest"". The Lion King is among the shows which were due to visit Cardiff Tesco were âsimply wrongâ totell a woman she could not buy period products during lockdown, Wales' health minister has said. The supermarket has since apologised and admitted it had incorrectly applied rules that say they can only sell essential items until November 9. It later said an area of its store in St
Mellons, Cardiff had been cordoned off due to a break-in. The issue has prompted protests and calls
for the Senedd to be recalled. Speaking at a Welsh Government briefing, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said meetings would be held with
the supermarkets this afternoon to make clear they could use âsome discretionâ
to sell non-essentials to those in âgenuine needâ. He said he was âvery sorryâ a woman was
wrongly told sanitary products could not be sold. âThis is simply wrong,â Mr Gething said. âItâs an incorrect reading of both the regulations and the guidance. And Iâm
very sorry this woman was given this information.â During the lockdown supermarkets are
unable to sell items other high-street stores canât provide as they have been
told to close. Tesco later said the aisle in question had been cordoned off due to a break-in People in Wales have been told to stay at home during the nation's17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown. The major restrictions to people's lives will last until Monday 9 November. Pubs, bars and restaurants, gyms, and all non-essential shops have been made to close.

North and South Lanarkshire are being considered for the harshest coronavirus restrictions, according to the Scottish government, ahead of a parliamentary debate onScotland's new five-tier Covid restrictionson Tuesday. A letter to the umbrella body for Scotland's councils says ministers are considering implementing the toughest restrictions in the two council areas. They are the only local authorities in the country where the ""level of concern"" is such that the highest level of restrictions could be imposed. Read more here.

The tier three rules mean pubs that do not serve substantial meals must close, and imposes strict limits on households mixing. Read our explainer on the rules in place across the UK. The debate over whether the government should provide food for pupils who are eligible for free school meals over the half-term holiday is rumbling on, withthe prime minister standing by his refusal to do so. The government did step in over the summer holidays after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford, agreeing it was fair to do so as pupils had not been at school during term time because of the coronavirus pandemic. As you can see from the chart below, many of the areas with the highest percentage of pupils eligible for the support are also those in the higher tiers of restrictions, with Knowsley, Manchester and now Nottingham among those in the very high level.

Rotherham Hospital has 96 patients who have tested positive for the virus, as of this morning, compared to 78 at the height of the first wave. A spokesman for Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust said six in-patients are in critical care. It comes after Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said the number ofpatients with coronavirus admitted to its hospitals had doubled in a week. It said if rates continued to rise then it would, in the next two weeks, have more patients than at any point during the pandemic.

Toymakers are expecting strong sales during the critical end-of-year festive season aftera pandemic-fuelled surge in demand for items such as Barbies and board games. Hasbro, the maker of games such as Monopoly and Jenga, told investors earlier today that it was poised for a ""good holiday season"". The forecast followed rival Mattel's report last week of its biggest sales jump in a decade, as its Barbie dolls hit their highest quarterly sales since 2003. The gains have come as families buy toys and games in an attempt to fend off boredom amid coronavirus lockdowns. ""The toy industry as a whole grew meaningfully and continues to demonstrate its resilience in challenging economic times,"" said Mattel chief executive Ynon Kreiz. In the first nine months of the year, Hasbro sales grew 13% from 2019 - bucking the wider plunge in consumer spending around the world. At Mattel, sales are down 2% from 2019 - but some brands, such as Barbie, are having their strongest run in years. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Letnany, near Prague, is now home to a field hospital, built by the army in just seven days The Czech Republic was praised for its swift response to the coronavirus crisis back in spring, but seven months on it's now recording 15,000 new cases a day and has the second highest per capita death rate over seven days in the world. Colonel Ladislav Slechta, a commander in the Czech Army, has just overseen the building of a field hospital. He is used to building such hospitals in Afghanistan or Iraq. Not on the outskirts of Prague. ""There's no time at this moment to think about emotions. But I'm sure they're coming, because it's really an unusual situation,"" he told me. ""We were discussing it, and going back in history, we think the last time this type of facility was deployed in this country was during the First World War."" So what went wrong? Thousands of people celebrated the end of coronavirus in the city of Prague in the summer Czech efforts to fight the virus haven't been helped by the man who wrote the rules being caught in the act of breaking them. Czech Health Minister Roman Prymula says he will resign as soon as his successor is named, after the tabloid Blesk published a late-night photograph of him emerging maskless from a restaurant, holding his wallet. All pubs and restaurants are supposed to be closed to customers, and can only provide hatch service until 8pm. Read more from Rob here. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check In the closing days of the US election campaign, President
Trumpâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic has become a major issue. One significant point of contention has been the wearing of
face coverings - something some supporters of the president have often been unwilling
to do, notably at his rallies. Posts shared thousands of times on Facebook are falsely
claiming that Dr Anthony Fauci, Americaâs top infectious disease expert - who
strongly recommends that people wear face coverings - once wrote a paper saying face
masks led to mass deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic. However, the posts cite a report co-authored by Dr Fauci in
2008 which makes absolutely no mention of masks. The study found the majority of deaths during the 1918
pandemic were not caused by the virus alone but that most victims succumbed to
bacterial pneumonia following the influenza infection. Dr Fauci, who has frequently questioned President Trump's
handling of the pandemic, has beentargeted by misinformation campaigns before. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said infection rates have been rising and it was time ""to take action"" in Warrington, which has been moved into England's top tier of coronavirus restrictions. The area, in north-west England, will join Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, Lancashire and Liverpool City region in tier three from tomorrow. Under tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres and soft play areas will also have to close in Warrington, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the Cheshire town, which is home to about 210,000 people. The restrictions will be reviewed in 28 days' time. The
government will provide a financial support package of Â£1.68m to Warrington, as well as
Â£4.2m in business support funding. Here's more detail about the different restrictions around the UK. The UK government has confirmed Warrington, in north-west England, will move into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. The new measures will come into force from tomorrow. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has reported a record number of daily new coronavirus cases. Officials say 17,347 people have tested positive over the past 24 hours, binging the total tally in Russia to 1,531,224. With 219 further deaths recorded, the total Covid-19 death toll now stands at 26,269. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The pandemic is now hitting the regions east of Moscow. It is true that the situation is quite difficult... It requires incredibly energetic efforts on the part of the
federal government and regional governments."" It come as the authorities across Russia
have been introducing new, stricter measures, including:  If you are just joining us, welcome, here is a round-up of the main developments so far today: Bonfire Night is fast approaching in the UK, but with many public firework displays being cancelled this year due to social
distancing measures, a dogs charity is asking people to be considerate if they decide to put on private displays in their gardens. The Dogs Trust said: âDogs have approximately four times
more sensitive hearing than humans, so the loud cracks and bangs of fireworks
can often be a terrifying experience for them. Fireworks also tend to be
sudden, unpredictable and bright. This combination can be distressing and have
a lasting impact on dogs. ""This
year, dog owners are faced with the added worry that more fireworks will be set
off in the local neighbourhood due to large-scale gatherings being cancelled."" The charity advises people wishing to hold a private display to choose quieter fireworks, limit the display to 30 minutes or less, and let dog owners in neighbouring homes know in advance. Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Several hospitals in Belgium have requested that doctors and nurses who test positive for Covid-19, continue to work if they have no symptoms. The decision has been made by 10 hospitals in Liege, which are dealing with a surge in coronavirus admissions. The city is one of the worst affected areas of Europe and hospitals have started transferring patients elsewhere and cancelled all non-urgent surgery. The situation is exacerbated by a lack of doctors and nurses available. A quarter of medical staff in Liege are reported to be off work with Covid-19. But another 10% of staff who have tested positive but are asymptomic have been asked to continue working. The president of the Belgian Association of Medical Unions, Dr Philippe Devos, acknowledged the obvious risk of transferring the virus to patients, but says theyâve been left with no choice in order to avoid the hospital system collapsing within days.

Some of the dancers wore ""I am Fatima"" t-shirts, which referenceda widely-criticised government-backed advertfrom earlier this month which suggested a ballet dancer should retrain.

Tesco shopper 'unable to buy sanitary products',"This video can not be played Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government had ""made a mess of the messaging"" over the essential items issue Tesco was ""simply wrong"" to tell a woman she could not buy period products during lockdown, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. The supermarket apologised after saying it could not sell sanitary towels and tampons from a store in Cardiff. The Welsh Government has banned the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets during a 17-day lockdown. Opposition parties have called that ""absolute madness"" and said better communication was needed with shops. The Welsh Government said revised guidance will be published on Tuesday. Mr Gething told the Welsh Government briefing that supermarkets would now be able to use their ""discretion"". Tesco had blocked off the aisle after a ""break-in"" at the store in St Mellons, Cardiff They have been told toclose parts of their storesthat sell items such as clothes, bedding and toys during Wales' firebreak lockdown. Under Welsh Government guidance, shops which have been allowed to remain open are not allowed to sell goods classed as ""non-essential"" during the 17 days, which would normally be sold by businesses that have been made to close. This includes homeware, electrical goods, telephones, clothes, toys and games, and garden products. The policy has been criticised in a petition signed by more than 60,000 people. Homeware and bedding has been taped off in Tesco in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan One customer wrote on Twitter she was ""raging and in tears"" after not being able to buy period products at Tesco's St Mellons store in Cardiff, after the aisle was blocked off. In a tweet that was later deleted, Tesco responded to the complaint by saying it had been told not to sell the items during the lockdown. ""This is wrong - period products are essential,"" the Welsh Government tweeted in response. The supermarket later issued a statement saying the area had been closed off following a break-in at the store, which the police were investigating. South Wales Police confirmed it was investigating a burglary which happened between 02:30 GMT and 04:30 on Monday when an estimated ""Â£20,000 worth of beauty products were stolen"". Tesco said the reply to the customer, which had implied sanitary towels were non-essential, ""was sent by mistake"". In Tesco's Penarth store, carbon Monoxide and smoke alarms were covered in sheeting In Tesco in Penarth shelves containing smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors were covered in plastic sheeting, with the store putting up a sign saying they were ""non essential"". But under the Welsh Government guidelines shops can sell products you can normally buy fromfood and drink stores, newsagents, pharmacies and DIY and hardware stores,external- as they remain open. Wales national lockdown in new year 'likely' 'Think of others during firebreak,' says archbishop On Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said meetings would be held with the supermarkets to make clear they could use ""some discretion"" to sell non-essentials to those in ""genuine need"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing he said he was ""very sorry"" a woman had been incorrectly told she could not buy sanitary products. Mr Gething said shoppers and retailers should use ""common sense"" and there would be a ""very small number"" of cases where there would be a genuine need to buy a non-essential item in a supermarket. ""For the great majority of us though of course, we will be able to manage for the next two weeks - with the hardship, with the interruption that causes, yes -Â  but to avoid the much greater hardship and much greater interruption to people's lives and their ability to still see family and friends in the future,"" he said. Books have been covered in cellophane The Welsh Government has come under pressure to abandon the measure and a petition against the ban is now the largest ever submitted to the Senedd. Secretary of State for WalesSimon Hart has urged,externalMr Drakeford to ""scrap the policy"" while Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies called for Members of the Senedd to be recalled ""virtually"" to debate the matter. ""This is absolute madness by the Welsh Government, preventing people from buying the products which they want to buy,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price called on ministers to admit they had sent out confused messaging about a policy, and the public health message had got ""lost"". ""If they'd had the conversations with the retail sector earlier, so we heard from the minister that they had a meeting on Thursday, I would suggest that was too late,"" he said. ""That has eroded public trust over the weekend and obviously that is concerning because it's the public support, the public health message is ultimately the one thing that keeps us all safe.""

Tim Batcup, who has had to close his Swansea book shop during the lockdown, said the Welsh Government had made the ""right call"". But he said that while some supermarkets had stopped selling books, others were still selling them, and the messaging was a ""bit mixed"". ""I don't really understand the fuss... I don't know why people can't go a couple of weeks without a pair or pants or a candle,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""I think it's a sincere attempt at levelling up, how effective it will be I don't know. It might drive people towards the online giants, but they all seem to clean up anyway."" The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off Nicky Small, who has had to close her craft shop in Llandudno, said she believed wool and other craft items were essential as the hobbies were helping many through the pandemic. ""I think there's a balance, what is one person's non-essential could be another person's essential,"" she said. ""The difficulty is anybody trying to dictate what essential is, because that will depend on who you are, what you are needing to get, if you have been waiting for payday."" Head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, Sara Jones, said the rules were confusing, and banning people from buying certain items set a dangerous precedent. ""I think this policy is the wrong way to go about it, because rather than levelling the playing field, it's just creating winners and losers, it's pushing people online,"" she said. She said allowing an element of discretion would go against the purpose of the policy, as people would have to approach staff for items and spend more time in store. ""It's distorting competition, which I think is setting a bit of a dangerous precedent,"" she said.

Officer 'failed to notice' dead sex offender,"HMP Rye Hill is a Category B prison that houses sex offenders A prison officer was dismissed after she ""failed to notice"" a sex offender was dead on the floor when unlocking his cell, a report said. Stephen Maddock, 59, died at HMP Rye Hill on the Northamptonshire and Warwickshire border on 7 December. A report said an officer opened his cell but did not check on him, ""which meant that no-one realised [he] was dead for another half an hour"". HMP Rye Hill's director said it ""fully accepted"" the report's recommendations. ThePrisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) report,externalsaid Maddock was serving a 16-year sentence, having been convicted of sexual offences in 2015. Maddock, who was clinically obese, had diabetes and high blood pressure, which he received medication for. On the morning of 7 December, the report said, officers at the G4S-operated Category B prison for sex offenders carried out roll checks of inmates on Maddock's wing twice before an officer unlocked his cell at 08:00 GMT.

North and South Lanarkshire are being considered for the harshest coronavirus restrictions, according to the Scottish government, ahead of a parliamentary debate onScotland's new five-tier Covid restrictionson Tuesday. A letter to the umbrella body for Scotland's councils says ministers are considering implementing the toughest restrictions in the two council areas. They are the only local authorities in the country where the ""level of concern"" is such that the highest level of restrictions could be imposed. Read more here. A further 20,890 coronavirus cases have been recorded across the UK in the past 24 hours, according tothe latest government figures,external, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 894,690.

Nottingham and the surrounding areas' move into the strictest level of Covid restrictions, tier three, comes after the city consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in the country. There are now 7.9 million people in England living in tier three - the ""very high"" alert level. People living in Nottingham, as well as nearby Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowe, will join Liverpool City Region, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, South Yorkshire and Warrington in the highest tier. The tier three rules mean pubs that do not serve substantial meals must close, and imposes strict limits on households mixing. Read our explainer on the rules in place across the UK. The debate over whether the government should provide food for pupils who are eligible for free school meals over the half-term holiday is rumbling on, withthe prime minister standing by his refusal to do so. The government did step in over the summer holidays after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford, agreeing it was fair to do so as pupils had not been at school during term time because of the coronavirus pandemic. As you can see from the chart below, many of the areas with the highest percentage of pupils eligible for the support are also those in the higher tiers of restrictions, with Knowsley, Manchester and now Nottingham among those in the very high level. Nottingham has consistently recorded one of the highest infection rates in England More now on the move into tier three restrictions for Nottingham and surrounding areas.

They confirm there will be additional rules to the standard tier three baseline measures ""specific to these areas of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire"". A package of financial support, similar to those secured in other areas of the country in tier three, has been agreed to help residents and businesses who will be impacted by the new restrictions.

Rotherham Hospital has 96 patients who have tested positive for the virus, as of this morning, compared to 78 at the height of the first wave. A spokesman for Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust said six in-patients are in critical care. It comes after Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said the number ofpatients with coronavirus admitted to its hospitals had doubled in a week. It said if rates continued to rise then it would, in the next two weeks, have more patients than at any point during the pandemic. Both Rotherham and Doncaster, along with Sheffield and Barnsley and other parts of South Yorkshire,entered the strictest tier of coronavirus restrictions at the weekendamid concerns over rising cases in the area.

Toymakers are expecting strong sales during the critical end-of-year festive season aftera pandemic-fuelled surge in demand for items such as Barbies and board games. Hasbro, the maker of games such as Monopoly and Jenga, told investors earlier today that it was poised for a ""good holiday season"". The forecast followed rival Mattel's report last week of its biggest sales jump in a decade, as its Barbie dolls hit their highest quarterly sales since 2003. The gains have come as families buy toys and games in an attempt to fend off boredom amid coronavirus lockdowns. ""The toy industry as a whole grew meaningfully and continues to demonstrate its resilience in challenging economic times,"" said Mattel chief executive Ynon Kreiz. In the first nine months of the year, Hasbro sales grew 13% from 2019 - bucking the wider plunge in consumer spending around the world. At Mattel, sales are down 2% from 2019 - but some brands, such as Barbie, are having their strongest run in years. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Letnany, near Prague, is now home to a field hospital, built by the army in just seven days The Czech Republic was praised for its swift response to the coronavirus crisis back in spring, but seven months on it's now recording 15,000 new cases a day and has the second highest per capita death rate over seven days in the world. Colonel Ladislav Slechta, a commander in the Czech Army, has just overseen the building of a field hospital. He is used to building such hospitals in Afghanistan or Iraq. Not on the outskirts of Prague. ""There's no time at this moment to think about emotions. But I'm sure they're coming, because it's really an unusual situation,"" he told me. ""We were discussing it, and going back in history, we think the last time this type of facility was deployed in this country was during the First World War."" So what went wrong? Thousands of people celebrated the end of coronavirus in the city of Prague in the summer Czech efforts to fight the virus haven't been helped by the man who wrote the rules being caught in the act of breaking them. Czech Health Minister Roman Prymula says he will resign as soon as his successor is named, after the tabloid Blesk published a late-night photograph of him emerging maskless from a restaurant, holding his wallet. All pubs and restaurants are supposed to be closed to customers, and can only provide hatch service until 8pm. Read more from Rob here. Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check In the closing days of the US election campaign, President
Trumpâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic has become a major issue. One significant point of contention has been the wearing of
face coverings - something some supporters of the president have often been unwilling
to do, notably at his rallies. Posts shared thousands of times on Facebook are falsely
claiming that Dr Anthony Fauci, Americaâs top infectious disease expert - who
strongly recommends that people wear face coverings - once wrote a paper saying face
masks led to mass deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic. However, the posts cite a report co-authored by Dr Fauci in
2008 which makes absolutely no mention of masks. The study found the majority of deaths during the 1918
pandemic were not caused by the virus alone but that most victims succumbed to
bacterial pneumonia following the influenza infection. Dr Fauci, who has frequently questioned President Trump's
handling of the pandemic, has beentargeted by misinformation campaigns before. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said infection rates have been rising and it was time ""to take action"" in Warrington, which has been moved into England's top tier of coronavirus restrictions. The area, in north-west England, will join Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, Lancashire and Liverpool City region in tier three from tomorrow. Under tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Betting shops, casinos, bingo halls, adult gaming centres and soft play areas will also have to close in Warrington, while there is guidance against travelling in or out of the Cheshire town, which is home to about 210,000 people. The restrictions will be reviewed in 28 days' time. The
government will provide a financial support package of Â£1.68m to Warrington, as well as
Â£4.2m in business support funding. Here's more detail about the different restrictions around the UK. The UK government has confirmed Warrington, in north-west England, will move into the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. The new measures will come into force from tomorrow. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has reported a record number of daily new coronavirus cases. Officials say 17,347 people have tested positive over the past 24 hours, binging the total tally in Russia to 1,531,224. With 219 further deaths recorded, the total Covid-19 death toll now stands at 26,269. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The pandemic is now hitting the regions east of Moscow. It is true that the situation is quite difficult... It requires incredibly energetic efforts on the part of the
federal government and regional governments."" It come as the authorities across Russia
have been introducing new, stricter measures, including:  If you are just joining us, welcome, here is a round-up of the main developments so far today: Bonfire Night is fast approaching in the UK, but with many public firework displays being cancelled this year due to social
distancing measures, a dogs charity is asking people to be considerate if they decide to put on private displays in their gardens. The Dogs Trust said: âDogs have approximately four times
more sensitive hearing than humans, so the loud cracks and bangs of fireworks
can often be a terrifying experience for them. Fireworks also tend to be
sudden, unpredictable and bright. This combination can be distressing and have
a lasting impact on dogs. ""This
year, dog owners are faced with the added worry that more fireworks will be set
off in the local neighbourhood due to large-scale gatherings being cancelled."" The charity advises people wishing to hold a private display to choose quieter fireworks, limit the display to 30 minutes or less, and let dog owners in neighbouring homes know in advance. Gavin LeeBBC Europe reporter Several hospitals in Belgium have requested that doctors and nurses who test positive for Covid-19, continue to work if they have no symptoms. The decision has been made by 10 hospitals in Liege, which are dealing with a surge in coronavirus admissions. The city is one of the worst affected areas of Europe and hospitals have started transferring patients elsewhere and cancelled all non-urgent surgery. The situation is exacerbated by a lack of doctors and nurses available. A quarter of medical staff in Liege are reported to be off work with Covid-19. But another 10% of staff who have tested positive but are asymptomic have been asked to continue working. The president of the Belgian Association of Medical Unions, Dr Philippe Devos, acknowledged the obvious risk of transferring the virus to patients, but says theyâve been left with no choice in order to avoid the hospital system collapsing within days.

The protesters want the government to provide more funding to support the sector. In July, the government announced a package of Â£1.57bn for the struggling arts sector. It is one of many protests from those in the industry to have taken place during the outbreak, withmusiciansandtheatre workersalso protesting outside Parliament earlier this month.  Some of the dancers wore ""I am Fatima"" t-shirts, which referenceda widely-criticised government-backed advertfrom earlier this month which suggested a ballet dancer should retrain. The ad pictured a dancer - ""Fatima"" - and encouraged her to give up on dancing and ""reskill"" in cyber security. The ad was pulled after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden disowned it. Â© 2025 BBC.

Ministers set to review Wales' supermarket rulesIt follows a public backlash after stores were told they could not sell items such as clothes.Wales,"This video can not be played Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government had ""made a mess of the messaging"" over the essential items issue Tesco was ""simply wrong"" to tell a woman she could not buy period products during lockdown, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. The supermarket apologised after saying it could not sell sanitary towels and tampons from a store in Cardiff. The Welsh Government has banned the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets during a 17-day lockdown. Opposition parties have called that ""absolute madness"" and said better communication was needed with shops. The Welsh Government said revised guidance will be published on Tuesday. Mr Gething told the Welsh Government briefing that supermarkets would now be able to use their ""discretion"". Tesco had blocked off the aisle after a ""break-in"" at the store in St Mellons, Cardiff They have been told toclose parts of their storesthat sell items such as clothes, bedding and toys during Wales' firebreak lockdown. Under Welsh Government guidance, shops which have been allowed to remain open are not allowed to sell goods classed as ""non-essential"" during the 17 days, which would normally be sold by businesses that have been made to close. This includes homeware, electrical goods, telephones, clothes, toys and games, and garden products. The policy has been criticised in a petition signed by more than 60,000 people. Homeware and bedding has been taped off in Tesco in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan One customer wrote on Twitter she was ""raging and in tears"" after not being able to buy period products at Tesco's St Mellons store in Cardiff, after the aisle was blocked off. In a tweet that was later deleted, Tesco responded to the complaint by saying it had been told not to sell the items during the lockdown. ""This is wrong - period products are essential,"" the Welsh Government tweeted in response. The supermarket later issued a statement saying the area had been closed off following a break-in at the store, which the police were investigating. South Wales Police confirmed it was investigating a burglary which happened between 02:30 GMT and 04:30 on Monday when an estimated ""Â£20,000 worth of beauty products were stolen"". Tesco said the reply to the customer, which had implied sanitary towels were non-essential, ""was sent by mistake"". In Tesco's Penarth store, carbon Monoxide and smoke alarms were covered in sheeting In Tesco in Penarth shelves containing smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors were covered in plastic sheeting, with the store putting up a sign saying they were ""non essential"". But under the Welsh Government guidelines shops can sell products you can normally buy fromfood and drink stores, newsagents, pharmacies and DIY and hardware stores,external- as they remain open. Wales national lockdown in new year 'likely' 'Think of others during firebreak,' says archbishop On Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said meetings would be held with the supermarkets to make clear they could use ""some discretion"" to sell non-essentials to those in ""genuine need"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing he said he was ""very sorry"" a woman had been incorrectly told she could not buy sanitary products. Mr Gething said shoppers and retailers should use ""common sense"" and there would be a ""very small number"" of cases where there would be a genuine need to buy a non-essential item in a supermarket. ""For the great majority of us though of course, we will be able to manage for the next two weeks - with the hardship, with the interruption that causes, yes -Â  but to avoid the much greater hardship and much greater interruption to people's lives and their ability to still see family and friends in the future,"" he said. Books have been covered in cellophane The Welsh Government has come under pressure to abandon the measure and a petition against the ban is now the largest ever submitted to the Senedd. Secretary of State for WalesSimon Hart has urged,externalMr Drakeford to ""scrap the policy"" while Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies called for Members of the Senedd to be recalled ""virtually"" to debate the matter. ""This is absolute madness by the Welsh Government, preventing people from buying the products which they want to buy,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price called on ministers to admit they had sent out confused messaging about a policy, and the public health message had got ""lost"". ""If they'd had the conversations with the retail sector earlier, so we heard from the minister that they had a meeting on Thursday, I would suggest that was too late,"" he said. ""That has eroded public trust over the weekend and obviously that is concerning because it's the public support, the public health message is ultimately the one thing that keeps us all safe.""

Tim Batcup, who has had to close his Swansea book shop during the lockdown, said the Welsh Government had made the ""right call"". But he said that while some supermarkets had stopped selling books, others were still selling them, and the messaging was a ""bit mixed"". ""I don't really understand the fuss... I don't know why people can't go a couple of weeks without a pair or pants or a candle,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""I think it's a sincere attempt at levelling up, how effective it will be I don't know. It might drive people towards the online giants, but they all seem to clean up anyway."" The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off Nicky Small, who has had to close her craft shop in Llandudno, said she believed wool and other craft items were essential as the hobbies were helping many through the pandemic. ""I think there's a balance, what is one person's non-essential could be another person's essential,"" she said. ""The difficulty is anybody trying to dictate what essential is, because that will depend on who you are, what you are needing to get, if you have been waiting for payday."" Head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, Sara Jones, said the rules were confusing, and banning people from buying certain items set a dangerous precedent. ""I think this policy is the wrong way to go about it, because rather than levelling the playing field, it's just creating winners and losers, it's pushing people online,"" she said. She said allowing an element of discretion would go against the purpose of the policy, as people would have to approach staff for items and spend more time in store. ""It's distorting competition, which I think is setting a bit of a dangerous precedent,"" she said.

'No touring West End shows until vaccine' warning,"The Lion King was due for a run in Cardiff this summer - it will now be back in 2022 Hit West End shows may not return to the Wales Millennium Centre ""without a Covid-19 vaccine"", it has been warned. Visiting tours of The Lion King and Phantom of the Opera to Cardiff have been cancelled as the Â£125m venue, which shut in March, remains closed. Artistic director Graeme Farrow said it hoped to stage ""test events"" with about 150 people in the audience in January. However he said the venue cannot ""flick a switch"" and fill a 1,800 capacity hall. Mr Farrow has said discussions with Welsh Government had started in a bid to allow test events to take place, involving about 150 people sat at cabaret tables spread across the venue's main stage. Productions were cancelled when the UK shut down because of the Covid-19 crisis in March and the WMC remains shut to the general public ""until April 2021 at the earliest"". Arts bodies get millions to survive Covid pandemic West End musicals reveal reopening plans Wales Millennium Centre warns 250 jobs at risk It estimated the venue would lose Â£20m in commercial income this year and said in June that250 jobs were at risk. TheWMC received Â£3.9m from the Arts Council of Wales's cultural recovery fundearlier in the week to help them through the pandemic. But the venue has now made 63 permanent members of staff redundant due to the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis. Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay is one of Wales' top arts venues But Mr Farrow hopes performances can return in the new year. ""We want to run a series of test events for live performance with audiences,"" he said. The Wales Millennium Centre has released all of its casual staff during the Covid-19 crisis ""We think we can start testing that from January with the audience on the stage and not in the stalls. ""Because come the summer or the autumn, without a vaccine we won't be able to just flick a switch and have 1,800 people back in this auditorium. ""We need to be able to plan through for that from early in the new year with small audiences, then we need to test 250, 500, 1,000 before we can even think about reopening for big shows. ""At the minute we are thinking May at the very earliest for that, and that may move back. But we will plan for every scenario, and what the money gives us is the ability to do that with people."" People watched outside as Mared Williams performed in a pilot at Theatr Clwyd in August Six and Everybody's Talking About Jamie are setto become the first musicals back in London's West End in mid-November, eight months after the curtain came down. Other theatres are also experimenting while Covid restrictions prevent them resuming traditional shows. Theatr Clwyd in Mold hasheld outdoor performancesand has begun experimenting with streamed online events, while Sherman Theatre in Cardiff has made a series of audio plays by new and established writers. But while Welsh Government guidelines currently prevent theatre shows from going ahead, Theatr Clwyd's artistic director Tamara Harvey said she hoped the rules would change after the firebreak lockdown. ""The frustrating thing for us is that we had a whole autumn season ready to go,"" she said. ""The theatre is laid out as a cabaret space with socially distanced seating. We are able to bring people into our cinema, so we know we can do that safely, and where pubs and restaurants are still allowed to stay open that has been really frustrating. ""We are really good, in theatres, at keeping people safe and keeping them in their seats."" Wales Millennium Centre has called for similar rules for live events as those which exist in hospitality. ""How can cinemas open but this place can't? Even if we were to put 50 people in this auditorium, we could have them 10 metres apart. But we can't,"" added Mr Farrow. ""I think we need to start asking the question 'Why not?' rather than 'Why?'."" The Welsh Government said its programme of pilot events with spectators at both outdoor and indoor events has ""been put on hold, the public health position takes precedence"". ""We understand this is a very difficult time for the sector and we will continue to work in partnership towards a safe reopening when the time is right,"" said a spokesperson.

Local lockdowns 'stifling jobs recovery',"Deserted High Streets and home working are stifling the British job market's recovery, new research suggests. Urban areas in Scotland and southern England have seen the biggest declines in job postings, according to the Centre for Cities (CfC) think tank. Vacancies have failed to return to pre-pandemic levels across all 63 towns and cities it analysed across the UK. CfC boss Andrew Carter said local lockdowns, while necessary, will exacerbate the situation over winter. The slow jobs recovery is linked to a ""collapse"" in the number of jobs in services being advertised, CfC said. Aberdeen, where the oil industry has struggled during the pandemic, recorded the steepest fall, with a 75% decline in job vacancies at the beginning of October, compared to the same time last year. It is followed by Edinburgh at 57%, and both Belfast and Crawley, a West Sussex town near Gatwick Airport, at 55%. London has seen the sixth biggest fall in job postings at 52%. Overall, UK vacancies are 46% behind last year's level, said the report from the think tank and jobs website Indeed. Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: ""This could have potentially catastrophic long-term consequences for people and the economy. ""The government has told us to expect a tough winter and while local lockdowns are necessary to protect lives, it is vital that ministers continue to listen and reassess the level of support given to help people and places to cope with the months ahead."" The think tank's analysts said in general, the lag in hiring was concentrated in sectors exposed to Covid-19 restrictions, such as retail, arts and leisure.Stricter coronavirus rules are now in forcefor nearly six million Britons. They also said working from home was stifling industries which depended on High Street footfall. Areas where footfall has returned to normal more quickly, such as Birkenhead, Chatham and Hull, have seen a faster recovery in the number of jobs advertised. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: ""The timid recovery in job vacancies is a portent of the distress towns and cities could face if restrictions continue to spring up in parts of the country already reeling from imposed lockdowns and reduced footfall."" How many people are out of work? How to get a job: Top bosses share their secrets 'I didn't want to tell anyone I was claiming benefits' ""With the remote work trend showing no sign of abating, and entire regions being placed under stricter control, service jobs in large towns and cities could become scarcer still and pull the UK into a jobs spiral,"" Mr Adrjan said. ""That could mean a very long winter ahead for the millions of people currently unemployed,"" he added.

School meals row continues as half term begins,"Cafe staff in Liverpool prepare sandwich bags for children, as businesses offer to help Ministers are continuing to insist they will not fund free school meals for children at risk of going hungry in England over the half-term holiday. Many councils are providing meal vouchers, while hundreds of businesses are offering parcels to those in need. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing mounting pressure from former ministers and some Tory MPs to reverse the move. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said providing money through councils was the ""best way"" to support people. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have already introduced food voucher schemes. The UK government extended free school meals to eligible children during the Easter holidays earlier this year and, after a high-profile campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford, did the same for the summer holiday. But it has refused to do so again. A petition created by the Manchester United striker calling for provision to continue in the holidays had gained nearly 870,000 signatures by Monday morning. Is there really no money for free school meals? What's happening to free school meals during holidays? 'I remember going to bed with hunger pains' Mr Hancock defended the government's refusal to budge, saying it had increased Universal Credit and allocated Â£63m to local authorities. ""Often it's councils who know best on the ground,"" he said. But the children's commissioner, Anne Longfield, said money going to local councils ""gets tied up then in processes, in distribution, in bureaucracies"", and that might not help some children. She said the beauty of the free school meals scheme ""is that it gets directly to children"", adding: ""There'll be children who are desperate for that help and that's something that really makes this a very urgent priority for Boris Johnson when he gets to his desk today."" The Conservative leader of Warwickshire County Council told the BBC they had already spent all the money allocated under the Â£63m fund -which was announced in June,external- and it was not enough to fund school meals too. This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Earlier, there was also confusion about whether Mr Johnson had responded to a letter from Rashford. Asked about it on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said: ""There has been communication between the two, as far as I understand it."" When pressed further, he said: ""I understand that there has been communication but I'm obviously not in charge of the prime minister's correspondence. If there hasn't been, I'm sure that that will be followed up."" ButRashford later tweeted:,external""Hmm, unless he's referring to the call we had following the U-turn in June?"" Downing Street sources said they are not aware of any direct communication between the prime minister and Rashford since the summer, when they spoke on the phone. The footballer's campaign has recently led tobusinesses including fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants and cafespromising to dish out free food to eligible children over half-term. A cafe in Sheerness, Kent, puts out a menu for free breakfast for local children Some charities have set up websites and maps allowing parents to search for places nearby providing free meals. Cafe-owner Kim Mahony Hargreaves in Wembley, London, is providing a lunchbox with a sandwich, fruit, oat flapjack, yoghurt and apple juice to children that need it. ""My partner was a teacher and has seen first hand the impact free school meals can have on children for whom it may be the only food they eat all day,"" she said. ""Some children wouldn't even eat the food themselves but take it home for their families to share."" Mr Hancock said he had been looking at Rashford's Twitter feed - where the footballer had retweeted offers from restaurants and cafes all across he country. ""As central government, we put in extra money. The councils, they're stepping up to the plate and lots of businesses and individuals are as well. I think that's brilliant. ""I saw Marcus Rashford said what we need is collaboration, people working together. I totally agree."" A chef in a restaurant in Leeds prepares food boxes for children during half term Last week, Conservative MPs voted against Labour's attempt to extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling and voting for Labour's motion. Sir David Amess, one of those to vote against the motion for free school meals, had his constituency office of Southend West targeted on Sunday, as local people wrote messages on empty plates and left them outside. ""The situations people find themselves in are just unbearable,"" said organiser Sadie Hasler, 40, from Southend. ""The stigma that comes with maybe being a single parent, and trying to do the best thing by your child, and society just kind of constantly wants to keep elbowing you in the ribs for it."" The messages on the plates criticised the government while others read: ""I'm hungry"" Several Tory MPs oppose the government's stance. Conservative MP and former welfare minister Caroline Nokes told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour the government had to ""take another look at it"". And fellow Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said ""it would be wise"" for the government to reconsider in time for the Christmas holidays, adding it would be ""a sensible thing to do to bring people together"". Some councilshave promised to supplymeal vouchers for children facing hardship. Conservative-led Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council said it would provide food parcels for families from Monday, tweeting: ""No child should go hungry."" And Kensington and Chelsea council - which is also Tory-run - said nearly 3,300 youngsters would receive Â£15 vouchers from their schools to cover the cost of meals during the holiday, adding: ""No kid should go hungry."" Fiona Crump, owner of the Castle Beach Cafe in Falmouth, is one of several business owners to make free lunch bags during half term Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party will force a new Commons vote on the issue if the government had not changed its position before the Christmas Commons recess, saying: ""It's not too late to do the right thing."" Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible for free school meals. In England, about 1.3 million children claimed for free school meals in 2019 - about 15% of state-educated pupils. Analysis by the Food Foundation estimates a further 900,000 children in England may have sought free school meals since the start of the pandemic.

Berlin breaks up 600-strong party over Covid,"Covid is also taking its toll of German Christmas markets Police in Berlin have broken up a 600-strong party as coronavirus restrictions continue to curb German festivities. Berlin police tweeted that the ""fetish party"" in the capital ""probably ended unsatisfactorily"" for the attendees. The venue was too small for the crowd to socially distance, they said. Like many countries in Europe, Germany is battling a rise in infections. Frankfurt has become the latest city to cancel its famed Christmas market. Germany has fared better than the other heavily populated nations in Europe but Sunday was the fourth day in a row that it registered more than 10,000 new cases. The total is now more than 430,000 since the pandemic began. More than 10,000 people have died with the virus in the country. Frankfurt has now joined Berlin, DÃ¼sseldorf and Cologne in cancelling or scaling back Christmas markets. Munich and Nuremberg still plan to go ahead. Germany has 2,500 of them normally, and Frankfurt usually attracts more than two million visitors. ""Our goal remains to avoid another lockdown,"" Frankfurt mayor Peter Feldmann said in a statement. Tickets for the open-air Berlin party in the Mitte district had to be bought in advance, with a maximum of 250 people allowed. But the event was shut when far more party-goers turned up, many of them not wearing masks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Officer 'failed to notice' dead sex offenderA prison officer was dismissed after failing to spot a man who had been ""dead for some time"".","HMP Rye Hill is a Category B prison that houses sex offenders A prison officer was dismissed after she ""failed to notice"" a sex offender was dead on the floor when unlocking his cell, a report said. Stephen Maddock, 59, died at HMP Rye Hill on the Northamptonshire and Warwickshire border on 7 December. A report said an officer opened his cell but did not check on him, ""which meant that no-one realised [he] was dead for another half an hour"". HMP Rye Hill's director said it ""fully accepted"" the report's recommendations. ThePrisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) report,externalsaid Maddock was serving a 16-year sentence, having been convicted of sexual offences in 2015. Maddock, who was clinically obese, had diabetes and high blood pressure, which he received medication for. On the morning of 7 December, the report said, officers at the G4S-operated Category B prison for sex offenders carried out roll checks of inmates on Maddock's wing twice before an officer unlocked his cell at 08:00 GMT. The report said: ""About half an hour later, prisoners called for staff after they had found Maddock on his cell floor. ""He had rigor mortis, which indicated that he had been dead for some time.""

But the report added the officer, who was later dismissed after a disciplinary investigation, ""failed to notice that he was dead on the floor"". ""When unlocking a prisoner's cell, the officer is supposed to get a response from the prisoner to satisfy themselves that they are alive and well. ""This did not happen, which meant that no-one realised that Maddock was dead for another half an hour."" The PPO also recommended ""that all staff understand what is expected of them when conducting roll checks and that all staff adhere to these expectations"". Peter Small, director at HMP Rye Hill, said: ""Mr Maddock's family and friends remain in our thoughts at this difficult time. ""We have fully accepted the recommendations made by the PPO; staff conducting welfare checks do so with regular managerial supervision, and daily reports are issued to the deputy director.""

Why the US election matters for the UK,"If you want to see one of the great monuments to what is called ""the special relationship"" between Britain and the United States, take a stroll to Grosvenor Square, a leafy haven in the heart of London. There you will find a grand statue of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the great wartime American president, set high on a stone pedestal, dominating the square. Below it there is a surprise, an inscription revealing that the statue, unveiled in 1948, was paid for by ""small sums from people in every walk of life throughout the UK"". Think of it: at a time of grim post-war austerity and food rationing, 160,000 Britons were so admiring of America they were willing to pay five shillings each - about 8 pounds in today's money - to erect a statue in memory of its former president. This memorial marks perhaps the zenith of US-UK relations. It is doubtful today many Britons would fork out hard-earned cash to raise a likeness of Donald Trump. A survey last month by the Pew Research Center foundonly 19% of Britons have confidence in Mr Trump to do the right,externalthing in world affairs. Transatlantic relations over the past four years have been ragged. President Trump publicly criticised Theresa May's Brexit negotiations; on Twitter he accused British intelligence of spying on him; down the phone he shouted at Boris Johnson about the UK's approach to the Chinese tech giant, Huawei. There have been ""ups and downs at a political level"", the ever-diplomatic Lord Sedwill, Britain's recent national security adviser, told the BBC. ""President Trump is a very unusual occupant of that office."" President Barack Obama meeting Prince George at Kensington Palace in London in 2016... And Donald Trump and his wife Melania meeting the Queen at Windsor Castle in 2018 Of course, the official relationship between Britain and the US endures; the military, diplomatic and intelligence links that run deep into the fabric of both nations. But the occupant of the White House shapes that relationship, and that is why the election on November 3 matters. The big question about a second Trump term is whether he would double down, unconstrained by electoral concerns, or moderate his behaviour as he looked to his legacy. Some reckon there might just be more of the same. For the UK, that would mean reasonably warm personal relations at the top between the president and a prime minister he once called""Britain Trump"". There would be more positive noises about Brexit and a future trade deal. But there would likely also be more disputes over policy such as relations with China or Iran. In terms of substance, the big unknown is whether Trump mark 2 would withdraw the US even further from the defence alliance Nato. In recent interviews, John Bolton, Trump's former National Security Adviser, has said there was real risk of this. Others say it would be resisted by the US political establishment. But if the US did step back from Nato, Britain and the rest of Europe would have to spend more on their own defence and that could mean substantial tax rises. On Iran, a second Trump administration would push harder for the collapse of the deal Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear ambitions. Britain would come under more pressure to split from European allies or risk tougher US sanctions that apply indirectly to British businesses and banks. The transatlantic divide on this and other issues would likely grow if Mr Trump gets four more years. A really simple guide to the US election Where Biden and Trump stand on the policies You decide: Who will be the next US president? Why we might not get a result on election night Full coverage of the US election If Joe Biden were to win, the US would be less hostile towards the international organisations that Britain values so much, such as the United Nations. It would try to repair global partnerships. He's promising a ""summit of the democracies"". Transatlantic relations would be easier, less unpredictable, with fewer unexpected tweets. Relations between the US and the UK over some policy issues would improve. Take climate change. Next year Britain is hosting a big UN summit - known as COP26 - where it is hoped the world will agree new carbon reduction targets. President Trump, who pulled the US out of the previous Paris climate accord, is unlikely to help get a deal, whereas Mr Biden has promised to re-join Paris and push for even more ambitious targets. What the US election will mean for climate change Both Mr Biden and Mr Johnson share a tough approach towards Russia. They are closer on China, agreeing on the need to challenge malign behaviour but also allow for engagement on global issues. Divisions over Iran may become less stark as Mr Biden has promised to re-engage with the nuclear deal. That is not to say a Biden presidency would not pose difficulties for the UK. He is not a natural fan of the prime minister, describing him last December as ""a physical and emotional clone"" of President Trump. He strongly opposed Brexit. And as someone with a strong sense of his Irish heritage, Mr Biden has expressed concern about the potential impact Britain's departure from the European Union could have on Ireland's economy and Northern Ireland's security. Presidential candidate Joe Biden outside Downing Street in 2013, when he was vice-president Many analysts believe a Biden presidency would shift its focus towards Germany and France, seeing them and the EU as America's primary transatlantic partners. Sir Peter Westmacott, former UK ambassador in Washington, said: ""Biden will lean towards Paris and Berlin not because he has anything intrinsic against the UK, but because we will count for less in Washington because of Brexit. Our importance to the US has always been linked to the difference we can make to US interests in Europe, and vice versa."" Regardless of who wins on November 3, many observers believe some trends will continue: the gradual US retreat from global leadership and military intervention as the country rediscovers its isolationistic instincts. Mr Biden might be more internationalist in outlook than Mr Trump, but he too is promising to end US involvement in ""forever wars"", focus his foreign policy on improving the lives of America's middle classes, and protect US jobs from the tide of globalisation. According to Sophia Gaston, director of the British Foreign Policy Group, that means Britain will come under pressure to fill that vacuum and defend the multilateral organisations that have served the West so well. ""Even if Biden wins,"" she says, ""Britain is going to have to take a bigger role in those international institutions and a bigger role in leadership on issues like climate change, democracy and human rights because the US president is going to be more concerned by a fractious domestic landscape.""

How Trump and Biden's playlists pump up the fans,"When he was seven years old, President Donald Trump punched his school music teacher. ""I actually gave a teacher a black eye,"" he wrote in his 1987 book The Art Of The Deal, ""because I didn't think he knew anything about music."" Mr Trump says he was ""almost expelled"" over the incident, and it suggests he's as opinionated about music as he is about trade or taxes. The president is a big fan of The Rolling Stones, Eminem and Elton John (a decidedly one-way relationship), but his favourite song is Peggy Lee'sIs That All There Is?,externalIt's an interesting choice: Lee's nihilistic ballad essentially says life is a series of meaningless disappointments, so you might as well drink away your sorrows and forget about the rest of the world. Mr Trump sees it differently. ""It's a great song because I've had these tremendous successes and then I'm off to the next one. Because, it's like, 'Oh, is that all there is?'""he told his biographer,externalMichael D'Antonio, in 2014. Who will be the next US president? You decide Why we might not get a result on election night Has Trump delivered on his promises? Full coverage of the US election So what about his Democratic rival, Joe Biden? Well, his tastes are no more up-to-date. His favourite band is traditional Irish folk outfit The Chieftains,he told People Magazine in 2012,external, adding: ""I would sing Shenandoah if I had any musical talent."" Shenandoah,external, which The Chieftains recorded in 1998, actually dates back to the early 19th Century. The story of a fur trapper who falls in love with the daughter of a Native American chief, it's steeped in romanticism for the early days of America. None of these songs have been played on the campaign trail this year - but the candidates' musical preferences at rallies and in advertisements offer a glimpse into what they think works for their supporters. Mr Trump's playlist leans heavily on classic rock songs that project power and combative self-confidence. He frequently plays Queen'sWe Are The Champions,external- whose refrain, ""No time for losers,"" could almost be the president's inner monologue. Tina Turner'sThe Best,external(""you're better than all the rest"") and Survivor's pugnaciousEye Of The Tiger,external(""just a man and his will to survive"") fulfil similar functions - conveying the idea of Mr Trump as a lone wolf, fighting the political establishment. Mr Trump often seems to be trolling critics with his choices. Why else would he play Gnarls Barkley'sCrazy,external, or The Rolling Stones'You Can't Always Get What You Want,external? And his perceived persecution by the media gets a musical airing, too, through songs like Michael Jackson'sBeat It,external. ""They told him, don't you ever come around here,"" sings the star, who once kept a home in one of  Mr Trump's buildings in New York. ""Don't want to see your face, you'd better disappear."" But the song actually advocates retreat. ""You'd better leave while you can,"" Jackson advises, the message being: You think you're tough, but your opponents are tougher... so be the better man and walk away. Mr Trump's song choices are usually based on how they feel, rather than a scholarly analysis of the lyrics. His pre-speech playlist is designed to keep the audience pumped up. They often stand for hours before he comes on stage, so the focus is on timeless sing-alongs, seemingly targeted at white voters in their 50s and 60s. That means songs like Elton John'sTiny Dancer,externaland Laura Branigan'sGloria,external, mixed with rousing classical numbers likeNessun Dorma,externaland the patrioticBattle Of The Hymn Republic,external(Glory, Glory, Hallelujah). In recent months, as the president has courted black voters (""I did more for the Black community in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years"") he has also started including a few soul classics in his set. James Brown'sPlease, Please, Please,externaland Barry White'sMy First, My Last, My Everything,externalwere given an airing during last week's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania. Mr Biden's playlist has been almost evenly divided between black and white artists since he announced his candidacy in April 2019. Recently, his walk-on music has been The Staple Singers' deep cutWe The People,external- an uplifting, soulful hymn to unity, whose title was lifted from the preamble to the US Constitution. ""You may have the black blood / Or you may have the white blood,""sing the gospel group, ""But we are all living on blood / So don't let nobody slip into the mud."" It's the sort of message Mr Biden has sought to build his campaign around, calling for harmony and stability. He tends to favour feel-good songs like Bill Withers'Lovely Day,externalor Jackie Wilson's(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher,external. But for those paying attention, there's often a message hidden in the lyrics. ""Powers keep on lyin' / While your people keep on dyin,'"" sings Stevie Wonder in campaign stapleHigher Ground,external- a not-so-thinly veiled reference to the Trump administration's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. After speaking, Mr Biden usually leaves the stage to the strains of Bruce Springsteen'sWe Take Care Of Our Own,external.  Like Born In The USA, the song is actually a critique of America, originally written in response to President Bush's handling of Hurricane Katrina. ""There ain't no help, the cavalry stayed home,"" sings The Boss, who says he's ""looking for the map that leads me home"". Mr Biden is, presumably, trying to align himself with Springsteen - a working-class hero who's determined to set America back on the right path. But sometimes, the candidates select songs that make you wonder if they've paid attention to the words at all. What is  Mr Trump trying to say when he blasts outSympathy For The Devil,external, a song literally written from the perspective of Satan? And, wonderful though Haim'sThe Wire,externalis, does Mr Biden realise he's being welcomed onto the stage with the lyrics: ""I fumbled it when it came down to the wire""? Mr Biden suffered another musical misfire last month, when he attempted to woo a large Puerto Rican audience in Florida byplaying the Reggaeton song Despacito from his phone,external, while dancing awkwardly behind the podium (Luis Fonsi, who recorded the song, had just introduced him to the crowd). As right-wing pundits gleefully pointed out, Despacito is Spanish for ""slowly"" - a perfect descriptor for the candidate they refer to  as Sleepy Joe. Allow Twitter content?

The 70s disco classic has been part of Mr Trump's playlist since at least last year, but it got bumped up the running order in June when the Rolling Stones threatened to sue the campaign over the use of their song You Can't Always Get What You Want. They're not the only ones to object: Neil Young, Adele, Aerosmith, Pharrell Williams, Rihanna, Guns N' Roses and Phil Collins have all demanded not to be played at Mr Trump's rallies, with varying degrees of success. The Village People were more relaxed. ""Like millions of Village People fans worldwide, the President and his supporters have shown a genuine like for our music,""they wrote on Facebook in February,external.

Rapper Cardi B is among the stars who've endorsed Joe Biden's campaign But Mr Trump enjoys very little support from the current crop of pop stars, with Cardi B, Taylor Swift, Lizzo, Frank Ocean and DaBaby all endorsing Mr Biden this year.

One videoposted to social media in May,externalfeatured Mr Trump complaining about his treatment by the press, set to a soundtrack of Justin Timberlake's Cry Me A River. But in the end, music can only set a mood. Voters won't decide who wins based on the candidates' CD collections. In fact,a 2016 Ohio surveyconcluded that star endorsements had no effect on most voters' intentions in that year's presidential race - and some celebrities actually put people off.

Different rules for women?,"With Senator Kamala Harris as a historic vice-presidential running mate, it's impossible to avoid the topic of gender this election cycle - but are the rules of the race really different for women? Here's how her nomination highlights the issues women in politics have faced for decades - and how things are changing - with analysis from Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Women in politics must walk a fine line between assertive and aggressive. Research shows that existing, unconscious gender biases can make women come across as condescending where their male counterparts might be lauded as confident. For minority women, these gender biases are compounded by racial ones too. And in the US, the trope of the ""angry black woman"" is an old, insidious stereotype. The trope, which emerged in the 19th Century, characterised black women as unfeminine, irrational and sassy. Serena Williams and 'angry black women' As Ms Walsh explains: ""Women are accused of not being strong enough and tough enough to be president or vice-president, but at the same time, how do you portray strength without it being seen as anger?"" She feels Ms Harris did a good job toeing the line during the VP debate, but adds that there were some instances were she seemed to hold herself back - although her polite response to the interruptions was ""brilliant"" and relatable to any woman who has experienced being talked over. Mansplaining explained in one chart Some analysts argue that women have to prove themselves on the campaign trail in ways men do not, even if gender isn't a primary concern for voters. Where people assume competency for men, women must demonstrate it. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to Nevada's assembly floor leader in 2019 Economist/YouGov,externalpolls in August showed that the sitting vice-president held a narrow lead in favourability compared to Ms Harris. A quarter of Americans polled said they were uncertain how they felt about Ms Harris, and 14% said the same of Mr Pence. After the debate, most voters felt Harris won. But when asked who might be better to take over as president, some polls looked a bit different. Are voters biased against women candidates? YouGov polls,externalfound most Americans - 56% - felt Mr Pence was best placed to take on the presidency if Mr Trump cannot serve, while 50% felt the same way about Ms Harris. Among the key independent voter bloc, 53% reported having faith in Mr Pence's abilities, compared to 44% saying the same for Ms Harris. While some survey respondents may simply feel a sitting vice-president is more qualified for the top job than a first-term senator, advocates for women in politics have long argued they have to prove their prowess more than their male counterparts. When she accepted her position as Democratic running mate, Ms Harris said the title of vice-president would be great, ""but 'momala' means the most"". As she's introduced herself to America, Ms Harris has often highlighted her family life (she's mother to two step-children) and values. The way she was raised by a single-mother coupled with her blended family have been key points in the way Ms Harris presents herself as a candidate. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots For men in politics, Ms Walsh explains, showing off their families has ""always been a value add"". But it's only more recently that women in politics have also begun to use their experiences as qualifications. It's a ""conundrum for women"", she says, because if they do not have children or do not talk about them it can raise questions of ""why not?"" ""And then if you do talk about them and if they're young, then there's the question of who's going to take care of your children?"" On the flip side, when a man discusses his family, it helps paint the picture of him as a ""family man"", but ""no-one is questioning [his] choices and priorities"", or wondering who is taking care of the children. One only has to look back to Sarah Palin's 2008 vice-presidential run to see the family debate play out. The then-Alaska governor saw her parenting choices scrutinised by the media and some Democrats. At the time, Mrs Palin had five children, including a baby with Down syndrome. Critics wondered if she was neglecting her family to run for office. Then-Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin in 2008 It's a stereotype that's been changing, to be sure - even if women in politics can't quite escape links to motherhood. More recently at her Supreme Court nomination hearing, Amy Coney Barrett's status as a mother to seven has been touted by Republicans as experience that will make her a better justice. Ms Walsh also notes that Ms Harris is in a unique position as the mother to grown-up stepchildren. And of course, voters want to see their candidates as human beings with lives of their own. ""So I think she is following what's actually normal."" Nasty, radical, disrespectful, a monster: this is how Mr Trump has described Ms Harris since she became Mr Biden's right hand. Read more about how Trump uses gendered language - and if it matters - here Her rival Mr Pence has not levied insults, but we did learn a bit from his debate performance. When it comes to the interruptions, certainly some of it is just part of debating. But for Ms Walsh, it's the fact that Mr Pence could use such a technique that highlights the differences. 'Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking' ""He does it in this way that he's politely ignoring you,"" she says. ""If a woman were to do that, sort of just keep talking, there would be a whole line of discussion about she just couldn't shut up."" Ms Walsh says that since 2018, when there wasa surge in the number of women running for office, women candidates have become more comfortable with authenticity. ""Not overthinking too much about 'how am I supposed to perform' but trying to be more who they really are,"" she says. ""We saw it in 2018 with a lot of candidates talking about issues that most women would have been told to stay away from."" Those include mentioning young children, to experiencing homelessness or talking about their own financial problems. Back in 2017,external, former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also called for women to not let ""somebody else's racism or sexism be your problem"". ""That's what we have to say to women: When you walk into a room, if somebody tries to put you down, don't take that on. Simply speak up for yourself,"" she said at a KPMG leadership summit. ""If you're really denied something that you think you should have gotten, there are all kinds of means of recourse for that - and you ought to take them."" Ms Walsh says from Geraldine Ferraro to Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton, each candidacy has built upon the past. And now, with the culmination of having a black, Indian woman as a vice-presidential nominee, ""it's an enormous shift in the world"", she says. 'Vice-presidents aren't cute' A 100-year milestone for women... and what comes next ""When women see someone like Kamala Harris as the vice-president pick and possibly as the vice president, it just changes the calculus of what they could be in life.""

"National strike is on, Belarus opposition says","Students are rallying again in Minsk, backing the opposition Groups of workers and students in Belarus have heeded a nationwide strike call by exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, to press for the president's resignation. Workers at some state-run plants downed tools and chanted slogans outside the gates. Hundreds of students also marched out of several universities in Minsk clapping, chanting and linking arms. However, the government says key enterprises are still running smoothly. President Alexander Lukashenko ignored the opposition's midnight deadline for him to step down. Protests have gripped Belarus since he claimed victory in an August poll widely viewed as rigged. The interior ministry says police arrested 523 people during mass anti-government demonstrations on Sunday, 352 of whom are still in custody. On Monday, at least 155 people were arrested for supporting the strike action in Minsk, Borisov, Brest, Grodno, Mogilev and Novopolotsk, human rights group Vesna reports. The full scale of the protests on Monday is not yet clear, partly because of the authorities' media restrictions. This video can not be played Police targeted protesters with stun grenades and raided flats in October 2020 Videos posted to independent media site Tut.by show empty factories and students walking out of their universities. A source in Minsk following the protests told the BBC that the strike was affecting some major state enterprises, including the Grodno Azot chemical plant and Minsk Tractor Plant, but they had not been brought to a standstill. Dozens of shops, cafes and restaurants are closed in Belarus, in solidarity with the strike. Many other small businesses are also supporting the strike, our source says. But big supermarkets and public transport are still running normally. Thousands of pensioners walked through central Minsk, eventually merging with a procession of students. Pensioners have held protest rallies every Monday. Students have also been very active, despite threats of expulsion. What's happening in Belarus? Belarus opposition leader on Russia's wanted list How many people does it take to oust a political leader? Earlier an estimated 100,000 demonstrators marched for the 11th successive Sunday of protests. Many waved the opposition's red and white flags and chanted ""strike"" as they marched. According to Russian news agencies, citing their correspondents at the scene, at least 10 stun grenades went off. There were also reports that riot police had fired rubber bullets. Security forces also blocked roads in central Minsk and water cannon were put in place. Belarusian police blocked roads in central Minsk as tens of thousands of protesters marched on Sunday Ms Tikhanovskaya issued her ultimatum on 13 October, threatening a mass walkout by workers if Mr Lukashenko - who has ruled Belarus for 26 years - ignored their demands. She said that Belarus had ""had enough"" after two months of ""political crisis, violence and lawlessness"". She issued three demands from a location in Lithuania, where she has been in exile since August. In addition to Mr Lukashenko's resignation, she demanded an immediate end to police brutality and the release of all political prisoners. Earlier anti-Lukashenko protests at state enterprises, in support of the opposition, were not sustained. There are reports of workers being warned they will lose their jobs if they go on strike. The BBC's source in Minsk says fear is widespread, after many protesters were beaten up and tortured by police. It is common for masked men with batons to grab protesters, drag them into unmarked vans and drive off.
