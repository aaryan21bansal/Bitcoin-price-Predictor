Ireland snatch win over France in Six Nations,"Six Nations France (3) 13 Try:ThomasCon:BelleauPens:Machenaud 2 Ireland (9) 15 Pens:Sexton 4Drop:Sexton Ireland snatched a remarkable win over France thanks to a brilliant long-range drop-goal by fly-half Johnny Sexton. After the Irish had led for most of the game in Paris, winger Teddy Thomas scored a fine 71st-minute try to give France the lead for the first time. However, Sexton pulled off his dramatic drop in the 83rd minute to give Joe Schmidt's side a valuable opening win. The incredible last-gasp score denied France a winning start under their new coach Jacques Brunel. Sexton landed four penalties before missing his fifth, which would have given the visitors a 15-6 lead. That failed attempt looked like proving costly when Racing 92 star Thomas scythed through the Irish defence for what seemed like being the decisive score. Perhaps it is unfair to compare an uncapped teenager with the British and Irish Lions starting fly-half, but the difference between the sides was crystallised by the fortunes of the two men wearing the number 10 shirts. On his Test debut, Matthieu Jalibert lost an early aerial battle with Rob Kearney and minutes later he miscued an attempted chip over the Irish defence to cough up possession. The Bordeaux youngster was too frequently guilty of crabbing across the field, which cut off space for his team-mates, before limping off after 30 minutes following an awkward collision with Bundee Aki. In contrast, Sexton's control of the Irish attack was flawless. The Leinster man consistently probed at the French back three with an array of clever kicks. And the playmaker showed nerves of steel to land the match-winning score at the death. Teddy Thomas scored the only try but it wasn't enough for the French as Ireland snatched a late win Thomas produced a real moment of magic to put France within seconds of a stunning win. With less than 10 minutes left on the clock, the wing struck to put his side into the lead for the first time as Les Bleus appeared to have grabbed an unlikely victory. Thomas gathered a clearing kick near the halfway line and sprinted past Kearney on the right wing before swerving in field, leaving Jacob Stockdale, Sexton and Keith Earls in his wake to score under the posts. It was the first moment of real genius in the match before Sexton's stunning winner. When Brunel sits down to review the video of his first game as French national coach, he will see the cost of the indiscipline shown by his players. France conceded 10 penalties in total, but all three of Sexton's first-half penalties were relatively straightforward and the result of needless errors. Sebastien Vahaamahina was guilty of four silly penalties either side of half-time - two of them were converted by Sexton for points and another cost his side a rare attacking position. The home side fought their way back into contention in the third quarter but almost released the pressure valve when team captain Guilhem Guirado didn't roll away, but Sexton missed his kick. The home side improved their discipline in the closing stages but were left to rue their early mistakes. The young French players will be devastated to have lost in such dramatic fashion, but they have shown that they can be contenders in this year's championship and will have another week of training under Brunel before their visit to Scotland on 11 February. Ireland's Grand Slam remains on track - but only just. They will know they must improve their attack if they are to regain the title they last won in 2015. Joe Schmidt may now decide to use the same players again and resist the temptation to experiment against Italy in round two on 10 February. Ireland match-winning hero Johnny Sexton:""It was one of those moments - I'm just happy I got another chance as we have worked so hard over the last few weeks and all our goals would have crumbled today if we had lost. ""It's great to be in the position we are now after getting an away win. I had a kick to put us two scores clear but I just snatched at it so I was happy to get another chance to secure victory for the boys. ""The boys' legs were out and I don't think we could have got through another couple of phases. ""The management drill into us every day that it's never over and we have got some good characters in the team. We just wanted to get off to a good start.""

Airlines probed over seating policyA review will examine whether passengers are deliberately split up so they pay to sit together.27m27 minutes agoUK,"A review is being launched into airlines' seating policies, the Civil Aviation Authority says. It will examine whether companies are deliberately splitting up groups of passengers so they pay to sit together. Airlines allocate seating via computer algorithms. The BBC has been told of many incidents of family and friends being split. A spokeswoman for Ryanair said: ""Our policy is very clear for our customers."" The CAA said it wanted to make sure seat allocation practices were ""fair and transparent"". CAA research of more than 4,000 passengers who had travelled as part of a group on 10 airlines in the last year found that just over half of respondents were told they would have to pay more to sit together before they booked. However, almost half believed that their airline would automatically allocate them seats together. Of the group of respondents that paid extra to sit together, six in 10 said they did so because of the risk that their airline might split up their group. Natalie Williams was separated from her two young children At least twice a year, Natalie Williams takes her children to visit her parents, who live in Portugal. Returning to the UK after an Easter holiday in 2017, she checked in online and found the family of four had been completely separated. ""That meant a two-year-old child and five-year-old travelling on their own. ""We were not even anywhere near them. I didn't think that was acceptable,"" she says. She says no one was available to help at the main desk or at the gate, so she was left to ask other passengers to move so that they could travel in pairs and her children would not be alone. ""Luckily both travellers were happy to help and get separated from their own group."" Ms Williams has complained to TAP Air Portugal but has not received a response. Gill Willis paid extra to sit next to her husband on a Ryanair flight back from Fuerteventura in 2017. ""When we got on the plane the lady next to us was behind her husband and the seat I had originally been allocated remained empty next to him. ""So there was no need to have paid extra as they could have just rearranged so the two couples sat together,"" she said. She added: ""It is just a money making rip-off exercise. I really hope something is done as it is completely unnecessary."" Andrew Haines, chief executive of the CAA, said airline seating practices were ""clearly causing some confusion"" and its research showed some passengers were paying to sit together when they might not need to. ""We will be looking into how airlines decide where to seat passengers that have booked as part of a group and whether any airlines are pro-actively splitting up groups of passengers when, in fact, they could be sat together,"" he said. ""We will not hesitate to take any necessary enforcement action should it be required at the end of the review,"" he added. Sprawling Maya cities uncovered by lasers Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack Spain cracks king's 500-year-old code A spokeswoman for Ryanair said the airline was happy to co-operate. ""Our policy is very clear for our customers and seats can be purchased from just â¬2 and kids travelling in families get free seats,"" she said. In a statement, EasyJet said: ""Unlike some airlines, if passengers choose not to pay to select their seats, EasyJet's seating system is programmed to try and seat families together when they check-in online by using an algorithm."" 2017 safest year for air travel Soaring airport drop-off fees 'severe' Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

She did not make specific allegations against Weinstein at the time.But she details her claims in a 3,000-word feature published in the New York Times on Saturday, entitled: ""This is why Uma Thurman is angry"",external. Harvey Weinstein has been at the centre of a string of abuse allegations Among the revelations in the article are that Thurman was sexually assaulted at age 16, at the beginning of her career. She met an actor - who is not named - at a Manhattan nightclub, and was ""coerced"" when she returned to his home for a late-night drink. ""I was ultimately compliant,"" she told the newspaper. ""I tried to say no, I cried, I did everything I could do. He told me the door was locked but I never ran over and tried the knob."" ""When I got home, I remember I stood in front of the mirror and I looked at my hands and I was so mad at them for not being bloody or bruised."" Her allegations regarding Weinstein took place in the time period after the success of the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction, which was produced by Weinstein. The alleged incident took place at his suite in London's Savoy Hotel. ""He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me... He did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" Thurman told the Times. ""But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard."" She said a bunch of flowers arrived the next day with a note reading: ""You have great instincts."" And that in the aftermath, Weinstein's assistants kept calling about new film projects. A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein - who is in rehab - issued a statement in the wake of the story's publication. It said his team had contacted the New York Times and sent photographs ""that demonstrate the strong relationship Mr Weinstein and Ms Thurman had"". The newspaper acknowledged receiving ""chummy photos"" of the pair at premieres and parties. ""Mr Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms Thurman in England after misreading her signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which he immediately apologised and deeply regrets,"" the statement said. ""However, her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue."" ""There was no physical contact during Mr Weinstein's awkward pass and [he] is saddened and puzzled as to why Ms Thurman... waited 25 years to make these allegations public"". How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Harvey Weinstein's accusers Weinstein 'derailed my career' Weinstein threatened to kill me - Hayek Thurman also detailed the rift between herself and director Quentin Tarantino, who - alongside Weinstein - made Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, two of Thurman's most successful films. Tarantino 'knew enough' about Weinstein Quentin Tarantino, Uma Thurman, and Harvey Weinstein, pictured at the Kill Bill Vol 2 after party in 2004 But she revealed that she fell out with Tarantino over a car crash scene in Kill Bill. She alleges that there were known issues with the convertible car, that Tarantino was ""furious"" at her insistence that they use a stunt driver during filming, and persuaded her to drive the car - which crashed, injuring her. The incident would mar the pair's relationship. Thurman threatened to sue Weinstein's studio but says she was denied access to the crash footage for 15 years. Tarantino has yet to issue any public statement about Thurman's claims.

Treasury 'fiddling figures' on Brexit,"Jacob Rees-Mogg chairs the Conservative Party's European Research Group Prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Treasury officials of ""fiddling the figures"" on Brexit to keep the UK in the European Union customs union. It comes amid claims, which the Treasury has denied, that it had deliberately created an economic model that made all other options look bad. The FDA union, which represents civil servants, attacked the MP for peddling ""unsubstantiated conspiracy theories"". The Treasury said it was working hard to deliver the best deal for Britain. Conservative MP Mr Rees-Mogg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If you look at the forecasts the Treasury made before the referendum, they were a humiliation. ""They were clearly politically influenced."" But FDA general secretary David Penman said the comments were ""clear evidence"" that the MP was ""prepared to sacrifice anyone or anything on the altar of his own ideology"". He told the BBC Theresa May had to ""get a grip on both her ministers - who are peddling these myths as well - and on Conservative politicians"". He said it should be the prime minister or Cabinet ministers defending the civil service - not him, and called for an end to ""constant swiping at the messenger"" which was undermining trust in the government and the civil service. The Treasury said that both the prime minister and the chancellor have repeatedly stated the UK will be leaving the single market and the customs union and that ""any suggestion to the contrary is simply false"". Brexit minister in civil service apology Protesters disrupt Jacob Rees-Mogg speech How to make sense of Brexit forecasts Reality Check: What is a customs union? Mr Rees-Mogg said former chancellor George Osborne had set up the Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent analysis of the UK's public finances, because Treasury forecasts ""had been politicised"". ""And it was thought they were unreliable on political grounds,"" he added. ""With the referendum and with the EU, the Treasury has gone back to making forecasts. ""It was politically advantageous for them in the past. It is the same now. ""So yes, I do think they are fiddling the figures."" By BBC political correspondent Matthew Cole This is more than a row about a backbench MP challenging Treasury figures he doesn't like. Jacob Rees-Mogg leads a section of MPs on whom Theresa May's future might depend. That bloc - the Tories' European Research Group - are vehemently opposed to the UK staying in ANY form of customs union with the EU after Brexit. This week, key ministerial meetings will take place on that very subject, with Theresa May known to be against staying in THE customs union, but open-minded to setting up a less expansive arrangement. So Jacob Rees-Mogg's intervention could be taken as upping the ante, exerting extra pressure on Mrs May ahead of this big week, which could provide crucial answers to our future relations with the EU, and to the prime minister's future. His comments came after Theresa May, on the final day of her official visit to China, appeared to suggest some sort of customs agreement with the EU could be possible - even though ministers have said Britain will leave the existing customs union. Mr Rees-Mogg stated any such deal would be unacceptable to Tory Brexiteers as it would prevent the UK from striking free trade deals with other countries. ""We need to be free to do deals with the rest of the world,"" he said. ""We must be out of the protectionist common external tariff which mainly protects inefficient EU industries at the cost to British consumers."" It is the second time this week that Mr Rees-Mogg has condemned civil servants' economic forecast concerning the impact of Brexit. The row began on Tuesday with areport leaked to Buzzfeed,externalwhich said growth would be lower in each of three different Brexit outcomes than if the UK had stayed in the EU. The government said its preferred option however - a bespoke deal covering trade and financial services - was not among those analysed in the leaked paper. But in the Commons on Thursday, Mr Rees-Mogg asked Brexit minister Steve Baker to confirm whether he had heard that officials were deliberately trying to influence policy in favour of staying in the EU customs union. He attributed the remarks to Charles Grant, the head of the Centre for European Reform. On Friday, Mr Baker apologised to MPs for saying Mr Rees-Mogg's account of the remarks was ""essentially correct"". Mr Grant had denied making them and an audio recording emerged where he did not say what was attributed to him. However, Mr Rees-Mogg said he stood by his original claim. Mr Grant told the BBC he was surprised that Mr Rees-Mogg had not apologised to him. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called Mr Rees-Mogg's claims about the Treasury ""absolutely outrageous"". ""The government should be thinking about all possibilities and how to minimise the damage from Brexit,"" he said. ""Serious Conservatives inside and outside government are saying that whatever happens with Brexit, we should remain in a customs union. ""The Treasury would be failing in its duty if it didn't examine that possibility seriously; we should be inside a customs union whatever happens.""

"UK police look into more Weinstein claimsTwo more women have made allegations against the Hollywood producer, it has emerged.6m6 minutes agoUK","Harvey Weinstein, pictured in 2013, was one of Hollywood's most powerful men UK police investigating Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein are looking at allegations of sexual assault against two more women, it has emerged. The alleged offences, reported to police in October and November, took place in the Republic of Ireland in 1991, Westminster in 2011 and abroad in 2010, the Metropolitan Police said. These bring the number of women making accusations to the Met to nine. Mr Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. On 31 October a woman told UK police that she had been assaulted by Mr Weinstein in the Republic of Ireland. This allegation has been passed on to Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na - the Irish police force. On 13 November a ninth alleged victim told police she had been attacked in Westminster in 2011 and a location outside the UK in 2010. Scotland Yard says the allegation will be passed to the relevant force. Uma Thurman says the alleged incident took place in Mr Weinstein's suite at London's Savoy Hotel This comes on the same day thatactress Uma Thurman alleged that Mr Weinstein assaulted her in a London hotel roomafter the success of the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction. In a New York Times article,,externalshe says Weinstein pushed her down and ""tried to expose himself"" before she managed to ""wriggle away"". ""He did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" she says. ""But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard."" A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein - who is in rehab - said: ""Mr Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms Thurman in England after misreading her signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which he immediately apologised and deeply regrets.

Robertson quits as SNP deputy leader,"Angus Robertson lost his Moray seat in the UK general election last June Angus Robertson has announced he is standing down as deputy leader of the SNP with immediate effect. He lost his Moray constituency to Conservative Douglas Ross in the UK general election last June. In a letter informing Nicola Sturgeon of his decision he said his mandate had been to partner her at Westminster but that it was now time to move on. He said in a tweet he would ""always be there to help Scotland reach its full potential"". Analysis by BBC Scotland Westminister correspondent Nick Eardley We don't know for sure when the SNP's new deputy leader will be chosen - arrangements will be decided in ""due course"", the party says. It comes at an interesting time. The independence campaign was effectively parked after last year's election. But it's an issue the SNP Scottish government will have to decide on sooner rather than later in the context of Brexit. Clearly everyone who goes for the job will support independence, but how will the candidates approach the idea of a referendum in the next couple of years? And how will the membership react? Some thought after the election that the party needs to be more radical to counter Jeremy Corbyn's Labour. Someone from the party's left might fancy a stab at the deputy leader job. Mr Robertson was a respected figure at Westminster. In his resignation letter, he says he no longer felt able to fulfil his mandate as Nicola Sturgeon's eyes and ears in the Commons. The party may well want to keep its top two split between the two parliaments. It's also likely some at Holyrood will mull over a bid. Last time an MEP and a councillor threw their hats in the ring too. There's plenty to watch out for in the next few months. Tweeting a response to Mr Robertson, the first minister Ms Sturgeon described him as an ""outstanding"" deputy leader. She added: ""You should be very proud of your enormous contribution to our party's success. I wish you well and hope to see you back in frontline politics in the future."" In his letter Mr Robertson wrote: ""Since the 2017 general election I have been focussed on supporting campaign best practice for local SNP branches, constituency associations, elected members and the party nationally. ""As discussed recently, I believe I am no longer able to fully discharge my mandate, which was to partner you as Westminster SNP leader and as a parliamentarian representing a rural constituency. ""While it would be my greatest privilege to continue as deputy leader, I know you understand that I have to focus now on pursuing new career opportunities."" He added he was ""tremendously honoured"" to have held the role, and would now work to support public policy development in Scotland as an advisory board member of the Scottish Policy Foundation. Angus Robertson with Nicola Sturgeon and other SNP MPs after the announcement of last year's snap general election Ms Sturgeon told the former MP he had ""always been a source of wise counsel"" to her, noting that when he was first elected to Westminster the SNP had just five MPs. The party went on to win 56 of the 59 seats up for grabs in Scotland in the 2015 general election, although it lost 21 of those constituencies some two years later. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Our political and electoral success over the last decade has been nothing short of extraordinary - and the party owes you an enormous debt of gratitude for the personal role you have played in bringing about that success. ""That includes your part in the 2014 referendum which brought the country closer to independence than ever before."" After losing his seat in the general election, Mr Robertson was replaced as SNP Westminster leader by Ian Blackford. Mr Robertson had won widespread praise for his performance at PMQs, with many political opponents commending his questioning of the prime minister. When he waselected to the deputy leader role in October 2016he succeed Stewart Hosie, who quit the position following claims about his personal life. The contest then was decided through a single transferable vote system that saw members rank the candidates in order of preference. All five of the party's last leaders - Nicola Sturgeon, Alex Salmond, John Swinney, Gordon Wilson and Billy Wolfe - had previously served as the party's deputy leader.

Italy drive-by attack targets immigrants,"A handgun was found in the suspect's car Italian police have arrested a gunman suspected of carrying out a drive-by shooting spree that targeted African immigrants. At least six people were wounded in the central town of Macerata. The suspect, named locally as Luca Traini, 28, had an Italian flag wrapped around his neck when he was detained. He had taken part in regional elections for the anti-immigration Northern League last year and reportedly made a fascist salute when he was captured. Italy votes in national elections on 4 March, with immigration one of the key issues. The suspect, named locally as Luca Traini, following his detention Mr Traini, who is from the surrounding Le Marche region, did not resist when he was detained after fleeing from his car near the town's war memorial. He is now being questioned. Police found a gun in his car. The shooting had begun two hours earlier at about 11:00 local time (10:00 GMT), La Repubblica website reports. The mayor had warned people to stay indoors during the incident, which saw shootings across a number of locations. The victims are being treated in hospital. At least one of them is said to be in a serious condition. The shootings took place in various parts of the town Video of the moment the suspect was apprehended,externalwas published by local website, Il Resto del Carlino, showing a white bald man draped in an Italian tricolour being escorted away by police. Italian police also tweeted a photo of the moment of capture, saying one of the wounded had required surgery. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Shots had been fired in the Via Spalato and Via dei Velini parts of town, two key areas in an investigation into the murder of an 18-year-old girl whose body was found dismembered and hidden in two suitcases last Wednesday. A 29-year-old Nigerian male migrant has been detained over the killing of Pamela Mastropietro. Several racist comments calling for revenge attacks were posted on the Facebook page of the victim's mother in the run up to Saturday's shootings, Ansa reports. Local reports are linking the two incidents. Bullet holes were found on shop windows in the area targeted by the gunman Right-wing politicians have been using Pamela Mastropietro's killing to promote their anti-migrant message as part of their campaign for the general election. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni has temporarily suspended campaigning over the shootings. Opinion polls suggest a centre-right bloc, including the Northern League, Forza Italia and the far-right Brothers of Italy, will win the most seats but not a working majority. With about 28% support in the opinion polls, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement is the most popular single party. This suggests there could be tough coalition negotiations, or even another election, after 4 March.

"'Forget walking 10,000 steps a day'","This video can not be played Many people consider 10,000 steps a daily target to remain healthy These days it is hard to walk the streets without running into someone who is anxiously looking at their wrist to see if they are on target to reach the magic 10,000 steps. Is it really a goal worth striving for, or might there be something better? And where did that figure come from? You might be surprised to hear it was the result of a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. In the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, a company came up with a device which they started marketing to the health-conscious. It was called a Manpo-Kei. In Japanese, ""man"" means 10,000, ""po"" means steps and ""kei"" means meter. So it was, literally, a 10,000 steps meter. The device was an early pedometer, based on the work of Dr Yoshiro Hatano, a young academic at Kyushu University of Health and Welfare. Dr Hatano was worried that the Japanese were busy importing a slothful American lifestyle, as well as a love of watching baseball, and wanted to help them get more active. He reckoned that if he could persuade his fellow Japanese to increase their daily steps from 4,000 to around 10,000 then they would burn off approximately 500 extra calories a day and remain slim. That, apparently, was how the ""10,000 steps a day"" regime was born. It was clearly a great marketing success. But is it still the most effective way to improve our fitness? ForThe Truth about Getting Fit, I went to a factory in Sheffield with Prof Rob Copeland from Sheffield Hallam University. Our aim was to do a small experiment in which we would compare the benefits and ease of doing 10,000 steps against something called, ""Active 10,external"". With Active 10 you don't need to count steps. You simply aim to do three brisk 10-minute walks a day. Our volunteers all had different reasons for wanting to get fitter. Some of the volunteers who took part in our test Dave said: ""I'm very aware that I'm not as fit as I used to be and I've put a lot of weight on,"" while Judy confessed: ""My only activity at the moment is knitting."" And Nathan, who has a six-year-old daughter, said: ""She runs so fast, and I run so slowly, I can't catch her up."" Our small group of volunteers was fitted with activity monitors so we could not only monitor what they did, but also how vigorously they did it. First, a normal day's activity was measured. Rob then split them into two groups.  One was asked to hit the 10,000-step target - around five miles - in a day, while the other group was asked to do three sessions of ""Active 10"" - which adds up to around 1.5 miles - more like 3,000 steps. The Active 10 group were also told that their aim was not to amble but to get their pace up so that they would be working their heart and lungs. Prof Copeland told them: ""You are aiming to walk fast enough so that you can still talk but not sing."" When we looked at the volunteers' results, two out of the three asked to do 10,000 steps had managed to hit their target. But they had all struggled. The Active 10 group, on the other hand, had found it relatively easy. They had formed a small walking group and met together at convenient times during their working day to go for a brisk walk together. So 10,000 steps was harder to achieve - but which activity was better for health? Better to go briskly... Prof Copeland had analysed the data from their tracking monitors and he said the findings were very clear. ""The Active 10 group actually did 30% more 'moderate to vigorous physical activity' than the 10,000-step group, even though they moved for less time. ""And it's when you are doing moderate intensity activity that you are starting to get the greatest health benefits."" So even though the Active 10 group spent less time actually moving, they spent more time getting out of breath and increasing their heart rate. Prof Copeland told the group: ""What we really wanted you to do was to get your heart beating faster. There's lots of evidence to suggest that by doing so you can lower your risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers."" So three short brisk walks were easier to fit into the day and better for health. I thought that was really interesting and I found it very encouraging, because I really don't like doing 10,000 steps. So the fact that you can get similar, perhaps greater, benefits from a few brisk walks a day is enormously encouraging. To start doing some Active 10s in your day go to theNHS website,externalwhere you can download a free Public Health England app. It is a good way to see how much brisk walking you're doing, and how to do more.

Russian fighter jet 'shot down' in Syria,"Images said to show the wreckage of the Sukhoi-25 A Russian Sukhoi-25 ground-attack aircraft has been shot down in a rebel-held area in Syria's north-western province of Idlib. The Russian defence ministry said the pilot had ejected into an area believed to be controlled by the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham alliance. Although he survived the crash he was killed in a ground fight, Moscow said. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - formerly linked to al-Qaeda - said it had shot down the plane. The Syrian government, backed by Russian air power, launched a major offensive in December against rebel groups in Idlib. Why is there a war in Syria? The Sukhoi-25, a close-support ground-attack aircraft, was operating over the town of Maasran in Idlib. There had been dozens of Russian air strikes in the area over the previous 24 hours, monitoring groups said. It is not yet known who shot the plane down or how Video posted on social media showed the jet being hit and quickly catching fire, before spiralling to the ground. Video from the ground showed the wreckage with red stars on the wings. Russia's defence ministry said: ""The pilot had enough time to report that he had ejected in an area controlled by the militants"". ""During a battle with terrorists, the pilot was killed."" Other video on social media showed a bloodied body in a uniform. In a statement released on social media, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group claimed it had shot down the plane using a shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile. The group said the plane had been carrying out an air raid over the nearby city of Saraqeb. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has operated in the region for years under a series of different names. Tahrir al-Sham: Al-Qaeda's latest incarnation in Syria The defence ministry said it was making all possible efforts to retrieve the body. However, social media posts also reported a salvo of cruise missiles had been fired into Idlib province from Russian navy vessels in the Mediterranean. The Russian defence ministry confirmed only that ""a series of high-precision weapons strikes has been delivered on the area"". Very. It could be the first time rebels have shot down a Russian jet since Moscow began its Syria campaign in September 2015, although rebels did bring down a helicopter in 2016. This video can not be played This video shows a plane falling to the ground on the Syrian border with Turkey About 45 Russian military personnel have been confirmed dead in Syria, along with an unknown number of contractors. Here are the air force losses: Dec 2017: Shelling damages several planes at the Hmeimim airbase, with two Russian servicemen killed Dec 2016:A Tu-154 carrying 92 people - including army musicians - crashes into the Black Seaafter taking off for Syria from Sochi, killing all on board Aug 2016: All five people on board a helicopter are killed when it is shot down over Idlib Nov 2015:Turkish warplanes shoot down a Sukhoi-24. One pilot is killed, the other rescued. The incident sparks a severe deterioration of bilateral relations It is supposed to be a ""de-escalation zone"", as agreed by Turkey, Russia and Iran. But fighting escalated in November and the Syrian government launched a major offensive there in December. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is the main adversary. The UN says some 100,000 civilians have been displacedby the fighting. There are 2.65 million people in north-western Syria as a whole, the UN says, and 1.16 million of them are internally displaced people (IDPs). No. Turkey launched an operation on 20 January called ""Olive Branch"" aimed at removing Kurdish militiamen from Afrin, to the north-west of the city of Aleppo. The Turkish army said seven Turkish soldiers were killed in action on Saturday, including five who died in an attack on a tank by the Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) militia.

Minister in civil service apology,"A Brexit minister has apologised in Parliament for comments he made about the independence of the civil service. Steve Baker said he had been told Treasury officials were deliberately trying to influence policy in favour of staying in the EU customs union. Charles Grant, an EU policy expert said to have been the source of the claims, has since denied telling Mr Baker this. Mr Baker told MPs he now accepted this and insisted that he had the ""highest regard"" for the civil service. Calls to publish Brexit study rejected Fox: End obsession with Europe What are the UK's Brexit trade options? In a short speech in the Commons before proceedings began on Friday, Mr Baker said he wanted to set the record straight. ""As I explained yesterday (Thursday) I considered what I understood to be the suggestion being put to me as implausible because of the long standing and well regarded impartiality of the civil service,"" he said. After Mr Baker's claims emerged on Thursday, Mr Grant, the Centre for European Reform think tank chief, issued a statement. He said he recalled telling the minister at an event at the Conservative Party conference that he was aware of Treasury research showing the economic costs of leaving the customs union outweighed the benefits of striking free trade deals. But he added: ""I did not say or imply that the Treasury had deliberately developed a model to show that all non-customs union options were bad, with the intention to influence policy."" An audio recording of Mr Grant's lunch at the Tory conference hassince been published online,external. In his apology, Mr Baker said: ""In the context of that audio I accept that I should have corrected or dismissed the premise of my Hon Friend's question. ""I have apologised to Charles Grant who is an honest and trustworthy man. ""As I have put on record many times I have the highest regard for our hard-working civil servants. I am grateful for this early opportunity to correct the record, and I apologise to the House."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Downing Street said it was ""the right thing to do"" for Mr Baker to have made a ""heartfelt"" apology for his comments, adding: ""We consider this matter closed."" Theresa May's spokesman said the prime minister had not personally spoken to Mr Baker about the row but No 10 officials did have a word with him after the recording of Mr Grant's lunch emerged. The row was sparked by Commons exchanges on Thursday at Brexit questions. Prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg asked Mr Baker to confirm if he had heard Mr Grant that ""officials in the Treasury have deliberately developed a model to show that all options other than staying in the customs union were bad and that officials intended to use this to influence policy"". In response, Mr Baker said he was ""sorry to say"" that Mr Rees-Mogg's account was ""essentially correct"", adding: ""At the time I considered it implausible because my direct experience is that civil servants are extraordinarily careful to uphold the impartiality of the civil service."" Mr Baker, a leading backbench Eurosceptic before his promotion to a ministerial post, was challenged by opposition MPs as he delivered his answer to Mr Rees-Mogg, prompting him to add: ""I didn't say it was correct. I said the account that was put to me is correct. ""It was put to me, I considered it an extraordinary allegation, I still consider it an extraordinary allegation."" Following Mr Baker's apology, Mr Rees-Mogg is continuing to insist that the Treasury has questions to answer over its stance on the customs union. Allow Twitter content?

"Idlib offensive 'displaces 100,000'","Fighting in south-eastern areas of Idlib province has forced civilians from their homes Some 100,000 Syrian civilians have been displaced by a government offensive on the country's largest remaining rebel stronghold, the United Nations says. Since the start of November, fighting and air strikes have intensified in the north-western province of Idlib and neighbouring parts of Hama and Aleppo. The UN says the situation for those forced from their homes is ""dire"". Turkey, which backs the rebels, has called on the government's allies, Russia and Iran, to halt the offensive. Idlib was designated a ""de-escalation zone"" under an agreement between the three countries, and Turkish troops are deployed to observation points in the province. Attacks in rebel-held Idlib 'kill 40' Russia thwarts drone attack on Syria base Syria hospitals 'targeted by attacks' Some 2.65 million people are living in north-western Syria, including 1.16 million internally displaced people (IDPs), according to the UN. In the past year, more than 500,000 people have arrived in rebel-held areas from other parts of the country, leaving already-stretched humanitarian organisations struggling to help those in need. The escalation in fighting between pro-government forces and rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an al-Qaeda-linked jihadist alliance that dominates Idlib, has caused civilian casualties, damaged infrastructure and led to mass displacement. The UN said last week that 60,000 people had fled their homes since 1 November. On Wednesday, an official told the BBC the figure had climbed to 100,000. Analysis by Lyse Doucet, BBC News, Damascus Syrian official sources admit Russia made it clear it does not support major military offensives now against rebel-held Idlib province and the besieged Eastern Ghouta, outside Damascus. Both were designated last year as ""de-escalation"" zones by Russia, Turkey and Iran. One official said Moscow, hoping to offer a goodwill gesture, recently reassured Turkey that there would be no military escalation close to its border. But President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to take back 100% of Syrian territory, including Idlib, which is dominated by hardline Islamist fighters. Moscow is trying to organise what it calls a ""national dialogue"" among Syrian groups later this month in Sochi. It knows it needs to maximise its slim chances of success. It is a reminder to Western and Arab officials, who see Russia as a last source of pressure on the Syrian leader, that Damascus does not always do the bidding of its most important military ally. On the ground in Idlib, troops and allied militiamen continued to advance towards the strategically important Abu al-Zuhour airbase, which rebels seized when they took control of most of Idlib in 2015. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that another 16 villages had been retaken by the government, bringing the total to more than 135 in three months. An explosion in the centre of Idlib city on Sunday night left at least 28 people dead Warplanes had also carried out several raids around the Abu al-Zuhour base, as well as on the Khan Sheikoun, al-Tamanaa, Maarat al-Numan and Jarjanaz areas, it said. Air strikes across Idlib on Sunday reportedly left at least 21 people dead. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein condemned the upsurge in civilian casualties in Idlib,external, as well as in a besieged rebel enclave outside the capital, Damascus, called the Eastern Ghouta, where at least 85 civilians have been killed and 183 injured since 31 December. This video can not be played Fifteen-year-old Muhammed lives in the rebel-held area of Eastern Ghouta Earlier,Turkey's foreign minister told Anadolu news agency that the advances by Syrian government forces could not have taken place without Russian and Iranian support,external, and demanded they ""fulfil their responsibilities"". Mevlut Cavusoglu warned that the Idlib offensive was endangering efforts to broker a political solution to the conflict, including a planned ""national dialogue"" congress in the Russian resort city of Sochi later this month. ""It's not just a simple air strike. The regime is moving in Idlib, the intent here is different,"" he said. ""If the aim here is to make some unwilling opposition groups go to Sochi, it will backfire.""

Calls to publish study rejected,"This video can not be played Minister: There's a campaign to overturn Brexit vote The government says it will not publish a leaked report document predicting an economic hit from Brexit. Brexit Minister Steve Baker said the document was at a ""preliminary"" stage and releasing it in full could damage the UK's negotiations with the EU. According to BuzzFeed,,externalthe report said growth would be lower in each of three different Brexit outcomes than if the UK had stayed in the EU. Labour has called for it to be published and debated in Parliament. According to Buzzfeed, the leaked document, titled EU Exit Analysis - Cross Whitehall Briefing and drawn up for the Department for Exiting the EU, suggests almost every part of the economy would suffer. It looked at scenarios ranging from leaving with no deal to remaining within the EU single market. Kuenssberg: More Brexit trouble for May EU sets out Brexit transition demands Brexit: All you need to know Responding to an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Baker said the document was ""not anywhere near being approved by ministers"" and that ministers in his team had only just seen it. He described the document as a ""preliminary attempt to improve on the flawed analysis around the EU referendum"" and said it did not assess the government's preferred option of a bespoke free trade deal. It ""does not yet take account of the opportunities of leaving the EU"", he said, adding that civil service forecasts were ""always wrong, and wrong for good reasons"". Responding to calls for it to be published, Mr Baker said MPs would get as much information as possible before they vote on the final Brexit deal but said: ""We don't propose to go into these negotiations having revealed all of our thinking."" And as Brexiteer MPs hit out at the leaking of the document, he said there was ""clearly"" a campaign to overturn the 2016 EU referendum by some people in the media and the House of Commons. One Conservative MP, Antoinette Sandbach, told Mr Baker she took exception to being told it was not in the national interest for her to see the document. And responding for Labour, Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said the emergence of the report was ""piling absurdity on absurdity"" with the government having previously denied the existence of Brexit impact assessments. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""For months, Theresa May's government have refused to produce any detailed analysis of the potential impact of various Brexit scenarios - now we know why they have so desperately engaged in a cover-up."" The BBC understands the Treasury contributed to the document but sources say it is part of a much wider range of work going on in Whitehall. May urged to 'see off hard Brexiteers' Reality Check: What the EU wants from transition talks The report suggests UK economic growth would be 8% lower than current forecasts, in 15 years' time, if the country left the bloc with no deal and reverted to World Trade Organisation rules. It says growth would be 5% lower if Britain negotiated a free trade deal and 2% lower even if the UK were to continue to adhere to the rules of the single market. All scenarios assume a new deal with the US. Conservative MP Philip Davies blamed the report on ""London-centric remoaners"" in the civil service ""who didn't want us to leave the European Union in the first place and put together some dodgy figures to back up their case"". Earlier Conservative MP and leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the document should be taken ""with a pinch of salt"" as almost every single forecast on Brexit has been wrong. A government source said the report ""contains a significant number of caveats and is hugely dependant on a wide range of assumptions"". The FDA, which represents senior civil servants, reacted angrily to Mr Baker's dismissal of the leaked study. ""We have just witnessed the extraordinary scene of a serving minister telling the House that, whatever analysis his own department comes up with, he simply won't believe it,"" said the union's general secretary Dave Penman. Liam Fox says some Tory colleagues must ""live with disappointment"" Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has denied telling Tory Brexiteers to prepare for disappointment. Speakingto The Sun,externalabout pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, he criticised Tory MPs involved with negative briefings, saying ""nothing that would happen would change the parliamentary arithmetic"". ""We don't have a working majority, other than with the support of the Democratic Unionists, and we need to accept the reality of that. I know that there are always disappointed individuals but they're going to have to live with disappointment."" Mr Fox told the BBC his warning was to Mrs May's critics that they will be ""disappointed"" in their efforts to topple her or secure cabinet positions for themselves.

Tomb of ancient priestess found in Egypt,"This video can not be played The tomb is believed to belong to a priestess to the goddess of fertility Archaeologists in Egypt have unveiled the newly discovered tomb of an ancient priestess that dates back 4,400 years. The tomb found near Cairo is adorned with well-preserved and rare wall paintings depicting the priestess, Hetpet, in a variety of scenes. Hetpet was a priestess to the goddess of fertility Hathor, who assisted women in childbirth. It was found during excavations near the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt's antiquities ministry says. This site, in Giza's western cemetery, housed officials from the Old Kingdom's Fifth Dynasty, some of which have already been dug up since 1842. ""We know of course that she was a high official and that she had a strong link with the royal palace,"" Egyptian Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani said, describing Hetpet on Saturday. The tomb ""has the architectural style and the decorative  elements of the Fifth Dynasty, with an entrance leading to an 'L' shaped  shrine,"" the ministry said. The wall paintings inside were in ""a very good conservation condition depicting Hetpet standing in different hunting and fishing scenes or... receiving offerings from her children"". Sprawling Maya cities uncovered by lasers 'Big void' identified in Great Pyramid Ancient child burials found in Egypt Scenes of music and dancing performances, as well as monkeys featured as domestic animals were also depicted. One wall painting shows a monkey dancing in front of an orchestra. ""Such scenes are rare... and have only been found previously in the (Old Kingdom) tomb of 'Ka-Iber' where a painting shows a monkey dancing in front of a guitarist not an orchestra,"" Mostafa Waziri of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told AFP news agency. Minister Anani said he was hopeful of further discoveries at the site, which is located about 20km (12 miles) south of Cairo.

UK backs up Carillion contractor loans,"Contractors affected by the collapse of outsourcing giant Carillion will be able to apply for government-backed loans from High Street lenders. Thousands of Carillion suppliers were left unpaid after the construction giant collapsed in January. Ministers say the state-owned British Business Bank will guarantee Â£100m of lending to those firms, which should make it easier for them to borrow. This is in addition tofunds created by Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC and RBS. Business Secretary Greg Clark said he wanted small and medium-sized businesses who were owed money by Carillion to know ""they will be supported to continue trading"". Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, urged companies to ""take full advantage"" the British Business Bank. ""There is a confidence issue... you've got a very complex supply chain, much of which depends on creditworthiness, and I can see their problem,"" he said. Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Hospital cost may rise due to Carillion collapse Carillion collapse sparks break up call for 'Big four' Carillion tried to 'wriggle out' of pension contributions Carillion, the UK's second-largest construction company, manages a huge variety of public sector and private projects around the UK, from rebuilding Battersea Power Station to cleaning prisons. It collapsed, under a debt pile of Â£1.5bn, on 15 January. It had employed 43,000 people, including around 20,000 in the UK. Almost380 workers at Carillionwill be made redundant. Carillion contractors who may not have the security otherwise needed for conventional bank lendingcan apply to lenders,externalincluding Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest, Santander, and TSB, for a so-calledEnterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) borrowing facility,external. Banks are cushioned from businesses defaulting on the loans by taxpayer cash - 75% of any losses to the lender will be picked up by the British Business Bank if the loan cannot be paid back. Additionally the UK banking sector has promised to take the circumstances surrounding Carillion into consideration if individuals face problems repaying loans, overdrafts or mortgages. By Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent The government is determined to show that it has a grip on the Carillion crisis. And it needs to. At stake are not just the thousands of jobs directly employed but also the thousands of SMEs such as suppliers and contractors indirectly dependent on the former construction giant who will now not repay its debts. On top of that there's the ideology behind the likes of Carillion and outsourcing in general. Private finance initiatives and getting companies to do public sector work is an article of faith for the Conservative Party. If thousands of small firms collapse in a domino fashion due to Carillion, then the PFI as a policy will come under intense scrutiny. 377 Carillion workers to lose jobs Collapse sparks 'big four' probe Carillion 'wriggled out' of obligations Banks to support firms hit by Carillion Where did it go wrong for Carillion?

N Korea insists on Olympic military show,"North Korea's military parades can be large affairs North Korea has defended plans for a large-scale military parade scheduled for the day before the Winter Olympics in South Korea. Pyongyang's annual military parade to mark the founding of its armed forces has taken place in April for 40 years. From 2018, however, it has been changed to 8 February - when athletes will gather in Pyeongchang for the opening ceremony the following day. North Korea said that no-one had the right to take issue with its plans. A column in the ruling Workers' Party newspaper - the Rodong Sinmun - dismissed views that the event was provocative. Instead, the newspaper said,  it is ""basic common sense that any country in the world takes the founding anniversary of its military very seriously and celebrates it"". Pyongyang previously held its main military celebration on 25 April. The 2018 celebration, however, will mark the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the Korean People's Army, which was established on 8 February 1948. But professor Robert Kelly of Busan University in Seoul said Pyongyang's decision to hold the parade at such a time was politically motivated. ""It's going to be gigantic, it's a day before the Olympics - that kind of sends a signal,"" he said. ""Even though South Korea can have all these foreigners come to its country, this big peaceful exciting event with all this global attention - you know everybody still has to pay attention"" to the North. Monitoring group 38 North, however, said that whilesatellite imagery showed ""at least 12,000 troops"" gathered at a parade training facility,external, current evidence suggested February's event ""will remain relatively smaller in scale"" than previous parades. Tensions on the Korean peninsula remained extremely high throughout 2017, as North Korea completed a series of nuclear tests and missile launches designed to demonstrate its nuclear capability. North Korea's military parades usually feature thousands of troops and a display of missiles or other military hardware. At time when thousands of foreign athletes, officials, and spectators have gathered just 300km (185 miles) to the south, the planned event has been met with trepidation. North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's missile programme North Korea flouting sanctions, UN told This 15 April 2017 parade commemorated the late Kim Il-Sung's 105th birthday US Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told a press briefing earlier this week: ""We would prefer that this parade not occur"". ""The Olympic Games are about the athletes and nothing should be occurring which interfere with that,"" he added. But he downplayed security concerns, saying South Korea was doing ""a phenomenal job"" in its preparation. Concerns about security at the Winter Olympics eased in January, when North Korean leader Kim Jong-un appeared to extend an olive branch in his new year's speech. Since then, the Pyeongchang games have been the subject of sudden co-operation between the two Koreas. Olympic rings are on display across South Korea in preparation for the games The two countries have dramatically improved ties in just a few weeks, reopening lines of communication and negotiating a joint presence at the games. Rap video frosty welcome for Winter Olympics North Korean duo invited to Paralympics South Korea 'clear-eyed' about North talks They will march under a unified banner, and field a joint women's ice hockey team. Now, there are hopes that the progress made could lead to wider political solutions. In January,South Korea's foreign minister said she would continue high-level talks with ""clear eyes""- and that despite concerns over North Korea's motives, ""we have to make the most of it."" On Saturday, North Korea's state news agency KCNA criticised suggestions that the parade could be viewed as threatening. Such an interpretation would ""only bring about the consequences of souring the successful opening of the Winter Olympics"", it said.

Trump warned not to hinder Russia probe,"President Trump says he is the victim of a ""witch hunt"" Senior Democrats have warned President Donald Trump not to use a controversial memo as a ""pretext"" to fire the special counsel investigating alleged Russian involvement in the US election. They warned that such action could trigger a constitutional crisis not seen since the Nixon era. The memo,external, written by Republicans, accuses the FBI of abusing its powers. President Trump approved the declassification of the memo and said it revealed a disgraceful story. It accuses the FBI and the justice department of using an unsubstantiated and Democratic-funded report to obtain the warrant that gave permission to spy on an aide to Mr Trump. Democrats said the release of the memo was aimed at disrupting investigations into alleged links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. President Trump has consistently denied any such collusion. The FBI had warned against the memo's release and said key facts had been omitted. Democrats say the memo, released on Friday, is a ""shameful effort to discredit"" the FBI and inquiries into Russian meddling. In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Nancy Pelosi and eight other senior Democrats warned Mr Trump against trying to sack special counsel Robert Mueller or the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein. Key parts of memo - and what it means ""We write to inform you that we would consider such an unwarranted action as an attempt to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation,"" the statement said. They said such action could result in a constitutional crisis not seen since the 1970s when then President Richard Nixon gave orders to fire justice officials involved in the Watergate scandal. The White House later said ""no changes"" would be made at the Department of Justice and Mr Rosenstein was fully expected to continue in his job. It focuses on the court-approved wiretapping of Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign who was put under electronic surveillance by the FBI. But the memo accuses the FBI and the justice department of using unsubstantiated evidence to obtain the October 2016 warrant. It says that they did not tell the authorities their claim to the warrant was partially based on a dossier funded in part by the rival campaign of Hillary Clinton. It also says that the author of that dossier, a former British intelligence agent called Christopher Steele, told a senior justice department official that he was ""desperate"" that Donald Trump should not win the vote. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading the inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the US election The Democrats have drafted their own 10-page rebuttal memo, which is said to show that the FBI was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than the Republicans say. According to unnamed officials quoted by US media, the FBI and justice department did tell the court that information it had received from Mr Steele was politically motivated. One official told the Washington Post that the Department of Justice made ""ample disclosure"" to the court of facts that revealed ""the research was being paid for by a political entity"". However, the FBI did not say the dossier was financed by Democrats, sources told the New York Times. The White House said President Trump ""would be inclined"" to release the Democrats' memo, as long as it has been reviewed for security purposes. Republicans who support the release of their own memo say it exposes malpractice and political bias within the FBI and justice department. Mr Trump said a lot of people should be ""ashamed of themselves"" when asked about its contents. This video can not be played ""I think it's terrible...I think it's a disgrace"", Trump said of the controversial memo Earlier on Friday the president accused top officials of politicising FBI and justice department investigations to damage his Republican party. Devin Nunes, who commissioned the memo, has said it shows ""serious violations"" of public trust and he hopes it will trigger reforms. Mr Page said he would use the memo in upcoming legal action against the justice department. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Meet the cast in the drama to end all dramas But not all Republicans supported the release of the memo. Senator John McCain accused his party colleagues, and Mr Trump, of playing into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Our nation's elected officials, including the president, must stop looking at this investigation through the warped lens of politics and manufacturing partisan sideshows,"" he said in a statement. ""If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin's job for him."" Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Trump in May, tweeted that the memo was ""dishonest and misleading"" and would negatively impact intelligence agencies' ties to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) court system.

By the BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Whether the Republican-generated document is as explosive as it had been made out to be depends on how one views the now-infamous Christopher Steele dossier and whether one believes the memo's assertion that it was an ""essential part"" of the Carter Page Fisa warrant's approval - or if there was other pertinent information the Republican memo-writers omitted. The memo makes the case that the Fisa judge should have been told about information about Steele that could call his objectivity into question - including his expressed views about Donald Trump, his contacts with the press and the fact that his investigation was funded, in part, by Democratic Party interests. Would such a disclosure have been enough to make the Page warrant request one of only a handful of the tens of thousands of Fisa applications that have been rejected by judges since the system was set up in 1978? And is the surveillance of Page - who had drawn the attention of US intelligence services as far back as 2013 - enough to call into question the entire Russia investigation, which had been initiated months before the warrant was approved?

"North Korea flouting sanctions, UN told","Inspections of ships have been stepped up, but the UN says more must be done North Korea earned nearly $200m (Â£141m) last year by exporting banned commodities in breach of international sanctions, a UN report says. The confidential report by a panel of experts said several countries including China, Russia and Malaysia had failed to stop the illegal exports. It said there was evidence of military co-operation with Syria and Myanmar. Pyongyang is subject to sanctions from the US, UN and EU over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. But the report, which was submitted to the UN Security Council and seen by news agencies, said the North ""continued to export almost all the commodities prohibited in the resolutions... between January and September 2017"". The report said several unnamed multinational oil companies were being investigated for their alleged role in supplying petroleum products to North Korea. It said shipments of coal had been delivered to China, Malaysia, South Korea, Russia and Vietnam in breach of sanctions using ""a combination of multiple evasion techniques, routes and deceptive tactics"". How does North Korea do business under sanctions? North Korea crisis in 300 words All you need to know about the NK missile programme The expert panel accused North Korea of ""exploiting global oil supply chains, complicit foreign nationals, offshore company registries, and the international banking system"". China's embassy in North Korea denied flouting Security Council sanctions, but said in a statement that the two neighbours had maintained ""normal trade exchanges"". It said Chinese food, fruit and household products were still being sold in North Korea. Sanctions in recent years have targeted North Korea's coal trade with China, as well as banned exports of ore and other raw materials and imposed travel bans and asset freezes on individuals and companies linked to its nuclear programme. The latest UN sanctions, announced in December, were estimated to reduce the nation's petrol imports by up to 90%. It included a ban on exports of North Korean goods, such as machinery and electrical equipment. Meanwhile, all North Korean nationals working abroad were told to return home within 24 months. UN monitors found that Myanmar and Syria continued to co-operate with North Korea's main arms exporter, Komid, despite it being on a UN sanctions blacklist. The report said there was evidence that the North was helping Syria to develop chemical weapons and providing ballistic missiles to Myanmar. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? Between 2012 and 2017 the panel revealed there had been more than 40 North Korean shipments to companies acting for the research centre overseeing Syria's chemical weapons programme. Syrian officials had told the monitors that the only North Korean experts on its territory were involved in sport.

Council 'warned it was unsustainable'The leader of cash-strapped Northamptonshire County Council says she told ministers it was struggling.1h35 minutes agoNorthampton,"Heather Smith said the council received ""significantly less"" in government funds than other authorities and this had been made known to Whitehall The leader of a council forced to ban almost all spending said she warned the government the authority was about to ""fall over the edge of the cliff"". Northamptonshire County Council said on Friday it had brought in a ""section 114"" notice, banning new expenditure. Heather Smith, Conservative council leader, said it was the ""perfect storm"" of increases in demand for services and reductions in government funding. ""We did warn that we would become unsustainable,"" she said. She continued: ""We have been warning government from about 2013/14 that, with our financial position, we couldn't cope with the levels of cuts we were facing. ""Before Christmas, I wrote to the secretary of state to say we were about to fall over the edge of the cliff because we can't just increase council tax. ""We've been in what you might call a perfect storm of huge increases in demand for our services at the same time as significant reductions in funding from central government."" A government spokesman said it had appointed an independent inspector to look at the council's finances, adding: ""This is a decision for the authority, and it would not be appropriate for us to comment while the inspection is ongoing."" The council has insisted staff wages and spending on statutory services for protecting vulnerable people will be unaffected. Northamptonshire County Council's new headquarters officially opened in October Philip Hollobone, Conservative MP for Kettering, said: ""Just a few weeks ago the council was saying they could set a budget and it seems this announcement is more about the collapse of internal financial controls in the county council, which clearly are not adequate enough. ""The government may have to intervene rather more quickly than it perhaps intended to. It might have to send in commissioners to run the county council."" The council announced in December that it was looking toincrease council tax by almost 5% as it sought to make savings of Â£34.3m. It was then revealed in January it wasconsidering selling its new Â£53m headquarters, which officially opened in October. Last month, the government saidan inspector would look into allegations of financial failings at the authority. Speaking to Labour's local government conference in Nottingham, the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Austerity is unleashing chaos across our country, squeezing our local authorities and putting jobs, and the vital services they deliver, at risk."" Nick Golding, editor of the Local Government Chronicle, said as many as ten other councils could soon take measures similar to those implemented in Northamptonshire. ""Council spending power has fallen by almost half this decade; it's been a really, really difficult time for councils and there haven't been any sensible conversations about how you can provide the funding for social care and children's services, in particular, in the years to come,"" he said. ""No-one seems to be able to face up to the fact that the current local government finance system isn't working. ""The danger is that councils will only provide an absolute bare minimum in the years to come."" The Angel Square complex was officially opened in October Council staff are being paid which means libraries, schools and children's centres will stay open. The council's leader has said she understands potholes will still be fixed as that is an existing contract that will be honoured. But there will be no new deals, no new spending, on anything other than services legally required to keep vulnerable people safe. While life continues for now, the seriousness of this move should not be underestimated - a warning like this has not been made at any authority for almost two decades. It has serious long-term implications for the authority as councils have to balance the books by law. In Northamptonshire there are two levels of council and so services like bin collections and car parks are the responsibility of separate borough and district councils that are not affected. It is the first section 114 notice - a provision of the Local Government Finance Act - issued in about 20 years but Prof Tony Travers, from The London School of Economics, believes others could follow. He said: ""I think there are others that are quite close to Northamptonshire's position and, with so-called austerity continuing into the next decade, I would be amazed if Northamptonshire was the only council to get into these circumstances."" Bob Scott, leader of the Labour Group on Northamptonshire County Council, said: ""My only surprise is that a section 114 order has been issued just after an inspector has been appointed and started his work."" The implications are due to be discussed at the full council meeting on 22 February.

Driveby gun attack in Italian town,"A handgun was found in the suspect's car Italian police have arrested a gunman suspected of carrying out a drive-by shooting spree that targeted African immigrants. At least six people were wounded in the central town of Macerata. The suspect, named locally as Luca Traini, 28, had an Italian flag wrapped around his neck when he was detained. He had taken part in regional elections for the anti-immigration Northern League last year and reportedly made a fascist salute when he was captured. Italy votes in national elections on 4 March, with immigration one of the key issues.

Shots had been fired in the Via Spalato and Via dei Velini parts of town, two key areas in an investigation into the murder of an 18-year-old girl whose body was found dismembered and hidden in two suitcases last Wednesday. A 29-year-old Nigerian male migrant has been detained over the killing of Pamela Mastropietro. Several racist comments calling for revenge attacks were posted on the Facebook page of the victim's mother in the run up to Saturday's shootings, Ansa reports. Local reports are linking the two incidents. Bullet holes were found on shop windows in the area targeted by the gunman Right-wing politicians have been using Pamela Mastropietro's killing to promote their anti-migrant message as part of their campaign for the general election. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni has temporarily suspended campaigning over the shootings. Opinion polls suggest a centre-right bloc, including the Northern League, Forza Italia and the far-right Brothers of Italy, will win the most seats but not a working majority. With about 28% support in the opinion polls, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement is the most popular single party. This suggests there could be tough coalition negotiations, or even another election, after 4 March.

"Spice Girls to work together againThe 90s girl group says the time feels right to ""explore some incredible new opportunities"".5h5 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","The Spice Girls have confirmed they are planning to work on new projects, after meeting for the first time since 2012. It comes after Victoria Beckham, Geri Horner, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown and Melanie Chisholm were pictured together at Horner's house in Hertfordshire. Mel C told BBC Radio 2 they had been talking about ""opportunities and ideas"" but there was ""nothing set in stone"". Their debut single Wannabe propelled the Spice Girls to fame in 1996 and they split up six years later. The five members - nicknamed Posh, Ginger, Baby, Scary and Sporty - were accompanied at the meeting by their former manager Simon Fuller. Mel C told Dermot O'Leary on Radio 2's Saturday Breakfast Show the five stars had wanted ""a little catch up"" to ""see where everyone's at"". ""It's the worst kept secret in showbiz always,"" she said. ""It was lovely to get together, so we are talking about opportunities, ideas we have for the future... but you know, it's early stages and there's nothing set in stone, there is no big announcement."" She added: ""But it's just great to be back in Spiceworld and to see the reaction, all over social media, the press and it's so lovely to know that people out there still care.""

Lady Gaga halts tour due to 'severe pain' Michael Mosley: 'Forget walking 10,000 steps a day' Fake celebrity porn videos deleted from internet Earlier in the day the former band members used their Instagram accounts to hint at a possible reunion. Emma Bunton told her followers that the ""future is looking spicy"" and Geri Horner said ""#girlpower is alive and well"". Beckham wrote: ""Love my girls!!! So many kisses!!!"" adding ""exciting"". Meanwhile Brown praised the group for helping her become ""who I am"". This would not be the first Spice Girls reunion - the group embarked on a tour of Europe and the US which accompanied a release of their greatest hits. They also performed together at the Olympic closing ceremony in 2012, however rumours of a return in 2016 failed to come true. Posh, Baby, Ginger, Sporty and Scary last reunited to perform at the London Olympics closing ceremony In November 2017 Victoria Beckham, now a successful fashion designer, said of a potential reunion album and tour: ""It is not happening. ""At some point you've got to know when it's time. I don't think I'll be slipping into a PVC catsuit anytime soon."" The Sun reported that the group could earn up to Â£10m,externalfor new projects including TV work in China, a television talent show, endorsement deals and a compilation album.

Council 'warned it was unsustainable',"Heather Smith said the council received ""significantly less"" in government funds than other authorities and this had been made known to Whitehall The leader of a council forced to ban almost all spending said she warned the government the authority was about to ""fall over the edge of the cliff"". Northamptonshire County Council said on Friday it had brought in a ""section 114"" notice, banning new expenditure. Heather Smith, Conservative council leader, said it was the ""perfect storm"" of increases in demand for services and reductions in government funding. ""We did warn that we would become unsustainable,"" she said. She continued: ""We have been warning government from about 2013/14 that, with our financial position, we couldn't cope with the levels of cuts we were facing. ""Before Christmas, I wrote to the secretary of state to say we were about to fall over the edge of the cliff because we can't just increase council tax. ""We've been in what you might call a perfect storm of huge increases in demand for our services at the same time as significant reductions in funding from central government."" A government spokesman said it had appointed an independent inspector to look at the council's finances, adding: ""This is a decision for the authority, and it would not be appropriate for us to comment while the inspection is ongoing."" The council has insisted staff wages and spending on statutory services for protecting vulnerable people will be unaffected. Northamptonshire County Council's new headquarters officially opened in October Philip Hollobone, Conservative MP for Kettering, said: ""Just a few weeks ago the council was saying they could set a budget and it seems this announcement is more about the collapse of internal financial controls in the county council, which clearly are not adequate enough. ""The government may have to intervene rather more quickly than it perhaps intended to. It might have to send in commissioners to run the county council."" The council announced in December that it was looking toincrease council tax by almost 5% as it sought to make savings of Â£34.3m. It was then revealed in January it wasconsidering selling its new Â£53m headquarters, which officially opened in October. Last month, the government saidan inspector would look into allegations of financial failings at the authority. Speaking to Labour's local government conference in Nottingham, the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Austerity is unleashing chaos across our country, squeezing our local authorities and putting jobs, and the vital services they deliver, at risk."" Nick Golding, editor of the Local Government Chronicle, said as many as ten other councils could soon take measures similar to those implemented in Northamptonshire. ""Council spending power has fallen by almost half this decade; it's been a really, really difficult time for councils and there haven't been any sensible conversations about how you can provide the funding for social care and children's services, in particular, in the years to come,"" he said. ""No-one seems to be able to face up to the fact that the current local government finance system isn't working. ""The danger is that councils will only provide an absolute bare minimum in the years to come."" The Angel Square complex was officially opened in October Council staff are being paid which means libraries, schools and children's centres will stay open. The council's leader has said she understands potholes will still be fixed as that is an existing contract that will be honoured. But there will be no new deals, no new spending, on anything other than services legally required to keep vulnerable people safe. While life continues for now, the seriousness of this move should not be underestimated - a warning like this has not been made at any authority for almost two decades. It has serious long-term implications for the authority as councils have to balance the books by law. In Northamptonshire there are two levels of council and so services like bin collections and car parks are the responsibility of separate borough and district councils that are not affected. It is the first section 114 notice - a provision of the Local Government Finance Act - issued in about 20 years but Prof Tony Travers, from The London School of Economics, believes others could follow. He said: ""I think there are others that are quite close to Northamptonshire's position and, with so-called austerity continuing into the next decade, I would be amazed if Northamptonshire was the only council to get into these circumstances."" Bob Scott, leader of the Labour Group on Northamptonshire County Council, said: ""My only surprise is that a section 114 order has been issued just after an inspector has been appointed and started his work."" The implications are due to be discussed at the full council meeting on 22 February.

Oligarchs in UK told to explain wealth,"James Norton plays the son of a former Russian ""Godfather"" in the BBC's McMafia Russian oligarchs suspected of corruption will be forced to explain their luxury lifestyles in the UK, the security minister has said. As part of an organised crime crackdown,Ben Wallace told The Times,externalofficials could now seize suspicious assets worth more than Â£50,000. He added wealthy foreign criminals would feel the ""full force of government"". It is estimated Â£90bn of illegal cash is laundered in the UK each year. The real story of the world's McMafias What can be done about London's dirty money? Unexplained Wealth Orders, which came into force on 31 January, force wealthy people to explain the source of their assets if there is reason to suspect corruption. They allow government officials to keep hold of assets including property until they have been properly accounted for. In the interview with the paper, the security minister warned: ""We will come for you, for your assets and we will make the environment you live in difficult."" Dozens of targets have already been identified, according to The Times. Mr Wallace commended BBC drama McMafia's ""really good portrayal"" of the international nature of organised crime. ""Beneath the gloss there is real nastiness,"" he said. ""So far it's very close to the truth, the international nature of organised crime and the impunity with which some of these people operate and the brutality of it, is absolutely correct."" He then referred to the so-called Laundromat case - a scheme in which fake companies mainly based in the UK were used to launder Russian cash through Western banks. ""The government's view is that we know what they are up to and we are not going to let it happen anymore,"" he said. An Unexplained Wealth Order is a civil, investigative power, which requires people to explain the ownership of certain assets - but does not alone allow for a seizure Only ""enforcement agencies"" can apply for an Unexplained Wealth Order. In England and Wales these include the National Crime Agency, HMRC, and the Financial Conduct Authority It is an offence to produce false evidence in response Evidence obtained through an Unexplained Wealth Order can then be used in any further civil or criminal proceedings Source:Home Office,external What can be done about London's dirty money?

US wants smaller nukes to counter Russia,"The US nuclear force is based on land, sea and air-based weapons The US military has proposed diversifying its nuclear arsenal and developing new, smaller atomic bombs, largely to counter Russia. The latest thinking was revealed in a Pentagon policy statement,externalknown as the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). The US military is concerned Moscow sees US nuclear weapons as too big to be used - meaning they are no longer an effective deterrent. Developing smaller nukes would challenge that assumption, it argues. Low-yield weapons are smaller, less powerful bombs with a strength below 20 kilotons. They are still devastating, however. The atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki at the end of World War Two had about the same explosive power, and killed more than 70,000 people. Reality Check: Where are the world's nuclear weapons? ""Our strategy will ensure Russia understands that any use of nuclear weapons, however limited, is unacceptable,"" the document said. US Deputy Secretary of Defence, Patrick Shanahan, said the country's nuclear arsenal had kept it safe for over 70 years. ""We cannot afford to let it become obsolete,"" he told a media briefing in Washington. It is the first time since 2010 that the US military has outlined its perception of future nuclear threats. The proposed ""tactical"" nukes would not increase America's arsenal, which is already considerable, but would repurpose existing warheads. Nonetheless, critics have accused the Trump administration of challenging the spirit of non-proliferation agreements. The NPR also highlights the White House's concerns about North Korea, China and Iran. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent For the Trump Administration the goal of this review is to modernise and adapt the US nuclear arsenal for unsettled times. The three main elements of America's nuclear forces - land-based ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and air-delivered weapons - are to be extensively modernised. These are programmes which actually began under the Obama Administration. What is new is the perceived need for two new types of nuclear weapons to provide - in the words of US officials - ""more flexible capabilities to give tailored deterrence"". These include the modification of some submarine-launched nuclear warheads to give a lower-yield or less powerful detonation, as well as bringing back sea-based nuclear cruise missiles. US officials insist that this makes the US deterrent more credible and thus actually raises the nuclear threshold. But critics worry that such weapons could blur the distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear systems, and actually make a nuclear war more likely.

'Undervalued' GPs fuelling a 'crisis',"The government says it is committed to providing an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020 GPs are leaving the profession at an increasing rate because they feel ""undervalued"", fuelling what the British Medical Association (BMA) has described as a ""crisis"". Research by the University of Exeter Medical School,externalhas found GPs are ""fed up"" with ""unlimited demands"" on them. Doctors spoke of concerns about the risk of litigation and problems with their own health due to work pressures. The government said it had committed to an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020. Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA GPs committee, said: ""This is a crisis which we've been pointing out for a number of years."" He said the BMA was regularly contacted by GPs from across the country who are concerned about workload pressures. ""They feel they're not able to provide safe patient care,"" he added. The number of full-time equivalent GPs fell by 1,193 in the year up to October 2017, compared to a drop of 97 the year before,according to NHS Digital,external. In October 2017, there were 33,302 in England, compared to 34,495 the year before. Dr Charlotte Ferriday quit her GP partnership in Devon in 2015. She said the job left her burnt out. ""I woke up one Monday morning and I couldn't get out of bed,"" she said. ""For six weeks it was difficult to leave the house and it was catastrophic. ""I found it was increasingly difficult to do the job because I didn't have the resources and services that supported my patients. ""It felt like we were ignored and GPs were not valued by the government."" Researchers in Exeter interviewed doctors and other professionals with direct experience of GP workforce issues in the South West. They found common themes relating to the perceived value of GP-based care, concerns regarding fear and risk such as medical litigation, and issues around personal, social, financial, domestic and professional considerations. Prof John Campbell, who led the research and is also a GP, said: ""The government has already invested a very substantial amount but the truth is that it's not enough because the needs of the population are accelerating faster than the resourcing of the system."" Arecent survey by the same medical school,externalfound a third of GPs (37%) in the South West thought it was ""highly likely"" they would leave the profession within five years Among the 41 GPs interviewed for this latest study was a locum who said: ""GPs tend [to] go down one of two routes. ""They either - to cope with demand - start to cut corners or you overburden yourself and you won't cut corners and that has its consequences at the end of the day."" Another told researchers: ""I was just working at such a pace and I knew I was making myself ill."" The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Whilst we recognise that GPs face a great deal of pressure as our population ages, we have the highest numbers of GPs in training ever - more than 3,000 - and havecommitted to an extra 5,000 doctors,externalin general practice by 2020. ""This is supported by investment of an extra Â£2.4 billion a year by 2020-21 to improve care and deliver better patient access."" Dr Linda Thomas quit general practice in Bristol to set up an eco-fashion company. She said: ""At the worst stages I would come back from a long surgery and I would be physically shaking because the pressure of trying to meet the needs of all the people, the time pressure, the system pressure, just became so hard just to do what I wanted to do and help people.

Coronation Street 'may have saved my life',"Scott Wray and wife Emily visited the soap set in 2015 A Coronation Street fan who discovered a lump in his groin after a testicular cancer storyline says the soap may have saved his life. Scott Wray, 27, had a 1.5cm growth removed by surgeons and wife Emily tweeted her gratitude to the show. Actor Tristan Gemmill, whose character Robert Preston had a similar ordeal, sent Scott ""a hearty man-hug"". Scott said he was ""forever grateful"" to the soap and got to thank Tristan personally on BBC Radio Manchester. The Corrie fan, from Shotton Colliery, County Durham, now lives in Ontario, Canada, where the soap is ""very popular"". He and Emily, 27, are big fans and visited the set in 2015 while he was working in the UK to save for their wedding. Scott Wray is recovering after testicular cancer surgery When bistro owner character Robert Preston found a testicular growth, it prompted Scott to check himself more thoroughly than usual and he found the 1.5cm lump. Surgeons performed an orchiectomy to remove one testicle on 27 January and Scott is awaiting a blood test to find out if he is in the clear. He was told it appeared the cancer had not spread but that doctors could not yet be ""100% sure"". The retail worker said while character Robert agonised about having an operation, he ""just went and got it done"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Review: Lady Gaga in Birmingham âââââ,"Can the 15,000 adoring Lady Gaga fans who packed out the Birmingham Arena on Wednesday night be wrong? Can all the positive reviews that followed from well-informed critics be ill-judged? Is it possible that the Lady who gave us Perfect Illusion wasn't actually that good on the night? These are the questions that have been running through my mind from the moment Gaga's gig finished with her singing Million Reasons on a small, beautifully lit, piano stage towards the back of the auditorium. At that point she had put in a full-on two-hour shift of song and dance and costume changes (seven, I think), which would be impressive under any circumstances, but particularly so considering she is only just coming back after a debilitating bout of chronic pain caused by the condition fibromyalgia. Lady Gaga performing in Birmingham, as part of her Joanne World Tour She strutted, cavorted, head-banged, and powered her way from stage-to-stage crossing walkways lowered from the ceiling. She belted out her back catalogue (including a very good Bad Romance), introduced her more recent work from the 2016 Joanne album (the title track is a nice ballad which she amped up a bit too much), and demanded everybody stand and party. The crowd loved it. Arms were raised and swayed for just about every number, smartphone torches were held en masse for Edge of Glory, and roars of approval echoed around the Arena when the singer took time out to champion equality, individuality, and friendship. Lady Gaga tweeted this photo of the audience, that she took from the stage And yet. And yet. And this is what bothers me. Unlike all those fans and all those knowledgeable critics, the whole thing left me as cold as a spring holiday in Skegness. It seemed to me the physicality of her performance compromised her singing at times, a problem compounded by the stadium speakers which made the top register of her voice decidedly screechy. The show itself was disappointingly ordinary. I've always admired her as a singer and a writer, but more than that, I rated her highly as an artist. There was a moment when she really did seem to be taking up the art-pop baton handed on by the likes of Bowie, Roxy Music, Grace Jones, and The Fall. I was looking forward to the show, to seeing how she had developed as a performance artist, checking out some funky new contemporary choreography, and having my eyeballs sent spinning by an array of extraordinary costumes. In these respects the show was a let down, for me, at least. Gaga has gone conservative. She has retrenched into a typical pop superstar serving up a conventional, commercial show in which the hits are belted out, accompanied by some run-of-the-mill dancing, and outfits that sparkle in the lights but not in the soul (the nod to Leigh Bowery was underwhelming). The intelligence and courage that marked her out as a remarkable talent, that marrying of high art and pop culture, has been glossed over with a mechanical show that is not an exciting leap forward, but a step back to the bygone days of Hot Gossip. And then there were the tedious and preachy monologues, the constant and unsubtle promotion of her latest album, and the totally uncool yelling of instructions as if we were toddlers who needed to be told how to act and what to feel. Maybe it was my position high up in the gods that killed the vibe and explains why my experience is so far removed from everyone else's. Perhaps it was the middle-aged bloke in front of me scrutinising the football scores on his phone all night, or the old bloke behind me with ear buds inserted while assiduously making notes. I don't know. I suppose I was expecting something more unconventional from a performer who spent the evening telling us how different she was.

Although her show didn't quite hit the spot for me, there is no question that she gave 100% of her energy to it. It was just great to have her back and I know she'll be devastated not to be able to perform in front of her hundreds of thousands of fans, 99.9% of whom I'm sure would have given her a thumping five-star review.

"'Undervalued' GPs fuelling a 'crisis'University of Exeter Medical School found GPs are ""fed up"" with ""unlimited demands"" on them.3m3 minutes agoEngland","The government says it is committed to providing an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020 GPs are leaving the profession at an increasing rate because they feel ""undervalued"", fuelling what the British Medical Association (BMA) has described as a ""crisis"". Research by the University of Exeter Medical School,externalhas found GPs are ""fed up"" with ""unlimited demands"" on them. Doctors spoke of concerns about the risk of litigation and problems with their own health due to work pressures. The government said it had committed to an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020. Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA GPs committee, said: ""This is a crisis which we've been pointing out for a number of years."" He said the BMA was regularly contacted by GPs from across the country who are concerned about workload pressures. ""They feel they're not able to provide safe patient care,"" he added. The number of full-time equivalent GPs fell by 1,193 in the year up to October 2017, compared to a drop of 97 the year before,according to NHS Digital,external. In October 2017, there were 33,302 in England, compared to 34,495 the year before. Dr Charlotte Ferriday quit her GP partnership in Devon in 2015. She said the job left her burnt out. ""I woke up one Monday morning and I couldn't get out of bed,"" she said. ""For six weeks it was difficult to leave the house and it was catastrophic. ""I found it was increasingly difficult to do the job because I didn't have the resources and services that supported my patients. ""It felt like we were ignored and GPs were not valued by the government."" Researchers in Exeter interviewed doctors and other professionals with direct experience of GP workforce issues in the South West. They found common themes relating to the perceived value of GP-based care, concerns regarding fear and risk such as medical litigation, and issues around personal, social, financial, domestic and professional considerations. Prof John Campbell, who led the research and is also a GP, said: ""The government has already invested a very substantial amount but the truth is that it's not enough because the needs of the population are accelerating faster than the resourcing of the system."" Arecent survey by the same medical school,externalfound a third of GPs (37%) in the South West thought it was ""highly likely"" they would leave the profession within five years Among the 41 GPs interviewed for this latest study was a locum who said: ""GPs tend [to] go down one of two routes. ""They either - to cope with demand - start to cut corners or you overburden yourself and you won't cut corners and that has its consequences at the end of the day."" Another told researchers: ""I was just working at such a pace and I knew I was making myself ill."" The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Whilst we recognise that GPs face a great deal of pressure as our population ages, we have the highest numbers of GPs in training ever - more than 3,000 - and havecommitted to an extra 5,000 doctors,externalin general practice by 2020. ""This is supported by investment of an extra Â£2.4 billion a year by 2020-21 to improve care and deliver better patient access."" Dr Linda Thomas quit general practice in Bristol to set up an eco-fashion company. She said: ""At the worst stages I would come back from a long surgery and I would be physically shaking because the pressure of trying to meet the needs of all the people, the time pressure, the system pressure, just became so hard just to do what I wanted to do and help people. ""I'm a mum as well, I need to be a whole human being.  I can't just be a medic and then nothing.""

Whatâs eating the restaurant trade?Why are chains like Byron burger and Jamie's Italian struggling?7h7 hours agoBusiness,"The restaurant sector is hardly sizzling at the moment. Last month burger chain Byron agreed a rescue plan with lenders and landlords which could lead to the closure of up to 20 restaurants. Also in January, Jamie Oliver's restaurant group said 12 of its 37 outlets would shut their doors -the second wave of closuresin the space of a year. And since the beginning of 2015, shares in the Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie and Bennys and Garfunkels, have lost two thirds of their value. So what's causing the gloom? Serial entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who helped expand Pizza Express in the 1990s, says the whole of the food sector in the UK is under pressure at the moment. Businesses in the sector are having to pay the new living wage, the apprenticeship levy, and deal with ""upwards-only rent reviews"", he says. Mr Johnson, whoamong his many business interests,externalis the chairman of casual-dining chain 3Sixty Restaurants, adds that ""food and ingredients costs are affecting the whole eating-out market"". That is certainly the case for Jamie's Italian, which said the rising price of ingredients was partly behind its troubles. It buys many ingredients from Italy and they have become more expensive due to the slide in the value of the pound since Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Roger Tejwani, head of consumer sector at stockbrokers Finncap, says there are just too many restaurants. ""There is too much capacity in the market with consumers having a considerable amount of choice,"" he says. He says there needs to be a big decrease in the number of outlets some chains have. Customers have so much choice that there is little loyalty, and social media lets people be more aware of a wider range of food, Mr Tejwani says. Fast-casual restaurant firms have to work hard to persuade people to spend - especially as people are already spending more on experiences. ""They are all competing against each other and other forms of entertainment,"" he says. So to win customers restaurant chains have had to discount, making life even tougher. Mr Tejwani argues that restaurants need to move with the times and start taking account of consumer technology. Younger customers expect to be able to document what they are doing and ""want to be seen in a cool place"", which means restaurants have to be ""Instagrammable"", he says. Creating that cool environment will require investment, and there's less of that to go around, says Mr Johnson. ""The banks are pulling in debt lines where they can,"" he says, while private equity is also getting harder to come by. Uncertainties caused by the Brexit process arehaving an impact on the casual dining sector as a whole,external, according to consultancy firm Deloitte. Consumer confidence steadily fell throughout 2017, putting a squeeze on spending on non-essential items, says Deloitte. ""2018 is going to be a challenging year for restaurants, and they will need a tightly-run ship to survive,"" says Sarah Humphreys, lead partner for casual dining at Deloitte. ""Consumer tastes such as healthy eating, sustainable food sourcing and informal or experiential dining should not be ignored. ""Operators should consider how adaptable their models are to changing tastes, or else face the risk of missing out,"" she says. Consumer spending in general took a hit in 2017, having its worst year since 2012,according to payments processor Visa,external. That's partly because wages have been rising at a slower pace than inflation, leaving consumers worse off. Taking out Food delivery firms such as Just Eat and Deliveroo are a double-edged sword for the sector. They can increase sales, and on balance, they increase profit, says Ms Humphreys. But they can put pressure on restaurants if there's not enough staff to fill the takeaway orders and keep the customers in the restaurant happy, says Mr Tejwani. There are other downsides. Food delivery firms charge a high commission for delivery, and also restaurants lose the opportunity to sell profitable extras like drinks. However, Luke Johnson says that while the market is ""tough"" at the moment, he remains hopeful for the sector. ""Generally speaking the industry remains in reasonable health â¦ I'm sure it will remain profitable in five to ten years time.""

Triple crash victim 'talented kick-boxer',"(From left) George Wilkinson, Harry Rice and Josh McGuinness died after a car mounted the pavement in Hayes, West London Tributes have been paid to three boys who were hit by a car and killed while walking to a birthday party. Harry Rice, 17, Josh McGuinness and George Wilkinson, both 16, died after the crash in Hayes, west London, on 26 January. The boys were described as ""incredible"" and popular. George, who was a kick-boxer, was a ""great martial artist"", his coach said. A vigil was held near their homes in Harefield on Friday. Balloons were released on the village green in their memory and candles were lit. Josh's sister Melissa Weston said the vigil provided ""some joy in this sad time"", adding that the boys ""were just incredible and had so many friends"". Melissa Weston paid tribute to her brother Josh McGuinness Dave Gentry, from Rock Solid Kickboxing, said losing the teenagers has ""hit the community so badly"". Mr Gentry taught George and Josh kick-boxing for five years and said George was a black belt in the making. Dave Gentry, from Rock Solid Kickboxing, said losing the teenagers has ""hit the community so badly"" He was ""cheeky, loveable and fun"" as well as talented, his coach said. A fundraising event by the kick-boxing club in Uxbridge to raise money for the London Ambulance Service has had more than Â£1,000 in donations. ""It's devastating. So much is being done by everybody,"" Mr Gentry said. ""A message from George's dad to everybody is that he cannot thank you enough for all that you're doing, all that you care about.""

Memo accuses FBI of abusing power,"This video can not be played ""I think it's terrible...I think it's a disgrace"", Trump said of the controversial memo The US Congress has released a memo accusing the FBI of abusing its power in its investigations into Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The memo, written by Republicans, alleges the FBI used unsubstantiated evidence to spy on a Trump aide. The FBI had warned against the memo's release and said key facts had been omitted. Democrats said it was aimed at derailing ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign's links with Russia. The memo,externalhas become a flashpoint in the bitter dispute between Republicans and Democrats over investigations into whether Russia colluded with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election. It centres on court-approved wiretapping of Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign who was put under electronic surveillance by the FBI. But the memo accuses the FBI and the justice department of using an unsubstantiated and Democratic-funded report to obtain the October 2016 warrant that gave permission to spy on Mr Page. Key parts of memo - and what it means Memo reaction - as it happened It says that they did not tell the authorities their claim to the warrant was partially based on a dossier funded in part by the rival Hillary Clinton campaign. It also says that the author of that dossier, a former British intelligence agent called Christopher Steele, told a senior justice department official that he was ""desperate"" that Donald Trump not win the vote. The report says that all this represents ""a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses"". The memo was top secret, but it was approved for release by the House Intelligence Committee on Monday and by Mr Trump on Friday. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Meet the cast in the drama to end all dramas By the BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher The mystery is over, the memo is out, and the results areâ¦ pretty much what everyone expected. Whether the Republican-generated document is as explosive as it had been made out to be depends on how one views the now-infamous Christopher Steele dossier and whether one believes the memo's assertion that it was an ""essential part"" of the Carter Page Fisa warrant's approval - or if there was other pertinent information the Republican memo-writers omitted. The memo makes the case that the Fisa judge should have been told about information about Steele that could call his objectivity into question - including his expressed views about Donald Trump, his contacts with the press and the fact that his investigation was funded, in part, by Democratic Party interests. Would such a disclosure have been enough to make the Page warrant request one of only a handful of the tens of thousands of Fisa applications that have been rejected by judges since the system was set up in 1978? And is the surveillance of Page - who had drawn the attention of US intelligence services as far back as 2013 - enough to call into question the entire Russia investigation, which had been initiated months before the warrant was approved? The answers to those questions will determine whether the memo was a bomb or a dud.

Asked about the contents of the memo, Mr Trump said a lot of people should be ""ashamed of themselves"". Earlier on Friday the president accused top officials of politicising FBI and justice department investigations to damage his Republican party. Devin Nunes, who commissioned the memo, has said it shows ""serious violations"" of public trust and he hopes it will trigger reforms. Mr Page, the Trump aide who was the subject of the surveillance, said he would use the memo in upcoming legal action against the justice department. But not all Republicans supported the release of the memo. Senator John McCain strongly criticised his party colleagues for attacking the FBI and the justice department, and accused Mr Trump of undermining the rule of law. Democrats say the memo is a ""shameful effort to discredit"" the FBI and inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi said: ""By not protecting intelligence sources and methods, [Trump] just sent his friend Putin a bouquet."" Democrats have warned Mr Trump in a letter not to use the memo as a ""pretext"" to fire senior justice department officials or the special counsel appointed to investigate alleged Trump campaign ties to Russia. They said this would provoke a constitutional crisis. Meanwhile, FBI agents say they ""have not, and will not, allow partisan politics to distract"" from their work. In an email to his staff, FBI Director Christopher Wray said: ""Talk is cheap; the work you do is what will endure. ""I stand by our shared determination to do our work independently and by the book. I stand with you,"" he said. And former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Trump in May, tweeted that the memo was ""dishonest and misleading"". Allow Twitter content?
