Black pupils' exclusion rates higher in most areas,"Ranae James, now a graphic designer, was excluded dozens of time during a tough period Black pupils are disproportionately hit with fixed-term exclusions in England - by three times as many in some places, data shows. Pupils with black ethnicity have higher temporary exclusion rates in two-thirds of local authority areas, new analysis from the House of Commons library says. Discipline policies banning black hairstyles, kissing teeth and fist-bumping are being blamed in part. Schools have a statutory duty not to discriminate against pupils over race. Rates for fixed-term exclusions - disciplinary measures that may last a day or several weeks - were around three times higher for black pupils in four areas. And in another seven local authorities, black pupils had double the local rate for all pupils, according to 2017-18 data. The revelation comes as the Department for Education publishes new national data on exclusions, which shows black pupils from a Caribbean background had almost twice the England average rate of short term exclusions at 10.37% in 2018-19. Exclusions: what's legal and what's not Overhaul exclusions to beat knife crime, say MPs Ranae James, was excluded dozens of times while her mother grappled with a mental health problem, before she managed to turn things around for herself. She told the BBC how she felt her east London school had ""stereotyped"" her, rather than offering the support she needed. She added: ""If you were upset and you kissed your teeth, you were excluded straight away. ""That was seen as the most antagonistic thing you could do."" Kissing teeth is a way of expressing emotion, often used by African and Caribbean people. It produces a sounds using the teeth and lips which is similar to ""tutting"". Ranae now volunteers with young people Ranae also said the school banned pupils from ""bumping fists"" when they met each other, saying it referred to gang culture. ""It was just the way that we used to greet each other,"" Ranae said, adding: ""None of us were in gangs."" In general, pupils who receive fixed term exclusions often go on to be permanently excluded - but they also tend be those facing the most challenges. These include mental health issues - often expressed in behaviour, difficult home lives and living conditions, such as extreme poverty, as well as special educational needs. Some of these factors are experienced at higher rates among black families in England. Liberal Democrat education spokesman and leadership contender, Layla Moran, who obtained the data, is calling for a new universal code with clear criteria setting out the grounds for exclusions to prevent any bias or discrimination. She said: ""It is a glaring injustice that black pupils growing up across the country are so much more likely to be excluded from school than their peers. ""The government must urgently review what is causing this gap and take action to ensure every child has an equal opportunity to thrive. ""The numbers in some areas may be small, but they still show black pupils are being disproportionately impacted."" Kiran Gill, who runs a charity calledThe Difference,external- which recruits and trains leaders for schools for excluded pupils, says it is not that teachers are racist, but more that a pupil's experience of racism generally can intersect with circumstances that are already tough. Irene Ogunseitan and Jack Weston have worked together to understand how cultural differences can play out in schools Irene Ogunseitan, assistant principal at Harris Aspire, Croydon, south London and a Difference Leader, says the issue is often down to a lack of thought about how school policies can affect certain groups. She says hair styles, and the requirement for all pupils to look the same, can be a flashpoint. Ms Ogunseitan said: ""I have seen in schools when parents have had their child's hair cut low, they thought they were getting their child school ready, and that child ends up in an isolation unit."" She has worked on the broader issue through the charity with another Difference Leader Jack Weston, who is assistant head teacher of another school for excluded pupils in Medway. He says the black pupils who come into his school often see racism as part of the reason they are there. Gillian LaRoque says black pupils can feel worn down by having to fit in And Gillian LaRoque, assistant head of The Limes College, Sutton, recalls a girl in another school who had her hair in an Afro being told to cut it because other pupils ""couldn't see the board"". ""These may be small, micro things that you are doing to change yourself,"" she adds, ""but after a while it really wears you down."" ""It's the message that you are almost not good enough. ""You are having to tame your hair, tame your blackness, and it's happening from when you are a child,"" she says. Schools are loaded with cultural norms that can be excluding to minority groups, she says, adding that some teachers have certain expectations about how black pupils will behave. Over the past decade, there has been a drop in the proportion of black pupils given temporary exclusions nationally, but in every year since 2007, pupils from black and mixed backgrounds have had the highest rates. Ms Gill believes one key way to tackle the issue is to promote more black staff to senior positions in school, so staff teams can increase their cultural awareness and sensitivity. This also ""disrupts a tacit message that leadership isn't for black people"", she argues. According to the data, which relates to 2017-18, in four areas, Warrington and Kingston-upon-Thames, Harrow and Bath and NE Somerset, black pupils were around three times more likely to be excluded. Warrington Council pointed to their low numbers of black pupils overall, with only 0.65% of pupils with this ethnicity in 2017-18.  Here, the 5.7% exclusion rate, meant 12 black pupils were temporarily excluded. It added that more recent data showed the number and rate had dropped since then. Kingston-upon-Thames Council also highlighted their low exclusion rate overall, adding that whilst black pupils were proportionally over-represented in 2017-18, there were relatively few pupils involved. It added that the number of black pupils excluded fell the following year from 31 to 24. In Harrow and Bath and North East Somerset, black pupils are just under three times as likely to be disciplined in this way compared to all pupils. In a further seven council areas, Stockport, Trafford, Ealing, Solihull, Redbridge, Herefordshire and Richmond-upon-Thames, the exclusion rate for black pupils was double that for all pupils in these areas. Some of these areas have small black populations, others large and there was no clear pattern as to why black pupils were disproportionately affected. In a statement, the Department for Education said the government had established an independent commission to look at race and ethnic disparities in general, as well as seeking to understand disparities in exclusion rates. The statement said some pupils would return to school in September having experienced loss or adversity due to the coronavirus pandemic and so the department had provided guidance on how to re-engage pupils.

Wiley sorry for tweets 'that looked anti-Semitic',"Grime artist Wiley has apologised for ""generalising"" about Jewish people after being banned from social media. In an interview with Sky News, the artist insisted: ""I'm not racist."" ""My comments should not have been directed to all Jews or Jewish people. I want to apologise for generalising, and I want to apologise for comments that were looked at as anti-Semitic."" Twitter had earlier banned his account permanently after a public backlash over a perceived lack of action. ""We are sorry we did not move faster,"" Twitter said in a statement. Sky News reported that the offensive tweets were sparked by a falling-out between the rapper and his former manager, who is Jewish. The pair cut ties in recent days. ""I just want to apologise for generalising and going outside of the people who I was talking to within the workspace and workplace I work in,"" Wiley said. ""I'm not racist, you know. I'm a businessman. My thing should have stayed between me and my manager, I get that."" However, the artist appeared in the interview to refuse to distance himself from most of the anti-Semitic comments he posted on social media. Wiley's series of anti-Semitic tweets appeared on Friday night. One tweet read: ""I don't care about Hitler, I care about black people"", and compared the Jewish community to the Ku Klux Klan. This video can not be played Rapper Wiley's Twitter account has been suspended after anti-Semitic posts Twitter did not immediately respond, prompting a public outcry anda 48-hour boycott of Twitter by many usersover what they said had been an unacceptable delay. The social network eventually banned Wiley for violating its ""hateful conduct"" policy - a day after Facebook and Instagram had deleted the music star's accounts for ""repeated violations"" of their rules. Twitter said it had decided to make an earlier temporary ban permanent, and wipe all his past posts from its platform, ""upon further consideration"". ""We deeply respect the concerns shared by the Jewish community and online safety advocates,"" the statement said, promising to continue to tackle anti-Semitism. The star, known as the ""godfather of grime"", was awarded an MBE for services to music in 2018. He told Sky News he would hand back the honour following calls for him to be stripped of it, saying he had ""never wanted it"". ""I never felt comfortable going to get it. Just look at Britain's colonialism history,"" he said. When asked what he would like to say to his fans, he responded angrily saying fans were fickle and, at 41, he was no longer ""current"" and was at the end of his career. By Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation and social media reporter The permanent suspension of the rapper's Facebook, Instagram and Twitter profiles has been widely welcomed. However, it is emblematic of a slowness to act on hateful abuse from social media sites. And many are asking why this took so long. Time and time again, decisive action from social media sites over racist abuse, misinformation or hate speech has come only once comments have reached thousands of users. What does it take for Twitter to act decisively on anti-Semitic abuse? Facebook removes Wiley after abuse of Jewish critics VIPs and MPs boycott Twitter after Wiley tweets 'How it feels to be black and Jewish' In this case it appears to be external pressure - the move comes after a boycott by users. And it also seems to be dependent on what the other social media sites choose to do: Facebook moved to suspend Wiley's accounts on Tuesday, and then Twitter appeared to follow suit. With the Stop Hate for Profit campaign ramping up pressure, and increased focus on the way social media sites tackle hate speech and misinformation, the spotlight will intensify on the actions of Twitter, Facebook and Google in these scenarios. The delay in Twitter taking action prompted the 48-hour boycott of Twitter by many users - including celebrities and MPs - beginning on Monday morning. Organisers said the time reflected the ""48 hours of pure race hate"" they accuse Twitter of giving to Wiley. On Tuesday, Facebook issued a ban after Wiley was discovered posting abusive material on his personal page using his real name, Richard Cowie. Twitter followed suit on Wednesday, after what it said was a thorough investigation. Despite the move, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said both Twitter and Facebook had been slow to act, adding ""it is just not good enough"". ""Social media companies have not been strong or fast enough about tackling racism, misogyny or homophobia,"" it said in a statement. The Campaign Against Antisemitism echoed that sentiment, writing that Twitter ""has finally listened"". ""The closure of Wiley's account is too little too late, but it is at least a start for this deeply irresponsible social network,"" it said.

"US to withdraw 12,000 troops from Germany","Germany currently hosts by far the largest number of US forces in Europe The US is set to withdraw almost 12,000 troops from Germany in what it described as a ""strategic"" repositioning of its forces in Europe. About 6,400 troops will be sent home, with the rest moved to other Nato countries such as Italy and Belgium. President Donald Trump said the move was a response to Germany failing to meet Nato targets on defence spending. But it has attracted widespread opposition in Congress from those who believe it will embolden Russia. Senior German officials have also expressed concern. What does the US do for Nato? Can Nato survive President Donald Trump? ""We don't want to be the suckers anymore,"" Mr Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday shortly after the move was announced. ""We're reducing the force because they're not paying their bills; it's very simple."" Mr Trump has long complained that European members of Nato should spend more on their own defence. He has said that Nato members should no longer be relying so heavily on the US to shoulder the costs of maintaining the alliance. The argument between the allies focuses around the target agreed by all alliance members that defence spending should reach 2% of GDP (gross domestic product, the total value of goods produced and services provided in a country) by 2024. Germany, along with many other countries, has yet to meet this target. Defence Secretary Mark Esper struck a different tone when announcing the decision, suggesting it was part of a broader plan to reposition US forces in the region. He said it was ""a major strategic and positive shift"" that would ""unquestionably achieve the core principles of enhancing US and Nato deterrence of Russia"". The move is set to cost the US government several billion dollars and will reduce the country's military presence in Germany by more than 25%. A squadron of fighter jets would be moved to Italy while some troops could be relocated to Poland, Mr Esper said. Mr Trump has previously complained about a lack of burden-sharing at Nato The decision was criticised by German officials, with the chairman of the country's foreign affairs committee suggesting it would ""weaken the Nato alliance"". And the head of the German state of Bavaria, Markus Soeder, said he regretted the decision. ""This puts a burden on the German-American relationship,"" he told reporters. There was also bipartisan criticism in Washington. ""This is a self-inflicted wound... against American interests,"" Democratic Senator Jack Reed said. Republican Senator Mitt Romney described the decision to remove troops from Germany as a ""grave error"" and a ""a slap in the face at a friend and ally"". This video can not be played Nato explained in 80 seconds The plan was first announced by Mr Trump last month, when he accused Berlin of being ""delinquent"" in its payments to Nato. He also accused Germany of treating the US ""very badly on trade"". He also claimed that Germany was profiting from having the troops there because soldiers spend their money in the country. The US military presence in Germany is a legacy of the post-World War Two Allied occupation of the country. Germany currently hosts by far the largest number of US forces in Europe, followed by Italy, the UK and Spain. Some US personnel based in Europe support non-Nato operations and US military numbers fluctuate as forces are rotated in and out of Europe.

Trumpâs coronavirus signals 'not helpful' - Fauci,"This video can not be played Dr Anthony Fauci: ""It's not helpful"" to give signals about not wearing a mask Top US virus researcher Dr Anthony Fauci has called President Donald Trump's sharing of a video which included claims masks are not needed to fight Covid-19 ""not helpful"". The video promotes a drug widely disproven to be effective in treating Covid-19. Dr Fauci's interview with the BBC's Katty Kay comes as the US is about to hit 150,000 deaths due to the pandemic. The virus continues to spread rapidly in the US as states lock down again. President Trump was among social media users who shared video on social media late on Monday of a group called America's Frontline Doctors advocating hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment and saying that masks and shutdowns are not effective in combating coronavirus. Facebook and Twitter removed the video, flagging it as misinformation, but not before more than 17 million people had viewed it. The speaker in the video also alleged that there was a conspiracy to prevent the world from learning of a coronavirus ""cure"" that was being led ""by Fauci & the Democrats to perpetuate Covid deaths to hurt Trump"". On Tuesday, Dr Fauci denied ""misleading the American public under any circumstances"". ""This issue of tweeting and retweeting is something that I've never understood or gotten involved in,"" Dr Fauci told BBC News on Wednesday. ""But I can tell you, you'd have to say it's not helpful if people get signals about not wearing masks when we are trying to get people to universally wear masks."" ""My feeling about what we should do with masks is very very clearly understood by everyone including those in the White House,"" added Dr Fauci, who serves on the White House coronavirus task force and has directed the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. Asked about Mr Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine - a drug Mr Trump himself says he took to ward off the virus - Dr Fauci said it would not be ""productive or helpful for me to be making judges [sic] on right or wrong"". ""We know that every single good study - and by good study I mean randomised control study in which the data are firm and believable - has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of Covid-19,"" he said. Why a video promoted by Trump was pulled on social media What do we know about hydroxychloroquine? Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cautioned against using the drug to treat coronavirus patients,external, following reports of ""serious heart rhythm problems"" and other health issues. Studies commissioned by the WHO, the US National Institutes of Health and other researchers around the world have found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine - when used with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, as repeatedly recommended by President Trump - helps treat coronavirus. This video can not be played US President Trump on Dr Fauci's approval rating: ""Nobody likes me"" A 26 July report from the White House coronavirus taskforce identified 21 states as being in the ""red zone"", meaning that they had reported more than 100 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past week. Twenty-eight states are in the ""yellow zone"". Vermont is the only state in the green, with fewer than 10 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. The report calls for further closures by state governors to contain the spread of the outbreak. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The video retweeted by Mr Trump showed doctors speaking outside the US Supreme Court building at an event organised by Tea Party Patriots Action, a group that has helped fund a pro-Trump political action committee. In the video, Dr Stella Immanuel, a doctor from Houston, says she has successfully treated 350 coronavirus patients ""and counting"" with hydroxychloroquine. The president said on Tuesday: ""I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it."" This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus According to the Daily Beast,external, Dr Immanuel has previously claimed the government is run by ""reptilians"" and that scientists are developing a vaccine to stop people being religious, among other bizarre views. America's Frontline Doctors' founder Simone Gold accused social media companies of censorship for removing the hydroxychloroquine video. ""Treatment options for COVID-19 should be debated, and spoken about among our colleagues in the medical field,"" she tweeted. ""They should never, however, be censored and silenced."" This video can not be played 'We already lost prom and graduation...' Late on Monday, Mr Trump also retweeted several tweets critical of Dr Fauci. But in Tuesday's briefing the president denied he was criticising the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, insisting: ""I get along with him very well."" But he criticised Dr Fauci's high popularity, telling reporters ""Nobody likes me."" ""He's got this high approval rating, so why don't I have a high approval rating... with respect to the virus?"" he asked. This video can not be played Why the US struggled with its reopening The US now has more than 4.3 million reported cases of Covid-19. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

The ones they couldn't save,"    By Alison Holt It’s the early hours of the morning and Michelle Heavens moves quickly along one of the care home’s dark corridors. She’s the senior carer on duty overnight and needs to check on 84-year-old Joan Day. Michelle pauses to put on a mask, goggles, apron and gloves before going into Joan’s room. Joan has coronavirus and is going downhill fast. “I loved her from the day she came in,” says Michelle. Joan had been physically fit, but dementia had made her life increasingly difficult. She'd moved into the specialist home at Blackley in Manchester last year and settled in quickly. “She was always singing Joan. Absolutely brilliant lady. She’d ask us if we needed help, rather than us give her any support.” Michelle checks Joan’s oxygen levels. They’re dropping rapidly. She’s having difficulty getting her breath so Michelle and two other carers reposition her to try to make her more comfortable. The nurse also gives her painkilling drugs. Joan Day  By early morning, it’s clear Joan is not improving. Normally her family would be with her, but coronavirus restrictions mean they haven’t seen her for weeks. Joan’s daughter, Yvonne Connelly, is herself shielding. Carers are her only link to what’s happening in the home. Shortly before finishing her shift, Michelle calls Yvonne. She explains that Joan’s health is deteriorating. “There’s not much else I can say, apart from she’s not coming back from it.” Yvonne wants to speak to her mother on the phone, but Joan is too ill. “When Michelle called she was lovely about it. She was upset herself,” reflects Yvonne. “She said ‘Yvonne, I don’t think she’ll be here when I come back tonight.’” Just a few hours after that call, Joan died. Yvonne was devastated she couldn’t be at her mother’s side. “It’s the worst feeling in the world.” Across the UK, more than 22,000 care home residents have died with Covid-19. Joan Day was one of nine residents to die with the virus at EachStep Blackley - one of two care homes that granted Panorama access during the pandemic.    Nurse Phil Benson had heard about a new virus emerging in China on the news, but it seemed a world away. “I was naive about it initially. It didn’t seem like it was a real thing. Nothing to worry about.” Phil’s a dementia specialist working for Community Integrated Care, the charity that runs EachStep Blackley. In the past, he’s worked in A&E and intensive care. “Social care’s probably the most challenging job I’ve ever had, but the best as well. It all starts from the heart.” Phil Benson But that “heart” was soon to be tested beyond measure, in a care sector already struggling with growing demand from an ageing population and years of underfunding. On 23 January, 11 million people were locked down in the Chinese city of Wuhan. A picture was emerging of a new illness that was particularly worrying for older people and those with underlying health conditions. As the virus started to spread globally, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - Sage - held regular meetings and fed advice to ministers. Sage brought together a wide range of experts plus food supply strategists, those with digital marketing experience and even staff from the justice system. But no-one had specific expertise in old age or social care. During February, Sage spent a lot of time planning how the NHS would cope. There were also two discussions about preventing the virus spreading in prisons. More than 400,000 people live in care homes in England, but according to official minutes, care homes didn’t appear on the agenda for the first 11 meetings. “It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected… There is no need to do anything differently in any care setting at present” was the Public Health England and government advice on 25 February. On 3 March, Phil heard about a major virus outbreak at a care home in Seattle in the US. Thirty-seven people would eventually die. “The guy speaking about Seattle said it was spreading from room to room, despite them using the best technologically available PPE [Personal Protective Equipment]. “I was thinking, oh my God, it can’t be, this is going to devastate us.” It was also the day Sage scientists discussed care homes for the first time. In a discussion about social distancing for over-65s the minutes note that: “It will be a challenge to implement this measure in communal settings, such as care homes.” At a televised briefing, England’s Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty said there would be “specific advice for care homes, but they didn’t want to do it too early”. But it already felt too late for Mark Adams, Phil’s boss and head of the charity Community Integrated Care. Mark Adams “We set up our own war room. We made our own decisions about what we could do to protect people.” Ordering PPE for many care homes was also a major problem. They claimed some of their usual supplies were being diverted to the NHS and the price of masks, aprons and gloves had skyrocketed. Community Integrated Care locked down all its homes on 13 March, including EachStep Blackley. Family and friends could no longer visit. The same day, the government withdrew advice which said the virus spread in care homes was unlikely. It said no-one with suspected Covid-19, or who was unwell, should visit care homes.

More than 200 miles away in Kent, at Pelham House in Folkestone, they were also worrying about how they would deal with the virus. A small, privately-run dementia home looking after 20 people, Pelham, like Blackley, also allowed Panorama in during the pandemic. Pelham’s owner, Roger Waluube, locked down on 16 March. “At that stage we began to get reports Covid was here on our doorstep,” says Roger. “We had to keep the wolf at bay.”  Roger Waluube That evening, at the first 5pm Downing Street daily briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said no-one should make “unnecessary” visits to care homes - but he stopped short of saying people must not visit relatives under any circumstances. By mid-March, the number of people needing treatment for Covid-19 in hospitals was rising rapidly. On the 17 March, NHS England sent hospitals a letter saying all medically-fit patients should be discharged as soon as possible. There was no requirement for testing. During the next four weeks, 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes. Panorama has gathered data from 39 hospital trusts, which shows three-quarters of people discharged were untested. The social care system is run by local councils, not the NHS. In all parts of the UK it’s under pressure from an ageing population and funding cuts. James Bullion was just taking over the role as president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), representing officials who run council care services in England. When he and colleagues met the prime minister and the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock - he says making sure the NHS could cope was the overriding message. “There was a very strong feeling that anything that got in the way of that discharge arrangement [from hospitals] needed to be got out of the way. “Social care, the NHS and government should have had the forethought to think ‘It’s not right to discharge people without a test,” he says.  NHS England says testing policy is set by ministers and it has never supported pressure being put on care homes to accept admissions. The government has also repeatedly said that hospital discharge decisions during this time were made by medical professionals on a case-by-case basis. Sage advisers have since said residents moving into and out of hospital “may have been an important source” of the introduction of Covid-19 into care homes.

Sage advisers have since said residents moving into and out of hospital “may have been an important source” of the introduction of Covid-19 into care homes.   On 23 March, as the national lockdown began and streets fell eerily quiet, Phil Benson was on standby for the first coronavirus outbreak at a home run by Community Integrated Care. “I remember at that time the anxiety building,” he says. That week, there would be more than 500 outbreaks of coronavirus in care homes in England. On the last day of March, Phil got the call. EachStep Blackley had an outbreak. A resident, who’d been in hospital with breathing problems, had tested positive. She was very poorly and returned to the home for her last few days. “It was scary. We didn’t know much about Covid at that point,” says Debra Fielding, one of the advanced carers. “She came in through the back way, straight into an end bedroom. No residents were near her. Only certain staff were going in, they had to wear special PPE - visors, goggles, aprons, gloves.” Debra Fielding Other Blackley residents had started showing Covid-19 symptoms before she returned, but she was the first to die with the virus. In Kent, staff at Pelham House felt they were doing well keeping the virus out. Eighty-seven-year-old Doreen is one of the residents. She moved in after being diagnosed with dementia. She misses her late husband and old home. She has some understanding of what’s going on. “Coronavirus - that’s something that if you’ve got it, you must stay isolated,” she says. “It’s a bit frightening.” Doreen Pelham House, like many homes, was struggling to get enough PPE. Even basics, like food, were problematic - with the home’s regular supplier stopping deliveries. As a small care home, we were “left alone and set adrift, if I’m honest”, says Roger Waluube.  At Blackley, they checked residents’ temperatures, oxygen levels and blood pressure four times a day. They even brought in air purifiers, but the virus was spreading. In the two weeks after their first confirmed case, five died and 14 were showing symptoms. But none of those deaths were reflected at the televised daily government briefings. For the first six weeks, graphs that ministers and scientists pointed to - showing the number of coronavirus deaths - only showed what was happening in hospitals. Care home numbers were not included. Hospital deaths linked to Covid-19 peaked in England on 8 April. The peak in care homes followed soon after. “Family and friends should be advised not to visit care homes, except next of kin in exceptional situations such as end of life” “Negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home” “Respirators, fluid-resistant surgical masks, eye protection... can be subject to single sessional use - for example, a ward round or taking observations of several patients” Behind the scenes, directors of councils care services were increasingly worried. On 11 April, they sent a strongly worded letter to the Department of Health and Social Care. Social care appeared an afterthought, it said, adding that government guidance was contradictory and PPE distribution shambolic. The letter was leaked. James Bullion, ADASS president, says they were “distressed” by their “emotive” message going public, but it was an exceptional time. “We were frustrated by the lack of grip of the PPE issue, and lack of understanding about how you get, effectively, PPE to thousands of local organisations,” he says. The government says over the course of the pandemic it has provided 156 million items of protective equipment to social care.     At Blackley, staff were particularly worried about 85-year-old Bryan McHugh. A resident for two-and-a-half years, he had a history of lung problems. His daughter, Susan Murray, smiles at photos of Bryan with his grandson. “He was just lovely. He’d do anything for anybody. Nothing was ever too much trouble.” On 15 April, the home told her father had Covid symptoms. The following day he deteriorated. It took more than two hours for an ambulance to arrive. By then, Bryan was in a lot of pain and struggling to breathe. Advanced carer, Chelsea Mills, says it was tough. “To watch someone in pain is absolutely horrendous when you feel helpless. It was extremely hard.”  Chelsea Mills    There were difficult discussions between paramedics, Blackley staff and Bryan’s family about what to do for the best. Bryan was dying and being in hospital would not save him. It was agreed he should remain in the home surrounded by people he knew. His daughter Susan had asked the carers to give him a message. “Just tell him there’s Covid outside. We’ve got to be isolated in our own homes. That’s why we can’t come. And just tell him that we love him.” On the night shift, experienced nurse Herbert Mumbamarwo gave Bryan prescribed painkilling drugs - including morphine - but they weren’t working. Herbert Mumbamarwo  “Bryan over the last 10 to 12 months has never spoken a complete sentence,” says Herbert. “But that night, he managed to say ‘I can’t breathe, I’m drowning,’ words I didn’t know he could speak. That explains the extent of the trauma he was experiencing.” In a hospital, Herbert could have turned to senior doctors for advice to make Bryan more comfortable in his final hours, but in the care home he was the only medically-trained person on duty. “I was going on YouTube, on NICE guidelines, trying to find better ways to help. It didn’t help much. After my shift, I had a feeling of… I’ve failed Bryan.” Bryan was more comfortable by morning, but died the following night. Family photo: Susan, Bryan and his wife Sheila  “I feel as though I’ve let my dad down,” says daughter Susan. “Not being able to hold his hand was just horrendous. He relied on me, he used to say he always wanted me there if he was poorly.” NHS England says care homes had medical support through the pandemic.  Herbert understands the whole system was under pressure, but believes there are still lessons to learn. “We would benefit from a team of specialists, specifically on standby to respond to extreme cases of Covid. They could give advice on what best to do. “We’re not defying death, but what we’re trying to do is our mission statement - to make it comfortable.” In the week Bryan died, care home deaths peaked. More than 3,300 residents died in England and Wales. At its worst, 540 died in a single day. It’s a situation that angers Mark Adams from Community Integrated Care - the charity that runs EachStep Blackley. “Nobody really thought about the challenge that care organisations were going to face until, if I’m being brutal, the body count became so high they couldn’t ignore it.”  At Blackley, staff were particularly worried about 85-year-old Bryan McHugh.

Previous advice had stated that: “Negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home.” There would also be testing for all care home residents and staff showing symptoms. A shortage of tests had seen NHS staff prioritised and few care workers checked. By the end of April, there was increasing evidence that one of the ways the virus was getting into homes was through staff - particularly those working in more than one care home or hospital. It was also becoming clearer many residents and staff who tested positive for the virus showed no symptoms.

Other parts of the UK: (Sources: ONS, NRS, NISRA)  By early May, in Kent, Pelham House was still free of the virus. “We were meticulous about PPE,” says Karen White, one of the home’s most experienced carers. “Temperature-taking every morning, the staff, the residents. We were bobbing along. We were so pleased with ourselves, because we hadn’t got one single case.” But that was about to change. Francis, a resident for six years, was starting to feel poorly. “He was a fit and well man at the age of 96, and had served in the war,” says owner Roger Waluube. “He wasn’t feeling well, unusual for Francis, so he went into hospital.” Francis Chapman (photo: Paul Smith) The next morning, they got a call saying Francis needed to be discharged. The hospital said there was no clinical need for him to stay. It had followed guidance and tested him, but the results were not back. The government’s Social Care Action Plan stated: “Where a test result is still awaited, the patient will be discharged and pending the result, isolated in the same way as a Covid-positive patient will be.” But staff at Pelham wanted to wait until they knew what they were dealing with. “It escalated to the consultant in A&E being on the phone and really, really requesting and stating that Francis had to come home on that day,” says Roger. Asked if they felt bullied, he says: “We did. Yes. There was no other option but to take Francis back to the care home and if we didn’t agree, he would be sent back anyway in an ambulance.”  Pelham House does not have nursing facilities and Francis was very ill. He was back at the home when staff got the call saying he’d tested positive for Covid-19. “You knew you couldn’t stop it, you were powerless,” says Roger. “It was very scary. It was inevitable, we knew people were going to go.” The Kent and Medway Clinical Commissioning Group said in a statement: “As symptoms can take up to 14 days to appear following exposure, it is likely the resident would already have been infected.” It also said the home was given advice and support around minimising the risk of Covid-19 spreading in the home. In his final hours, Francis was moved to a nearby hospice, which provided him with the end of life care he needed. Other Pelham House residents were now also falling ill with the virus.   At Blackley, Covid-19 had spread from one end of the building to the other. Staff were worried about 91-year-old Vera, normally seen making her way around the home with her walking frame. “She does look after everybody, mother everybody. And she chats non-stop, so that’s what we like,” says advanced carer, Debra Fielding. But Vera had developed a cough and her temperature was up. Vera Another resident, Michael, was taken to hospital because of his particular underlying medical condition. His daughter, Michelle Phillips, is Blackley’s manager. “He was poorly when he left. When he spotted me in reception, he waved and shouted after me that he loved me. That just made me cry.” At this point, Blackley was only able to test residents or staff with Covid-19 symptoms. To stand a chance of controlling the virus they needed to be able to identify all those who were infected but without symptoms. Phil Benson was on the phone every few days trying to get more tests. “I remember begging ‘Please can one of these people come and just test? Can we not have everyone tested? Surely there’s such a severe outbreak here, it’s in everyone’s interest to be tested?’ “And it was ‘No, the policy is clear. We only test people who’ve got symptoms.’”  Nearly two months after the country locked down, on 15 May, the Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock, announced an infection control plan for care homes. It included £600-million ring-fenced to help with increased Covid-19 costs, a named clinician to provide each home with medical support and testing for all care home residents and staff. At the daily briefing, the health secretary said that: “From the start we’ve worked incredibly hard to throw that protective ring around our care homes.” “What protective ring?” asks Pelham House manager Roger Waluube. “We don’t understand what the protective ring could have been or was.”      Everyone in Pelham House could now be tested. All 20 residents and 17 staff were checked. Two days later the test results came back. “The manager was just sat there with his mouth open,” says carer Karen White. “He just pointed at the screen and it was horrific. Every resident apart from two were positive. And 80% of the staff.” Karen White It meant most of the staff had to leave immediately. “They had to down tools,” remembers Roger. “That left us in a very vulnerable position, particularly when the cook has to suddenly stop her cooking and go home. “There’s three or four of us who’ve been on the frontline as such and continually testing negative. We could keep going.” Overall, 19 Pelham House residents tested positive and nearly half those living at the home died. The home normally averages about three deaths a year, but it had nine in just 10 days. “We’re not used to death at this scale. Having to say goodbye to so many people so quickly,” says Roger. Carer Karen was hit hard after the funeral of Peter Baker, a resident with learning difficulties and no family, soon to celebrate his 76th birthday. “He just gently passed away,” she recalls tearfully. “He trusted us to look after him. And he always kept saying ‘Love you girls, I love you girls, I’m so happy here.’ We just let him die. With his learning difficulties he wouldn’t have understood.”  Pelham House was also facing another big problem. By July, it was virus free, but the deaths of half of its residents meant the home had lost 50% of its income. Pelham was rated “good” by the regulator, the Care Quality Commission. Before Covid-19, Roger Waluube had plans to develop and redecorate. Coronavirus changed all that. “We were a very healthy and viable business,” he says. “Now our future is in the balance and the outlook is not good.” Roger Waluube By late June, he estimated they had enough money to last six to eight weeks. With little prospect of new residents moving in, he turned to Kent County Council for help. Since March, the government has given councils £3.7bn to help with the additional pandemic costs. The money is for all services under pressure - including support for children, the homeless and transport services. The Local Government Association, which represents local councils, estimates about 40% of the first £3.2bn received has gone to adult social care, including care homes. So far, Pelham has received about £40,000 in council help. Roger is discussing loans, but he estimates it’ll take at least another £100,000 for the home to survive. Closure would see residents like Doreen having to find a new home. It would be difficult for them all. Residents grow to see this place as their home, says Roger. “Moving people from one care home to another never generally has great results because that adjustment can take its toll on people.”    At Blackley, there was finally some good news. Staff lined up in reception to welcome Michael back. He was in hospital with the virus for two weeks but recovered. As the ambulance crew wheeled him in, his daughter and home manager, Michelle, gave him a big hug. Michelle Phillips “I’m really happy,” she laughs. “A feeling I’ve not had for a while.” Vera also recovered and was able to celebrate her 92nd birthday. In mid-June, she saw her daughter and grandson at a distance. She sat on one of the home’s balconies while they were in the garden. Vera smiles at her daughter and grandson Over six weeks, 16 of the home’s 55 residents had Covid-19 officially - while others had symptoms. Nine died. With the outbreak under control, Phil Benson finished his work at Blackley and went on to help other homes. By early July, Pelham House was also coronavirus-free, but its future remained uncertain. Roger Waluube is crowdfunding to see if he can save the home, but he faces some hard decisions. “I will not get to the point where I’ve got two hours to go, and I’ve run out of cash or I can’t care for people any more,” he says.

The government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the social care sector was “slow, inconsistent and at times negligent” is the damning verdict of MPs on the Public Accounts Committee in theirreport of 29 July. The decision to allow hospital patients in England to be discharged to care homes without tests at the start of the pandemicwas “reckless”, they say. The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care declined to be interviewed by Panorama. In a statement, his department said:“We first published guidance for the social care sector in February and have since announced a raft of measures. Our help has meant almost 60% of England’s care homes have had no outbreak at all.” The government has also promised to bring forward plans for reforming the care system in the near future. It has started cross-party talks on what it describes as a complex issue. Mark Adams, of Community Integrated Care, says that change has to happen soon. “When we look back, we will see this as one of the most mismanaged national challenges we’ve ever faced,” he says. “You can’t have a disconnected health and social care system. It can’t be left to local authorities, whose budgets are being cut, and [who] then have to think about who gets care and who doesn’t.” No government will get everything right in the extreme situation a pandemic presents, but it will be judged on how it protects the most vulnerable.

Mystery of origin of Stonehenge stones solved,"The origin of the standing sarsens at Stonehenge had been impossible to identify until now The origin of the giant sarsen stones at Stonehenge has finally been discovered with the help of a missing piece of the sitewhich was returned after 60 years. A test of the metre-long core was matched with a geochemical study of the standing megaliths. Archaeologists pinpointed the source of the stones to an area 15 miles (25km) north of the site near Marlborough. English Heritage's Susan Greaney said the discovery was ""a real thrill"". The seven-metre tall sarsens, which weigh about 20 tonnes, form all fifteen stones of Stonehenge's central horseshoe, the uprights and lintels of the outer circle, as well as outlying stones. The monument's smaller bluestones have been traced to the Preseli Hills in Wales, but the sarsens had been impossible to identify until now. The return of the core, which was removed during archaeological excavations in 1958, enabled archaeologists to analyse its chemical composition. No-one knew where it was until Robert Phillips, 89, who was involved in those works, decided to return part of it last year. The stone samples were removed during archaeological work in 1958 Researchers first carried out x-ray fluorescence testing of all the remaining sarsens at Stonehenge which revealed most shared a similar chemistry and came from the same area. They then analysed sarsen outcrops from Norfolk to Devon and compared their chemical composition with the chemistry of a piece of the returned core. English Heritage said the opportunity to do a destructive test on the core proved ""decisive"", as it showed its composition matched the chemistry of sarsens at West Woods, just south of Marlborough. Prof David Nash from Brighton University, who led the study, said: ""It has been really exciting to harness 21st century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries. Archaeologists analysed the composition of the core to pinpoint where the ancient Sarsen stones came from ""Each outcrop was found to have a different geochemical signature, but it was the chance to test the returned core that enabled us to determine the source area for the Stonehenge sarsens."" Ms Greaney said: ""To be able to pinpoint the area that Stonehenge's builders used to source their materials around 2,500 BC is a real thrill. ""While we had our suspicions that Stonehenge's sarsens came from the Marlborough Downs, we didn't know for sure, and with areas of sarsens across Wiltshire, the stones could have come from anywhere. ""They wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find and it made sense to get them from as nearby as possible."" Ms Greaney added the evidence highlights ""just how carefully considered and deliberate the building of this phase of Stonehenge was"".

Travel bosses demand end to blanket quarantine,"This video can not be played Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye: ""More work needs to be done, we need to test and learn"" Leading travel and airline industry figures have urged the prime minister to replace blanket quarantine measures with regional travel corridors. In a letter to Boris Johnson, they said the 14-day quarantine for people coming from Spain had caused disruption. It was ""the latest significant blow to a sector which now risks being permanently scarred"", they added. They called for quarantine-free travel to areas unaffected by any spike in coronavirus cases. This would include not just Spain, but other key markets for trade and tourism, such as the US and Canada. ""We are in a situation where the government is advising against travel to areas of Spain that have lower rates of Covid than the UK,"" the letter said. ""We urgently request a meeting with you to discuss the challenge facing our sector and our proposed ways forward,"" the letter concluded. Among the nearly 50 signatories of the letter were British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz, Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye and Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade. Travel industry chiefs are seeking ways to rescue the holiday season. Their intervention came after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC that coronavirus testing at airports was not a ""silver bullet"" to stop the need for quarantine, because the virus could develop over time. The government's sudden change to travel advice for Spain at the weekend prompted a fresh wave of confusion and uncertainty to people's holiday plans. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps returned home early from his own Spanish holiday on Wednesday and will now begin two weeks' quarantine, buthe defended the government's decision. ""We had to act when we did. The figures since have shown why that was required. I'm desperately sad and sorry for people who have lost their holidays,"" he said. Travel firm Tui said on Wednesday it had cancelled holidays to the Balearics and Canary Islands until 4 August after the UK extended its advice against non-essential travel to Spain to include its islands. Coronavirus: Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? Mr Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme the confusion caused by the changes to guidance over Spain showed the need for an alternative. He said airports should be allowed to test for coronavirus to avoid the ""cliff-edge"" of quarantine. Heathrow's financial results, out on Wednesday, showed passengers all but stopped travel in the three months to June, falling by 96% on a year ago as global aviation came to a virtual standstill. Revenue was 85% lower than last year at Â£119m. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""Today's results should serve as a clarion call for the government - the UK needs a passenger testing regime and fast. Without it, Britain is just playing a game of quarantine roulette."" He said he wanted the government to work with the company on the plan and he could have testing sites set and ready ""within weeks"". But Mr Dowden quashed the idea, saying: ""We are not at the point where there is a viable alternative to the 14-day quarantine."" However, he added that all options were under review. Coronavirus testing is available at some German airports Other countries are operating airport testing. It is voluntary - and free - at some German airports now although it may become mandatory, as it is in France for arrivals from high-risk countries such as the US and Brazil. The Netherlands approach is to single out people coming from specific areas with high levels of infections - such as a few named regions in Spain and the UK city of Leicester and urge them to self-isolate. Dr Hans Kluge, Europe regional director for the World Health Organization, endorsed testing at airports as part of general attempts to track the movement of coronavirus. He told the Today programme: ""Testing is never wrong - whether at airports, community or drive-in centres - what's the difference between day-to-day life and travelling?"" Mr Holland-Kaye said a UK airport test would cost about Â£150 each, and passengers would be expected to pay. He acknowledged that was ""not cheap"", but that the test would come down over time as more people took it. The idea of introducing testing at airports is an attractive idea. The theory being people could travel where they like and just get tested as they arrive back in the country, negating the need to self-isolate. But the government is not convinced. Why? Logistically testing all the travellers who arrive every week will be difficult. Testing capacity has increased but this would stretch the system. Not to mention the practical difficulties of setting up testing facilities in busy airports. But the other factor, which is perhaps more crucial, is that in the early stages of infection the test may not even pick it up. Instead, officials are much more persuaded by a more intelligent, targeted approach to self-isolation. That would involve asking only those coming from certain regions in a country where the infection rates are highest to self-isolate. That could then be complemented by then asking them to get tested after a week, meaning if they test negative, there would be no need for the full 14-day self-isolation. All this and more is being discussed behind the scenes. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""The aim would be to have a test on arrival. We could have it up and running in the next two weeks."" He said the plan would be for passengers to go into quarantine and have another test after eight days: ""If they were infected we would be confident that it had shown itself.  If it was clear, they would be allowed to go out of quarantine earlier than had been the case. It's very scientifically based."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? The government is said to be considering an eight-day stretch between tests. The number of days required between each test is critical in reducing the possibility of ""false negative"" results from people not yet showing symptoms. Under current rules, those arriving in the UK from certain countries must self-isolate for 14 days.

"Tech bosses grilled over claims of 'harmful' powerUS lawmakers are considering tougher regulation of the firms, which critics say are too powerful.","Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai defended their firms The heads of some of the world's biggest tech companies have appeared before Washington lawmakers to defend their firms against claims they abuse their power to quash competitors. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos said the world ""needs large"" firms, while the heads of Facebook, Apple and Google argued their companies had spurred innovation. The appearance comes as lawmakers consider tougher regulation and competition probes are under way. Some critics want the firms broken up. Democrats pressed the tech titans on competition issues, while Republicans were more concerned about how they managed information and whether they were marginalising conservative views. The hearing as it happened Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat leading the congressional committee holding the hearing, said a year-long investigation by lawmakers had showed the online platforms had ""wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand"". This video can not be played ""Mr Bezos... why on Earth would one of your partners compare your company to a drug dealer?"" He said he was convinced the firms were monopolies and called for action. ""Some need to be broken up and all need to be properly regulated,"" he said at the end of more than five hours of testimony. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google, and Tim Cook of Apple insisted they had done nothing illegal and stressed the American roots and values of their firms. At the hearing, lawmakers accused Google of having stolen content created by smaller firms, like Yelp, in order to keep users on their own web pages. Amazon's treatment of sellers on its site, Facebook's acquisition of competitors such as Instagram, and Apple's App store also drew attention. In response to claims Google had stolen content, Google boss Sundar Pichai said the firm held itself to the ""highest standard"" Mr Cicilline said Amazon had an inherent conflict of interest, since it both hosts sellers and competes against them by offering similar products. Such practice has also come under scrutiny from European regulators. ""Amazon's dual role... is fundamentally anti-competitive and Congress must take action,"" he said. However, some Republicans signalled they were not prepared to split up the firms or significantly overhaul US competition laws, with one committee member saying ""big is not inherently bad"". Republican concerns focused on perceived political bias at the firms, which they accused of suppressing conservative views. ""I'll just cut to the chase - big tech is out to get conservatives,"" said Congressman Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio. Four of the world's top technology company executives may have been testifying before the Judiciary Committee from a distance, but they were still caught in the middle of a political storm on Wednesday afternoon. The stated purpose of the hearing was to address whether existing anti-trust laws provide sufficient regulation of transnational tech Goliaths. The reality, however, was that the proceedings - with each member of the committee receiving five minutes to speak - were more akin to a feeding frenzy, as corporate chiefs faced criticism from every direction Democrats expressed concern that the companies were abusing their power by disadvantaging competitors or buying them out entirely. Republicans accused the witnesses of insufficient patriotism and being too cosy with the Chinese. Both sides expressed outrage over how the companies managed speech and expression on their platforms. They didn't go far enough in removing hateful rhetoric and false information, Democrats said. They singled out conservatives for censorship, the Republicans countered. Through it all, the witnesses thanked the questioners and took their lumps, perhaps confident that they could soon log off and get back to their work. While all the politicians seemed to agree that the big tech companies were a problem, their chances of arriving at any kind of solution seems unlikely. Appearing by remote video, the executives defended their companies, saying their products helped smaller businesses and they remained vulnerable to competition from newcomers. Apple boss Tim Cook said the business climate was ""so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business"". Mr Bezos, in his first appearance before Congress, denied that Amazon's multiple roles were a conflict of interest, but he admitted the firm was reviewing its handling of sales data from sellers on the site. The company has been accused of using such information to launch its own version of hot-selling products. Mr Bezos said Amazon rules forbid staff from looking at sales data from individual companies, but he conceded it was possible that employees had violated the policy. ""We are investigating that,"" he said. A day of reckoning for US tech giants' CEOs Will the US break up the tech giants? Elon Musk calls for 'break up' of Amazon In his prepared remarks, Mr Bezos said Amazon faced significant competition from firms such as Walmart and noted that the company lost money for years as it branched out into new areas. ""I love garage entrepreneurs - I was one. But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can't do,"" he said. This video can not be played WATCH: Who are the 'big four' and just how much power do they have? US President Donald Trump is a long-time critic of Amazon and threatened his own action on Twitter, writing: ""If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders."" He also told reporters that White House officials would be watching the hearing closely. ""There's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad,"" he said. Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said ""storm clouds"" were building in Washington but he thought it was unlikely that Congress would come together on new legislation that would force tech companies to change. ""We think a legislative fix is the only one that creates a potential for limitations on these companies' ability to conduct business, whether that takes the form of higher taxes or new rules regarding market concentration,"" he wrote. ""Absent a legislative fix, we don't see meaningful change in regulation, although future acquisitions will most certainly be scrutinized and more difficult to close.""

Labour warns of 'perfect storm' for childcare,"A ""perfect storm"" of rising childcare costs and providers closing down could make it ""impossible"" for some parents to return to work amid the coronavirus pandemic, Labour says. The party says childcare costs in England have risen up to three times as fast as wages since 2010. And it is calling on the government to ""urgently provide targeted support"" to the childcare sector. The government said the sector had received ""significant"" support. 'I was asked for Â£430 a month for my shut nursery' Back-to-office parents need childcare, says Starmer Coronavirus: âThe nursery I run may not surviveâ Nurseries, pre-schools and childminders have been allowed to open to all children since 1 June following the coronavirus lockdown. And as part of easing lockdown restrictions, the government has said people who can, no longer have to work from home. However, Labour warns that many parents will struggle to return to workplaces without adequate childcare, particularly if families cannot rely on grandparents for help due to the virus. It says ""long-term underfunding and a lack of targeted support during the coronavirus pandemic, will make it impossible for many providers to remain viable"". The party points to research carried out by Early Years Alliance - the nursery sector body - which found that 25% of childcare providers in England are at risk of closing in the next year. Last month, the alliance also published data suggesting that since reopening nurseries have only been operating at 37% of their capacity, creating financial pressure for providers. Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Ordering parents back to work without allowing them to access the childcare they need is a stark reminder that Boris Johnson is completely out of touch with the needs of working families."" Clare Matthews runs Sunny Days Pre-school in West Molesey, Surrey, with her husband Richard. The business has been a success, but when lockdown hit, the couple could not afford to stay open for key workers' children. ""All providers are having to make tough decisions to maintain their nurseries and just to get through this,"" she says. ""The parents were really supportive when we gave them our reasons and they trusted us, but they think we are getting government support, and the money just isn't there."" Clare says the only coronavirus-related scheme Sunny Days qualified for was the business rate holiday, and when they applied for more funding from their local council, they were rejected and told to ""come back when it comes to crunch time"". She says: ""It is really stressful. We don't want to let our families down, we want our children back and we want to do it safely."" Parents want to come back to the nursery in September, when it plans to re-open, but Clare said some are ""scared"" of what the future may hold. ""I had a call from one parent today who is genuinely concerned because his employer 'suggested' his job would be at risk if he didn't get his childcare sorted by next month,"" she said. ""We are very strong and have good contingency plans in place, but I am seeing good nurseries close every week and it has people at panic stations."" Clare wants the government not just to think of short term fixes for the sector, but to ""reflect"" and look at a long-term recovery plan to up the funding for early years' care. ""Everybody is trying to make sure they can provide childcare, but the government and ministers need to recognise the problems and listen,"" she says. ""If the government doesn't put support in place quickly, I think there are going to be a lot more closures to come."" Meanwhile a senior Labour MP has raised concern about the options for those coming to the end of their maternity or paternity leave. Catherine McKinnell, chair of the Commons Petitions Committee, said some parents face ""a dreadful dilemma of having to prepare to return to work... at a time when finding suitable childcare is nearly impossible"". ""Our investigation found some parents have even had to give up their jobs because there has been no financially viable way to extend their leave,"" she said. She also expressed disappointment that the government had not responded to her committee's report on the subject. In a letter, Business Minister Paul Scully said a response to the report had not been issued before the recess due to the need for ""careful consideration of recommendations"" and for discussions with counterparts in other departments. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Should maternity and paternity leave be extended? Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association charity, said greater funding is needed as the situation is ""clearly not sustainable"". ""Since lockdown, nurseries have also had to absorb additional operating costs such as installing more handwashing stations and extra cleaning, but as costs have increased, their income has dropped due to low numbers of children,"" she said. ""The government has given most local authorities an extra 8p this year per hour per child, but this won't even cover inflation, let alone take account of above-inflation national minimum and living wage rises."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said early years providers would benefit from Â£3.6bn funding from next year for free early education and childcare places. ""We are continuing to provide extra security to nurseries and childminders that are open by 'block-buying' childcare places for the rest of this year at the level we would have funded before coronavirus - regardless of how many children are attending,"" she said. In Scotland,the government has had to delayimplementing a pledge to provide free early years care due to coronavirus - something First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she ""deeply"" regretted. A Â£10.5m fund to help childcare providers to reopen following the lockdownhas been set upin Northern Ireland. And in Wales,the government saysit has made Â£2.6m available to provide care for the children of key workers.

Pharmacy linked to new Covid-19 clusterA site in Inverclyde is one of a number of businesses being investigated after a series of positive tests.Scotland,"A pharmacy in Inverclyde is among a number of businesses which have been linked to a new coronavirus cluster. Eight positive tests in Port Glasgow are among 14 new cases reported in the Greater Glasgow health board area. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said none of the cases were experiencing anything more than mild symptoms. It added: ""Close contacts are being advised to self-isolate and other identified contacts are being followed up and given appropriate advice."" Greenock and Inverclyde MSP Stuart McMillian tweeted to say he would not speculate ""where or who is involved"". But he said: ""News has broken that there has been a cluster of Covid-19 cases in Port Glasgow. ""I have spoken to the Scottish government and the health board, and their Track and Trace Investigation Team are working on this as we speak. ""I will share information to help the community when I get it."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that an incident management team was meeting to discuss the development. The cases were among 22 reported across Scotland in the last 24 hours. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland Ms Sturgeon has previously said localised outbreaks of the virus are all but inevitable, following clusters in North Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway. However, the first minister said the ""test and protect"" system was working well, with the number of people being treated in hospital for Covid-19 remaining low. Ms Sturgeon said:  ""Part of the challenge we have around any potential cluster is to make sure everything possible that can be done to minimise onward transmission is done."" Nicola Sturgeon has previously said localised outbreaks of the virus are ""all but inevitable"" The first minister said people should be assured that ""any suggestion of any links between cases or possible clusters or outbreaks are absolutely rigorously explored, investigated and dealt with"". News of the cluster came as the National Records of Scotland said the number of deaths linked to coronavirus had increased very slightly, with Covid-19 mentioned on eight death certificates in the week to Sunday. This was an increase of two deaths from the six that were recorded the previous week. Ms Sturgeon said numbers were likely to fluctuate at such a low level, pointing out that the overall number of deaths in Scotland was below the five-year average. However she said her government was likely to ""adopt a very cautious approach"" at the next review of lockdown restrictions on Thursday. She said ""very significant changes"" had been made in recent weeks, with the hospitality and tourism industries reopening, and said it was ""still too early to be completely assured"" of the impact of this. Ms Sturgeon said it was important not to ""do too much too quickly and give the virus the chance to overwhelm us again"". The first minister is expected to give further details of when and how Scotland's schools will re-open on Thursday.

Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Ordering parents back to work without allowing them to access the childcare they need is a stark reminder that Boris Johnson is completely out of touch with the needs of working families."" Clare Matthews runs Sunny Days Pre-school in West Molesey, Surrey, with her husband Richard. The business has been a success, but when lockdown hit, the couple could not afford to stay open for key workers' children. ""All providers are having to make tough decisions to maintain their nurseries and just to get through this,"" she says. ""The parents were really supportive when we gave them our reasons and they trusted us, but they think we are getting government support, and the money just isn't there."" Clare says the only coronavirus-related scheme Sunny Days qualified for was the business rate holiday, and when they applied for more funding from their local council, they were rejected and told to ""come back when it comes to crunch time"". She says: ""It is really stressful. We don't want to let our families down, we want our children back and we want to do it safely."" Parents want to come back to the nursery in September, when it plans to re-open, but Clare said some are ""scared"" of what the future may hold. ""I had a call from one parent today who is genuinely concerned because his employer 'suggested' his job would be at risk if he didn't get his childcare sorted by next month,"" she said. ""We are very strong and have good contingency plans in place, but I am seeing good nurseries close every week and it has people at panic stations."" Clare wants the government not just to think of short term fixes for the sector, but to ""reflect"" and look at a long-term recovery plan to up the funding for early years' care. ""Everybody is trying to make sure they can provide childcare, but the government and ministers need to recognise the problems and listen,"" she says. ""If the government doesn't put support in place quickly, I think there are going to be a lot more closures to come."" Meanwhile a senior Labour MP has raised concern about the options for those coming to the end of their maternity or paternity leave. Catherine McKinnell, chair of the Commons Petitions Committee, said some parents face ""a dreadful dilemma of having to prepare to return to work... at a time when finding suitable childcare is nearly impossible"". ""Our investigation found some parents have even had to give up their jobs because there has been no financially viable way to extend their leave,"" she said. She also expressed disappointment that the government had not responded to her committee's report on the subject. In a letter, Business Minister Paul Scully said a response to the report had not been issued before the recess due to the need for ""careful consideration of recommendations"" and for discussions with counterparts in other departments. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Should maternity and paternity leave be extended? Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association charity, said greater funding is needed as the situation is ""clearly not sustainable"". ""Since lockdown, nurseries have also had to absorb additional operating costs such as installing more handwashing stations and extra cleaning, but as costs have increased, their income has dropped due to low numbers of children,"" she said. ""The government has given most local authorities an extra 8p this year per hour per child, but this won't even cover inflation, let alone take account of above-inflation national minimum and living wage rises."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said early years providers would benefit from Â£3.6bn funding from next year for free early education and childcare places. ""We are continuing to provide extra security to nurseries and childminders that are open by 'block-buying' childcare places for the rest of this year at the level we would have funded before coronavirus - regardless of how many children are attending,"" she said. In Scotland,the government has had to delayimplementing a pledge to provide free early years care due to coronavirus - something First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she ""deeply"" regretted. A Â£10.5m fund to help childcare providers to reopen following the lockdownhas been set upin Northern Ireland. And in Wales,the government saysit has made Â£2.6m available to provide care for the children of key workers.

"Tech bosses grilled over claims of 'harmful' powerUS lawmakers are considering tougher regulation of the firms, which critics say are too powerful.Business","Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai defended their firms The heads of some of the world's biggest tech companies have appeared before Washington lawmakers to defend their firms against claims they abuse their power to quash competitors. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos said the world ""needs large"" firms, while the heads of Facebook, Apple and Google argued their companies had spurred innovation. The appearance comes as lawmakers consider tougher regulation and competition probes are under way. Some critics want the firms broken up. Democrats pressed the tech titans on competition issues, while Republicans were more concerned about how they managed information and whether they were marginalising conservative views. The hearing as it happened Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat leading the congressional committee holding the hearing, said a year-long investigation by lawmakers had showed the online platforms had ""wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand"". This video can not be played ""Mr Bezos... why on Earth would one of your partners compare your company to a drug dealer?"" He said he was convinced the firms were monopolies and called for action. ""Some need to be broken up and all need to be properly regulated,"" he said at the end of more than five hours of testimony. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google, and Tim Cook of Apple insisted they had done nothing illegal and stressed the American roots and values of their firms. At the hearing, lawmakers accused Google of having stolen content created by smaller firms, like Yelp, in order to keep users on their own web pages. Amazon's treatment of sellers on its site, Facebook's acquisition of competitors such as Instagram, and Apple's App store also drew attention. In response to claims Google had stolen content, Google boss Sundar Pichai said the firm held itself to the ""highest standard"" Mr Cicilline said Amazon had an inherent conflict of interest, since it both hosts sellers and competes against them by offering similar products. Such practice has also come under scrutiny from European regulators. ""Amazon's dual role... is fundamentally anti-competitive and Congress must take action,"" he said. However, some Republicans signalled they were not prepared to split up the firms or significantly overhaul US competition laws, with one committee member saying ""big is not inherently bad"". Republican concerns focused on perceived political bias at the firms, which they accused of suppressing conservative views. ""I'll just cut to the chase - big tech is out to get conservatives,"" said Congressman Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio. Four of the world's top technology company executives may have been testifying before the Judiciary Committee from a distance, but they were still caught in the middle of a political storm on Wednesday afternoon. The stated purpose of the hearing was to address whether existing anti-trust laws provide sufficient regulation of transnational tech Goliaths. The reality, however, was that the proceedings - with each member of the committee receiving five minutes to speak - were more akin to a feeding frenzy, as corporate chiefs faced criticism from every direction Democrats expressed concern that the companies were abusing their power by disadvantaging competitors or buying them out entirely. Republicans accused the witnesses of insufficient patriotism and being too cosy with the Chinese. Both sides expressed outrage over how the companies managed speech and expression on their platforms. They didn't go far enough in removing hateful rhetoric and false information, Democrats said. They singled out conservatives for censorship, the Republicans countered. Through it all, the witnesses thanked the questioners and took their lumps, perhaps confident that they could soon log off and get back to their work. While all the politicians seemed to agree that the big tech companies were a problem, their chances of arriving at any kind of solution seems unlikely. Appearing by remote video, the executives defended their companies, saying their products helped smaller businesses and they remained vulnerable to competition from newcomers. Apple boss Tim Cook said the business climate was ""so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business"". Mr Bezos, in his first appearance before Congress, denied that Amazon's multiple roles were a conflict of interest, but he admitted the firm was reviewing its handling of sales data from sellers on the site. The company has been accused of using such information to launch its own version of hot-selling products. Mr Bezos said Amazon rules forbid staff from looking at sales data from individual companies, but he conceded it was possible that employees had violated the policy. ""We are investigating that,"" he said. A day of reckoning for US tech giants' CEOs Will the US break up the tech giants? Elon Musk calls for 'break up' of Amazon In his prepared remarks, Mr Bezos said Amazon faced significant competition from firms such as Walmart and noted that the company lost money for years as it branched out into new areas. ""I love garage entrepreneurs - I was one. But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can't do,"" he said. This video can not be played WATCH: Who are the 'big four' and just how much power do they have? US President Donald Trump is a long-time critic of Amazon and threatened his own action on Twitter, writing: ""If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders."" He also told reporters that White House officials would be watching the hearing closely. ""There's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad,"" he said. Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said ""storm clouds"" were building in Washington but he thought it was unlikely that Congress would come together on new legislation that would force tech companies to change. ""We think a legislative fix is the only one that creates a potential for limitations on these companies' ability to conduct business, whether that takes the form of higher taxes or new rules regarding market concentration,"" he wrote. ""Absent a legislative fix, we don't see meaningful change in regulation, although future acquisitions will most certainly be scrutinized and more difficult to close.""

Self-isolation period to be extended to 10 days,"People who test positive for coronavirus or show symptoms in the UK must now self-isolate for at least 10 days, rather than seven. The change,announced by the UK's chief medical officers,external, comes as ministers try to avoid a resurgence of the virus. Until now, those showing key symptoms - a new continuous cough, a temperature or loss of taste or smell - have had to self-isolate for at least a week. The new advice is in line with World Health Organization guidance. The chief medical officers said the change is ""particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission"". Evidence shows that people with Covid-19 have ""a low but real possibility of infectiousness"" between seven and nine days after falling ill, they said. People are most contagious just before they first display symptoms and for the first few days afterwards. But scientists say evidence that they could pass it on up to nine days later has ""strengthened"". Advice on the length of isolation varies between countries. For example,the Irish Republic,externalsays those who have symptoms should isolate for 14 days, while inthe US,externalthose with symptoms are told to isolate for 10 days and can only leave isolation if they have had at least 24 hours without a fever. It comes after the prime minister warned ofsigns of a ""second wave"" of the pandemic in parts of Europe. Speaking on BBC Breakfast before the announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wanted to ""take a precautionary approach"" and ""protect people from that wave reaching our shores"". Frank Atherton, chief medical officer for Wales, said the change was ""vital"" and ""nobody should be under the illusion that coronavirus has gone away"". England death rate among worst in Europe What's the evidence Europe is having a 'second wave'? UK signs deal for 60 million virus vaccine doses The government has also confirmed that registered health and care professionals travelling to the UK from high-risk countries will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. An quarantine exemption for health professionals had been in place since June. There have also been concerns about several local outbreaks across the UK, including inOldham,WrexhamandStaffordshire. Meanwhile, the government is expected on Friday to announce a decision on whether to ease restrictions in Leicester, a month after the citywas put into extended lockdownfollowing a spike in cases. The mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, expressed frustration at the delayed decision, originally expected on Thursday. ""We haven't got a clue what's going on, we really haven't,"" he said. Two or three weeks ago the message from the prime minister was that, hopefully, we would be back to near-normality by Christmas. The direction of travel was one of lockdown easing, with pubs and restaurants reopening, as well as a feeling that we seemed to be getting through it. Now, there's a real sense of the brakes beginning to go on. We saw it with the quick quarantine measures imposed on people returning from Spain. Luxembourg may well have similar restrictions soon and they're keeping an eye on Belgium too. We had restrictions imposed in Oldham to curb the virus there and now there's been an extension of the self-isolation period. The real apprehension is that what is happening in the rest of Europe may, in time, happen here. To some extent, that has been the story of coronavirus: we have tended to follow what has emerged in mainland Europe. Official figures published on Thursday showed that 43,119 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in England had their cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace since its launch in May. The tracing system successfully contacted just over 77% of these - but just over 23% were not reached. The figures, from the Department of Health and Social Care, also showed that of 222,589 people identified as close contacts of those who tested positive, 83% had been reached and asked to self-isolate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge - that by the end of June everyone tested in person would receive results within 24 hours - is still not being met, with about three-quarters (76.4%) of people getting results on time in the week up to July 22. For those using home testing kits, 76.9% received results within 48 hours. But the government is concerned that some people are not coming forward for testing, hampering its ability to track outbreaks, because they wrongly think they have to pay for it or that they are not eligible. The UK requirement for people who test positive or show symptoms to isolate for seven days was always on the low side - plenty of other countries require 10 days or even longer. As coronavirus is new, there is still a lack of certainty over how long someone remains infectious, which is why there are a variety of approaches. UK health officials say there is enough evidence now to point to a ""low, but tangible"" risk of transmission from seven to 10 days, even for those with mild to moderate illness. This is a decision that could have been taken weeks, even months, ago in truth. But officials are describing it as a ""value judgement"" based on a variety of reasons. For one thing the easing of restrictions means we have more social contacts than we did previously - so even with the low risk of transmission post seven days, the chances of passing it on increases. The availability of widespread testing also means only those with a positively confirmed infection need to continue isolating - earlier in the pandemic the lack of testing meant a blanket approach had to be taken so anyone with symptoms was asked to isolate. But it is about sending an important signal too. Levels of infection are low, but the message is clear: we can't be complacent. The government is launching a TV and online advertising campaign on Thursday night stressing that anyone with symptoms should get tested, which is free and available to all. Only about a third of people infected are thought to come forward for tests, although some of the untested cases may be people who do not have any symptoms. Those in a household with anyone who tests positive or shows symptoms are told to self-isolate for 14 days. And people returning to the UK from certain countries are also being asked to quarantine for 14 days -a move that has sparked complaints from travel firms. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? Ministers are also looking for a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine period for arrivals to the UK, meaning that quarantine and self-isolation time periods could be standardised at 10 days. Mr Hancock told Today that the government is looking at using testing to reduce the length of the quarantine period - but there would be no imminent changes. On Thursday evening, Luxembourg was removed from the quarantine-free list, meaning people arriving in the UK from the small land-locked country from midnight will need to self-isolate for two weeks. A senior government source told the BBC that Belgium would stay off the list - for the moment - but case numbers would continue to be monitored. Leading travel and airline industry figures called on Wednesday forcoronavirus testing at airportsin the UK but the source said that ""any new system had to be workable and at the moment it isn't"". Mr Hancock told Breakfast that the ""big scientific challenge"" with testing arrivals at the border is that people ""can incubate this disease for many days without displaying any symptoms, and that wouldn't show up in a test"". Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it. Anyone who has either tested positive for coronavirus or shown symptoms should isolate themselves for at least 10 days, and those who show symptoms should arrange to get tested. Symptoms include: a new continuous cough a high temperature a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell They should continue to self-isolate if they still feel unwell after that initial period. Other members of their household should isolate for 14 days and not leave their homes. If you test positive you will be contacted by contact tracers, who will establish who else you might have passed on the infection to. Anybody they deem to be at risk will have to isolate themselves for 14 days from the point of contact.

A day of reckoning for US tech giants' CEOs,"This video can not be played WATCH: Who are the 'big four' and just how much power do they have? Unprecedented is a dangerous word in journalism, but this really hasn't happened before. On Wednesday, four of the biggest names in tech will give evidence to members of the US Congress. Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Sundar Pichai (Google), Tim Cook (Apple) and Jeff Bezos (Amazon) will all be grilled. Jeff Bezos - the world's richest man - has never testified before either house. They have never all been quizzed together. How these tech bosses do, how they stand up to scrutiny, could be a defining moment in their future relationship with government. Central to the interrogation will be whether these tech giants are simply too big. MacKenzie Scott donates $1.7bn since Bezos divorce Elon Musk calls for 'break up' of Amazon Amazon's hand-washing policy in spotlight The Covid pandemic has put this into sharp focus. Where other companies have struggled, Big Tech companies have thrived. Together they are now worth $5tn dollars. It's led to accusations that - just like the banks - they are simply too big to fail. The number of complaints levelled at these companies are so numerous they are too many to name individually here. In pre-released comments, Mark Zuckerberg argued that Facebook had become successful ""the American way"" - providing products that people find valuable after starting with nothing. ""Our story would not have been possible without US laws that encourage competition and innovation,"" he said. But he acknowledged that there were concerns about the size and perceived power of technology companies and that there should be a more active role for governments and regulators - and updated rules for the internet. Jeff Bezosposted his opening statement to Congress.,external Jeff Bezos is the world's richest man ""At Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things,"" he said. ""I know what Amazon could do when we were 10 people. I know what we could do when we were 1,000 people, and when we were 10,000 people. And I know what we can do today when we're nearly a million."" ""I believe Amazon should be scrutinized,"" he added. ""We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or non-profits. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colours."" The general theme is that these companies don't just run services - they own the internet's utilities. The charge is that they use that commanding position unfairly at the expense of others. Take one of the criticisms against Amazon, for example, that it promotes its own products over others on its Amazon marketplace. Or Apple charging a 30% cut on the money generated from apps that use the App Store. The complaint from app makers:  where else do we go to sell our apps? Apple and Google (which respectively own iOS and Android, the operating systems of almost all the world's smartphones) control the market, and so control who gets to play and who doesn't. And they of course get to set the charges. Google too, with its dominant search engine, has been accused (and fined) before, for burying competitor searches. Once again, the accusation is that no one company should have such a commanding position in an essential part of our internet. And there are general criticisms that can be levelled at all the tech giants too. For example the alleged Copy/Acquire/Kill strategies that all four are accused of using. Copy others' ideas, buy a company that threatens you - and even potentially kill it off. Is this just shrewd, albeit ruthless business? Or is this Big Tech flexing its muscle unfairly? Sundar Pichai is the new chief executive of Alphabet, Google's holding company Here's why this has been such a difficult area to police. Traditionally, anti-competition law - in this case ""anti-trust"" law - has been focused on consumer pricing. In a typical monopoly or cartel, there's a simple test. Are consumers paying more because of a lack of competition? The US ""trusts"" of the early 20th Century - from which the anti-trust legislation derives its name - were found to be driving up prices. Companies like Standard Oil and railway companies used their dominant position to hurt consumers. That's much harder to prove with these tech companies. For example Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are free. Amazon often drives down prices to beat competition. Google's search engine is free. YouTube  - owned by Google - is free. And apps on iPhones can often be downloaded for free. That is the heart of the argument. Critics say that these companies hurt consumers in a more subtle way, killing off smaller companies and strangling other businesses. The charge is that they are in fact damaging the economy. That's what legislators are looking to examine. Anti-trust campaigners have already lost one battle before the hearing even begins. They wanted to have the tech bosses grilled one by one. ""We want to leave as little room as possible for them to hide behind each other,"" Sarah Miller, from the American Economics Liberties Project, told me last week. But that's not going to happen. They'll be questioned together and the hearing will - perhaps aptly - be virtual. There are also worries that members of Congress will use the occasion to grandstand - to strut and preen - rather than asking the more difficult technical questions that might catch them out. Tim Cook's Apple is preparing for a time when iPhone sales do not bring in the huge profits investors have come to expect Off-topic questions are also likely - particularly for Mark Zuckerberg. For example, Facebook is currently the focus of an advertising boycott. It's accused of being too slow in removing racist and hateful content, and that could well be a line of questioning. And of course, ahead of the US elections, Facebook should expect incoming from both Republican and Democratic members of Congress. Democrats are generally concerned about far-right content on the platform, Republicans that the company is structurally left-wing. And of course there are still concerns of foreign interference. Expect China to come up too - and for it to be brought up by the tech bosses. With companies like TikTok and Huawei attracting the ire of the Trump administration, one defence will go something like: ""Break us up, overregulate us, and you give Chinese tech companies more power."" Trying to prise the four away from their scripts is going to be the toughest job. That worked most effectively during Mr Zuckerberg's interrogation on Capitol Hill in 2018. But that's harder said than done. Mark Zuckerberg was memorably questioned on Capitol Hill in 2018 Congress has a big opportunity here. The chance to really cross-examine these powerful men doesn't come often, and the evidence they give could shape their future relationship with government and their customers. But whatever happens on Wednesday, this won't be end of the story. Earlier this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee's anti-trust panel said it would hold a hearing in September to discuss Google's dominance in online advertising.

Will the US break up the tech giants?,"The US Department of Justice has announced what many consider to be a long-overdue investigation into the tech giants. But should the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook be worried? The decision to probe whether tech firms are competing properly follows heightened scrutiny of the companies in Washington. And it comes as Facebook is expected to be fined $5bn (Â£4bn) by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for privacy violations. Meanwhile, in Europe, Google has been fined more than Â£7bn in three different antitrust investigations by the European Commission. Technology giants' power to be probed in US Should Google, Amazon and Facebook fear this woman? Now, the DoJ, which is seen as more easily politically influenced than the FTC, has become the latest to ratchet up pressure on the companies - although it did not name which ""digital platforms"" it was looking into. It has only said that it was seeking to address ""widespread concerns"" around social media, search engines and online retail services and whether their actions had harmed consumers. Firstly, it may be worried about being seen as falling behind European regulators and lawmakers, as well at the FTC, according to Ioannis Kokkoris, professor of law and economics at Queen Mary University in London. The body's counterparts in Europe have pursued the firms, while the DoJ had ""done nothing"", he said. The academic expects the DoJ to look at whether the firms have too much data. But rather than focusing on privacy concerns, he expects the DoJ to look at whether the tech giants are using that customer information to stifle competition. He thinks the DoJ will also look for things like anti-competitive language in Amazon's contracts with its suppliers, and notes that the scope of the investigation could extend beyond an overall look at the market to become a probe into an individual firm. The US president has certainly given tech executives cause for concern. Just last week he promised to take a look into suggestions from tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, that Google should be investigated for treason over its dealings in China. And he has repeatedly sparred with Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, a paper that has been critical of the Trump administration Professor Kokkoris described it as a  ""very nice coincidence"" that this investigation had been launched as the administration appeared to be souring on the tech firms. He said the DoJ was unlikely to have launched the probe if it was going to be seen unfavourably by the administration. Ultimately, it could break the firms up. And it has some support, not least from Facebook's co-founder Chris Hughes who has said Whatsapp and Instagram, which are both owned by Facebook, should be made into separate companies. And the call has also gained support from US lawmakers. Most notably, US Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has said she'd consider dismantling the tech giants should she ever get the top job. However Prof Kokkoris thinks that is highly unlikely. US competition law makes it very hard for courts to find a legal basis on which to justify splitting up a large company.  If there is evidence of bad behaviour then a judge could conceivably make such a demand.  But companies can promise to fix the bad behaviour and move on. And that is what Professor Kokkoris expects to happen.  He thinks the DoJ may look to change the way the sector works to make it more competitive. At this stage, he would not be too worried if he was at the helm of one of the firms - but he said that could change if the DoJ decides to probe a specific company.

What's the evidence Europe is having a 'second wave'?,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned there are signs of a ""second wave"" of coronavirus cases in Europe, but what's the evidence for that? Talk of a second wave is the stuff of nightmares, conjuring up images of another deadly surge of infections. This is what happened with Spanish Flu after the First World War when a second wave proved deadlier than the first. But the truth is many experts try to avoid the phrase altogether. Margaret Harris, from the World Health Organization, has made clear that what we have seen is ""one big wave"" that is making its way across the globe. Some countries, such as South Korea and Singapore, have been better than others at flattening it from the start by stopping the virus spreading by using comprehensive testing and tracing regimes. But others - and the UK, France, Spain and Italy are examples of this - have just managed to flatten it partway through the wave by introducing lockdowns. This was because they did not have such sophisticated infectious disease systems in place to control the virus. Thanks to investment, they are in a much stronger position now and have been able to release lockdown, while still trying to suppress the virus wave through testing and tracing. But there are signs cases are picking up, especially in Spain. But rather than this being a second wave - or the start of one - perhaps we are better off thinking of these as the existing wave bursting through the defences. Prof Paul Hunter, a Covid expert at Norwich Medical School, says for it to be a second wave the virus would have to have gone away completely, so he prefers to call it a ""resurgence"". And really it should come as no surprise that this happens in highly-populated areas like Western Europe. Containing the virus relies on good systems for detecting cases and for the public to play its part by social distancing, and engaging with the test and trace systems. Clearly any weakness leaves countries susceptible, particularly to this virus which can be transmitted even if people are not displaying symptoms. However, while cases may be going up, it is worth noting they are nowhere near the levels seen during the peak of the pandemic. And bear in mind that the peaks seen in the charts above for all the countries - bar maybe Germany which had widespread testing in place quickly - are a gross underestimate of the true scale of infections. That's because there was not widespread testing available at the time. In the UK alone it is estimated that there were 100,000 cases a day at the peak - 20 times more than the testing in place at the time suggested. The greater access to testing there is, the more likely you are to pick up mild infections. If you only test patients in hospital - as was largely the case in the UK until late April - you are going to miss a lot of cases. What is also clear is that infection levels vary greatly within countries. There are areas where the virus is virtually non-existent, while in others it is lurking menacingly. In the UK there have beenflare-ups in Leicesterand - to a lesser extent -Blackburn with DarwenandOldham. A similar picture emerges when you look at the data for Spain. Even Germany is not immune to this, with local lockdowns announced in recent weeks. There are many reasons why this is happening. There are signs young people are spreading it in certain areas. Certainly, the young are less likely to get extremely sick, which could make them more relaxed about the need for social distancing. But it could also be true that the virus has always been circulating in these groups, it is just that more widespread testing is picking it up. There also seems to be a link to deprivation - where people live in close proximity the likelihood of transmission increases. This video can not be played What factors determine a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections? Whatever the reasons behind the local flare-ups, what is certain is that they will continue for the foreseeable future. Prof Keith Neal, an expert in infectious diseases from University of Nottingham, says these spikes will become a way of life, but they are in ""no way"" a second wave. He says countries across Europe are ""learning to live"" with the virus by taking precautions such as social distancing and wearing masks. He believes that if people remain vigilant, coupled with the improved treatments that are being found and greater testing, the scale of deaths seen during the peaks will hopefully not be repeated. There is a good chance, it seems, that what will be seen are the ripples from the first wave rather than a big second wave.

Mystery of origin of Stonehenge stones solvedArchaeologists have pinpointed the source of the stones to an area 15 miles north of the site.Wiltshire,"The origin of the standing sarsens at Stonehenge had been impossible to identify until now The origin of the giant sarsen stones at Stonehenge has finally been discovered with the help of a missing piece of the sitewhich was returned after 60 years. A test of the metre-long core was matched with a geochemical study of the standing megaliths. Archaeologists pinpointed the source of the stones to an area 15 miles (25km) north of the site near Marlborough. English Heritage's Susan Greaney said the discovery was ""a real thrill"". The seven-metre tall sarsens, which weigh about 20 tonnes, form all fifteen stones of Stonehenge's central horseshoe, the uprights and lintels of the outer circle, as well as outlying stones. The monument's smaller bluestones have been traced to the Preseli Hills in Wales, but the sarsens had been impossible to identify until now. The return of the core, which was removed during archaeological excavations in 1958, enabled archaeologists to analyse its chemical composition. No-one knew where it was until Robert Phillips, 89, who was involved in those works, decided to return part of it last year. The stone samples were removed during archaeological work in 1958 Researchers first carried out x-ray fluorescence testing of all the remaining sarsens at Stonehenge which revealed most shared a similar chemistry and came from the same area. They then analysed sarsen outcrops from Norfolk to Devon and compared their chemical composition with the chemistry of a piece of the returned core. English Heritage said the opportunity to do a destructive test on the core proved ""decisive"", as it showed its composition matched the chemistry of sarsens at West Woods, just south of Marlborough. Prof David Nash from Brighton University, who led the study, said: ""It has been really exciting to harness 21st century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries. Archaeologists analysed the composition of the core to pinpoint where the ancient Sarsen stones came from ""Each outcrop was found to have a different geochemical signature, but it was the chance to test the returned core that enabled us to determine the source area for the Stonehenge sarsens."" Ms Greaney said: ""To be able to pinpoint the area that Stonehenge's builders used to source their materials around 2,500 BC is a real thrill. ""While we had our suspicions that Stonehenge's sarsens came from the Marlborough Downs, we didn't know for sure, and with areas of sarsens across Wiltshire, the stones could have come from anywhere. ""They wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find and it made sense to get them from as nearby as possible."" Ms Greaney added the evidence highlights ""just how carefully considered and deliberate the building of this phase of Stonehenge was"".

Pharmacy linked to new Covid-19 cluster,"A pharmacy in Inverclyde is among a number of businesses which have been linked to a new coronavirus cluster. Eight positive tests in Port Glasgow are among 14 new cases reported in the Greater Glasgow health board area. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said none of the cases were experiencing anything more than mild symptoms. It added: ""Close contacts are being advised to self-isolate and other identified contacts are being followed up and given appropriate advice."" Greenock and Inverclyde MSP Stuart McMillian tweeted to say he would not speculate ""where or who is involved"". But he said: ""News has broken that there has been a cluster of Covid-19 cases in Port Glasgow. ""I have spoken to the Scottish government and the health board, and their Track and Trace Investigation Team are working on this as we speak. ""I will share information to help the community when I get it."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that an incident management team was meeting to discuss the development. The cases were among 22 reported across Scotland in the last 24 hours. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland Ms Sturgeon has previously said localised outbreaks of the virus are all but inevitable, following clusters in North Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway. However, the first minister said the ""test and protect"" system was working well, with the number of people being treated in hospital for Covid-19 remaining low. Ms Sturgeon said:  ""Part of the challenge we have around any potential cluster is to make sure everything possible that can be done to minimise onward transmission is done."" Nicola Sturgeon has previously said localised outbreaks of the virus are ""all but inevitable"" The first minister said people should be assured that ""any suggestion of any links between cases or possible clusters or outbreaks are absolutely rigorously explored, investigated and dealt with"". News of the cluster came as the National Records of Scotland said the number of deaths linked to coronavirus had increased very slightly, with Covid-19 mentioned on eight death certificates in the week to Sunday. This was an increase of two deaths from the six that were recorded the previous week. Ms Sturgeon said numbers were likely to fluctuate at such a low level, pointing out that the overall number of deaths in Scotland was below the five-year average. However she said her government was likely to ""adopt a very cautious approach"" at the next review of lockdown restrictions on Thursday. She said ""very significant changes"" had been made in recent weeks, with the hospitality and tourism industries reopening, and said it was ""still too early to be completely assured"" of the impact of this. Ms Sturgeon said it was important not to ""do too much too quickly and give the virus the chance to overwhelm us again"". The first minister is expected to give further details of when and how Scotland's schools will re-open on Thursday.

"Wiley sorry for tweets 'that looked anti-Semitic'The grime artist apologises for ""generalising"" about Jewish people after he's banned from social media.Technology","Grime artist Wiley has apologised for ""generalising"" about Jewish people after being banned from social media. In an interview with Sky News, the artist insisted: ""I'm not racist."" ""My comments should not have been directed to all Jews or Jewish people. I want to apologise for generalising, and I want to apologise for comments that were looked at as anti-Semitic."" Twitter had earlier banned his account permanently after a public backlash over a perceived lack of action. ""We are sorry we did not move faster,"" Twitter said in a statement. Sky News reported that the offensive tweets were sparked by a falling-out between the rapper and his former manager, who is Jewish. The pair cut ties in recent days. ""I just want to apologise for generalising and going outside of the people who I was talking to within the workspace and workplace I work in,"" Wiley said. ""I'm not racist, you know. I'm a businessman. My thing should have stayed between me and my manager, I get that."" However, the artist appeared in the interview to refuse to distance himself from most of the anti-Semitic comments he posted on social media. Wiley's series of anti-Semitic tweets appeared on Friday night. One tweet read: ""I don't care about Hitler, I care about black people"", and compared the Jewish community to the Ku Klux Klan. This video can not be played Rapper Wiley's Twitter account has been suspended after anti-Semitic posts Twitter did not immediately respond, prompting a public outcry anda 48-hour boycott of Twitter by many usersover what they said had been an unacceptable delay. The social network eventually banned Wiley for violating its ""hateful conduct"" policy - a day after Facebook and Instagram had deleted the music star's accounts for ""repeated violations"" of their rules. Twitter said it had decided to make an earlier temporary ban permanent, and wipe all his past posts from its platform, ""upon further consideration"". ""We deeply respect the concerns shared by the Jewish community and online safety advocates,"" the statement said, promising to continue to tackle anti-Semitism. The star, known as the ""godfather of grime"", was awarded an MBE for services to music in 2018. He told Sky News he would hand back the honour following calls for him to be stripped of it, saying he had ""never wanted it"". ""I never felt comfortable going to get it. Just look at Britain's colonialism history,"" he said. When asked what he would like to say to his fans, he responded angrily saying fans were fickle and, at 41, he was no longer ""current"" and was at the end of his career. By Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation and social media reporter The permanent suspension of the rapper's Facebook, Instagram and Twitter profiles has been widely welcomed. However, it is emblematic of a slowness to act on hateful abuse from social media sites. And many are asking why this took so long. Time and time again, decisive action from social media sites over racist abuse, misinformation or hate speech has come only once comments have reached thousands of users. What does it take for Twitter to act decisively on anti-Semitic abuse? Facebook removes Wiley after abuse of Jewish critics VIPs and MPs boycott Twitter after Wiley tweets 'How it feels to be black and Jewish' In this case it appears to be external pressure - the move comes after a boycott by users. And it also seems to be dependent on what the other social media sites choose to do: Facebook moved to suspend Wiley's accounts on Tuesday, and then Twitter appeared to follow suit. With the Stop Hate for Profit campaign ramping up pressure, and increased focus on the way social media sites tackle hate speech and misinformation, the spotlight will intensify on the actions of Twitter, Facebook and Google in these scenarios. The delay in Twitter taking action prompted the 48-hour boycott of Twitter by many users - including celebrities and MPs - beginning on Monday morning. Organisers said the time reflected the ""48 hours of pure race hate"" they accuse Twitter of giving to Wiley. On Tuesday, Facebook issued a ban after Wiley was discovered posting abusive material on his personal page using his real name, Richard Cowie. Twitter followed suit on Wednesday, after what it said was a thorough investigation. Despite the move, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said both Twitter and Facebook had been slow to act, adding ""it is just not good enough"". ""Social media companies have not been strong or fast enough about tackling racism, misogyny or homophobia,"" it said in a statement. The Campaign Against Antisemitism echoed that sentiment, writing that Twitter ""has finally listened"". ""The closure of Wiley's account is too little too late, but it is at least a start for this deeply irresponsible social network,"" it said.

Boeing to end 747 production and warns of job cuts,"Boeing has said it will stop making its classic 747 plane and is eyeing steeper job cuts than those it has previously announced. The firm is also planning to slow production of many of its jets, including the troubled 737 Max. The changes come as the firm disclosed a $2.4bn (Â£1.8bn) loss as the virus depressed demand for air travel. ""The reality is the pandemic's impact on the aviation sector continues to be severe,"" said Boeing boss Dave Calhoun. Airlines around the world have responded to the coronavirus pandemic by reducing their fleets and delaying or cancelling aircraft orders. This month British Airways became the latest to say it was retiring all of its 747 jets - about 10% of its fleet - citing the fall in passenger demand. Australian airline Qantas has also retired the jet, which marked its 50th anniversary last year. BA retires entire 747 fleet after travel downturn Boeing job cuts start to hit nearly 13,000 workers Boeing said the slowdown may mean deeper job cuts on top of roughly 16,000 layoffs - around 10% of its workforce - it has already planned. ""Our government services, defence and space programs provide some critical stability for us in the near-term as we take tough but necessary steps to adapt for new market realities,"" Mr Calhoun said. ""We are taking the right action to ensure we're well positioned for the future."" The pandemic has exacerbated the crisis facing Boeing, which was already in trouble following two fatal crashes of its 737 Max plane which killed 346 people. The jet has been grounded since last March, costing the company some $20bn. The scandal led to the departure of top executives and a string of ongoing investigations. Boeing said it has re-started production of the 737, but it expects the rate of manufacturing to remain low for the foreseeable future as the virus weighs on the industry. It said it hoped to be making 31 per month by the beginning of 2022 - instead of during 2021 as planned.  That would be roughly half the rate of the firm's production before the grounding. Qantas retired its Boeing 747 jets last week ""While there have been some encouraging signs, we estimate it will take around three years to return to 2019 passenger levels,"" Boeing said. Boeing said it lost $2.4bn in the three months to 30 June, as sales fell 25% to $11.8bn. Last year, it reported a $2.9bn loss in the same quarter, driven by a charge of more than $5bn related to the grounding of the 737 Max. The sales decline was driven by its commercial unit, which serves passenger airlines. Revenue dropped 65% as the firm delivered just 20 planes in the quarter, compared to 90 a year ago. Sales in the firm's defence, space and security unit were essentially flat at $6.5bn.

Staffordshire County Council said one individual from the pub who has tested positive attended a private social gathering - further spreading the virus. A post on the pub's Facebook page said it had temporarily closed and it is planning to review its risk assessment ahead of reopening at the weekend. One resident described ""hundreds of people"" going to the centre this morning. Dr Richard Harling, the county council's director for public health, said: ""We also want people who have been in close contact with anyone drinking in the pub on that weekend to get themselves tested, as well as people who were out and about in the town and are experiencing Covid-19 symptoms - namely a high temperature, new persistent cough or loss of taste and smell. ""It is also crucial that people self-isolate if they are told to do so.""

They called for quarantine-free travel to areas unaffected by any spike in coronavirus cases.

This would include not just Spain, but other key markets for trade and tourism, such as the US and Canada.

John and Mary Boxer should have been celebrating their diamond wedding anniversary in the past week, their family had planned a big party. Instead they both died with Covid-19 within days of each other. Daughter Elaine said the couple had been friends since childhood, growing up in the same part of Sunderland and they were married on 23 July 1960. John fell ill on 10 April and was taken to Sunderland Royal Hospital, where Mary had worked as a dinner nanny. Staff found nothing wrong and sent him home but two days later on Easter Sunday he returned and was tested for Covid-19. Seven days after he had fallen ill he died on 17 April. Mary, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, found it hard to process what had happened. ""She stopped eating"", Elaine said, but the family put that down to grief. A few days before her husband's funeral she was taken to hospital with a temperature, before testing positive for coronavirus. The family left John's funeral on 2 May only to find out that Mary had died. They are planning to hold a joint memorial for the couple later in the year, when social distancing rules allow for it. Elaine said: ""We need some closure. The small comfort we have is that they are together again - they were always together."" Read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The most recent seven-day average for cases in the UK is 726. This is up by just under 25% since 15 July. It is still too soon to know for sure whether this is due to more and better testing - or the early stages of a resurgence of the virus. The ONS survey suggests that infections in homes in England are steady - no signal for rising or falling numbers. Test and trace stats up until 15 July showed that testing was going up faster than case numbers, suggesting some of the rise could be due to testing. And levels of infection are far below their peak. But patterns across Europe show the possibilities for the virus to increase. Reality Check Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health
Organizationâs (WHO) regional director for Europe, was on the BBCâs Today
programme this morning talking about some of the recent spikes in coronavirus
cases. âWhat's a bit different now, although still
without final scientific evidence, is that we are receiving reports from civil
and health authorities of a higher proportion of new infections among young
people,â he said. We asked the WHO for more details. It said it
didnât want to single out countries but pointed to these examples. In Sweden,,externalwhere there was a sharp increase in cases for those under the age of 49 in mid-June. Since then those cases have
declined, but the 20 to 29 age group currently has more cases per 100,000
people than any other age group in the country. In Ireland,,externalas of 28 July, nearly 60% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases have occurred in people under 45. In Israel,external, the recent increase in
cases has been linked to outbreaks in schools. In the latest figures, about a
fifth of cases occurred in people aged 10 to 19 and a fifth in the 20 to 29 group. Helen BriggsBBC Environment correspondent Bats may harbour viruses, but should not be persecuted, say experts Coronaviruses capable of infecting humans may have been circulating undetected in bats for decades. Research suggests one of the closest known ancestors of the virus that causes Covid-19 emerged in bats between 40 and 70 years ago. It has been poised for human crossover for some time, the scientists said. And this casts further doubt on conspiracy theories that the virus causing Covid-19 was bioengineered or escaped from a laboratory, they added. Prof David Robertson, of the University of Glasgow, worked on the study, published in the journal Nature Microbiology. You can read more here. Among those who will now have to quarantine for 14 days after returning from Spain is Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. He spoke to reporters on his return home to the UK today and said that the blanket rule on Spain had been the right thing to do - but that he understood the frustration some might be feeling. ""I very much understand. It obviously had an impact on me and
my family and I am very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who were
either away, or perhaps havenât even managed to go away this summer, as well to
Spain,"" he said. ""But it is absolutely essential we acted when we did and that is why all
four nations of the UK acted together and the figures have turned out to
justify that action."" Mr Shapps said he could not discount quarantines being introduced on arrivals from other countries, adding that the Spanish islands had been included because Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty was very concerned by the figures. US Attorney General William Barr will be tested for coronavirus after he came into close contact with a member of Congress who later tested positive. Barr met the Texan Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert when he was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. It's believed that Gohmert subsequently tested positive for the virus ahead of a flight back to Texas with President Donald Trump. As we reported earlier, the US has seen another sharp rise in the number of coronavirus deaths. Florida suffered a record number of fatalities for a second successive day and the US reported what's believed to be the fastest increase in deaths since the start of June. The rise in infections has forced states to reverse reopening their economies and easing restrictions. Aviation giant Boeing will stop making its classic 747 plane and is eyeing steeper job cuts than previously announced. The firm said it isplanning slow the production of many of its jets after disclosing a $2.4bn (Â£1.8bn) loss as the virus reduced demand for air travel. This month British Airways became the latest to say it was retiring all of its 747 jets - about 10% of its fleet - citing the fall in passenger demand. Australian airline Qantas has also retired the jet, which marked its 50th anniversary last year. ""The reality is the pandemic's impact on the aviation sector continues to be severe,"" said Boeing boss Dave Calhoun. India's healthcare system has struggled to cope with rising cases Let's take a look at India now. The government has further relaxed its coronavirus restrictions, despite a sharp increase in the number of cases over the past month. A night-time curfew has been lifted and gyms will be allowed to open from next week. But schools, colleges and cinema halls will remain closed until the end of August and restrictions will remain in force in designated containment zones. India has registered more than 1.5m confirmed infections, the third highest tally in the world after the US and Brazil. More than 34,500 people have died in the country due to the virus so far. Police and council staff will patrol the gates at a Glasgow park on Friday to prevent anyone entering with alcohol, in anticipation of high temperatures. It comes after police were forced to disperse crowds at Kelvingrove Park during lockdown following antisocial behaviour. Glasgow City Council said the decision had been made in anticipation of high temperatures forecast for Friday. It said it expected the weather to draw large crowds to the area. A possible coronavirus ""cluster"" in Glasgow is being investigated. The scaled-down Muslim Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia has meant a drastic drop in income for many who provide services for the pilgims. More than two million people from all over the world normally take part but because of coronavirus restictions, only about 1,000 Saudi residents will perform this year's five-day ritual.

US tech giants face Congress grilling,"The bosses of four of America's largest tech firms are testifying remotely to Congress Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook are all taking part They face questions from the House Judiciary Committee on whether their firms have become too dominant ""Simply put, they have too much power,"" committee chair David Cicilline said in his opening remarks Together the companies represent $5 trillion (Â£3.8 trillion) dollars of the US economy It is the first time Bezos - the world's richest person - has appeared before the US Congress Leo Kelion and Tom Spender We're now ending our live coverage of this event - but before we go, here's a recap of what's happened today. You can read a summary of the hearing here. And on Friday,our Tech Tent podcastwill further explore how the four chief executives fared. The committee's chair Congressman Cicilline has ended the hearing with one last shot across the bows of the tech leaders. ""Today we had the opportunity to hear from the decision-makers from the most powerful companies in the world,"" he said. ""This hearing has made one fact clear to me: These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable. And he added: ""We must make our choice. We may have democracy or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few. We can't have both."" So, today's skirmish is over. But how willing the politicians are to enforce regulations capable of reining in the tech giants, and what the tech giants might do to resist, remain open questions. Over recent weeks, Facebook has seen an exodus of big-name advertisers, which have voiced protest over its handling of hate speech and disinformation. Shortly after the walkout began, comments Zuckerberg made to an internal meeting were leaked, revealing he had said theadvertisers would be back soon enough. Congresswoman Jayapal asked if Facebook was now so big that it wasn't worried how it was impacted by a major boycott of 1,100 advertisers. ""No congresswoman. Of course we care,"" he responded. ""But we're also not going to set our content policies because of advertisers. I think that that would be the wrong thing for us to do. ""We've cared about issues like fighting hate speech for a long time, and we have invested billions of dollars [in content moderators and AI systems]... I do believe that they are industry leading."" There have only been a few instances when the politicians have taken advantage of the fact that all four CEOs are present to bounce a question between them. But Congressman Jordan has just used the opportunity to question their commitment to the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech. Here's their responses - Cook: ""I think it's good for people to hear different points of view and decide for themselves."" PichaI: ""We take pride in the fact that across our platforms, including YouTube, there are more diverse voices than ever before."" Zuckerberg: ""I believe strongly in free expression. Giving people a voice is an important part of what our services do. And I'm very worried about some of the forces of illiberalism that I see in this country."" Bezos: ""I am concerned in general about that, and what I find a little discouraging is that it appears to me that social media is a nuance-destruction machine. And I don't think that's helpful for a democracy."" Democratic Rep David Cicilline has been grilling Mark Zuckerberg over the firm's response to the coronavirus. ""What are you doing right now to protect people from demonstrably false claims related to this deadly pandemic?"" he asks. He says misinformation is often the most-shared content on the platform. ""The more engagement there is, the more money you make from advertising,"" he says - and goes on to list some examples. He accuses Facebook of being so big that it can't effectively police ""deadly content"". Zuckerberg says such content is not good for its business model and it removes offending posts. ""I think we have relatively good record in taking down misleading content,"" he responds. But Cicilline goes on: ""This is the tip of the iceberg. It's not just about Covid. Facebook gets away with it because there is no competitor. Itâs the only game in town."" The four bosses are asked a yes-or-no question by Republican Greg Steube: Do you believe the Chinese government is stealing technology from US
companies? Tim Cook. ""I donât know of specific cases where we have been
stolen from by the government. I know of no case on ours where it occurred."" Sunder Pichai: ""I have no first-hand knowledge of any information
stolen from Google in this regard."" Mark Zuckerberg: ""I think itâs well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from US companies."" Jeff Bezos: ""I havenât seen that personally but Iâve heard many
reports of it."" Democratic Congresswoman Mary Scanlon has been asking Sunder
Pichai about YouTubeâs policies on content for children. She asks Mr Pichai if
Google has been collecting data on the children who use YouTube. Mr Pichai responds that this is an area the firm takes very
seriously. He says under-13s are not allowed to set up their own accounts, and the firm had invested in a special version of its video clip service, YouTube Kids. Ms Scanlon then asks if YouTube is investing in âluring inâ
advertisers by telling them that YouTube is regularly visited by children. âAre you targeting children and then targeting advertisers
to bring them on board?â Mr Pichai responds by saying everything the firm does
complies with regulations. Finally Ms Scanlon asks if content creators are able to
choose which advertisements appear next to their content. âIf Sesame Street doesnât want to show junk food ads on YouTube,
does Google allow them to make that choice?â Mr Pichai says users have a choice â they can use it as a
subscription service without seeing such advertisements or they can use it for
free with ads. He says he is not aware of a report in the Wall St Journal alleging that YouTube is making it difficult for independent auditors to report back to companies on what advertisements are shown alongside their content, but will get back to her about it. Matt Gaetz questioned whether Mark Zuckerberg was being truthful Having earlier questioned Google about bias, the Republican Matt Gaetz has now chased Zuckerberg over the issue. The politician claimed that Facebook's culture ""disadvantages conservatives"" and that its employees had been caught out on video revealing their prejudices. ""I certainly do not want our platforms to be run in a way that has any ideological bias,"" Zuckerberg replied. Facebook's chief declined to get into the specifics of the hidden-camera clips being referenced, but said: ""People make mistakes... it's our job in running the company to make sure that we minimise errors."" Mr Gaetz then switched tack asking why Zuckeberg had fired Palmer Luckey. The co-founder of the Oculus virtual reality division Facebook acquired in 2014 was ousted two years later after it emerged he had donated money to an anti-Hillary Clinton group during the presidential election. ""I'm not sure it's appropriate to get into a specific personnel issue publicly,"" Zuckerberg responded. Mr Gaetz wasn't satisfied with this. ""I've seen the messages where you have specifically directed Mr Luckey to make statements regarding his politics for the benefit of your company,"" he said. ""So I think both in the case of these content moderators and in the case of the testimony you just gave regarding Mr Luckey... there is serious question as to whether or not you're giving truthful testimony here."" These days Mr Luckey runs a surveillance start-up that is helping patrol the US-Mexico border. The US markets are now closed. So how do investors think the tech CEOs are doing? Obviously, it's a bit simplistic to link stock prices to their performance - but if the politicians had landed a deadly blow, you might have expected at least one of the companies' shares to have suffered. But at the close of trade: Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Four of the worldâs top technology
company executives may have been testifying before the Judiciary Committee from
a distance, but they were still caught in the middle of a political storm on
Wednesday afternoon. The stated purpose of the hearing was to
address whether existing anti-trust laws provide sufficient regulation of
transnational tech Goliaths. The reality, however, was that the proceedings - with each member of the committee receiving five minutes to speak - were more
akin to a feeding frenzy, as corporate chiefs faced criticism from every
direction Democrats
expressed concern that the companies were abusing their power by disadvantaging
competitors or buying them out entirely. Republicans accused the witnesses of
insufficient patriotism and being too cosy with the Chinese. Both sides
expressed outrage over how the companies managed speech and expression on their
platforms. They didnât go far enough in removing hateful rhetoric and false
information, Democrats said. They singled out conservatives for censorship, the
Republicans countered. Through
it all, the witnesses thanked the questioners and took their lumps, perhaps
confident that they could soon log off and get back to their work. While all
the politicians seemed to agree that the big tech companies were a problem,
their chances of arriving at any kind of solution seems unlikely. While we are in another break, a reminder of who the tech chief executives are giving testimony to the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee: -Mark Zuckerberglaunched Facebook while a student at Harvard. It is the biggest social media network in the world. He is the youngest of the four men, aged 36, and has masterminded a series of key takeovers, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus. -Sundar Pichai, the former chief of Google's Chrome browser, climbed the ranks to take charge of parent company Alphabet at the end of 2019. He was born in India and is now one of the best compensated chief executives in the US - company filings revealed he earned $281m (Â£213m) last year. -Jeff Bezosfounded Amazon as an online bookstore in his garage and built it into a giant spanning e-commerce, streaming and cloud computing. He's the world's richest man and had never appeared before Congress until now. He regularly sells part of his stock in Amazon to fund another venture, the space transport company Blue Origin. -Tim Cookjoined Apple in 1998, and served as co-founder Steve Jobs' chief financial officer before taking the top job in 2011. Under his leadership, Apple has made digital privacy one of its core values, and sought to become less reliant on hardware sales by expanding across a range of digital services.   Jeff Bezos has been questioned about why Amazon doesn't do more to remove fake goods sold via its online marketplace. ""Counterfeits are a scourge,"" said Mr Bezos. ""It's bad for customers. It's bad for honest third-party sellers."" But the Democratic member Henry Johnson said the panel had heard evidence from one seller that Amazon had only agreed to stop diverting sales to knock-off rivals once the vendor had committed to a $2m advertising spend. ""That's unacceptable,"" responded Mr Bezos. ""If someone, somewhere inside Amazon said 'you know, buy X dollars in ads and then we'll help you with your counterfeit problem', that is unacceptable. ""And I will look into that and we'll get back to your office with that."" Facebookâs Mark Zuckerberg has once again been pressed on whether his
company stifled competitors by copying their features or forced them into a sale. He said he saw it as part of Facebook's job to work out
what people found valuable in tech. âWeâve certainly adapted features that others have led in,
as have others copied and adapted features that we have led in,"" he explained. But Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal didn't give up the theme, asking: ""Has Facebook ever threatened to clone the products of another company while also attempting to acquire that company?"" ""Not that I recall,"" said Zuckerberg. The politician pressed on, asking what he then made of reports that he had threatened to go into ""destroy mode"" when trying to convince Kevin Systrom to sell Instagram. ""I want to respectfully disagree with the characterisation,"" said Zuckerberg. ""It was clear that this was a space that we were going to compete in one way or another. I don't view those conversations as a threat in any way."" In any case, Mr Zuckerberg clinched the deal, and Mr Systrom has since quit. The committee chair David Cicilline has pressed Jeff Bezos over claims that his company has an inherent conflict of interest with sellers who use its marketplace. He said one clothing company had likened receiving a cheque from the online store to getting a fix of ""Amazon heroin"" - the idea being that it felt good in the short-term to be paid, but ultimately Amazon would cause the seller's downfall by launching rival products of its own. ""Mr Bezos, this is one of your partners. Why on earth would they compare your company to a drug dealer?"" the congressman asked. âI completely disagree with that characterisation,â replied Mr Bezos. âI think it's important to understand that we have a policy against using individual seller data to compete with our private-label products.â Mr Cicilline made clear he was unconvinced. ""Amazon is only interested in exploiting its monopoly power over the e-commerce marketplace,"" he concluded. ""Amazon's dual role as a platform operator and competing seller on that platform is fundamentally anti-competitive and Congress must take action."" Amazon's Jeff Bezos is presented with a complaint from a family bookseller, who says their business evaporated after being de-listed from his online store. âI would like to talk to her. It does not at all to me seem
the right way to treat her. And Iâm surprised by that. Itâs not the systematic
approach that we take,"" Mr Bezos said, rejecting accusations his company was ""bullying"" small suppliers. Republican Jim Jordan Republican congressman Jim Jordan returned to the theme that tech companies are biased against his party, suggesting Google might tailor its features to aid Joe Biden's presidential campaign. ""We won't do any work to politically tilt things one way or another. It's against our core values,"" responded Mr Pichai. But Mr Jordan went on to bring up a 2016 email, in which he said a Google executive had talked about the ""silent donation"" Google had made to Hillary Clinton's campaign. ""We didn't find any evidence of such activity,"" Mr Pichai replied. Mr Jordan continued, saying the email had referred to Google urging people to vote ""in key states"". He suggested this was a reference to the swing states of Nevada and Florida, meaning there had been a deliberate effort to prevent Donald Trump from winning. ""I can assure you we were compliant with the laws in 2016,"" said Mr Pichai, adding that Google would obey the law this year as well. ""Can you assure us you are not going to silence conservatives and... you're not going to configure your features [to favour] Joe Biden?"" Mr Jordan said again. ""You have my commitment. It's always been true and we'll continue to conduct yourselves in a neutral way,"" was the reply. It seemed to be a relatively calm end to the session until the next politician, the Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon, suggested Mr Jordan had been pushing ""fringe conspiracy theories"". At which point, Mr Jordan reacted with fury, saying: ""We have the email - there was no fringe conspiracies.""  In a testy exchange, the Democratic member Val Butler Demings asked Sundar Pichai whether it was true that ""the more user data that Google collects, the more money Google can make"". ""That's not true,"" he replied. ""Most of the data today we collect is to help users and provide personalised experiences."" But before he could flesh out this response - or be challenged over it - the session ended to make way for the next set of questions. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and chair of
the antitrust subcommittee A gentle reminder from the committee chair to the tech bosses that time is short, with each committee member just getting five minutes each. All four have often begun their answers by thanking the committee for the question. ""We appreciate the gratitude for the questions, and your description of them as good questions, but we'll just assume that they are good questions and that you are happy to answer them."" Amazon's Jeff Bezos has finally been asked a question, so it looks like his feed is working - though the picture is a bit fuzzy. Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal asked him for a ""yes or no"" answer to whether his firm had ever used seller data to make business decisions. This was a reference to reports that Amazon had used data gathered from businesses selling products via its site to design and price its own rival first-party goods - something the firm has previously suggested had been limited to a group of rogue employees. Mr Bezos responded that he couldn't give in answer in such simple terms. ""What I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated,"" he said. Ms Jayapal said she remained concerned that Amazon was continuously monitoring its logs to prevent any other business from becoming big enough that it would pose a competitive risk.  The hearing is back in business and with questions for Alphabet's Sundar Pichai on General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). Republican Kelly Armstrong makes the case that the privacy law has helped entrench Google's market-leading position rather than weaken it. Mr Pichai responded: ""We see robust competition in the marketplace [and] we have to comply with regulation."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Staffordshire County Council said one individual from the pub who has tested positive attended a private social gathering - further spreading the virus. A post on the pub's Facebook page said it had temporarily closed and it is planning to review its risk assessment ahead of reopening at the weekend. One resident described ""hundreds of people"" going to the centre this morning. Dr Richard Harling, the county council's director for public health, said: ""We also want people who have been in close contact with anyone drinking in the pub on that weekend to get themselves tested, as well as people who were out and about in the town and are experiencing Covid-19 symptoms - namely a high temperature, new persistent cough or loss of taste and smell. ""It is also crucial that people self-isolate if they are told to do so.""

Speaking shortly after he arrived back from a Spanish holiday of his own, he said that he would have to go into quarantine for two weeks. The government announced on 25 July that the measures would take effect for those coming back to the UK from anywhere in the European country.

John and Mary Boxer should have been celebrating their diamond wedding anniversary in the past week, their family had planned a big party. Instead they both died with Covid-19 within days of each other. Daughter Elaine said the couple had been friends since childhood, growing up in the same part of Sunderland and they were married on 23 July 1960. John fell ill on 10 April and was taken to Sunderland Royal Hospital, where Mary had worked as a dinner nanny. Staff found nothing wrong and sent him home but two days later on Easter Sunday he returned and was tested for Covid-19. Seven days after he had fallen ill he died on 17 April. Mary, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, found it hard to process what had happened. ""She stopped eating"", Elaine said, but the family put that down to grief. A few days before her husband's funeral she was taken to hospital with a temperature, before testing positive for coronavirus. The family left John's funeral on 2 May only to find out that Mary had died. They are planning to hold a joint memorial for the couple later in the year, when social distancing rules allow for it. Elaine said: ""We need some closure. The small comfort we have is that they are together again - they were always together."" Read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The most recent seven-day average for cases in the UK is 726. This is up by just under 25% since 15 July. It is still too soon to know for sure whether this is due to more and better testing - or the early stages of a resurgence of the virus. The ONS survey suggests that infections in homes in England are steady - no signal for rising or falling numbers. Test and trace stats up until 15 July showed that testing was going up faster than case numbers, suggesting some of the rise could be due to testing. And levels of infection are far below their peak. But patterns across Europe show the possibilities for the virus to increase. Reality Check Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health
Organizationâs (WHO) regional director for Europe, was on the BBCâs Today
programme this morning talking about some of the recent spikes in coronavirus
cases. âWhat's a bit different now, although still
without final scientific evidence, is that we are receiving reports from civil
and health authorities of a higher proportion of new infections among young
people,â he said. We asked the WHO for more details. It said it
didnât want to single out countries but pointed to these examples. In Sweden,,externalwhere there was a sharp increase in cases for those under the age of 49 in mid-June. Since then those cases have
declined, but the 20 to 29 age group currently has more cases per 100,000
people than any other age group in the country. In Ireland,,externalas of 28 July, nearly 60% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases have occurred in people under 45. In Israel,external, the recent increase in
cases has been linked to outbreaks in schools. In the latest figures, about a
fifth of cases occurred in people aged 10 to 19 and a fifth in the 20 to 29 group. Helen BriggsBBC Environment correspondent Bats may harbour viruses, but should not be persecuted, say experts Coronaviruses capable of infecting humans may have been circulating undetected in bats for decades. Research suggests one of the closest known ancestors of the virus that causes Covid-19 emerged in bats between 40 and 70 years ago. It has been poised for human crossover for some time, the scientists said. And this casts further doubt on conspiracy theories that the virus causing Covid-19 was bioengineered or escaped from a laboratory, they added. Prof David Robertson, of the University of Glasgow, worked on the study, published in the journal Nature Microbiology. You can read more here. Among those who will now have to quarantine for 14 days after returning from Spain is Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. He spoke to reporters on his return home to the UK today and said that the blanket rule on Spain had been the right thing to do - but that he understood the frustration some might be feeling. ""I very much understand. It obviously had an impact on me and
my family and I am very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who were
either away, or perhaps havenât even managed to go away this summer, as well to
Spain,"" he said. ""But it is absolutely essential we acted when we did and that is why all
four nations of the UK acted together and the figures have turned out to
justify that action."" Mr Shapps said he could not discount quarantines being introduced on arrivals from other countries, adding that the Spanish islands had been included because Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty was very concerned by the figures. US Attorney General William Barr will be tested for coronavirus after he came into close contact with a member of Congress who later tested positive. Barr met the Texan Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert when he was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. It's believed that Gohmert subsequently tested positive for the virus ahead of a flight back to Texas with President Donald Trump. As we reported earlier, the US has seen another sharp rise in the number of coronavirus deaths. Florida suffered a record number of fatalities for a second successive day and the US reported what's believed to be the fastest increase in deaths since the start of June. The rise in infections has forced states to reverse reopening their economies and easing restrictions. Aviation giant Boeing will stop making its classic 747 plane and is eyeing steeper job cuts than previously announced. The firm said it isplanning slow the production of many of its jets after disclosing a $2.4bn (Â£1.8bn) loss as the virus reduced demand for air travel. This month British Airways became the latest to say it was retiring all of its 747 jets - about 10% of its fleet - citing the fall in passenger demand. Australian airline Qantas has also retired the jet, which marked its 50th anniversary last year. ""The reality is the pandemic's impact on the aviation sector continues to be severe,"" said Boeing boss Dave Calhoun. India's healthcare system has struggled to cope with rising cases Let's take a look at India now. The government has further relaxed its coronavirus restrictions, despite a sharp increase in the number of cases over the past month. A night-time curfew has been lifted and gyms will be allowed to open from next week. But schools, colleges and cinema halls will remain closed until the end of August and restrictions will remain in force in designated containment zones. India has registered more than 1.5m confirmed infections, the third highest tally in the world after the US and Brazil. More than 34,500 people have died in the country due to the virus so far. Police and council staff will patrol the gates at a Glasgow park on Friday to prevent anyone entering with alcohol, in anticipation of high temperatures. It comes after police were forced to disperse crowds at Kelvingrove Park during lockdown following antisocial behaviour. Glasgow City Council said the decision had been made in anticipation of high temperatures forecast for Friday. It said it expected the weather to draw large crowds to the area. A possible coronavirus ""cluster"" in Glasgow is being investigated. The scaled-down Muslim Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia has meant a drastic drop in income for many who provide services for the pilgims. More than two million people from all over the world normally take part but because of coronavirus restictions, only about 1,000 Saudi residents will perform this year's five-day ritual.

Breaking|Breaking newsPharmacy linked to new Covid-19 clusterA site in Inverclyde is one of a number of businesses being investigated after a series of positive tests.Scotland,"A pharmacy in Inverclyde is among a number of businesses which have been linked to a new coronavirus cluster. Eight positive tests in Port Glasgow are among 14 new cases reported in the Greater Glasgow health board area. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said none of the cases were experiencing anything more than mild symptoms. It added: ""Close contacts are being advised to self-isolate and other identified contacts are being followed up and given appropriate advice."" Greenock and Inverclyde MSP Stuart McMillian tweeted to say he would not speculate ""where or who is involved"". But he said: ""News has broken that there has been a cluster of Covid-19 cases in Port Glasgow. ""I have spoken to the Scottish government and the health board, and their Track and Trace Investigation Team are working on this as we speak. ""I will share information to help the community when I get it."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that an incident management team was meeting to discuss the development. The cases were among 22 reported across Scotland in the last 24 hours. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland Ms Sturgeon has previously said localised outbreaks of the virus are all but inevitable, following clusters in North Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway. However, the first minister said the ""test and protect"" system was working well, with the number of people being treated in hospital for Covid-19 remaining low. Ms Sturgeon said:  ""Part of the challenge we have around any potential cluster is to make sure everything possible that can be done to minimise onward transmission is done."" Nicola Sturgeon has previously said localised outbreaks of the virus are ""all but inevitable"" The first minister said people should be assured that ""any suggestion of any links between cases or possible clusters or outbreaks are absolutely rigorously explored, investigated and dealt with"". News of the cluster came as the National Records of Scotland said the number of deaths linked to coronavirus had increased very slightly, with Covid-19 mentioned on eight death certificates in the week to Sunday. This was an increase of two deaths from the six that were recorded the previous week. Ms Sturgeon said numbers were likely to fluctuate at such a low level, pointing out that the overall number of deaths in Scotland was below the five-year average. However she said her government was likely to ""adopt a very cautious approach"" at the next review of lockdown restrictions on Thursday. She said ""very significant changes"" had been made in recent weeks, with the hospitality and tourism industries reopening, and said it was ""still too early to be completely assured"" of the impact of this. Ms Sturgeon said it was important not to ""do too much too quickly and give the virus the chance to overwhelm us again"". The first minister is expected to give further details of when and how Scotland's schools will re-open on Thursday.

Will vaccine sceptics make trials a headache?,"It will soon be critical for the NHS to start vaccinating people against flu, to prevent hospitals being swamped with flu and Covid-19 patients this winter. Large-scale trials of Covid-19 vaccines, already under way in some places, are likely to start in Bradford in the autumn. It's therefore worrying, says Dr John Wright of the city's Royal Infirmary, that anti-vax conspiracy theories seem to have flourished in this pandemic. The numbers of hospital patients continue to slowly decline, almost down to single figures this week. There is great relief in the hospital, tempered by the inevitability of a further spike of infection. We know of the warning from Game of Thrones - winter is coming - and never before has that phrase been so ominous. The prediction of a second wave of Covid-19 in January, with the added layer of an influenza epidemic, is our worst fear. So we will be working hard to make sure we vaccinate as many people for flu as we can in the autumn. The race for an effective Covid-19 vaccine continues at pace. Over 130 candidate vaccines have now been developed and more than 30 are in clinical trials, with some showing promising early signs. At the Bradford Institute of Health Research we are one of just five national centres for patient recruitment to clinical trials, and have lots of expertise with testing new drugs. However vaccine trials are a completely different ball game. Rather than trialling new drugs on a small number of patients with specific diseases we will be testing new vaccines on hundreds and thousands of healthy volunteers. We have been exploring how we could use sports centres or community halls to recruit these volunteers, and how we can scale up our research teams to cope with the numbers. We have been preparing for two different vaccine trials, only for the companies to pull them from the UK at the last minute and move them to the Americas. The pandemic fires have been dampened in Europe, but in the US and Latin America they continue to rage, and if you are going to test a new vaccine you need countries where the virus is still accelerating. But despite these two false starts, there will be further trials of other candidate vaccines. It's therefore important to win the support of the public so that they sign up to these new trials, and to do that we need to counter some of the growing false news stories we are hearing on our community grapevines, which are leading people to believe that the vaccines are harmful. Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Listen to the next episode of The NHS Front Lineon BBC Soundsorthe BBC World Service Or read the previous online diary entry:So, did the Bradford choir have Covid in January? Check out all the diary entries on the BBC Radio 4 website I wrote before about theabusive messages sent to one of our consultants, Fozia Hayat, who was accused of having blood on her hands when she tried to rebut the idea that hospitals leave patients from ethnic minorities to die. A conspiracy theory circulating in Bradford, which says that Bill Gates is using vaccines to implant microchips in patients, was aired on the news in Pakistan, she has learned. It appears these ideas are spreading nationally and internationally on social media. Listen to Fozia Hayat investigating Covid fake news in My Name is Foziaon BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 on Monday 27 July Fozia Hayat I have also written about Mohammed Azeem, a young man who delayed coming to hospital until he was at death's door because he believed the myth that ethnic minority patients never leave the wards alive (though thankfully he did, after 48 days in intensive care). Here are some more examples of the problems we are up against. In Bradford we recruited 12,500 pregnant women into a cohort study between 2007 and 2010, and have been monitoring the health of their children ever since. We have started to offer some of them antibody testing, and have been picking up on ideas such as, ""You're putting a microchip in us,"" or ""This is all a plot."" This is clearly something we need to understand and deal with ahead of the vaccine trials. A healthcare assistant in the hospital, who doesn't want to be named, has seen Covid patients on the ward - but she still believes many of the conspiracy theories online. She doesn't watch any mainstream media reports. ""I follow people who I believe know what they are talking about... I don't need to check them out, I get a gut feeling - I think more than anything that there's a big lie in the world. At the moment everything seems to be a big lie. Nobody knows what's true and what's not."" Giselle Rwegema, a TB nurse at St Luke's Hospital in Bradford, does volunteer work with East African refugees and says many believe that the vaccine is ""a way of getting rid of black people"". A video that claimed the vaccine would be trialled on very poor people in Africa was shared by millions, she says. Giselle Rwegema is able to get through to some vaccine sceptics, but not all ""What they're saying is that people go to hospital, and they don't come back. I work in healthcare and I know it's not true, it's just trying to convey that to people. Some understand it, but there are still others that are still not getting it."" A young mother in Giselle's group, Corrine, is adamant that she won't take a vaccine even if it has been declared safe and effective: ""No, definitely not. Because obviously, me being black and everything that we know about the work that's going on to just take a black number down - that's been going on for years and I wouldn't take it just based on that, because there are so many things that will be hidden in the vaccine."" Accident and Emergency ward sister Emma Clinton describes an Asian man in his early 60s who was afraid to come into hospital, and was already dying by the time his family called an ambulance. ""He died in the department within about an hour. And then of course the family were absolutely distraught. The son was saying, 'What lethal injection did you give him? How has he died? Have you killed him?'"" As A&E consultant David Greenhorn says, once that question has been asked, it's impossible to turn the situation around. ""If they must mistrust you enough to ask you that question directly, then the trust has already gone and you don't have the time to spend to develop it. You could never rebuild things, there's no way of building that bridge."" Anti-vaxers protesting in South Africa Previously I thought that everybody would want a vaccine if we can show that it works, but now I fear I underestimated how suspicious people are. I'm not sure what we can do about it, but part of it is about trying to understand the reasons for these views. Rather than just shouting from the hospital, ""It's OK, everything's fine,"" we need to understand where these rumours and false news stories are coming from, then we must work out how to counteract them. And I think that's a long-term journey. One plan we've had is to get some of our Covid patients, who have already had good experiences in hospital, to be ambassadors - patients from the communities that are most suspicious. That work has already begun in pre-publicity for the vaccine trials.

Madonna post flagged over conspiracy video,"Madonna claims to have been exposed to Covid-19 on her Madame X tour earlier this year Pop star Madonna has been censured by Instagram after sharing a video about a coronavirus conspiracy theory to her 15 million followers. In her post, the singer claimed a vaccine for Covid-19 had already been found, but was being hidden to ""let the rich get richer"". Instagram blurred out the video with a caption saying: ""False Information"". It also directed users to a page debunking the claims in the video, noting there is no coronavirus vaccine. The video was later deleted from Madonna's Instagram page, but not before fans protested at her decision to share the post. Among them was pop star Annie Lennox, who commented: ""This is utter madness!!! I can't believe that you are endorsing this dangerous quackery. ""Hopefully your site has been hacked and you're just about to explain it,"" she added. The star previously called coronavirus ""the great equaliser"" in a video posted from her bath The video in question showed a group called America's Frontline Doctors speaking outside the US Supreme Court building at an event organised by Tea Party Patriots Action.

This is not the first time Madonna has made controversial claims about coronavirus. In March, she posted a video from her bath, describing the virus as ""the great equaliser"". Two months later, she revealed she had tested positive for antibodies, supposedly granting her immunity from the disease.

The Killers to investigate tour misconduct claims,"The US rock band are known for hits like Mr Brightside and Somebody Told Me The Killers have said they are taking allegations of sexual misconduct on one of their tours ""extremely seriously"". It comes after a female sound engineer shared an account of a woman being abused backstage during a 2009 US tour. In an article published online, she alleged members of the stage crew took turns to engage in sexual activity with a woman in a dressing room. A representative for The Killers said the band would conduct an investigation of past and present tour staff. Some readers may find the following information distressing. If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story,these organisations may be able to help. A woman, who is named on her Twitter account as Chez Cherrie, posted a blog recalling her time working for a band during a tour in 2009. She says she was a sound engineer for the group, and the only woman working as part of the crew. Recalling a specific incident in Milwaukee, she said: ""We were about half way through our load-in when the FOH [front of house] engineer came over radio and said, 'Hey guys, there is a girl set up in Dressing Room A. Put your name on the list outside the door with your radio channel and we'll call you when it's your turn.' ""I continued my load out, occasionally hearing a name come over the radio to notify them that it was their turn on the train in Dressing Room A."" Cherrie said that later, on the bus, members of the crew would ""swap stories"" about their time with the woman. As they were departing, she says a security guard ran towards the bus. ""The security guy said, and I will never forget this moment because a piece of me died that night, 'That girl in Dressing Room A is passed out and naked. Is anyone going to take care of her?'"" She says the men on the bus laughed and declined, before leaving the venue. ""I cried that night in my bunk,"" she said. ""I should've left the tour. I should've spoken up for that woman. I should've defended her... and made sure she was okay."" Cherrie did not name the band in the article, which was published in 2018, but identified them as The Killers while re-posting the article on Twitter on Tuesday evening. None of the band members were implicated in the assault. She added that she was working for the ""largest sound company in the world"" at the time - but did not name them. A legal representative for The Killers told BBC News: ""First and foremost, any allegations of inappropriate behaviour by anyone on The Killers touring team are taken extremely seriously by the band and their management. ""This person's story is appalling and, while The Killers do not have the same touring crew in 2020 that they had earlier in their career, they will be conducting a thorough investigation into past and present tour staff. ""Their legal team will be reaching out to this person for more information and clarity on the alleged incidents as detailed, as well as to the audio vendor who provided crew for the tour. ""The band are astonished and shocked by these claims. The behaviour attributed to them and their crew is unrecognisable and in direct opposition to the principles with which they run their workplace."" The Killers are one of the biggest rock bands in the world, best known for hits such as Mr Brightside, Somebody Told Me, Human and When You Were Young.

"Travel bosses demand end to blanket quarantineRegional travel corridors would allow quarantine-free visits to some areas of Spain, they tell the PM.BusinessComments","This video can not be played Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye: ""More work needs to be done, we need to test and learn"" Leading travel and airline industry figures have urged the prime minister to replace blanket quarantine measures with regional travel corridors. In a letter to Boris Johnson, they said the 14-day quarantine for people coming from Spain had caused disruption. It was ""the latest significant blow to a sector which now risks being permanently scarred"", they added. They called for quarantine-free travel to areas unaffected by any spike in coronavirus cases. This would include not just Spain, but other key markets for trade and tourism, such as the US and Canada. ""We are in a situation where the government is advising against travel to areas of Spain that have lower rates of Covid than the UK,"" the letter said. ""We urgently request a meeting with you to discuss the challenge facing our sector and our proposed ways forward,"" the letter concluded. Among the nearly 50 signatories of the letter were British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz, Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye and Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade. Travel industry chiefs are seeking ways to rescue the holiday season. Their intervention came after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC that coronavirus testing at airports was not a ""silver bullet"" to stop the need for quarantine, because the virus could develop over time. The government's sudden change to travel advice for Spain at the weekend prompted a fresh wave of confusion and uncertainty to people's holiday plans. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps returned home early from his own Spanish holiday on Wednesday and will now begin two weeks' quarantine, buthe defended the government's decision. ""We had to act when we did. The figures since have shown why that was required. I'm desperately sad and sorry for people who have lost their holidays,"" he said. Travel firm Tui said on Wednesday it had cancelled holidays to the Balearics and Canary Islands until 4 August after the UK extended its advice against non-essential travel to Spain to include its islands. Coronavirus: Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? Mr Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme the confusion caused by the changes to guidance over Spain showed the need for an alternative. He said airports should be allowed to test for coronavirus to avoid the ""cliff-edge"" of quarantine. Heathrow's financial results, out on Wednesday, showed passengers all but stopped travel in the three months to June, falling by 96% on a year ago as global aviation came to a virtual standstill. Revenue was 85% lower than last year at Â£119m. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""Today's results should serve as a clarion call for the government - the UK needs a passenger testing regime and fast. Without it, Britain is just playing a game of quarantine roulette."" He said he wanted the government to work with the company on the plan and he could have testing sites set and ready ""within weeks"". But Mr Dowden quashed the idea, saying: ""We are not at the point where there is a viable alternative to the 14-day quarantine."" However, he added that all options were under review. Coronavirus testing is available at some German airports Other countries are operating airport testing. It is voluntary - and free - at some German airports now although it may become mandatory, as it is in France for arrivals from high-risk countries such as the US and Brazil. The Netherlands approach is to single out people coming from specific areas with high levels of infections - such as a few named regions in Spain and the UK city of Leicester and urge them to self-isolate. Dr Hans Kluge, Europe regional director for the World Health Organization, endorsed testing at airports as part of general attempts to track the movement of coronavirus. He told the Today programme: ""Testing is never wrong - whether at airports, community or drive-in centres - what's the difference between day-to-day life and travelling?"" Mr Holland-Kaye said a UK airport test would cost about Â£150 each, and passengers would be expected to pay. He acknowledged that was ""not cheap"", but that the test would come down over time as more people took it. The idea of introducing testing at airports is an attractive idea. The theory being people could travel where they like and just get tested as they arrive back in the country, negating the need to self-isolate. But the government is not convinced. Why? Logistically testing all the travellers who arrive every week will be difficult. Testing capacity has increased but this would stretch the system. Not to mention the practical difficulties of setting up testing facilities in busy airports. But the other factor, which is perhaps more crucial, is that in the early stages of infection the test may not even pick it up. Instead, officials are much more persuaded by a more intelligent, targeted approach to self-isolation. That would involve asking only those coming from certain regions in a country where the infection rates are highest to self-isolate. That could then be complemented by then asking them to get tested after a week, meaning if they test negative, there would be no need for the full 14-day self-isolation. All this and more is being discussed behind the scenes. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""The aim would be to have a test on arrival. We could have it up and running in the next two weeks."" He said the plan would be for passengers to go into quarantine and have another test after eight days: ""If they were infected we would be confident that it had shown itself.  If it was clear, they would be allowed to go out of quarantine earlier than had been the case. It's very scientifically based."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? The government is said to be considering an eight-day stretch between tests. The number of days required between each test is critical in reducing the possibility of ""false negative"" results from people not yet showing symptoms. Under current rules, those arriving in the UK from certain countries must self-isolate for 14 days.

Boeing to cease 747 production as losses hit $2.4bn,"Boeing has said it will stop making its classic 747 plane and is eyeing steeper job cuts than those it has previously announced. The firm is also planning to slow production of many of its jets, including the troubled 737 Max. The changes come as the firm disclosed a $2.4bn (Â£1.8bn) loss as the virus depressed demand for air travel. ""The reality is the pandemic's impact on the aviation sector continues to be severe,"" said Boeing boss Dave Calhoun. Airlines around the world have responded to the coronavirus pandemic by reducing their fleets and delaying or cancelling aircraft orders. This month British Airways became the latest to say it was retiring all of its 747 jets - about 10% of its fleet - citing the fall in passenger demand. Australian airline Qantas has also retired the jet, which marked its 50th anniversary last year. BA retires entire 747 fleet after travel downturn Boeing job cuts start to hit nearly 13,000 workers Boeing said the slowdown may mean deeper job cuts on top of roughly 16,000 layoffs - around 10% of its workforce - it has already planned. ""Our government services, defence and space programs provide some critical stability for us in the near-term as we take tough but necessary steps to adapt for new market realities,"" Mr Calhoun said. ""We are taking the right action to ensure we're well positioned for the future."" The pandemic has exacerbated the crisis facing Boeing, which was already in trouble following two fatal crashes of its 737 Max plane which killed 346 people. The jet has been grounded since last March, costing the company some $20bn. The scandal led to the departure of top executives and a string of ongoing investigations. Boeing said it has re-started production of the 737, but it expects the rate of manufacturing to remain low for the foreseeable future as the virus weighs on the industry. It said it hoped to be making 31 per month by the beginning of 2022 - instead of during 2021 as planned.  That would be roughly half the rate of the firm's production before the grounding. Qantas retired its Boeing 747 jets last week ""While there have been some encouraging signs, we estimate it will take around three years to return to 2019 passenger levels,"" Boeing said. Boeing said it lost $2.4bn in the three months to 30 June, as sales fell 25% to $11.8bn. Last year, it reported a $2.9bn loss in the same quarter, driven by a charge of more than $5bn related to the grounding of the 737 Max. The sales decline was driven by its commercial unit, which serves passenger airlines. Revenue dropped 65% as the firm delivered just 20 planes in the quarter, compared to 90 a year ago. Sales in the firm's defence, space and security unit were essentially flat at $6.5bn.

Job ad seeks new spokesperson for PM,"Boris Johnson has begun the search for a spokesperson to front daily White House-style media briefings. The job, advertised on the Conservative LinkedIn page, is described as a chance to ""communicate with the nation on behalf of the prime minister"". ""Essential skills"" include ""excellent risk management and crisis communication skills"". The salary is ""based on experience"",but the Daily Telegraph suggests,externalit is likely to be more than Â£100,000-a-year. The successful applicant is likely to be an experienced broadcaster - and the subject of intense media scrutiny. PM plans daily White House-style press briefings In the US, presidential spokesman such as Sean Spicer and Anthony Scaramucci became household names and sometimes found themselvesat the centre of controversy. Donald Trump's first presidential spokesman Sean Spicer was a controversial figure Traditionally, the UK government's twice daily media briefings have been held behind closed doors, with a civil servant taking questions from a group of accredited journalists, known as the lobby. Quotes are attributed to the ""prime minister's official spokesman"". From September, the afternoon lobby briefing will be filmed at 9 Downing Street, while the morning session will continue to be off-camera. The new spokesperson will be employed as a special adviser, a temporary class of civil servant allowed to give political advice to ministers, meaning they will be free to attack the opposition parties, as well as setting out the government's position. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmerhas warned,externalthat the plan could risk ""unbalancing the political discourse"" and is ""obviously a political move"". He said Labour was considering ways to get a right of reply to the briefings. The prime minister has defended the plan, saying it will build on the experience of the daily coronavirus press conference which gave people ""more direct, detailed information from the government"". The job description tells potential applicants: ""You will represent the government and the prime minister to an audience of millions on a daily basis, across the main broadcast channels and social media, and have the chance to influence and shape public opinion. ""You will speak directly to the public on the issues they care most about, explaining the government's position, reassuring people that we are taking action on their priorities and driving positive changes."" The successful applicant would need to be ""an experienced and confident media operator who would enjoy working on camera and with senior ministers, political advisers, officials and journalists; who would relish the challenge and pace of televised briefings, and who has a strong grasp of foreign and domestic policy issues"". Applicants are asked to email a CV and a ""statement of suitability of no more than 500 words"" to Downing Street by 21 August. The successful candidate ""must also be willing to undergo security clearance"".

You can read a summary of the hearing here. And on Friday,our Tech Tent podcastwill further explore how the four chief executives fared. The committee's chair Congressman Cicilline has ended the hearing with one last shot across the bows of the tech leaders. ""Today we had the opportunity to hear from the decision-makers from the most powerful companies in the world,"" he said. ""This hearing has made one fact clear to me: These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable. And he added: ""We must make our choice. We may have democracy or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few. We can't have both."" So, today's skirmish is over. But how willing the politicians are to enforce regulations capable of reining in the tech giants, and what the tech giants might do to resist, remain open questions. Over recent weeks, Facebook has seen an exodus of big-name advertisers, which have voiced protest over its handling of hate speech and disinformation. Shortly after the walkout began, comments Zuckerberg made to an internal meeting were leaked, revealing he had said theadvertisers would be back soon enough. Congresswoman Jayapal asked if Facebook was now so big that it wasn't worried how it was impacted by a major boycott of 1,100 advertisers. ""No congresswoman. Of course we care,"" he responded. ""But we're also not going to set our content policies because of advertisers. I think that that would be the wrong thing for us to do. ""We've cared about issues like fighting hate speech for a long time, and we have invested billions of dollars [in content moderators and AI systems]... I do believe that they are industry leading."" There have only been a few instances when the politicians have taken advantage of the fact that all four CEOs are present to bounce a question between them. But Congressman Jordan has just used the opportunity to question their commitment to the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech. Here's their responses - Cook: ""I think it's good for people to hear different points of view and decide for themselves."" PichaI: ""We take pride in the fact that across our platforms, including YouTube, there are more diverse voices than ever before."" Zuckerberg: ""I believe strongly in free expression. Giving people a voice is an important part of what our services do. And I'm very worried about some of the forces of illiberalism that I see in this country."" Bezos: ""I am concerned in general about that, and what I find a little discouraging is that it appears to me that social media is a nuance-destruction machine. And I don't think that's helpful for a democracy."" Democratic Rep David Cicilline has been grilling Mark Zuckerberg over the firm's response to the coronavirus. ""What are you doing right now to protect people from demonstrably false claims related to this deadly pandemic?"" he asks. He says misinformation is often the most-shared content on the platform. ""The more engagement there is, the more money you make from advertising,"" he says - and goes on to list some examples. He accuses Facebook of being so big that it can't effectively police ""deadly content"". Zuckerberg says such content is not good for its business model and it removes offending posts. ""I think we have relatively good record in taking down misleading content,"" he responds. But Cicilline goes on: ""This is the tip of the iceberg. It's not just about Covid. Facebook gets away with it because there is no competitor. Itâs the only game in town."" The four bosses are asked a yes-or-no question by Republican Greg Steube: Do you believe the Chinese government is stealing technology from US
companies? Tim Cook. ""I donât know of specific cases where we have been
stolen from by the government. I know of no case on ours where it occurred."" Sunder Pichai: ""I have no first-hand knowledge of any information
stolen from Google in this regard."" Mark Zuckerberg: ""I think itâs well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from US companies."" Jeff Bezos: ""I havenât seen that personally but Iâve heard many
reports of it."" Democratic Congresswoman Mary Scanlon has been asking Sunder
Pichai about YouTubeâs policies on content for children. She asks Mr Pichai if
Google has been collecting data on the children who use YouTube. Mr Pichai responds that this is an area the firm takes very
seriously. He says under-13s are not allowed to set up their own accounts, and the firm had invested in a special version of its video clip service, YouTube Kids. Ms Scanlon then asks if YouTube is investing in âluring inâ
advertisers by telling them that YouTube is regularly visited by children. âAre you targeting children and then targeting advertisers
to bring them on board?â Mr Pichai responds by saying everything the firm does
complies with regulations. Finally Ms Scanlon asks if content creators are able to
choose which advertisements appear next to their content. âIf Sesame Street doesnât want to show junk food ads on YouTube,
does Google allow them to make that choice?â Mr Pichai says users have a choice â they can use it as a
subscription service without seeing such advertisements or they can use it for
free with ads. He says he is not aware of a report in the Wall St Journal alleging that YouTube is making it difficult for independent auditors to report back to companies on what advertisements are shown alongside their content, but will get back to her about it. Matt Gaetz questioned whether Mark Zuckerberg was being truthful Having earlier questioned Google about bias, the Republican Matt Gaetz has now chased Zuckerberg over the issue. The politician claimed that Facebook's culture ""disadvantages conservatives"" and that its employees had been caught out on video revealing their prejudices. ""I certainly do not want our platforms to be run in a way that has any ideological bias,"" Zuckerberg replied. Facebook's chief declined to get into the specifics of the hidden-camera clips being referenced, but said: ""People make mistakes... it's our job in running the company to make sure that we minimise errors."" Mr Gaetz then switched tack asking why Zuckeberg had fired Palmer Luckey. The co-founder of the Oculus virtual reality division Facebook acquired in 2014 was ousted two years later after it emerged he had donated money to an anti-Hillary Clinton group during the presidential election. ""I'm not sure it's appropriate to get into a specific personnel issue publicly,"" Zuckerberg responded. Mr Gaetz wasn't satisfied with this. ""I've seen the messages where you have specifically directed Mr Luckey to make statements regarding his politics for the benefit of your company,"" he said. ""So I think both in the case of these content moderators and in the case of the testimony you just gave regarding Mr Luckey... there is serious question as to whether or not you're giving truthful testimony here."" These days Mr Luckey runs a surveillance start-up that is helping patrol the US-Mexico border. The US markets are now closed. So how do investors think the tech CEOs are doing? Obviously, it's a bit simplistic to link stock prices to their performance - but if the politicians had landed a deadly blow, you might have expected at least one of the companies' shares to have suffered. But at the close of trade: Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Four of the worldâs top technology
company executives may have been testifying before the Judiciary Committee from
a distance, but they were still caught in the middle of a political storm on
Wednesday afternoon. The stated purpose of the hearing was to
address whether existing anti-trust laws provide sufficient regulation of
transnational tech Goliaths. The reality, however, was that the proceedings - with each member of the committee receiving five minutes to speak - were more
akin to a feeding frenzy, as corporate chiefs faced criticism from every
direction Democrats
expressed concern that the companies were abusing their power by disadvantaging
competitors or buying them out entirely. Republicans accused the witnesses of
insufficient patriotism and being too cosy with the Chinese. Both sides
expressed outrage over how the companies managed speech and expression on their
platforms. They didnât go far enough in removing hateful rhetoric and false
information, Democrats said. They singled out conservatives for censorship, the
Republicans countered. Through
it all, the witnesses thanked the questioners and took their lumps, perhaps
confident that they could soon log off and get back to their work. While all
the politicians seemed to agree that the big tech companies were a problem,
their chances of arriving at any kind of solution seems unlikely. While we are in another break, a reminder of who the tech chief executives are giving testimony to the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee: -Mark Zuckerberglaunched Facebook while a student at Harvard. It is the biggest social media network in the world. He is the youngest of the four men, aged 36, and has masterminded a series of key takeovers, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus. -Sundar Pichai, the former chief of Google's Chrome browser, climbed the ranks to take charge of parent company Alphabet at the end of 2019. He was born in India and is now one of the best compensated chief executives in the US - company filings revealed he earned $281m (Â£213m) last year. -Jeff Bezosfounded Amazon as an online bookstore in his garage and built it into a giant spanning e-commerce, streaming and cloud computing. He's the world's richest man and had never appeared before Congress until now. He regularly sells part of his stock in Amazon to fund another venture, the space transport company Blue Origin. -Tim Cookjoined Apple in 1998, and served as co-founder Steve Jobs' chief financial officer before taking the top job in 2011. Under his leadership, Apple has made digital privacy one of its core values, and sought to become less reliant on hardware sales by expanding across a range of digital services.   Jeff Bezos has been questioned about why Amazon doesn't do more to remove fake goods sold via its online marketplace. ""Counterfeits are a scourge,"" said Mr Bezos. ""It's bad for customers. It's bad for honest third-party sellers."" But the Democratic member Henry Johnson said the panel had heard evidence from one seller that Amazon had only agreed to stop diverting sales to knock-off rivals once the vendor had committed to a $2m advertising spend. ""That's unacceptable,"" responded Mr Bezos. ""If someone, somewhere inside Amazon said 'you know, buy X dollars in ads and then we'll help you with your counterfeit problem', that is unacceptable. ""And I will look into that and we'll get back to your office with that."" Facebookâs Mark Zuckerberg has once again been pressed on whether his
company stifled competitors by copying their features or forced them into a sale. He said he saw it as part of Facebook's job to work out
what people found valuable in tech. âWeâve certainly adapted features that others have led in,
as have others copied and adapted features that we have led in,"" he explained. But Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal didn't give up the theme, asking: ""Has Facebook ever threatened to clone the products of another company while also attempting to acquire that company?"" ""Not that I recall,"" said Zuckerberg. The politician pressed on, asking what he then made of reports that he had threatened to go into ""destroy mode"" when trying to convince Kevin Systrom to sell Instagram. ""I want to respectfully disagree with the characterisation,"" said Zuckerberg. ""It was clear that this was a space that we were going to compete in one way or another. I don't view those conversations as a threat in any way."" In any case, Mr Zuckerberg clinched the deal, and Mr Systrom has since quit. The committee chair David Cicilline has pressed Jeff Bezos over claims that his company has an inherent conflict of interest with sellers who use its marketplace. He said one clothing company had likened receiving a cheque from the online store to getting a fix of ""Amazon heroin"" - the idea being that it felt good in the short-term to be paid, but ultimately Amazon would cause the seller's downfall by launching rival products of its own. ""Mr Bezos, this is one of your partners. Why on earth would they compare your company to a drug dealer?"" the congressman asked. âI completely disagree with that characterisation,â replied Mr Bezos. âI think it's important to understand that we have a policy against using individual seller data to compete with our private-label products.â Mr Cicilline made clear he was unconvinced. ""Amazon is only interested in exploiting its monopoly power over the e-commerce marketplace,"" he concluded. ""Amazon's dual role as a platform operator and competing seller on that platform is fundamentally anti-competitive and Congress must take action."" Amazon's Jeff Bezos is presented with a complaint from a family bookseller, who says their business evaporated after being de-listed from his online store. âI would like to talk to her. It does not at all to me seem
the right way to treat her. And Iâm surprised by that. Itâs not the systematic
approach that we take,"" Mr Bezos said, rejecting accusations his company was ""bullying"" small suppliers. Republican Jim Jordan Republican congressman Jim Jordan returned to the theme that tech companies are biased against his party, suggesting Google might tailor its features to aid Joe Biden's presidential campaign. ""We won't do any work to politically tilt things one way or another. It's against our core values,"" responded Mr Pichai. But Mr Jordan went on to bring up a 2016 email, in which he said a Google executive had talked about the ""silent donation"" Google had made to Hillary Clinton's campaign. ""We didn't find any evidence of such activity,"" Mr Pichai replied. Mr Jordan continued, saying the email had referred to Google urging people to vote ""in key states"". He suggested this was a reference to the swing states of Nevada and Florida, meaning there had been a deliberate effort to prevent Donald Trump from winning. ""I can assure you we were compliant with the laws in 2016,"" said Mr Pichai, adding that Google would obey the law this year as well. ""Can you assure us you are not going to silence conservatives and... you're not going to configure your features [to favour] Joe Biden?"" Mr Jordan said again. ""You have my commitment. It's always been true and we'll continue to conduct yourselves in a neutral way,"" was the reply. It seemed to be a relatively calm end to the session until the next politician, the Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon, suggested Mr Jordan had been pushing ""fringe conspiracy theories"". At which point, Mr Jordan reacted with fury, saying: ""We have the email - there was no fringe conspiracies.""  In a testy exchange, the Democratic member Val Butler Demings asked Sundar Pichai whether it was true that ""the more user data that Google collects, the more money Google can make"". ""That's not true,"" he replied. ""Most of the data today we collect is to help users and provide personalised experiences."" But before he could flesh out this response - or be challenged over it - the session ended to make way for the next set of questions. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and chair of
the antitrust subcommittee A gentle reminder from the committee chair to the tech bosses that time is short, with each committee member just getting five minutes each. All four have often begun their answers by thanking the committee for the question. ""We appreciate the gratitude for the questions, and your description of them as good questions, but we'll just assume that they are good questions and that you are happy to answer them."" Amazon's Jeff Bezos has finally been asked a question, so it looks like his feed is working - though the picture is a bit fuzzy. Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal asked him for a ""yes or no"" answer to whether his firm had ever used seller data to make business decisions. This was a reference to reports that Amazon had used data gathered from businesses selling products via its site to design and price its own rival first-party goods - something the firm has previously suggested had been limited to a group of rogue employees. Mr Bezos responded that he couldn't give in answer in such simple terms. ""What I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated,"" he said. Ms Jayapal said she remained concerned that Amazon was continuously monitoring its logs to prevent any other business from becoming big enough that it would pose a competitive risk.  The hearing is back in business and with questions for Alphabet's Sundar Pichai on General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). Republican Kelly Armstrong makes the case that the privacy law has helped entrench Google's market-leading position rather than weaken it. Mr Pichai responded: ""We see robust competition in the marketplace [and] we have to comply with regulation."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Wiley permanently banned by TwitterTwitter was accused of inaction and delay over anti-Semitic remarks posted by the music star.,"Grime artist Wiley has apologised for ""generalising"" about Jewish people after being banned from social media. In an interview with Sky News, the artist insisted: ""I'm not racist."" ""My comments should not have been directed to all Jews or Jewish people. I want to apologise for generalising, and I want to apologise for comments that were looked at as anti-Semitic."" Twitter had earlier banned his account permanently after a public backlash over a perceived lack of action. ""We are sorry we did not move faster,"" Twitter said in a statement. Sky News reported that the offensive tweets were sparked by a falling-out between the rapper and his former manager, who is Jewish. The pair cut ties in recent days. ""I just want to apologise for generalising and going outside of the people who I was talking to within the workspace and workplace I work in,"" Wiley said. ""I'm not racist, you know. I'm a businessman. My thing should have stayed between me and my manager, I get that."" However, the artist appeared in the interview to refuse to distance himself from most of the anti-Semitic comments he posted on social media. Wiley's series of anti-Semitic tweets appeared on Friday night. One tweet read: ""I don't care about Hitler, I care about black people"", and compared the Jewish community to the Ku Klux Klan. This video can not be played Rapper Wiley's Twitter account has been suspended after anti-Semitic posts Twitter did not immediately respond, prompting a public outcry anda 48-hour boycott of Twitter by many usersover what they said had been an unacceptable delay. The social network eventually banned Wiley for violating its ""hateful conduct"" policy - a day after Facebook and Instagram had deleted the music star's accounts for ""repeated violations"" of their rules. Twitter said it had decided to make an earlier temporary ban permanent, and wipe all his past posts from its platform, ""upon further consideration"". ""We deeply respect the concerns shared by the Jewish community and online safety advocates,"" the statement said, promising to continue to tackle anti-Semitism. The star, known as the ""godfather of grime"", was awarded an MBE for services to music in 2018.

Just look at Britain's colonialism history,"" he said. When asked what he would like to say to his fans, he responded angrily saying fans were fickle and, at 41, he was no longer ""current"" and was at the end of his career. By Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation and social media reporter The permanent suspension of the rapper's Facebook, Instagram and Twitter profiles has been widely welcomed. However, it is emblematic of a slowness to act on hateful abuse from social media sites. And many are asking why this took so long. Time and time again, decisive action from social media sites over racist abuse, misinformation or hate speech has come only once comments have reached thousands of users. What does it take for Twitter to act decisively on anti-Semitic abuse? Facebook removes Wiley after abuse of Jewish critics VIPs and MPs boycott Twitter after Wiley tweets 'How it feels to be black and Jewish' In this case it appears to be external pressure - the move comes after a boycott by users. And it also seems to be dependent on what the other social media sites choose to do: Facebook moved to suspend Wiley's accounts on Tuesday, and then Twitter appeared to follow suit. With the Stop Hate for Profit campaign ramping up pressure, and increased focus on the way social media sites tackle hate speech and misinformation, the spotlight will intensify on the actions of Twitter, Facebook and Google in these scenarios. The delay in Twitter taking action prompted the 48-hour boycott of Twitter by many users - including celebrities and MPs - beginning on Monday morning. Organisers said the time reflected the ""48 hours of pure race hate"" they accuse Twitter of giving to Wiley. On Tuesday, Facebook issued a ban after Wiley was discovered posting abusive material on his personal page using his real name, Richard Cowie. Twitter followed suit on Wednesday, after what it said was a thorough investigation. Despite the move, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said both Twitter and Facebook had been slow to act, adding ""it is just not good enough"". ""Social media companies have not been strong or fast enough about tackling racism, misogyny or homophobia,"" it said in a statement. The Campaign Against Antisemitism echoed that sentiment, writing that Twitter ""has finally listened"". ""The closure of Wiley's account is too little too late, but it is at least a start for this deeply irresponsible social network,"" it said.

Time and time again, decisive action from social media sites over racist abuse, misinformation or hate speech has come only once comments have reached thousands of users. What does it take for Twitter to act decisively on anti-Semitic abuse? Facebook removes Wiley after abuse of Jewish critics VIPs and MPs boycott Twitter after Wiley tweets 'How it feels to be black and Jewish' In this case it appears to be external pressure - the move comes after a boycott by users. And it also seems to be dependent on what the other social media sites choose to do: Facebook moved to suspend Wiley's accounts on Tuesday, and then Twitter appeared to follow suit. With the Stop Hate for Profit campaign ramping up pressure, and increased focus on the way social media sites tackle hate speech and misinformation, the spotlight will intensify on the actions of Twitter, Facebook and Google in these scenarios. The delay in Twitter taking action prompted the 48-hour boycott of Twitter by many users - including celebrities and MPs - beginning on Monday morning. Organisers said the time reflected the ""48 hours of pure race hate"" they accuse Twitter of giving to Wiley. On Tuesday, Facebook issued a ban after Wiley was discovered posting abusive material on his personal page using his real name, Richard Cowie. Twitter followed suit on Wednesday, after what it said was a thorough investigation. Despite the move, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said both Twitter and Facebook had been slow to act, adding ""it is just not good enough"". ""Social media companies have not been strong or fast enough about tackling racism, misogyny or homophobia,"" it said in a statement. The Campaign Against Antisemitism echoed that sentiment, writing that Twitter ""has finally listened"". ""The closure of Wiley's account is too little too late, but it is at least a start for this deeply irresponsible social network,"" it said.

Boeing to cease 747 production as losses hit $2.4bnThe US planemaker has also warned of job cuts beyond the 10% reduction already announced.Business,"Boeing has said it will stop making its classic 747 plane and is eyeing steeper job cuts than those it has previously announced. The firm is also planning to slow production of many of its jets, including the troubled 737 Max. The changes come as the firm disclosed a $2.4bn (Â£1.8bn) loss as the virus depressed demand for air travel. ""The reality is the pandemic's impact on the aviation sector continues to be severe,"" said Boeing boss Dave Calhoun. Airlines around the world have responded to the coronavirus pandemic by reducing their fleets and delaying or cancelling aircraft orders. This month British Airways became the latest to say it was retiring all of its 747 jets - about 10% of its fleet - citing the fall in passenger demand. Australian airline Qantas has also retired the jet, which marked its 50th anniversary last year. BA retires entire 747 fleet after travel downturn Boeing job cuts start to hit nearly 13,000 workers Boeing said the slowdown may mean deeper job cuts on top of roughly 16,000 layoffs - around 10% of its workforce - it has already planned. ""Our government services, defence and space programs provide some critical stability for us in the near-term as we take tough but necessary steps to adapt for new market realities,"" Mr Calhoun said. ""We are taking the right action to ensure we're well positioned for the future."" The pandemic has exacerbated the crisis facing Boeing, which was already in trouble following two fatal crashes of its 737 Max plane which killed 346 people. The jet has been grounded since last March, costing the company some $20bn. The scandal led to the departure of top executives and a string of ongoing investigations. Boeing said it has re-started production of the 737, but it expects the rate of manufacturing to remain low for the foreseeable future as the virus weighs on the industry. It said it hoped to be making 31 per month by the beginning of 2022 - instead of during 2021 as planned.  That would be roughly half the rate of the firm's production before the grounding. Qantas retired its Boeing 747 jets last week ""While there have been some encouraging signs, we estimate it will take around three years to return to 2019 passenger levels,"" Boeing said. Boeing said it lost $2.4bn in the three months to 30 June, as sales fell 25% to $11.8bn. Last year, it reported a $2.9bn loss in the same quarter, driven by a charge of more than $5bn related to the grounding of the 737 Max. The sales decline was driven by its commercial unit, which serves passenger airlines. Revenue dropped 65% as the firm delivered just 20 planes in the quarter, compared to 90 a year ago. Sales in the firm's defence, space and security unit were essentially flat at $6.5bn.

"Barclays: We want our people back in the officeThe bank's boss, who has said big offices might be outdated, now wants staff back in the workplace.","Barclays boss Jes Staley has signalled that he wants employees working from home during the pandemic to return to the office ""over time"". ""It is important to get people back together in physical concentrations,"" he told Bloomberg TV. He said 60,000 Barclays staff were working ""from their kitchen tables"", but stressed that another 20,000 were in offices, branches and call centres. In April, Mr Staley had saidbig city offices ""may be a thing of the past"". In recent years, banks worldwide have shifted staff away from expensive skyscrapers in financial hubs, but Barclays and its rivals still have busy offices in places such as London's Canary Wharf. In his latest remarks, Mr Staley appeared to cast doubt on the idea of abandoning those hubs, saying: ""We also have a responsibility to places like Canary Wharf, like Manchester, like Glasgow."" He added: ""We want our people back together, to make sure we ensure the evolution of our culture and our controls, and I think that will happen over time."" Mr Staley's comments chime with government plans to encourage more people to return to their workplaces from next month, as part of what Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes will bea ""significant return to normality"" by Christmas. However, not all big banks take the same view. Last week, NatWest told more than 50,000 staff in a memo thatthey could continue to work from home until next year. The bank, then known as RBS Group, said it had been reconsidering how the bank works ""in the longer term"" and intended to tell staff about ""future ways of working"" later this year. Originally, it had intended for its employees to work from home until the end of September, but it has now extended the period to early 2021. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley The Barclays boss was speaking after the bank reported a 58% fall in pre-tax profits to Â£1.3bn for the first half of this year, compared with Â£3bn for the same period in 2019. It said it had set aside Â£1.6bn in the second quarter of the year to cover the cost of non-repayment of loans, largely as a result of the coronavirus crisis. That took its total provisions for bad loans to Â£3.7bn for the first half of the year. Its shares were down 2.6% in Wednesday morning trading. ""These results aren't exactly unexpected, but they paint a pretty bleak picture of the UK economy nonetheless - particularly if you happen to be a business owner,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Given the backdrop, a large increase in provisions for bad loans during the half was to be expected - and Barclays now expects disruption to drag well past 2020.""

The Killers to investigate tour misconduct claimsA female sound technician alleges sexual misconduct took place among the band's tour crew in 2009.,"The US rock band are known for hits like Mr Brightside and Somebody Told Me The Killers have said they are taking allegations of sexual misconduct on one of their tours ""extremely seriously"". It comes after a female sound engineer shared an account of a woman being abused backstage during a 2009 US tour. In an article published online, she alleged members of the stage crew took turns to engage in sexual activity with a woman in a dressing room. A representative for The Killers said the band would conduct an investigation of past and present tour staff. Some readers may find the following information distressing. If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story,these organisations may be able to help. A woman, who is named on her Twitter account as Chez Cherrie, posted a blog recalling her time working for a band during a tour in 2009. She says she was a sound engineer for the group, and the only woman working as part of the crew. Recalling a specific incident in Milwaukee, she said: ""We were about half way through our load-in when the FOH [front of house] engineer came over radio and said, 'Hey guys, there is a girl set up in Dressing Room A. Put your name on the list outside the door with your radio channel and we'll call you when it's your turn.' ""I continued my load out, occasionally hearing a name come over the radio to notify them that it was their turn on the train in Dressing Room A."" Cherrie said that later, on the bus, members of the crew would ""swap stories"" about their time with the woman. As they were departing, she says a security guard ran towards the bus. ""The security guy said, and I will never forget this moment because a piece of me died that night, 'That girl in Dressing Room A is passed out and naked. Is anyone going to take care of her?'"" She says the men on the bus laughed and declined, before leaving the venue. ""I cried that night in my bunk,"" she said. ""I should've left the tour. I should've spoken up for that woman. I should've defended her... and made sure she was okay."" Cherrie did not name the band in the article, which was published in 2018, but identified them as The Killers while re-posting the article on Twitter on Tuesday evening. None of the band members were implicated in the assault. She added that she was working for the ""largest sound company in the world"" at the time - but did not name them. A legal representative for The Killers told BBC News: ""First and foremost, any allegations of inappropriate behaviour by anyone on The Killers touring team are taken extremely seriously by the band and their management. ""This person's story is appalling and, while The Killers do not have the same touring crew in 2020 that they had earlier in their career, they will be conducting a thorough investigation into past and present tour staff. ""Their legal team will be reaching out to this person for more information and clarity on the alleged incidents as detailed, as well as to the audio vendor who provided crew for the tour. ""The band are astonished and shocked by these claims. The behaviour attributed to them and their crew is unrecognisable and in direct opposition to the principles with which they run their workplace."" The Killers are one of the biggest rock bands in the world, best known for hits such as Mr Brightside, Somebody Told Me, Human and When You Were Young.

Unhealthy diets are âslow-motion disasterâ,"Is the food industry encouraging people towards unhealthy eating habits? Free school meals should be extended to another 1.5 million children in England, says a government-commissioned review into food and healthy eating. The National Food Strategy warns that England's eating habits are a ""slow-motion disaster"". The review,externalwarns of the toxic connection between child poverty, poor diet and hunger. And it warns of ""wilfully misleading"" packaging which can give a false impression that foods are healthy. The food industry is accused of ""clothing itself, and its products, in false virtue"" - with the report highlighting the packaging for Percy Pig sweets sold in Marks & Spencer. The report says these sweets are promoted with the claim they have ""no artificial colours or artificial flavourings"" and to be ""soft gums made with fruit juice"". Have government anti-obesity plans ever made any difference? Offers on unhealthy food encourage obesity Marcus Rashford gets result in U-turn over free school meals Who gets free school meals? But it asks how any parents check to see that the ""three largest ingredients by weight are glucose syrup, sugar and glucose-fructose-syrup"". Report author, Henry Dimbleby, said he was singling out Marks & Spencer ""not because it is the biggest sinner"" but because it is a ""well-trusted company"" which pledges to ""always strive to do the right thing"". The review proposes widening access to free school meals and food for families during the summer holidays In response, a spokesman for Marks & Spencer said: ""All our products have clear labelling so that customers can make informed choices about what they buy"" - and that there was a ""range of Percy Pigs with one third less sugar"". The food review from Mr Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain, takes issue with the language used to sell food. Email us atHaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp us at +44 7756 165803 Tweet us@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Phrases such as ""low fat"" might mean ""high starch"" and labels such as ""'free from' and 'less' are sprinkled around without context,"" says the report, which ""if not quite lies, are at least wilfully misleading"". Mr Dimbleby said some snacks might be ""clothed in a veneer of goodness and might not be better for you than a Mars bar"". Footballer Marcus Rashford campaigned for school meals to continue through the summer holiday The negative impacts of unhealthy eating or going hungry are long-lasting and corrosive, says the review, which is claimed as the most significant in England for decades. ""One of the miserable legacies of Covid-19 is likely to be a dramatic increase in unemployment and poverty and therefore hunger,"" says the food strategy report. As an immediate intervention, the review calls for many more children to be eligible for a free meal at school, as ""only 1% of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards of a school meal"". The review says they should be available to a further 1.5 million children, in addition to the 1.3 million already eligible - so almost one in three children would get free meals. The extension of free school meals, at a cost of Â£670m per year, would expand eligibility to all children in households where the parent or guardian is claiming universal credit or equivalent benefits. Such a move would aim to stop pupils being hungry at school and prevent the negative consequences for learning and behaviour. Footballer Marcus Rashford recently raised the profile of the importance of school meals during the summer holidays for families who are struggling financially,forcing a U-turn which will see vouchers continuing over the summer break. The food strategy proposes making a long-term commitment to feeding more families over the summer holidays, by making another 1.1 million children in England eligible for the ""holiday activity and food programme"", at a cost of Â£200m per year. Paul Whiteman, leader of the Nation Association of Head Teachers, said there were already too many children who ""arrive at school hungry and unable to learn"". ""Free school meals at least guarantee that children going hungry at home get one nutritious meal a day,"" he said. There are serious consequences from a poor diet, says the review, with one in seven deaths in the UK attributable to poor diets. ""A nutritionally poor-quality diet is the leading risk factor for ill-health in the UK, yet we do not treat it with the same seriousness afforded to other risk factors. FEELING LOST?:How to start thinking about the future 'HOMELESS HOTEL':Lockdown life inside emergency accommodation ""That has to change,"" said Susan Jebb, Oxford University professor of diet and population health, who worked on the report. ""This report reinforces the urgent need for action on the two biggest food challenges facing Britain: the growing scandal of food poverty and the need to prevent British farmers being undercut in new trade deals,"" said Luke Pollard, Labour's shadow environment secretary. This is the first part of the review, with the second part next year expected to focus on environmental issues, such as climate change, pollution, sustainable farming and the spread of diseases. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the food industry had ""worked round the clock"" to keep supplies going through the Covid-19 lockdown. ""But we know there is more to do and we will carefully consider this independent report and its recommendations as we emerge from the pandemic and build a stronger food system for the future,"" said Mr Eustice.

Coronavirus: How scared should we be of a 'second wave'?,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned there are signs of a ""second wave"" of coronavirus cases in Europe, but what's the evidence for that? Talk of a second wave is the stuff of nightmares, conjuring up images of another deadly surge of infections. This is what happened with Spanish Flu after the First World War when a second wave proved deadlier than the first. But the truth is many experts try to avoid the phrase altogether. Margaret Harris, from the World Health Organization, has made clear that what we have seen is ""one big wave"" that is making its way across the globe. Some countries, such as South Korea and Singapore, have been better than others at flattening it from the start by stopping the virus spreading by using comprehensive testing and tracing regimes. But others - and the UK, France, Spain and Italy are examples of this - have just managed to flatten it partway through the wave by introducing lockdowns. This was because they did not have such sophisticated infectious disease systems in place to control the virus. Thanks to investment, they are in a much stronger position now and have been able to release lockdown, while still trying to suppress the virus wave through testing and tracing. But there are signs cases are picking up, especially in Spain. But rather than this being a second wave - or the start of one - perhaps we are better off thinking of these as the existing wave bursting through the defences. Prof Paul Hunter, a Covid expert at Norwich Medical School, says for it to be a second wave the virus would have to have gone away completely, so he prefers to call it a ""resurgence"". And really it should come as no surprise that this happens in highly-populated areas like Western Europe. Containing the virus relies on good systems for detecting cases and for the public to play its part by social distancing, and engaging with the test and trace systems. Clearly any weakness leaves countries susceptible, particularly to this virus which can be transmitted even if people are not displaying symptoms. However, while cases may be going up, it is worth noting they are nowhere near the levels seen during the peak of the pandemic. And bear in mind that the peaks seen in the charts above for all the countries - bar maybe Germany which had widespread testing in place quickly - are a gross underestimate of the true scale of infections. That's because there was not widespread testing available at the time. In the UK alone it is estimated that there were 100,000 cases a day at the peak - 20 times more than the testing in place at the time suggested. The greater access to testing there is, the more likely you are to pick up mild infections. If you only test patients in hospital - as was largely the case in the UK until late April - you are going to miss a lot of cases. What is also clear is that infection levels vary greatly within countries. There are areas where the virus is virtually non-existent, while in others it is lurking menacingly. In the UK there have beenflare-ups in Leicesterand - to a lesser extent -Blackburn with DarwenandOldham. A similar picture emerges when you look at the data for Spain. Even Germany is not immune to this, with local lockdowns announced in recent weeks. There are many reasons why this is happening. There are signs young people are spreading it in certain areas. Certainly, the young are less likely to get extremely sick, which could make them more relaxed about the need for social distancing. But it could also be true that the virus has always been circulating in these groups, it is just that more widespread testing is picking it up. There also seems to be a link to deprivation - where people live in close proximity the likelihood of transmission increases. This video can not be played What factors determine a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections? Whatever the reasons behind the local flare-ups, what is certain is that they will continue for the foreseeable future. Prof Keith Neal, an expert in infectious diseases from University of Nottingham, says these spikes will become a way of life, but they are in ""no way"" a second wave. He says countries across Europe are ""learning to live"" with the virus by taking precautions such as social distancing and wearing masks. He believes that if people remain vigilant, coupled with the improved treatments that are being found and greater testing, the scale of deaths seen during the peaks will hopefully not be repeated. There is a good chance, it seems, that what will be seen are the ripples from the first wave rather than a big second wave.

Those who are eligible to enter the US - such as US citizens flying in from the UK - must be prepared to quarantine for 14 days. Even US travellers arriving from some US states must quarantine. And, since the US is not exempt from the UK's quarantine, anyone returning to the UK will have to self-isolate for 14 days. What's more, the Foreign Office still advises against non-essential travel to the US. The US has reported more than 5.8 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 179,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.

When is shielding ending?,"Guidance for people in England identified as being ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing? Formal advice telling them to take extra care, or ""shield"", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. Most coronavirus restrictionsare being lifted in Englandon 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else. However, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to ""think particularly carefully"" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including: limiting moments of close contact considering whether you and others have been fully vaccinated (you might want to wait until 14 days after your second dose before meeting) considering the risk if Covid levels are high in the general community meeting outside if possible ensuring inside spaces are well-ventilated washing hands regularly and avoiding face-touching continuing social distancing if that feels right for you asking friends/family to take lateral flow tests before meeting There is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Although Scotland moves toCovid protection level zero,externalon 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidkeeping the mandatory use of face coveringspast then would give ""added protection and assurance"" to people who were particularly vulnerable. From 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace. However, companies still havelegally binding health and safety responsibilities,external- and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. Some firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people. TheCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough),externalis available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. You may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons. Read theupdated government advice,external. Although the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it ""expects and recommends"" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport. You should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. TheNHS Volunteer Responders,externalprogramme is still available to offer support. Data showsCovid vaccines are highly effectivein most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection. Being double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. You should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not,book through the NHS website,externalor call 119. The most vulnerable peopleare likely to be offered booster jabs from September,external, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions. The pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The governmentrecommends several support websites,external. If you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on theNHS Shielded Patient List,external. A combination of factors can contribute toa person's risk,external, including: age (older being higher risk) ethnicity deprivation (according to postcode) weight (body mass index) underlying health issues prescribed medications Cancer patients need to take extra care High risk categories,externalinclude people: with transplanted solid organs undergoing some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy on immunosuppression drugs with heart disease who are also pregnant with severe respiratory conditions (for example: cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD) with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency with Down's syndrome (adults) on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (adults) EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Possible coronavirus 'cluster' in Glasgow area,"A pharmacy in Inverclyde is among a number of businesses which have been linked to a new coronavirus cluster. Eight positive tests in Port Glasgow are among 14 new cases reported in the Greater Glasgow health board area. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said none of the cases were experiencing anything more than mild symptoms. It added: ""Close contacts are being advised to self-isolate and other identified contacts are being followed up and given appropriate advice."" Greenock and Inverclyde MSP Stuart McMillian tweeted to say he would not speculate ""where or who is involved"". But he said: ""News has broken that there has been a cluster of Covid-19 cases in Port Glasgow. ""I have spoken to the Scottish government and the health board, and their Track and Trace Investigation Team are working on this as we speak. ""I will share information to help the community when I get it."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that an incident management team was meeting to discuss the development. The cases were among 22 reported across Scotland in the last 24 hours. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland Ms Sturgeon has previously said localised outbreaks of the virus are all but inevitable, following clusters in North Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway. However, the first minister said the ""test and protect"" system was working well, with the number of people being treated in hospital for Covid-19 remaining low. Ms Sturgeon said:  ""Part of the challenge we have around any potential cluster is to make sure everything possible that can be done to minimise onward transmission is done."" Nicola Sturgeon has previously said localised outbreaks of the virus are ""all but inevitable"" The first minister said people should be assured that ""any suggestion of any links between cases or possible clusters or outbreaks are absolutely rigorously explored, investigated and dealt with"". News of the cluster came as the National Records of Scotland said the number of deaths linked to coronavirus had increased very slightly, with Covid-19 mentioned on eight death certificates in the week to Sunday. This was an increase of two deaths from the six that were recorded the previous week. Ms Sturgeon said numbers were likely to fluctuate at such a low level, pointing out that the overall number of deaths in Scotland was below the five-year average. However she said her government was likely to ""adopt a very cautious approach"" at the next review of lockdown restrictions on Thursday. She said ""very significant changes"" had been made in recent weeks, with the hospitality and tourism industries reopening, and said it was ""still too early to be completely assured"" of the impact of this. Ms Sturgeon said it was important not to ""do too much too quickly and give the virus the chance to overwhelm us again"". The first minister is expected to give further details of when and how Scotland's schools will re-open on Thursday.

Madonna's Instagram flagged over conspiracy video,"Madonna claims to have been exposed to Covid-19 on her Madame X tour earlier this year Pop star Madonna has been censured by Instagram after sharing a video about a coronavirus conspiracy theory to her 15 million followers. In her post, the singer claimed a vaccine for Covid-19 had already been found, but was being hidden to ""let the rich get richer"". Instagram blurred out the video with a caption saying: ""False Information"". It also directed users to a page debunking the claims in the video, noting there is no coronavirus vaccine. The video was later deleted from Madonna's Instagram page, but not before fans protested at her decision to share the post. Among them was pop star Annie Lennox, who commented: ""This is utter madness!!! I can't believe that you are endorsing this dangerous quackery. ""Hopefully your site has been hacked and you're just about to explain it,"" she added. The star previously called coronavirus ""the great equaliser"" in a video posted from her bath The video in question showed a group called America's Frontline Doctors speaking outside the US Supreme Court building at an event organised by Tea Party Patriots Action. In the clip, Dr Stella Immanuel, a doctor from Houston, said she had successfully treated 350 coronavirus patients ""and counting"" with hydroxychloroquine. Trump sticks by discredited coronavirus treatment The best and worst celebrity isolation videos Madonna cringes at British accent as tour resumes Facebook and Twitter had previously removed the video, flagging it as misinformation; while Donald Trump Jr. was banned from tweeting for 12 hours as a penalty for sharing the clip. According to Instagram, flagging a post as false makes it harder for users to discover ""by filtering it from Explore and Hashtags, and reducing its visibility in Feed and Stories."" This is not the first time Madonna has made controversial claims about coronavirus. In March, she posted a video from her bath, describing the virus as ""the great equaliser"". Two months later, she revealed she had tested positive for antibodies, supposedly granting her immunity from the disease.

Barclays: We want our people back in the office,"Barclays boss Jes Staley has signalled that he wants employees working from home during the pandemic to return to the office ""over time"". ""It is important to get people back together in physical concentrations,"" he told Bloomberg TV. He said 60,000 Barclays staff were working ""from their kitchen tables"", but stressed that another 20,000 were in offices, branches and call centres. In April, Mr Staley had saidbig city offices ""may be a thing of the past"". In recent years, banks worldwide have shifted staff away from expensive skyscrapers in financial hubs, but Barclays and its rivals still have busy offices in places such as London's Canary Wharf. In his latest remarks, Mr Staley appeared to cast doubt on the idea of abandoning those hubs, saying: ""We also have a responsibility to places like Canary Wharf, like Manchester, like Glasgow."" He added: ""We want our people back together, to make sure we ensure the evolution of our culture and our controls, and I think that will happen over time."" Mr Staley's comments chime with government plans to encourage more people to return to their workplaces from next month, as part of what Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes will bea ""significant return to normality"" by Christmas. However, not all big banks take the same view. Last week, NatWest told more than 50,000 staff in a memo thatthey could continue to work from home until next year. The bank, then known as RBS Group, said it had been reconsidering how the bank works ""in the longer term"" and intended to tell staff about ""future ways of working"" later this year. Originally, it had intended for its employees to work from home until the end of September, but it has now extended the period to early 2021. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley The Barclays boss was speaking after the bank reported a 58% fall in pre-tax profits to Â£1.3bn for the first half of this year, compared with Â£3bn for the same period in 2019. It said it had set aside Â£1.6bn in the second quarter of the year to cover the cost of non-repayment of loans, largely as a result of the coronavirus crisis. That took its total provisions for bad loans to Â£3.7bn for the first half of the year. Its shares were down 2.6% in Wednesday morning trading. ""These results aren't exactly unexpected, but they paint a pretty bleak picture of the UK economy nonetheless - particularly if you happen to be a business owner,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Given the backdrop, a large increase in provisions for bad loans during the half was to be expected - and Barclays now expects disruption to drag well past 2020.""

Wiley permanently suspended by Twitter,"Grime artist Wiley has apologised for ""generalising"" about Jewish people after being banned from social media. In an interview with Sky News, the artist insisted: ""I'm not racist."" ""My comments should not have been directed to all Jews or Jewish people. I want to apologise for generalising, and I want to apologise for comments that were looked at as anti-Semitic."" Twitter had earlier banned his account permanently after a public backlash over a perceived lack of action. ""We are sorry we did not move faster,"" Twitter said in a statement. Sky News reported that the offensive tweets were sparked by a falling-out between the rapper and his former manager, who is Jewish. The pair cut ties in recent days. ""I just want to apologise for generalising and going outside of the people who I was talking to within the workspace and workplace I work in,"" Wiley said. ""I'm not racist, you know. I'm a businessman. My thing should have stayed between me and my manager, I get that."" However, the artist appeared in the interview to refuse to distance himself from most of the anti-Semitic comments he posted on social media. Wiley's series of anti-Semitic tweets appeared on Friday night. One tweet read: ""I don't care about Hitler, I care about black people"", and compared the Jewish community to the Ku Klux Klan. This video can not be played Rapper Wiley's Twitter account has been suspended after anti-Semitic posts Twitter did not immediately respond, prompting a public outcry anda 48-hour boycott of Twitter by many usersover what they said had been an unacceptable delay. The social network eventually banned Wiley for violating its ""hateful conduct"" policy - a day after Facebook and Instagram had deleted the music star's accounts for ""repeated violations"" of their rules. Twitter said it had decided to make an earlier temporary ban permanent, and wipe all his past posts from its platform, ""upon further consideration"". ""We deeply respect the concerns shared by the Jewish community and online safety advocates,"" the statement said, promising to continue to tackle anti-Semitism. The star, known as the ""godfather of grime"", was awarded an MBE for services to music in 2018. He told Sky News he would hand back the honour following calls for him to be stripped of it, saying he had ""never wanted it"". ""I never felt comfortable going to get it. Just look at Britain's colonialism history,"" he said. When asked what he would like to say to his fans, he responded angrily saying fans were fickle and, at 41, he was no longer ""current"" and was at the end of his career. By Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation and social media reporter The permanent suspension of the rapper's Facebook, Instagram and Twitter profiles has been widely welcomed. However, it is emblematic of a slowness to act on hateful abuse from social media sites. And many are asking why this took so long. Time and time again, decisive action from social media sites over racist abuse, misinformation or hate speech has come only once comments have reached thousands of users. What does it take for Twitter to act decisively on anti-Semitic abuse? Facebook removes Wiley after abuse of Jewish critics VIPs and MPs boycott Twitter after Wiley tweets 'How it feels to be black and Jewish' In this case it appears to be external pressure - the move comes after a boycott by users. And it also seems to be dependent on what the other social media sites choose to do: Facebook moved to suspend Wiley's accounts on Tuesday, and then Twitter appeared to follow suit. With the Stop Hate for Profit campaign ramping up pressure, and increased focus on the way social media sites tackle hate speech and misinformation, the spotlight will intensify on the actions of Twitter, Facebook and Google in these scenarios. The delay in Twitter taking action prompted the 48-hour boycott of Twitter by many users - including celebrities and MPs - beginning on Monday morning. Organisers said the time reflected the ""48 hours of pure race hate"" they accuse Twitter of giving to Wiley. On Tuesday, Facebook issued a ban after Wiley was discovered posting abusive material on his personal page using his real name, Richard Cowie. Twitter followed suit on Wednesday, after what it said was a thorough investigation. Despite the move, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said both Twitter and Facebook had been slow to act, adding ""it is just not good enough"". ""Social media companies have not been strong or fast enough about tackling racism, misogyny or homophobia,"" it said in a statement. The Campaign Against Antisemitism echoed that sentiment, writing that Twitter ""has finally listened"". ""The closure of Wiley's account is too little too late, but it is at least a start for this deeply irresponsible social network,"" it said.

Fears over 'zombie companies' as UK exits lockdown,"Those working in the events industry face an uncertain future A wave of ""zombie companies"" kept afloat during lockdown are on a cliff-edge going into the autumn, experts say. Analysis by the BBC shows a surge of firms went bust in March, then the rate slowed in the first few months of lockdown amid a Â£160bn support package. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says many firms have piled on debts and will struggle. The government said it would ""adjust support"" as the economy reopens. So-called zombie companies are businesses that function day-to-day, but cannot pay off the full debt they owe or find cash to invest and grow. Julie Palmer, a partner at the financial consultants Begbies Traynor, said: ""This crisis will force many zombie companies out of business. ""While these were clinging on to survival prior to the pandemic, many will now have become simply unviable due to high levels of debts and poor sales."" Stuart Adam, from the IFS, said: ""Many firms have been tided over during the period of hibernation partly through loans and tax deferrals, but those mean piling up debts that will make it harder for them to carry on in the longer term."" The BBC Shared Data Unit looked at how many companies had posted insolvency notices in the London Gazette, the official paper of record for public notices.  A company is insolvent when it can't pay its debts. Our investigation found there was a spike of 4,200 insolvencies in March as the UK headed into lockdown. The rate of insolvencies slowed over the next three months, with a further 5,000 businesses insolvent - a drop of 23% compared to the same period last year. What does it mean to declare insolvency? UK 'faces explosive debt levels' The economic impact of Covid-19 As well as government support, it is thought changes to insolvency law and reduced court services have contributed to the slowdown. Firms in the information and communication sector saw the largest increase in insolvencies. Richard Millward's events business Relevent Ltd has 'ongoing costs' Business ownerRichard Millwardis working as a driver for a supermarket while he watches his long-standing firm run out of cash. For 30 years, he has worked in the events industry, putting on large-scale gatherings such as the London Marathon. He is currently working as a driver for Waitrose, with no prospect of events income until at least April next year. His business has benefitted from the furlough scheme and a business rate relief grant - part of billions of pounds in government support and legal changes to help firms cope with Covid-19's impact. But his company of 17 years has ongoing costs and Richard is facing the choice of holding on, or closing it down before it runs out of money. He knows of several companies that have gone into administration or already closed down. ""It's sad and also quite worrying,"" he said. ""We're going to lose an awful lot of the skill, the talent pool that we have. I think a lot of people are just trying to hang on for as long as possible."" In separate research, financial consultants Begbies Traynor said527,000 businesses were in ""significant financial distress"",externalat the end of June. Ric Traynor, its executive chairman, said businesses would have to deal with a ""toxic mix"" of reduced sales and increased debt. He said: ""Many of the support measures will have simply delayed the inevitable, with the can being firmly kicked down the road."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? The IFS's Stuart Adam said: ""I think pretty much everyone agrees a perfect recovery is not realistic, it's going to be bad."" But he said investment in new businesses was key to recovery. ""Getting new businesses starting up and hiring people is exactly the kind of thing that needs to happen over the coming year or two,"" he added. Shahid Hussain has set up food delivery business 'Wraps, Pittas and Buns' While many companies are struggling, some people have been using the lockdown to launch new business ventures with more than 170,000 new firms registered from April to June. Sectors leading a bounce-back were online retail, real estate, construction and takeaway food. One of those new start-ups is run byShahid Hussain, from Essex, whose food delivery business now has eight branches. ""People said we were crazy to be setting up a business during Covid when everyone was going into lockdown. ""What we realised was that Covid was going to fundamentally change the way we eat. People wanted fast delivery food, but restaurant quality. ""It's going really well. The delivery market was picking up even before Covid; it just accelerated it. We definitely launched at the right time. It's going so well, we have got plans to open two or three outlets in the next week or so."" NurseTom Parkinson, 25, is hoping to register his baking business soon, making sourdough bread from home alongside his NHS work. He said: ""I think there's going to be a revival, I think more people are into food that's come from a local producer and done with a bit of love and care, I think there's a market for it."" The government said its job retention scheme had protected more than nine million jobs and the next stage of support included a 15% VAT cut for some businesses, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme Bonus, and investment in greener buildings and homes. A spokesman said: ""As the economy reopens, we will continue to look at how to adjust our support in a way that ensures people can get back to work, protecting both the UK economy and the livelihoods of people across the country.""

Women break round-the-world tandem record,"Cat Dixon and Raz Marsden (right) cycled through 25 countries Two women have broken the world record for the fastest time circumnavigating the globe on a tandem bicycle. Cat Dixon, 54, and Raz Marsden, 55, accomplished the feat in 263 days, beating the previous record of 281 days. They set out from Oxford last June, finishing in March shortly before the coronavirus lockdown. Their achievement has been confirmed as part of the launch ofGuinness World Records Day,external. The pair covered 18,263 miles (29,391 km) in precisely 263 days, eight hours and seven minutes, on a route that took them through 25 countries. During their trip, which included flights where crossings were impossible, they faced a heatwave across Europe, monsoons in Asia, and the Australian bush fires. They described their record-breaking trip as the ""adventure of a lifetime"" The journey then became a race against time as they boarded one of the last ferries to the UK on the day the travel ban started. The previous record was set by UK cyclists Edward Collier and Louis Paul Snellgrove last May. Ms Dixon, a lawyer from Yorkshire, and Ms Marsden, a Motor Neurone Disease nurse consultant at Oxford University Hospitals, have raised more than Â£40,000 for charity. In a joint statement they said: ""The experience was incredible and certainly not without its challenges - most notably racing to make it home as borders closed behind us due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""Setting the world record really was the adventure of a lifetime and we hope that it will inspire others to believe that anything is possible if you follow your dreams."" The pair faced heatwaves and bushfires on their long journey UK France Monaco Italy Slovenia Croatia Bosnia and Herzegovina Montenegro Albania North Macedonia Greece Turkey Georgia India Myanmar Thailand Malaysia Singapore Australia New Zealand USA Mexico Morocco Spain Gibraltar UK Craig Glenday, Guinness World Records editor in chief, said: ""I was thrilled to hear that they'd smashed not just the women's title but the overall round-the-world record.""

Covid studies to examine virus link with ethnicity,"A large proportion of NHS doctors are from an ethnic minority background UK scientists are to receive millions of pounds of government funding for a raft of studies to learn why people from an ethnic minority background are at greater risk from Covid-19. Six projects will analyse data on social circumstances, health and day-to-day activities, as well as investigating genetic risk factors. One will follow 30,000 health and social-care staff for a year. Researchers say there will be rapid action based on the findings. Prof Kamlesh Khunti, director of the Centre for BME Health at the University of Leicester, who is involved in three of the studies, told BBC News he expected results to be translated into guidance that would help save black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) lives within months. ""We will definitely get answers to the things that are putting people at much higher risk,"" he said. ""As soon as we get results that might make a difference, it is important that we get them out straight away."" The results will also be shared with the leaders of black and South Asian communities, professional bodies and health regulators who will take rapid action, said Prof Khunti. ""If we find that living in crowded, multi-generational housing, not getting enough physical activity, are high on the list of factors associated with certain communities dying from Covid, we can look at the evidence and transform them into the most culturally appropriate messages."" This video can not be played BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? Emerging evidence shows people from ethnic minoritiesare significantly more likely to die from Covid-19than the white population. But no-one knows exactly why ethnic groups are more vulnerable, though there are a number of ideas about why people from BAME backgrounds have been harder hit. These include: working in occupations with greater levels of contact with people in frontline health and social care living in deprived circumstances a greater proportion having underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, which increase the risk of serious illness Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, welcomed the research. ""With evidence showing that people from BAME backgrounds are more severely affected by Covid-19, it is critical that we understand what factors are driving this risk to address them effectively,"" he said. ""The diverse range of projects funded will help examine this association in detail so that new treatments and approaches to care can be developed to target BAME groups."" The projects include: a study looking at age, gender and deprivation data on more than two million health and social-care workers. The study will also follow 30,000 doctors, nurses, porters and cleaners of all ethnic backgrounds over the course of a year and look at workplace routines, such as redeployments and the provision of protective equipment Oxford and Southampton University teams will look at the health conditions of BAME patients who were treated in hospital and died from Covid-19, using a database of 40 million GP records across England a project analysing information gathered by the UK Biobank project, which has been monitoring the genetics, mental wellbeing and physical activity of 500,000 people since 2006 and collects blood, urine and saliva samples. Dr Manish Pareek, an associate clinical professor at the University of Leicester, is leading the study of health and social-care workers. He says the aim is to quantify the risk for different groups. ""What is the risk of a doctor from an Asian group compared with that of a nurse of black ethnicity? ""If there is a clear signal we are seeing that a particular group is at high risk we will put these forward and recommend action be taken. This may include enhanced health assessments or that those at really high risk should not be working in Covid wards."" He added: ""Even taking into account factors such as deprivation, household structure, age and gender, ethnicity is still is an important predictor of getting infected and having adverse outcomes."" Prof Dame Ottoline Leyser, chief executive of the UK Research and Innovation agency, which has part-funded the research, along with the National Institute of Health Research, said the studies would lead to lives being saved. ""Urgent action must be taken to determine and address the factors underlying this disparity,"" she said. ""There is unlikely to be a simple answer and we must consider all possibilities, reflected in the range of projects we have funded, so that we can save as many lives as possible during this pandemic and any future outbreaks.""

Trump sticks by unproven coronavirus treatment,"This video can not be played US President Trump on Dr Fauci's approval rating: ""Nobody likes me"" US President Donald Trump has again defended the use of hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, contradicting his own public health officials. He said the malaria medication was only rejected as a Covid-19 treatment because he had recommended its use. His remarks come after Twitter banned his eldest son for posting a clip promoting hydroxychloroquine. There is no evidence the drug can fight the virus, and regulators warn it may cause heart problems. On Wednesday Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, told the BBC that hydroxychloroquine was not effective against the virus. ""We know that every single good study - and by good study I mean randomised control study in which the data are firm and believable - has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of Covid-19,"" he said. Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cautioned against using the drug to treat coronavirus patients,external, following reports of ""serious heart rhythm problems"" and other health issues. The FDA also revoked its emergency-use authorisation for the drug to treat Covid-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) says ""there is currently no proof"" that it is effective as a treatment or prevents Covid-19. In other developments: Coronavirus deaths in the US reached 149,250, according to Johns Hopkins University, as states in the south and west, including Florida and California, reported record daily death tolls. But Mr Trump claimed that large parts of the US were ""corona-free"" The US biotech company Moderna said its experimental coronavirus vaccine had induced a strong immune response in a study on monkeys. It said the vaccine protected against infection in the lungs and nose, and prevented lung disease Better known for making cameras,Kodak has moved into drug making and has just secured a $765m (Â£592m) loan from the US government.The fallen giant of the photography industry will make ingredients used in generic drugs to help fight the virus Studies commissioned by the WHO, the US National Institutes of Health and other researchers around the world have found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine - when used with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, as repeatedly recommended by President Trump - helps treat coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine was first touted by Mr Trump in March. Two months later he surprised journalists by saying he had begun taking the unproven medication to ward off the virus. Why a video promoted by Trump was pulled on social media Madonna's Instagram flagged over conspiracy video The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' What do we know about hydroxychloroquine? On Tuesday the president told reporters at the White House: ""I can only say that from my standpoint, and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. ""I don't think you lose anything by doing it, other than politically it doesn't seem too popular."" He added: ""When I recommend something, they like to say 'don't use it'."" The comments were made as he prepared to visit Odessa, Texas for a fundraising event on Wednesday, despite concerns over surges of Covid-19 cases in the state. Joe Biden, Mr Trump's presumptive rival in the November general election, criticised the trip. ""Texas families are suffering. They're suffering because President Trump's inability to lead this country and combat the spread of Covid-19,"" Mr Biden said. President Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr were among social media users who shared video late on Monday of a group called America's Frontline Doctors advocating hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment. Facebook and Twitter removed the content, flagging it as misinformation, but not before more than 17 million people had seen one of the clips. Twitter also banned the US president's eldest son from tweeting for 12 hours as a penalty for sharing the clip. In the past, Twitter has declined to remove tweets by President Trump himself and other world leaders, citing public interest and newsworthiness. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The video in question showed doctors speaking outside the US Supreme Court building at an event organised by Tea Party Patriots Action, a group that has helped fund a pro-Trump political action committee. In the video, Dr Stella Immanuel, a doctor from Houston, says she has successfully treated 350 coronavirus patients ""and counting"" with hydroxychloroquine. The president said on Tuesday: ""I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it."" This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus According to the Daily Beast,external, Dr Immanuel has previously claimed the government is run by ""reptilians"" and that scientists are developing a vaccine to stop people being religious, among other bizarre views. America's Frontline Doctors' founder Simone Gold accused social media companies of censorship for removing the hydroxychloroquine video. ""Treatment options for COVID-19 should be debated, and spoken about among our colleagues in the medical field,"" she tweeted. ""They should never, however, be censored and silenced."" This video can not be played 'We already lost prom and graduation...' Late on Monday, Mr Trump also retweeted several tweets critical of Dr Fauci. But in Tuesday's briefing the president denied he was criticising the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, insisting: ""I get along with him very well."" Asked about hydroxychloroquine earlier on Tuesday, Dr Fauci said the medication was not an appropriate treatment for Covid-19. This video can not be played Why the US struggled with its reopening He told ABC News' morning show that the drug was ""not effective in coronavirus disease"".

Double tests 'could cut quarantine time',"People entering the UK from at-risk countries who test negative for coronavirus twice within several days might be allowed to leave quarantine early. The UK government is close to giving its backing to a trial, according to travel industry sources. Under current rules, those arriving in the UK from certain countries must self-isolate for 14 days. The Department for Transport (DfT) declined to comment. Details of the new programme are said to be still being worked out, but one key area of debate is the number of days required between tests. The government has indicated that it is keeping all quarantine measures under review. It is said to be considering an eight-day stretch between tests, whereas figures within the travel sector are keen for a five-day period. The number of days required between each test is critical in reducing the possibility of ""false negative"" results. A false negative result is possible if someone who has recently contracted Covid-19 is not showing symptoms. France is about to launch a compulsory two-test regime for people arriving from 16 at-risk countries, including the United States. The BBC understands that there are two broad options being considered. The first would involve someone having a first test several days before they travelled to the UK, with the second test happening the day before they arrive. However, this might mean that in some cases people would need to be tested abroad. That option could mean that people would avoid quarantine altogether. The second possibility is that people would be tested on arrival in the UK, possibly at the airport, and then be required to have a second test several days later. In the period between the two tests, the person would have to self-isolate at home in line with government rules. Airlines push for virus testing to save holiday season Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? What are the UK's travel rules and which countries can you visit? Another question mark remains over how the trial will be funded. Travel consultant Paul Charles believes that airports will have to foot part of the bill. ""The onus is on UK airports to invest, as restaurants and bars have done, in the measures which enable the economy to get going,"" he said. Like other figures in the travel industry, Mr Charles is frustrated by the fact that the government has still not given its backing to testing as a way of people avoiding the travel quarantine. ""Substantial investment in testing is the only solution to enable safer travel, keep corridors open to other countries and remove the disruptive need for everyone to self-isolate for 14 days."" John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, told BBC News ""the jury was still out"" on having one single coronavirus test on arrival. ""Not enough work has been done on that and it may be that we need another test after five or eight days to get people out of quarantine early. ""As the UK's hub airport, I want to work with the government on some of these things - to try to find a balance to keep people safe but also to get the economy moving again and save as many jobs as possible."" The test that would be used is the same Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-type test used by the NHS, and can cost about Â£150 each time. Any trial of the double-testing scheme would likely initially be focused on one or two specific routes. The BBC has been told that any trial would not initially be focused on people arriving from European destinations. The aviation sector has been in discussions with Public Health England about how the testing could work. If the scheme goes ahead, it is not expected to be implemented for several weeks. Collinson and Swissport are the two firms spearheading the work on the trials in the UK. Collinson chief executive David Evans said of the potential roll-out: ""I would hope that the government would move and flex on their policy - I think they've got to have an armoury of tools at their disposal to do this. ""As soon as they do that, we should get this rolled out in the next couple of weeks."" Why is the UK bringing in travel testing?

"Airport tests 'not silver bullet' to save holidaysBut Heathrow airport boss says there needs to be alternative to the ""cliff edge"" of quarantine.","This video can not be played Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye: ""More work needs to be done, we need to test and learn"" Leading travel and airline industry figures have urged the prime minister to replace blanket quarantine measures with regional travel corridors. In a letter to Boris Johnson, they said the 14-day quarantine for people coming from Spain had caused disruption. It was ""the latest significant blow to a sector which now risks being permanently scarred"", they added. They called for quarantine-free travel to areas unaffected by any spike in coronavirus cases. This would include not just Spain, but other key markets for trade and tourism, such as the US and Canada. ""We are in a situation where the government is advising against travel to areas of Spain that have lower rates of Covid than the UK,"" the letter said. ""We urgently request a meeting with you to discuss the challenge facing our sector and our proposed ways forward,"" the letter concluded. Among the nearly 50 signatories of the letter were British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz, Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye and Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade. Travel industry chiefs are seeking ways to rescue the holiday season. Their intervention came after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC that coronavirus testing at airports was not a ""silver bullet"" to stop the need for quarantine, because the virus could develop over time. The government's sudden change to travel advice for Spain at the weekend prompted a fresh wave of confusion and uncertainty to people's holiday plans. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps returned home early from his own Spanish holiday on Wednesday and will now begin two weeks' quarantine, buthe defended the government's decision. ""We had to act when we did. The figures since have shown why that was required. I'm desperately sad and sorry for people who have lost their holidays,"" he said. Travel firm Tui said on Wednesday it had cancelled holidays to the Balearics and Canary Islands until 4 August after the UK extended its advice against non-essential travel to Spain to include its islands. Coronavirus: Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? Mr Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme the confusion caused by the changes to guidance over Spain showed the need for an alternative. He said airports should be allowed to test for coronavirus to avoid the ""cliff-edge"" of quarantine. Heathrow's financial results, out on Wednesday, showed passengers all but stopped travel in the three months to June, falling by 96% on a year ago as global aviation came to a virtual standstill. Revenue was 85% lower than last year at Â£119m. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""Today's results should serve as a clarion call for the government - the UK needs a passenger testing regime and fast. Without it, Britain is just playing a game of quarantine roulette."" He said he wanted the government to work with the company on the plan and he could have testing sites set and ready ""within weeks"". But Mr Dowden quashed the idea, saying: ""We are not at the point where there is a viable alternative to the 14-day quarantine."" However, he added that all options were under review. Coronavirus testing is available at some German airports Other countries are operating airport testing. It is voluntary - and free - at some German airports now although it may become mandatory, as it is in France for arrivals from high-risk countries such as the US and Brazil. The Netherlands approach is to single out people coming from specific areas with high levels of infections - such as a few named regions in Spain and the UK city of Leicester and urge them to self-isolate. Dr Hans Kluge, Europe regional director for the World Health Organization, endorsed testing at airports as part of general attempts to track the movement of coronavirus. He told the Today programme: ""Testing is never wrong - whether at airports, community or drive-in centres - what's the difference between day-to-day life and travelling?"" Mr Holland-Kaye said a UK airport test would cost about Â£150 each, and passengers would be expected to pay. He acknowledged that was ""not cheap"", but that the test would come down over time as more people took it. The idea of introducing testing at airports is an attractive idea. The theory being people could travel where they like and just get tested as they arrive back in the country, negating the need to self-isolate. But the government is not convinced. Why? Logistically testing all the travellers who arrive every week will be difficult. Testing capacity has increased but this would stretch the system. Not to mention the practical difficulties of setting up testing facilities in busy airports. But the other factor, which is perhaps more crucial, is that in the early stages of infection the test may not even pick it up. Instead, officials are much more persuaded by a more intelligent, targeted approach to self-isolation. That would involve asking only those coming from certain regions in a country where the infection rates are highest to self-isolate. That could then be complemented by then asking them to get tested after a week, meaning if they test negative, there would be no need for the full 14-day self-isolation. All this and more is being discussed behind the scenes. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""The aim would be to have a test on arrival. We could have it up and running in the next two weeks."" He said the plan would be for passengers to go into quarantine and have another test after eight days: ""If they were infected we would be confident that it had shown itself.  If it was clear, they would be allowed to go out of quarantine earlier than had been the case. It's very scientifically based."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? The government is said to be considering an eight-day stretch between tests. The number of days required between each test is critical in reducing the possibility of ""false negative"" results from people not yet showing symptoms. Under current rules, those arriving in the UK from certain countries must self-isolate for 14 days.

Trump sticks by discredited coronavirus treatment,"This video can not be played US President Trump on Dr Fauci's approval rating: ""Nobody likes me"" US President Donald Trump has again defended the use of hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, contradicting his own public health officials. He said the malaria medication was only rejected as a Covid-19 treatment because he had recommended its use. His remarks come after Twitter banned his eldest son for posting a clip promoting hydroxychloroquine. There is no evidence the drug can fight the virus, and regulators warn it may cause heart problems. On Wednesday Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, told the BBC that hydroxychloroquine was not effective against the virus. ""We know that every single good study - and by good study I mean randomised control study in which the data are firm and believable - has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of Covid-19,"" he said. Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cautioned against using the drug to treat coronavirus patients,external, following reports of ""serious heart rhythm problems"" and other health issues. The FDA also revoked its emergency-use authorisation for the drug to treat Covid-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) says ""there is currently no proof"" that it is effective as a treatment or prevents Covid-19. In other developments: Coronavirus deaths in the US reached 149,250, according to Johns Hopkins University, as states in the south and west, including Florida and California, reported record daily death tolls. But Mr Trump claimed that large parts of the US were ""corona-free"" The US biotech company Moderna said its experimental coronavirus vaccine had induced a strong immune response in a study on monkeys. It said the vaccine protected against infection in the lungs and nose, and prevented lung disease Better known for making cameras,Kodak has moved into drug making and has just secured a $765m (Â£592m) loan from the US government.The fallen giant of the photography industry will make ingredients used in generic drugs to help fight the virus Studies commissioned by the WHO, the US National Institutes of Health and other researchers around the world have found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine - when used with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, as repeatedly recommended by President Trump - helps treat coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine was first touted by Mr Trump in March. Two months later he surprised journalists by saying he had begun taking the unproven medication to ward off the virus. Why a video promoted by Trump was pulled on social media Madonna's Instagram flagged over conspiracy video The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' What do we know about hydroxychloroquine? On Tuesday the president told reporters at the White House: ""I can only say that from my standpoint, and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. ""I don't think you lose anything by doing it, other than politically it doesn't seem too popular."" He added: ""When I recommend something, they like to say 'don't use it'."" The comments were made as he prepared to visit Odessa, Texas for a fundraising event on Wednesday, despite concerns over surges of Covid-19 cases in the state. Joe Biden, Mr Trump's presumptive rival in the November general election, criticised the trip. ""Texas families are suffering. They're suffering because President Trump's inability to lead this country and combat the spread of Covid-19,"" Mr Biden said. President Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr were among social media users who shared video late on Monday of a group called America's Frontline Doctors advocating hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment. Facebook and Twitter removed the content, flagging it as misinformation, but not before more than 17 million people had seen one of the clips. Twitter also banned the US president's eldest son from tweeting for 12 hours as a penalty for sharing the clip. In the past, Twitter has declined to remove tweets by President Trump himself and other world leaders, citing public interest and newsworthiness. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The video in question showed doctors speaking outside the US Supreme Court building at an event organised by Tea Party Patriots Action, a group that has helped fund a pro-Trump political action committee. In the video, Dr Stella Immanuel, a doctor from Houston, says she has successfully treated 350 coronavirus patients ""and counting"" with hydroxychloroquine. The president said on Tuesday: ""I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it."" This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus According to the Daily Beast,external, Dr Immanuel has previously claimed the government is run by ""reptilians"" and that scientists are developing a vaccine to stop people being religious, among other bizarre views. America's Frontline Doctors' founder Simone Gold accused social media companies of censorship for removing the hydroxychloroquine video. ""Treatment options for COVID-19 should be debated, and spoken about among our colleagues in the medical field,"" she tweeted. ""They should never, however, be censored and silenced."" This video can not be played 'We already lost prom and graduation...' Late on Monday, Mr Trump also retweeted several tweets critical of Dr Fauci. But in Tuesday's briefing the president denied he was criticising the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, insisting: ""I get along with him very well."" Asked about hydroxychloroquine earlier on Tuesday, Dr Fauci said the medication was not an appropriate treatment for Covid-19. This video can not be played Why the US struggled with its reopening He told ABC News' morning show that the drug was ""not effective in coronavirus disease"".

UK signs deal for 60 million virus vaccine doses,"The UK government has signed a fourth coronavirus vaccine deal, securing up to 60 million doses of an experimental treatment being developed by drug giants GSK and Sanofi. The government has already signed up for 100 million doses ofthe Oxford University vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca. It has also secured another 90 million doses oftwo other promising vaccines. However, it is still uncertain which, if any, of the vaccines may work. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and a number of pharmaceutical firms are in a race to develop and test potential drugs. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? The vaccine involved in the latest government deal, developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK, is based on the recombinant protein-based technology used by Sanofi to produce a flu vaccine, as well as GSK's established pandemic technology. Sanofi, which is leading the clinical development, said regulatory approval could be achieved by the first half of 2021 if trials were successful. In the meantime, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing to produce up to one billion doses a year overall. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? The vaccine has already been at the centre of an international political storm after Sanofi rowed back on an apparent promise to prioritise the US market. Sanofi chief executive Paul Hudson sparked a row in May by saying the US government had ""the right to the largest pre-order because it's invested in taking the risk"". But he changed his view after thenFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe respondedby saying access for all was ""non-negotiable"". In their latest announcement, GSK and Sanofi stressed that they were ""committed to making the vaccine available globally"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic ""With our partner GSK, we are pleased to co-operate with the UK government as well as several other countries and global organisations as part of our ongoing efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine and make it available as quickly as possible,"" said Thomas Triomphe, executive vice-president and global head of Sanofi Pasteur. Roger Connor, president of GSK Vaccines, added: ""We thank the UK government for confirmation of purchasing intent, which supports the significant investment we are already making as a company to scale up development and production of this vaccine."" UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:  ""It is important that we secure early access to a diverse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works, so we can protect the public and save lives."" Kate Bingham, who chairs the UK government's Vaccines Taskforce, said: ""This diversity of vaccine types is important because we do not yet know which, if any, of the different types of vaccine will prove to generate a safe and protective response to Covid-19.

Fly-tipping 'a major irritation' - Princess Anne,"Princess Anne on her Gatcombe Park farming estate Princess Anne has urged people to be careful about waste and energy to help protect the future of the countryside. The Princess Royal made the comments in the latest edition of Country Life, which she guest-edited to mark her 70th birthday next month. Controlling waste is something everyone can do to help the planet, she said, in a column called ""Waste not, want not"". She added: ""Did I mention that fly-tipping is another major irritation to me?"" GM crops have benefits - Princess Anne Princess Anne handed honorary degree by Camilla Princess Anne, who turns 70 on 15 August, paid tribute to her parents - the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh - for instilling her lifelong love of nature. She wrote: ""I was equally fortunate that both my parents had a love and understanding of the natural world through their own experiences."" The Queen's only daughter, who lives on a farming estate - Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire - used the article to question the need for wind turbines, and stressed the importance of better use of water, as well as waste from crops. ""Replacing fossil-fuel generators has not been easy, but covering the countryside in solar panels and windmills isn't really the answer, either,"" she said. She added: ""Small nuclear reactors could have their place, but perhaps there is not the space to pursue that now.""

Poor diets are âslow motion disasterâ,"Is the food industry encouraging people towards unhealthy eating habits? Free school meals should be extended to another 1.5 million children in England, says a government-commissioned review into food and healthy eating. The National Food Strategy warns that England's eating habits are a ""slow-motion disaster"". The review,externalwarns of the toxic connection between child poverty, poor diet and hunger. And it warns of ""wilfully misleading"" packaging which can give a false impression that foods are healthy. The food industry is accused of ""clothing itself, and its products, in false virtue"" - with the report highlighting the packaging for Percy Pig sweets sold in Marks & Spencer. The report says these sweets are promoted with the claim they have ""no artificial colours or artificial flavourings"" and to be ""soft gums made with fruit juice"". Have government anti-obesity plans ever made any difference? Offers on unhealthy food encourage obesity Marcus Rashford gets result in U-turn over free school meals Who gets free school meals? But it asks how any parents check to see that the ""three largest ingredients by weight are glucose syrup, sugar and glucose-fructose-syrup"". Report author, Henry Dimbleby, said he was singling out Marks & Spencer ""not because it is the biggest sinner"" but because it is a ""well-trusted company"" which pledges to ""always strive to do the right thing"". The review proposes widening access to free school meals and food for families during the summer holidays In response, a spokesman for Marks & Spencer said: ""All our products have clear labelling so that customers can make informed choices about what they buy"" - and that there was a ""range of Percy Pigs with one third less sugar"". The food review from Mr Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain, takes issue with the language used to sell food.

Mr Dimbleby said some snacks might be ""clothed in a veneer of goodness and might not be better for you than a Mars bar"". Footballer Marcus Rashford campaigned for school meals to continue through the summer holiday The negative impacts of unhealthy eating or going hungry are long-lasting and corrosive, says the review, which is claimed as the most significant in England for decades. ""One of the miserable legacies of Covid-19 is likely to be a dramatic increase in unemployment and poverty and therefore hunger,"" says the food strategy report. As an immediate intervention, the review calls for many more children to be eligible for a free meal at school, as ""only 1% of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards of a school meal"". The review says they should be available to a further 1.5 million children, in addition to the 1.3 million already eligible - so almost one in three children would get free meals. The extension of free school meals, at a cost of Â£670m per year, would expand eligibility to all children in households where the parent or guardian is claiming universal credit or equivalent benefits. Such a move would aim to stop pupils being hungry at school and prevent the negative consequences for learning and behaviour. Footballer Marcus Rashford recently raised the profile of the importance of school meals during the summer holidays for families who are struggling financially,forcing a U-turn which will see vouchers continuing over the summer break. The food strategy proposes making a long-term commitment to feeding more families over the summer holidays, by making another 1.1 million children in England eligible for the ""holiday activity and food programme"", at a cost of Â£200m per year. Paul Whiteman, leader of the Nation Association of Head Teachers, said there were already too many children who ""arrive at school hungry and unable to learn"". ""Free school meals at least guarantee that children going hungry at home get one nutritious meal a day,"" he said. There are serious consequences from a poor diet, says the review, with one in seven deaths in the UK attributable to poor diets. ""A nutritionally poor-quality diet is the leading risk factor for ill-health in the UK, yet we do not treat it with the same seriousness afforded to other risk factors. FEELING LOST?:How to start thinking about the future 'HOMELESS HOTEL':Lockdown life inside emergency accommodation ""That has to change,"" said Susan Jebb, Oxford University professor of diet and population health, who worked on the report. ""This report reinforces the urgent need for action on the two biggest food challenges facing Britain: the growing scandal of food poverty and the need to prevent British farmers being undercut in new trade deals,"" said Luke Pollard, Labour's shadow environment secretary. This is the first part of the review, with the second part next year expected to focus on environmental issues, such as climate change, pollution, sustainable farming and the spread of diseases. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the food industry had ""worked round the clock"" to keep supplies going through the Covid-19 lockdown. ""But we know there is more to do and we will carefully consider this independent report and its recommendations as we emerge from the pandemic and build a stronger food system for the future,"" said Mr Eustice.

Heathrow calls for coronavirus tests at UK airports,"This video can not be played Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye: ""More work needs to be done, we need to test and learn"" Leading travel and airline industry figures have urged the prime minister to replace blanket quarantine measures with regional travel corridors. In a letter to Boris Johnson, they said the 14-day quarantine for people coming from Spain had caused disruption. It was ""the latest significant blow to a sector which now risks being permanently scarred"", they added. They called for quarantine-free travel to areas unaffected by any spike in coronavirus cases. This would include not just Spain, but other key markets for trade and tourism, such as the US and Canada. ""We are in a situation where the government is advising against travel to areas of Spain that have lower rates of Covid than the UK,"" the letter said. ""We urgently request a meeting with you to discuss the challenge facing our sector and our proposed ways forward,"" the letter concluded. Among the nearly 50 signatories of the letter were British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz, Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye and Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade. Travel industry chiefs are seeking ways to rescue the holiday season. Their intervention came after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC that coronavirus testing at airports was not a ""silver bullet"" to stop the need for quarantine, because the virus could develop over time. The government's sudden change to travel advice for Spain at the weekend prompted a fresh wave of confusion and uncertainty to people's holiday plans. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps returned home early from his own Spanish holiday on Wednesday and will now begin two weeks' quarantine, buthe defended the government's decision. ""We had to act when we did. The figures since have shown why that was required. I'm desperately sad and sorry for people who have lost their holidays,"" he said. Travel firm Tui said on Wednesday it had cancelled holidays to the Balearics and Canary Islands until 4 August after the UK extended its advice against non-essential travel to Spain to include its islands. Coronavirus: Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? Mr Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme the confusion caused by the changes to guidance over Spain showed the need for an alternative. He said airports should be allowed to test for coronavirus to avoid the ""cliff-edge"" of quarantine. Heathrow's financial results, out on Wednesday, showed passengers all but stopped travel in the three months to June, falling by 96% on a year ago as global aviation came to a virtual standstill. Revenue was 85% lower than last year at Â£119m. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""Today's results should serve as a clarion call for the government - the UK needs a passenger testing regime and fast. Without it, Britain is just playing a game of quarantine roulette."" He said he wanted the government to work with the company on the plan and he could have testing sites set and ready ""within weeks"". But Mr Dowden quashed the idea, saying: ""We are not at the point where there is a viable alternative to the 14-day quarantine."" However, he added that all options were under review. Coronavirus testing is available at some German airports Other countries are operating airport testing. It is voluntary - and free - at some German airports now although it may become mandatory, as it is in France for arrivals from high-risk countries such as the US and Brazil. The Netherlands approach is to single out people coming from specific areas with high levels of infections - such as a few named regions in Spain and the UK city of Leicester and urge them to self-isolate. Dr Hans Kluge, Europe regional director for the World Health Organization, endorsed testing at airports as part of general attempts to track the movement of coronavirus. He told the Today programme: ""Testing is never wrong - whether at airports, community or drive-in centres - what's the difference between day-to-day life and travelling?"" Mr Holland-Kaye said a UK airport test would cost about Â£150 each, and passengers would be expected to pay. He acknowledged that was ""not cheap"", but that the test would come down over time as more people took it. The idea of introducing testing at airports is an attractive idea. The theory being people could travel where they like and just get tested as they arrive back in the country, negating the need to self-isolate. But the government is not convinced. Why? Logistically testing all the travellers who arrive every week will be difficult. Testing capacity has increased but this would stretch the system. Not to mention the practical difficulties of setting up testing facilities in busy airports. But the other factor, which is perhaps more crucial, is that in the early stages of infection the test may not even pick it up. Instead, officials are much more persuaded by a more intelligent, targeted approach to self-isolation. That would involve asking only those coming from certain regions in a country where the infection rates are highest to self-isolate. That could then be complemented by then asking them to get tested after a week, meaning if they test negative, there would be no need for the full 14-day self-isolation. All this and more is being discussed behind the scenes. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""The aim would be to have a test on arrival. We could have it up and running in the next two weeks."" He said the plan would be for passengers to go into quarantine and have another test after eight days: ""If they were infected we would be confident that it had shown itself.  If it was clear, they would be allowed to go out of quarantine earlier than had been the case. It's very scientifically based."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

The government is said to be considering an eight-day stretch between tests.

Double virus tests 'could cut quarantine time',"People entering the UK from at-risk countries who test negative for coronavirus twice within several days might be allowed to leave quarantine early. The UK government is close to giving its backing to a trial, according to travel industry sources. Under current rules, those arriving in the UK from certain countries must self-isolate for 14 days. The Department for Transport (DfT) declined to comment. Details of the new programme are said to be still being worked out, but one key area of debate is the number of days required between tests. The government has indicated that it is keeping all quarantine measures under review. It is said to be considering an eight-day stretch between tests, whereas figures within the travel sector are keen for a five-day period. The number of days required between each test is critical in reducing the possibility of ""false negative"" results. A false negative result is possible if someone who has recently contracted Covid-19 is not showing symptoms. France is about to launch a compulsory two-test regime for people arriving from 16 at-risk countries, including the United States. The BBC understands that there are two broad options being considered. The first would involve someone having a first test several days before they travelled to the UK, with the second test happening the day before they arrive. However, this might mean that in some cases people would need to be tested abroad. That option could mean that people would avoid quarantine altogether. The second possibility is that people would be tested on arrival in the UK, possibly at the airport, and then be required to have a second test several days later. In the period between the two tests, the person would have to self-isolate at home in line with government rules. Airlines push for virus testing to save holiday season Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? What are the UK's travel rules and which countries can you visit? Another question mark remains over how the trial will be funded. Travel consultant Paul Charles believes that airports will have to foot part of the bill. ""The onus is on UK airports to invest, as restaurants and bars have done, in the measures which enable the economy to get going,"" he said. Like other figures in the travel industry, Mr Charles is frustrated by the fact that the government has still not given its backing to testing as a way of people avoiding the travel quarantine. ""Substantial investment in testing is the only solution to enable safer travel, keep corridors open to other countries and remove the disruptive need for everyone to self-isolate for 14 days."" John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, told BBC News ""the jury was still out"" on having one single coronavirus test on arrival. ""Not enough work has been done on that and it may be that we need another test after five or eight days to get people out of quarantine early. ""As the UK's hub airport, I want to work with the government on some of these things - to try to find a balance to keep people safe but also to get the economy moving again and save as many jobs as possible."" The test that would be used is the same Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-type test used by the NHS, and can cost about Â£150 each time. Any trial of the double-testing scheme would likely initially be focused on one or two specific routes. The BBC has been told that any trial would not initially be focused on people arriving from European destinations. The aviation sector has been in discussions with Public Health England about how the testing could work. If the scheme goes ahead, it is not expected to be implemented for several weeks. Collinson and Swissport are the two firms spearheading the work on the trials in the UK. Collinson chief executive David Evans said of the potential roll-out: ""I would hope that the government would move and flex on their policy - I think they've got to have an armoury of tools at their disposal to do this. ""As soon as they do that, we should get this rolled out in the next couple of weeks."" Why is the UK bringing in travel testing?

Junk food deals to be targeted,"""Buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food will be banned as part of the government's bid to tackle obesity in England. The plan,externalalso includes restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus. A ban on junk food adverts before 21:00has been confirmed - for the whole UK. Boris Johnson said the plans would help ""reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus"". The prime minister has unveiled the strategy amid growing evidence of a link between obesity and an increased risk from Covid-19. Government statistics showed nearly 8% of critically ill patients in intensive care units with the virus have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population. How bad is our obesity problem? GPs to prescribe cycling in new obesity strategy Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say Has Covid-19 exposed UK's underlying ill health? The other measures being taken are: A national campaign to help people lose weight and eat more healthily after the ""wake-up call"" of coronavirus A consultation on whether to stop fast food adverts online altogether A review of traffic light labelling on food and drinks sold in shops A consultation on making calories labelling on alcohol drinks mandatory Greater incentives for GPs to tackle excess weight, including the use of apps and exercise-on-referral Labelling of calories on menus will apply to any restaurant, cafe or takeaway chain with more than 250 employees, and another new consultation will be launched around plans to provide the same information for alcoholic drinks. The move marks a change in stance by the prime minister, who has previously criticised levies on foods high in salt, fat and sugar - and described his views on tackling obesity as ""libertarian"". This video can not be played Former Labour MP Tom Watson who lost 8 stone, pictured here after and before But Mr Johnson's experience in intensive care during his treatment for Covid-19 is thought to have contributed to his changing position. Writing in the Daily Express, he said: ""We all put things off - I know I have. I've wanted to lose weight for ages and, like many people, I struggle with my weight. ""I go up and down, but during the whole coronavirus epidemic and when I got it too, I realised how important it is not to be overweight."" If implemented this will mean radical changes to the way food is marketed. Most of the proposals were first set out in a policy paper in 2018 and put out to consultation before getting stalled. The key is how businesses react this time, having previously been against the measures. The Food and Drink Federation has again given a hostile response. But what about advertisers whose freedom to promote some food products will be severely limited? A doyen of the industry Sir John Hegarty has come out in favour of a ban on TV ads of unhealthy food before the 9pm watershed. He said there was a growing health crisis. Much of the drinks industry has already accepted the need for calorie labelling. Just as Boris Johnson and other Conservative politicians have moved from a libertarian non-interventionist approach to a call for action on obesity, the business lobby could be shifting as well. This video can not be played The people tackling obesity during lockdown Sue Eustace, director of public affairs at the Advertising Association, said the ""extreme"" and ""unnecessary"" measures would have little effect in reducing obesity, and warned they could have ""wide-ranging ramifications"" for food businesses and online publishers trying to financially recover from the pandemic and the lockdown. ""We have some of the strictest [advertising] rules in the world already and children's exposure to high fat, salt, and sugar adverts on TV has fallen by 70% over the last 15 years or so, but there's been no change to obesity, so we don't think these measures are going to work."" She warned that the measures could affect  a ""whole range"" of household products that people do not necessarily view as junk food, and questioned whether this would restrict businesses like local fish and chip shops from putting their menus online for customers. A calorie is defined as the amount of energy it takes to heat 1g of water by 1 degree Celsius. The calories listed on food products are actually kilocalories (1,000 calories or kcals) - the energy needed to heat 1kg of water by 1 degree Celsius. The calorie content of a food can be found by burning it and measuring how much heat is released. Foods such as fruits and vegetables have fewer calories than, for instance, cakes or biscuits, which have a high fat or sugar content. Fat contains 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram Alcohol contains 7 kcal (29 kJ) per gram Protein contains 4 kcal (17 kJ) per gram Carbohydrate contains 3.75 kcal (16 kJ) per gram (for the purposes of food labelling this is rounded up to 4 kcal per gram) If we consume more calories than we burn up through everyday activity or exercise, we put on weight. Knowing how many calories are in the products we eat can help us keep track. Source:BNF,external But, writing in The Daily Telegraph, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This deadly virus has given us a wake-up call about the need to tackle the stark inequalities in our nation's health, and obesity is an urgent example of this. ""If everyone who is overweight lost five pounds it could save the NHS more than Â£100 million over the next five years. And, more importantly, given the link between obesity and coronavirus, losing weight could be life-saving. ""Obesity is one of the greatest long-term health challenges that we face as a country."" Health experts have welcomed the moves, but some said the government should go even further, while others questioned whether the Treasury's 'Eat Out to Help Out' initiative - granting everyone 50% off meals in restaurants, including fast food outlets, throughout August - would undermine the effort to get people to lose weight. Adam Briggs, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said the strategy was ""likely to be a missed opportunity"". He said there were multiple factors that contributed to obesity, adding that it was important to also address the role of economic and social factors, like poverty and unemployment which ""drive poor health and inequalities"". He also pointed out that public health budgets held by councils had been cut over the years. The NHS says most adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 to 39.9 are classed as obese. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's mass in kilograms by the square of their height in metres. Check your BMI using the BBC calculator Another measure of excess fat is waist size - men with a waist of 94cm or more and women with a waist of 80cm or more are more likely to develop obesity-related problems. This video can not be played Campaigner Tasha is on a mission to make it easier for young people to have healthier diet choices Professor Dame Parveen Kumar, chairwoman of the British Medical Association's Board of Science, said: ""The BMA has long been calling for new ways to tackle obesity and we are delighted to see that the government has sat up and listened. ""What we need now is for this strategy to be actioned as quickly as possible, with the promised expansion of NHS services delivered in full, with adequate resources and funding, to ensure that those struggling with their weight can get the support they need and deserve.""

Prince William: Football more important now I'm a dad,"This video can not be played Prince William takes a curry delivery for Peter Crouch The guest on this week's That Peter Crouch Podcast is none other than Prince William. As president of the Football Association, the Duke of Cambridge has been keen to use his role to start conversations around mental health, including helping to rename the 2020 FA Cup final theHeads Up FA Cup final. ""We're hoping that renaming it is a big enough statement that the UK will show the world, and the football world in particular, that mental health really matters,"" William - making his first appearance on a podcast - tells Crouch. The podcast team met William at Kensington Palace before lockdown - and even shared a curry - before a follow-up Zoom call this month. Here are the highlights: Download the full episode here Prince William says he finds it very important to talk to people about football Asked if football is his ""release"", William replies: ""It is now. Since becoming a dad, without a doubt, football has become way more important than it used to be. ""I need to go and be amongst other guys and let out some steam, shout a bit,"" he explains, joking he stops short of abusing the referee. ""I'm the president of the FA and I can't do that!"" William adds: ""It has become a lot more relevant to me and I need it. Talking about football helps a lot."" Later in the podcast, he says: ""This period of time has allowed us to all revalue things. The thing about lockdown is that it has been a little bit of an awakening that we maybe take our lives a bit for granted sometimes and there's a lot of things out there that can wobble all of us at any time. ""I think particularly now, as a parent, it starts to make you look a bit more to the future at what kind of world we are going to hand over to the next generation. There's been a lot of time to think - and you can also have too much time to think, and that's also what worries me."" William says he really missed football during its hiatus. ""I was trying to pretend I didn't care too much it wasn't around,"" he says. ""But by the end of the third weekend, I was really missing it. It just goes with the weekend."" And he's all for having crowd noise in empty stadiums. ""It's better than hearing the players puffing and swearing at each other,"" he says. What are among the things a royal worries about during lockdown? Home-schooling and keeping young kids entertained, apparently. ""I found it pretty testing, trying to keep the children engaged and interested in some sort of work,"" he says. ""It's been an interesting few months. ""I've learned my patience is a lot shorter than I thought it was! That's probably the biggest eye-opener for me, and my wife has super patience."" He goes on to admit he's struggled with year two maths. Comforting. This video can not be played Prince William is asked whether his son Prince George could be a professional footballer. Prince William is famously a Villa fan. He says he fell in love during his first trip to an FA Cup game - Villa against Bolton - when he was 11. ""I sat there among all the Villa fans and I loved it. I thought the atmosphere was great,"" he recalls. He says at the time he ""desperately"" didn't want to support ""someone like Manchester United or Chelsea"" - like everyone else at school did. He was also attracted to Villa's proud history - William was born in 1982, when they, as English champions, won the European Cup. ""I felt a real connection with the club,"" he says. ""I felt Villa was a very proud Midlands club and it felt very special. ""Only in the last few years have I got a grip of Villa as my real team and I watch them a lot and I get into the stats."" After being put on the spot, William says he's the only person in his team who wears shin pads. There is a good reason. ""In school, I basically got targeted the whole time,"" says William, who says he usually plays at right-back. Apparently, aged 15, he once asked a police officer with him to use a laser pen and 'red dot' one of the opposition players. ""I kept saying to him, 'see, he's following you',"" William laughed: ""It put him off for about 10 minutes!"" When Crouch and the team ask William if - in his role as president of the FA - he might get rid of Gareth Southgate were England to have a bad run of games, he concedes that ""that might be a bit difficult!"". ""Gareth is a legend, I really like Gareth and I think he's doing a great job with the England team,"" he says. ""That's not to say that conversations haven't been had where I give him a little nudge and say: 'Why isn't Grealish in the England squad?'"" he jokes. ""That would be the end of my life - you'd never see me on a balcony again,"" he says. ""I'd be locked in."" William tells a great story about watching Blackpool, then managed by Ian Holloway, on a stag do with friends from the Royal Air Force. Apparently the manager came to meet the group at half-time, which William says surprised him - given he should probably have been delivering his team talk at that point. ""He was just like, 'there's no point doing a team talk, they're not listening anyway',"" William says. When the team talked about bad presents they had given their wives, William admitted he once bought the Duchess of Cambridge a pair binoculars, despite her not being a keen birdwatcher. ""That was early on in the courtship. I think that sealed the deal,"" he jokes. ""I even tried convincing myself by saying: 'These are amazing, look how far you can see.'"" Asked about Kate's reaction to the gift, he said: ""Kate opened them and said: 'But they're binoculars, what's going on?''"" ""They deliberately keep me away from that. When Liverpool won that amazing Champions League semi-final against Barcelona [in May 2019], I grabbed hold of the Twitter thing and just posted. ""It was an amazing match, I was blown away by it. It was one of the best games of football I've ever seen. I got completely out of control. I was like: 'Tweet that! Get it out!' ""And nearly every Villa match we've won  - which isn't many this season - I've been trying to get hold of it, but they keep it away from me now."" ""I've met a lot of players. It's very interesting, how different sports and different teams behave in a changing room,"" William says. ""Whenever I go into the England dressing room there does always feel a lot more pressure. I don't know what it is, but you do notice guys find it much more difficult to relax. ""We talk about physical fitness. We never really talk about mental fitness. We all need to stay mentally fit, none more so than professional athletes who - under special circumstances playing for England under huge pressure - have got to have their heads razor sharp as well as their feet and legs."" This video can not be played ""People talk about physical fitness, we never really talk about mental fitness"" And the answer to the question you never realised that you had always wanted to know. It would be Queen, wouldn't it? ""It's one of the few songs I know all the lyrics to,"" he explains.

Covid studies to examine virus link with ethnicityThe government is to plough millions into research into why ethnic minorities are at increased risk.,"A large proportion of NHS doctors are from an ethnic minority background UK scientists are to receive millions of pounds of government funding for a raft of studies to learn why people from an ethnic minority background are at greater risk from Covid-19. Six projects will analyse data on social circumstances, health and day-to-day activities, as well as investigating genetic risk factors. One will follow 30,000 health and social-care staff for a year. Researchers say there will be rapid action based on the findings. Prof Kamlesh Khunti, director of the Centre for BME Health at the University of Leicester, who is involved in three of the studies, told BBC News he expected results to be translated into guidance that would help save black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) lives within months. ""We will definitely get answers to the things that are putting people at much higher risk,"" he said. ""As soon as we get results that might make a difference, it is important that we get them out straight away."" The results will also be shared with the leaders of black and South Asian communities, professional bodies and health regulators who will take rapid action, said Prof Khunti.

"Fears over 'zombie companies' as UK exits lockdownInsolvencies slow during lockdown, but experts say the worst is yet to come.","Those working in the events industry face an uncertain future A wave of ""zombie companies"" kept afloat during lockdown are on a cliff-edge going into the autumn, experts say. Analysis by the BBC shows a surge of firms went bust in March, then the rate slowed in the first few months of lockdown amid a Â£160bn support package. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says many firms have piled on debts and will struggle. The government said it would ""adjust support"" as the economy reopens. So-called zombie companies are businesses that function day-to-day, but cannot pay off the full debt they owe or find cash to invest and grow. Julie Palmer, a partner at the financial consultants Begbies Traynor, said: ""This crisis will force many zombie companies out of business. ""While these were clinging on to survival prior to the pandemic, many will now have become simply unviable due to high levels of debts and poor sales."" Stuart Adam, from the IFS, said: ""Many firms have been tided over during the period of hibernation partly through loans and tax deferrals, but those mean piling up debts that will make it harder for them to carry on in the longer term."" The BBC Shared Data Unit looked at how many companies had posted insolvency notices in the London Gazette, the official paper of record for public notices.  A company is insolvent when it can't pay its debts. Our investigation found there was a spike of 4,200 insolvencies in March as the UK headed into lockdown. The rate of insolvencies slowed over the next three months, with a further 5,000 businesses insolvent - a drop of 23% compared to the same period last year. What does it mean to declare insolvency? UK 'faces explosive debt levels' The economic impact of Covid-19 As well as government support, it is thought changes to insolvency law and reduced court services have contributed to the slowdown. Firms in the information and communication sector saw the largest increase in insolvencies. Richard Millward's events business Relevent Ltd has 'ongoing costs' Business ownerRichard Millwardis working as a driver for a supermarket while he watches his long-standing firm run out of cash. For 30 years, he has worked in the events industry, putting on large-scale gatherings such as the London Marathon. He is currently working as a driver for Waitrose, with no prospect of events income until at least April next year. His business has benefitted from the furlough scheme and a business rate relief grant - part of billions of pounds in government support and legal changes to help firms cope with Covid-19's impact. But his company of 17 years has ongoing costs and Richard is facing the choice of holding on, or closing it down before it runs out of money. He knows of several companies that have gone into administration or already closed down. ""It's sad and also quite worrying,"" he said. ""We're going to lose an awful lot of the skill, the talent pool that we have. I think a lot of people are just trying to hang on for as long as possible."" In separate research, financial consultants Begbies Traynor said527,000 businesses were in ""significant financial distress"",externalat the end of June. Ric Traynor, its executive chairman, said businesses would have to deal with a ""toxic mix"" of reduced sales and increased debt. He said: ""Many of the support measures will have simply delayed the inevitable, with the can being firmly kicked down the road."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break? The IFS's Stuart Adam said: ""I think pretty much everyone agrees a perfect recovery is not realistic, it's going to be bad."" But he said investment in new businesses was key to recovery. ""Getting new businesses starting up and hiring people is exactly the kind of thing that needs to happen over the coming year or two,"" he added. Shahid Hussain has set up food delivery business 'Wraps, Pittas and Buns' While many companies are struggling, some people have been using the lockdown to launch new business ventures with more than 170,000 new firms registered from April to June. Sectors leading a bounce-back were online retail, real estate, construction and takeaway food. One of those new start-ups is run byShahid Hussain, from Essex, whose food delivery business now has eight branches. ""People said we were crazy to be setting up a business during Covid when everyone was going into lockdown. ""What we realised was that Covid was going to fundamentally change the way we eat. People wanted fast delivery food, but restaurant quality. ""It's going really well. The delivery market was picking up even before Covid; it just accelerated it. We definitely launched at the right time. It's going so well, we have got plans to open two or three outlets in the next week or so."" NurseTom Parkinson, 25, is hoping to register his baking business soon, making sourdough bread from home alongside his NHS work. He said: ""I think there's going to be a revival, I think more people are into food that's come from a local producer and done with a bit of love and care, I think there's a market for it."" The government said its job retention scheme had protected more than nine million jobs and the next stage of support included a 15% VAT cut for some businesses, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme Bonus, and investment in greener buildings and homes. A spokesman said: ""As the economy reopens, we will continue to look at how to adjust our support in a way that ensures people can get back to work, protecting both the UK economy and the livelihoods of people across the country.""

"UK signs deal for 60 million virus vaccine dosesThe government signs a fourth deal, securing doses of a treatment being developed by GSK and Sanofi.","The UK government has signed a fourth coronavirus vaccine deal, securing up to 60 million doses of an experimental treatment being developed by drug giants GSK and Sanofi. The government has already signed up for 100 million doses ofthe Oxford University vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca. It has also secured another 90 million doses oftwo other promising vaccines. However, it is still uncertain which, if any, of the vaccines may work. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and a number of pharmaceutical firms are in a race to develop and test potential drugs. Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? The vaccine involved in the latest government deal, developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK, is based on the recombinant protein-based technology used by Sanofi to produce a flu vaccine, as well as GSK's established pandemic technology. Sanofi, which is leading the clinical development, said regulatory approval could be achieved by the first half of 2021 if trials were successful. In the meantime, Sanofi and GSK are scaling up manufacturing to produce up to one billion doses a year overall. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? The vaccine has already been at the centre of an international political storm after Sanofi rowed back on an apparent promise to prioritise the US market. Sanofi chief executive Paul Hudson sparked a row in May by saying the US government had ""the right to the largest pre-order because it's invested in taking the risk"". But he changed his view after thenFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe respondedby saying access for all was ""non-negotiable"".

Trump sticks by discredited coronavirus treatmentThe president said the drug is only rejected as a Covid-19 treatment because he suggested it.,"This video can not be played US President Trump on Dr Fauci's approval rating: ""Nobody likes me"" US President Donald Trump has again defended the use of hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, contradicting his own public health officials. He said the malaria medication was only rejected as a Covid-19 treatment because he had recommended its use. His remarks come after Twitter banned his eldest son for posting a clip promoting hydroxychloroquine. There is no evidence the drug can fight the virus, and regulators warn it may cause heart problems. On Wednesday Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, told the BBC that hydroxychloroquine was not effective against the virus. ""We know that every single good study - and by good study I mean randomised control study in which the data are firm and believable - has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of Covid-19,"" he said. Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cautioned against using the drug to treat coronavirus patients,external, following reports of ""serious heart rhythm problems"" and other health issues. The FDA also revoked its emergency-use authorisation for the drug to treat Covid-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) says ""there is currently no proof"" that it is effective as a treatment or prevents Covid-19. In other developments: Coronavirus deaths in the US reached 149,250, according to Johns Hopkins University, as states in the south and west, including Florida and California, reported record daily death tolls. But Mr Trump claimed that large parts of the US were ""corona-free"" The US biotech company Moderna said its experimental coronavirus vaccine had induced a strong immune response in a study on monkeys. It said the vaccine protected against infection in the lungs and nose, and prevented lung disease Better known for making cameras,Kodak has moved into drug making and has just secured a $765m (Â£592m) loan from the US government.The fallen giant of the photography industry will make ingredients used in generic drugs to help fight the virus Studies commissioned by the WHO, the US National Institutes of Health and other researchers around the world have found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine - when used with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, as repeatedly recommended by President Trump - helps treat coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine was first touted by Mr Trump in March. Two months later he surprised journalists by saying he had begun taking the unproven medication to ward off the virus. Why a video promoted by Trump was pulled on social media Madonna's Instagram flagged over conspiracy video The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' What do we know about hydroxychloroquine? On Tuesday the president told reporters at the White House: ""I can only say that from my standpoint, and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. ""I don't think you lose anything by doing it, other than politically it doesn't seem too popular."" He added: ""When I recommend something, they like to say 'don't use it'."" The comments were made as he prepared to visit Odessa, Texas for a fundraising event on Wednesday, despite concerns over surges of Covid-19 cases in the state. Joe Biden, Mr Trump's presumptive rival in the November general election, criticised the trip. ""Texas families are suffering. They're suffering because President Trump's inability to lead this country and combat the spread of Covid-19,"" Mr Biden said. President Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr were among social media users who shared video late on Monday of a group called America's Frontline Doctors advocating hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment. Facebook and Twitter removed the content, flagging it as misinformation, but not before more than 17 million people had seen one of the clips. Twitter also banned the US president's eldest son from tweeting for 12 hours as a penalty for sharing the clip. In the past, Twitter has declined to remove tweets by President Trump himself and other world leaders, citing public interest and newsworthiness. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The video in question showed doctors speaking outside the US Supreme Court building at an event organised by Tea Party Patriots Action, a group that has helped fund a pro-Trump political action committee. In the video, Dr Stella Immanuel, a doctor from Houston, says she has successfully treated 350 coronavirus patients ""and counting"" with hydroxychloroquine. The president said on Tuesday: ""I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it."" This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus According to the Daily Beast,external, Dr Immanuel has previously claimed the government is run by ""reptilians"" and that scientists are developing a vaccine to stop people being religious, among other bizarre views. America's Frontline Doctors' founder Simone Gold accused social media companies of censorship for removing the hydroxychloroquine video. ""Treatment options for COVID-19 should be debated, and spoken about among our colleagues in the medical field,"" she tweeted. ""They should never, however, be censored and silenced."" This video can not be played 'We already lost prom and graduation...' Late on Monday, Mr Trump also retweeted several tweets critical of Dr Fauci. But in Tuesday's briefing the president denied he was criticising the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, insisting: ""I get along with him very well."" Asked about hydroxychloroquine earlier on Tuesday, Dr Fauci said the medication was not an appropriate treatment for Covid-19. This video can not be played Why the US struggled with its reopening He told ABC News' morning show that the drug was ""not effective in coronavirus disease"".

Asylum seeker 'went without food' in lockdown,"Khadija had to flee violence in her home country - but says the worst period of her life has been in Wales A former United Nations worker seeking asylum in Wales says she went without food for a week during lockdown. The woman, who does not want to be identified due to threats in her home country, did not eat so she could afford to feed her children. Asylum seekers receive Â£37.75 a week plus Â£5 for a baby under one, and Â£3 for a child aged between one and three. The Home Office said it has taken ""decisive action"" to look after asylum seekers during the pandemic. The woman, who wishes to be referred to as Khadija, said she was appalled by what asylum seekers - particularly women with children - had to endure during lockdown and said the pandemic has revealed how little support they receive. Despite having to flee violence in her home country, Khadija said her time in Wales during lockdown has been ""the worst period of my life"". She said she found it difficult to contact the NHS when she had coronavirus symptoms due to a lack of information about who to contact, and said asylum seekers in Wales have been ""forgotten about"" during the pandemic. ""For almost two months nobody even bothered to call us,"" she said. ""I couldn't call anybody because I didn't have any mobile credit. ""All the asylum seekers I know were really forgotten, nobody contacted them, nobody asked them if they needed anything, or if they had the symptoms, or if their symptoms had worsened. ""We didn't have much food stock - I was just trying to survive."" She said she received no information from the Home Office, which has responsibility for asylum seekers. 'The execution order came for my mum' 'I thought I would die under that lorry' How have young people found living in lockdown? Khadija, who is now receiving the support she needs, said her situation was worsened by inflated prices during lockdown, particularly in local shops. She said lockdown has ""destroyed"" her ""mentally and physically"" and she lost weight going without food to make sure her children could eat. Sisters not Strangers, a coalition of charities which supports asylum seekers, published a report which found women have been exploited, forced to do unpaid work for shelter or enter into abusive relationships to access food and accommodation. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health Jessica Baker, a family and asylum officer and spokeswoman for Sisters not Strangers, said it was ""totally unacceptable"" for people to go hungry in Wales and said asylum seekers had been ""overlooked"". The organisation is calling for reform so asylum seekers have the same access to housing, healthcare, education and employment as everyone else - and an increase in the allowance they receive. Ms Baker said: ""I think the amount of money that's given per individual or family is just not enough to maintain a family, especially during this time - when places that families or women would usually rely on, such as food banks, charity shops for clothing, [are shut]. Jessica Baker says much of the support network previously relied on has been closed ""When all that shuts down and your children are growing or you need food to sustain a healthy lifestyle, I think that's really difficult when those support systems were really relied on heavily before."" BBC Wales has already reported howsupport for asylum seekers was ""scaled back"" during lockdown. The Home Office said it has been providing accommodation and essential living costs to those who would otherwise have been unable to support themselves. It said the weekly cash allowance is reviewed each year and recently had an above inflation increase. The Welsh Government said while asylum accommodation remains the responsibility of the Home Office, it had continued to support seekers during the pandemic. It said it provided a Â£10m fund for local authorities for emergency accommodation, legal advice to those refused asylum, access to emergency supplies, free school meals and translation of Covid-19 guidelines.

More free school meals 'would stop diet disaster',"Is the food industry encouraging people towards unhealthy eating habits? Free school meals should be extended to another 1.5 million children in England, says a government-commissioned review into food and healthy eating. The National Food Strategy warns that England's eating habits are a ""slow-motion disaster"". The review,externalwarns of the toxic connection between child poverty, poor diet and hunger. And it warns of ""wilfully misleading"" packaging which can give a false impression that foods are healthy. The food industry is accused of ""clothing itself, and its products, in false virtue"" - with the report highlighting the packaging for Percy Pig sweets sold in Marks & Spencer. The report says these sweets are promoted with the claim they have ""no artificial colours or artificial flavourings"" and to be ""soft gums made with fruit juice"". Have government anti-obesity plans ever made any difference? Offers on unhealthy food encourage obesity Marcus Rashford gets result in U-turn over free school meals Who gets free school meals? But it asks how any parents check to see that the ""three largest ingredients by weight are glucose syrup, sugar and glucose-fructose-syrup"". Report author, Henry Dimbleby, said he was singling out Marks & Spencer ""not because it is the biggest sinner"" but because it is a ""well-trusted company"" which pledges to ""always strive to do the right thing"". The review proposes widening access to free school meals and food for families during the summer holidays In response, a spokesman for Marks & Spencer said: ""All our products have clear labelling so that customers can make informed choices about what they buy"" - and that there was a ""range of Percy Pigs with one third less sugar"". The food review from Mr Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain, takes issue with the language used to sell food. Email us atHaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp us at +44 7756 165803 Tweet us@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Phrases such as ""low fat"" might mean ""high starch"" and labels such as ""'free from' and 'less' are sprinkled around without context,"" says the report, which ""if not quite lies, are at least wilfully misleading"". Mr Dimbleby said some snacks might be ""clothed in a veneer of goodness and might not be better for you than a Mars bar"". Footballer Marcus Rashford campaigned for school meals to continue through the summer holiday The negative impacts of unhealthy eating or going hungry are long-lasting and corrosive, says the review, which is claimed as the most significant in England for decades. ""One of the miserable legacies of Covid-19 is likely to be a dramatic increase in unemployment and poverty and therefore hunger,"" says the food strategy report. As an immediate intervention, the review calls for many more children to be eligible for a free meal at school, as ""only 1% of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards of a school meal"". The review says they should be available to a further 1.5 million children, in addition to the 1.3 million already eligible - so almost one in three children would get free meals. The extension of free school meals, at a cost of Â£670m per year, would expand eligibility to all children in households where the parent or guardian is claiming universal credit or equivalent benefits. Such a move would aim to stop pupils being hungry at school and prevent the negative consequences for learning and behaviour. Footballer Marcus Rashford recently raised the profile of the importance of school meals during the summer holidays for families who are struggling financially,forcing a U-turn which will see vouchers continuing over the summer break. The food strategy proposes making a long-term commitment to feeding more families over the summer holidays, by making another 1.1 million children in England eligible for the ""holiday activity and food programme"", at a cost of Â£200m per year. Paul Whiteman, leader of the Nation Association of Head Teachers, said there were already too many children who ""arrive at school hungry and unable to learn"". ""Free school meals at least guarantee that children going hungry at home get one nutritious meal a day,"" he said. There are serious consequences from a poor diet, says the review, with one in seven deaths in the UK attributable to poor diets. ""A nutritionally poor-quality diet is the leading risk factor for ill-health in the UK, yet we do not treat it with the same seriousness afforded to other risk factors. FEELING LOST?:How to start thinking about the future 'HOMELESS HOTEL':Lockdown life inside emergency accommodation ""That has to change,"" said Susan Jebb, Oxford University professor of diet and population health, who worked on the report. ""This report reinforces the urgent need for action on the two biggest food challenges facing Britain: the growing scandal of food poverty and the need to prevent British farmers being undercut in new trade deals,"" said Luke Pollard, Labour's shadow environment secretary. This is the first part of the review, with the second part next year expected to focus on environmental issues, such as climate change, pollution, sustainable farming and the spread of diseases. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the food industry had ""worked round the clock"" to keep supplies going through the Covid-19 lockdown. ""But we know there is more to do and we will carefully consider this independent report and its recommendations as we emerge from the pandemic and build a stronger food system for the future,"" said Mr Eustice.

Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus?,"A large proportion of NHS doctors are from an ethnic minority background Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are ""disproportionately"" dying with coronavirus. A number of reviews, including by the Office for National Statistics and Public Health England, have now concluded that this is the case. Suggested reasons have included existing health inequalities, housing conditions, public-facing occupations and structural racism. There were at least 3,876 deaths of black and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals in hospitals in England up to 9 June. This means that, where ethnicity is known, BAME people represented 15.5% of all deaths to this point. The 2011 census - the most accurate source -showed that 14.5% of the English population,externalwere from BAME backgrounds.  But clearly the proportion may have grown since then. Virus 'has disproportionate impact on BAME groups' Coronavirus cases to be tracked by ethnicity In 2016,the Office for National Statistics estimated,externalthat it could have increased to 15.4% of the population. Similar breakdowns by ethnicity for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not currently available. These numbers do not show a great disproportionality in BAME deaths, but once we account for demographics - such as age and location - a different story is told. Some of the highest death and hospitalisation rates during the outbreak have been in London, where 40% of the population are from ethnic minority backgrounds (according to the 2011 census). But even when you adjust for where the coronavirus outbreak has hit hardest, the Office for National Statistics, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank and Public Health England all conclude that people from ethnic minorities are being disproportionately impacted. Researchfrom the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS),externalshows that if we only looked at where BAME communities were concentrated, we might expect to see higher death rates than that for white British individuals. Black African Brits face 'triple' virus death rate However, the research says that this geographical factor is counter-balanced by the factor of age. Most minority groups are much younger on average than white Britons - and therefore should be less susceptible to the virus. The IFS concludes that, if we look at both geography and age combined, the death rate should be lower for most ethnicities than for white people. It estimates that the deaths of black Africans are 3.7 times higher than might be expected by geography and age, 2.9 times higher for Pakistanis and 1.8 for black Caribbean people (who are older on average than other minority groups). Public Health England,which approached the issue in a similar way,externalby adjusting for age, found similar disparities in both the infection rate and deaths for BAME people. TheONS research goes one step further,externalthan these reviews and looks at other factors, such as health and deprivation. It concludes that: Black people are 1.9 times as likely to die as white people Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are 1.8 times as likely to die Indians are around 1.5 times as likely Analysis from Public Health England (PHE) showed that once in hospital, people from BAME backgrounds were also more likely to require admission to an intensive care unit. BAME people accounted for 11% of those hospitalised with Covid-19 but over 36% of those admitted to critical care. Separate researchhas found that South Asian people were the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital in Great Britain. The study, which looked at nearly 35,000 Covid-19 patients in 260 hospitals, said high levels of diabetes was partly to blame. Health issues, living conditions and occupation could all play a role. While there is no conclusive evidence that minority groups are more at risk from the disease, some are more likely to have certain underlying health conditions. Black people are more likely to be overweight than white people, for example, while both Asian and black populations have been found to have a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease, according to the IFS. Both of these have been linked to higher coronavirus death rates. Various factors can play into these health inequalities,according to Public Health England,external, including socio-economic situation, access to health care and deprivation in an area. It's worth noting that deprivation in general, regardless of ethnicity, appears to play a role. According to the Office of National Statistics,external, the death rate in the poorest communities in England and Wales is twice as high as the wealthiest. Issues with self-isolation in larger households could also play a factor. Just under a third of Bangladeshi households are classified as overcrowded, as are 15% of black African households, according to government statistics. Only 2% of white British households are classified as overcrowded. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Black and other ethnic minority individuals make up a large share of jobs considered essential in tackling the virus, many of which are public-facing. One in five people working for the NHS in England, for example, is from an ethnic minority background, and these numbers are even higher when we look solely at doctors and nurses. Public Health England,through engagement with members,externalof the public and experts, found that structural racism could also play a part. ""Historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work may mean that individuals in BAME groups are less likely to seek care when needed or as NHS staff are less likely to speak up when they have concerns about Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or risk,"" the report says. A recent survey of NHS staff found that 29% of BAME staff felt bullied in the past year compared with 24% of white people.

Trump sticks by revoked coronavirus treatment,"This video can not be played US President Trump on Dr Fauci's approval rating: ""Nobody likes me"" US President Donald Trump has again defended the use of hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, contradicting his own public health officials. He said the malaria medication was only rejected as a Covid-19 treatment because he had recommended its use. His remarks come after Twitter banned his eldest son for posting a clip promoting hydroxychloroquine. There is no evidence the drug can fight the virus, and regulators warn it may cause heart problems. On Wednesday Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, told the BBC that hydroxychloroquine was not effective against the virus. ""We know that every single good study - and by good study I mean randomised control study in which the data are firm and believable - has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of Covid-19,"" he said. Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cautioned against using the drug to treat coronavirus patients,external, following reports of ""serious heart rhythm problems"" and other health issues. The FDA also revoked its emergency-use authorisation for the drug to treat Covid-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) says ""there is currently no proof"" that it is effective as a treatment or prevents Covid-19. In other developments: Coronavirus deaths in the US reached 149,250, according to Johns Hopkins University, as states in the south and west, including Florida and California, reported record daily death tolls. But Mr Trump claimed that large parts of the US were ""corona-free"" The US biotech company Moderna said its experimental coronavirus vaccine had induced a strong immune response in a study on monkeys. It said the vaccine protected against infection in the lungs and nose, and prevented lung disease Better known for making cameras,Kodak has moved into drug making and has just secured a $765m (Â£592m) loan from the US government.The fallen giant of the photography industry will make ingredients used in generic drugs to help fight the virus Studies commissioned by the WHO, the US National Institutes of Health and other researchers around the world have found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine - when used with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, as repeatedly recommended by President Trump - helps treat coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine was first touted by Mr Trump in March. Two months later he surprised journalists by saying he had begun taking the unproven medication to ward off the virus. Why a video promoted by Trump was pulled on social media Madonna's Instagram flagged over conspiracy video The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' What do we know about hydroxychloroquine? On Tuesday the president told reporters at the White House: ""I can only say that from my standpoint, and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. ""I don't think you lose anything by doing it, other than politically it doesn't seem too popular."" He added: ""When I recommend something, they like to say 'don't use it'."" The comments were made as he prepared to visit Odessa, Texas for a fundraising event on Wednesday, despite concerns over surges of Covid-19 cases in the state. Joe Biden, Mr Trump's presumptive rival in the November general election, criticised the trip. ""Texas families are suffering. They're suffering because President Trump's inability to lead this country and combat the spread of Covid-19,"" Mr Biden said. President Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr were among social media users who shared video late on Monday of a group called America's Frontline Doctors advocating hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment. Facebook and Twitter removed the content, flagging it as misinformation, but not before more than 17 million people had seen one of the clips. Twitter also banned the US president's eldest son from tweeting for 12 hours as a penalty for sharing the clip. In the past, Twitter has declined to remove tweets by President Trump himself and other world leaders, citing public interest and newsworthiness. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The video in question showed doctors speaking outside the US Supreme Court building at an event organised by Tea Party Patriots Action, a group that has helped fund a pro-Trump political action committee. In the video, Dr Stella Immanuel, a doctor from Houston, says she has successfully treated 350 coronavirus patients ""and counting"" with hydroxychloroquine. The president said on Tuesday: ""I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it."" This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus According to the Daily Beast,external, Dr Immanuel has previously claimed the government is run by ""reptilians"" and that scientists are developing a vaccine to stop people being religious, among other bizarre views. America's Frontline Doctors' founder Simone Gold accused social media companies of censorship for removing the hydroxychloroquine video. ""Treatment options for COVID-19 should be debated, and spoken about among our colleagues in the medical field,"" she tweeted. ""They should never, however, be censored and silenced."" This video can not be played 'We already lost prom and graduation...' Late on Monday, Mr Trump also retweeted several tweets critical of Dr Fauci. But in Tuesday's briefing the president denied he was criticising the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, insisting: ""I get along with him very well."" Asked about hydroxychloroquine earlier on Tuesday, Dr Fauci said the medication was not an appropriate treatment for Covid-19. This video can not be played Why the US struggled with its reopening He told ABC News' morning show that the drug was ""not effective in coronavirus disease"".

Kodak pivots itself to become strategic drug maker,"Better known for making cameras, Kodak has moved into drug making and has just secured a $765m (Â£592m) loan from the US government. The fallen giant of the photography industry will make ingredients used in generic drugs to help fight the coronavirus. Announcing the loan, the US government said it wanted to reduce dependency on foreign countries for medical supplies. Shares in Kodak shot up more than 60% on Tuesday after the announcement. Will vaccine sceptics make trials a headache? Photographer handed snaps of dead wife and son Trump sticks by revoked coronavirus treatment Pharmaceutical firms are in a race to find a vaccine for the coronavirus with a handful of human trials underway. ""Kodak is proud to be a part of strengthening America's self-sufficiency in producing the key pharmaceutical ingredients we need to keep our citizens safe,"" said its executive chairman Jim Continenza. At the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals, Mr Continenza said it would take three or four years to reach large-scale production. ""If we have learned anything from the global pandemic, it is that Americans are dangerously dependent on foreign supply chains for their essential medicines,"" Peter Navarro, a White House spokesman, said. US President Donald Trump called it ""one of the most important deals in the history of US pharmaceutical industries"" referring to Kodak as ""a great American company â you remember this company"". Kodak is not the only photography firm to shift direction into drug making. Japan's Fujifilm is working on a potential Covid-19 vaccine and hopes to start human trials soon. The Eastman Kodak Company was founded by George Eastman in 1888. The Brownie box was one of its most popular cameras and helped Kodak become a dominant player in the photographic industry. The company became famous for its ""Kodak moment"" tagline but began to struggle financially in the late 1990s as consumers moved away from photographic film and towards digital photography. At its peak Kodak employed more than 145,000 people but now has a global workforce of around 5,000. In 2012, Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US and and shifted its focus onto printing and professional services for companies. But it does still make digital and instant cameras for consumers. Kodak began making drug ingredients four years ago and will now dramatically expand production at its New York and Minnesota facilities.

PM warns of Europe 'second wave' amid Spain row,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends adding Spain to the quarantine list Boris Johnson has warned there are signs of a ""second wave"" of coronavirus in Europe, as he defended a 14-day quarantine on travellers from Spain. The PM said the government had to be ""swift"" - and hinted at further action against other countries if necessary. But airline Jet2 said information from the government was ""contradictory and often comes with little or no notice"". It comes after the Spanish prime minister called the UK's decision to change the rules for Spain ""unjust"". Pedro SÃ¡nchez said tourists in most regions in Spain would be safer from coronavirus than in the UK. The UK is advising against all non-essential travel to Spain, including the Balearic and Canary Islands. It also removed Spain and its islands from the list of countries that are exempt from the 14-day quarantine rule. Mr Johnson said it was up to individuals to decide whether they wanted to take the risk of travelling during the pandemic. ""These are decisions for families, for individuals, about where they want to go,"" he said. Meanwhile, Germany hasadvised against travel to three areas of Spain. What are the UK's quarantine rules? Spain travel rules: What are my rights? Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? Oldham brings in extra virus measures Speaking during a visit to Nottinghamshire, the PM said: ""What we have to do is take swift and decisive action where we think that the risks are starting to bubble up again. ""Let's be absolutely clear about what's happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends, I'm afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic."" It came as the UK reported a further 119 coronavirus deaths - taking the official number of deaths so far to 45,878 - but the daily figure is typically higher on Tuesdays due to delays in reporting deaths at the weekend. An additional 581 positive cases have also been reported across the UK, a small dip on recent days. Asked about reports inthe Daily Telegraph,externalthat the 14-day period could be reduced, Mr Johnson said: ""We are always looking at ways in which we can mitigate the impact of the quarantine. ""At the moment you have got to stick with the guidance that we are giving, we have given the guidance now about Spain and about some other places around the world."" When asked whether the 14-day quarantine period could be cut, transport minister Baroness Vere said the government was ""looking at a range of options"" including ""testing people on certain days"" after they arrive. Ministers are also ""certainly looking"" at the idea of restrictions on travel to regions rather than whole countries, she said during an urgent question in the House of Lords. Travel industry sources later told the BBC the governmentwas close to backing a trial of double-testing arrivalsfrom at-risk countries - allowing those who test negative twice a few days apart to leave quarantine early. Spain's rate of infection has risen in recent days but Britons have continued to travel to the country Mr Johnson said if the UK did see signs of a second wave in other countries, it was the government's duty to stop travellers returning and spreading the disease. ""It's vital that when people are coming back from abroad, if they are coming back from a place where I'm afraid there is another outbreak, they must go into quarantine,"" he said. ""That's why we have taken the action that we have and we will continue, throughout the summer, to take such action where it is necessary."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon echoed Mr Johnson's concerns, saying ""we are currently seeing a worrying resurgence of Covid"" in European countries. She warned potential travellers not to assume quarantine measures would remain the same at the time of booking a holiday as when they returned, adding: ""I wouldn't be booking a foreign holiday right now."" The Department of Health said there had been a handful of suspected cases this month where a person had tested positive for the coronavirus after returning to the UK from Spain. But it added these were not a factor in evidence presented to ministers and that the decision to reintroduce a quarantine for arrivals from Spain was taken because of rising infection rates there. In an interview with the Telecinco TV network, Spain's Mr SÃ¡nchez said his government was ""talking with British authorities to try to get them to reconsider"" the decision. He said the UK had made an ""error"" by considering the infection rate for the whole country. He added that ""64.5% of the new cases registered are in two territories"" and in most of Spain the prevalence of Covid-19 was ""very much inferior to the numbers registered in the United Kingdom"". The rate of infection in Spain is 47.2 cases per 100,000 people, while the UK is at 15,according to the latest figures,externalfrom the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. While the outbreak remains under control in many parts of Spain, certain areas - in particular Catalonia in the north-east, which includes the city Barcelona, and the neighbouring region of AragÃ³n - have seen a huge spike in infections. According todata,externalfrom the Spanish government, as of Monday, the infection rates in the Balearic and Canary Islands were 9.22 and 7.06 per 100,000 respectively. The same data showed infection rates in Catalonia, which includes Barcelona, was 132.4 per 100,000, and 28.21 in Madrid. On Tuesday,the UK government added,externalEstonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia and St Vincent and the Grenadines to the list of countries which are exempt from the quarantine rule. Travellers returning to the UK from anywhere not on the list - including Spain - must self-isolate for 14 days at a registered address. People who do not self-isolatecan be finedup to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and those returning to Scotland could be fined Â£480, with fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. Government sources told the BBC that there are no plans to introduce testing at airports, and the priority isto get walk-in centres up and running. In Barcelona, some businesses are quiet as residents are being told to stay at home Tourism is important for Spain's economy, with about 18 million trips made by Britons last year Some travel agents say they are struggling to understand the logic of the UK government's advice. And MP Chris Bryant, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for Spain, said: ""Why the Canaries - which are further away from Barcelona than Barcelona is to the UK - are on the list as well as mainland Spain, I simply don't understand. ""And there are many, many regions of Spain which have much lower infection rates than many areas in the UK. I think this has been terribly badly handled."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? Labour said the government's handling of the restrictions had been ""chaotic"", and urged it to step in to protect jobs in the travel industry. Holiday companies Jet2 and Tui were among those to announce sweeping flight cancellations following the UK announcement. ""What we need now is clarity and consistency from the government,"" Jet2 said. ""We want to provide customers, who work hard and save hard for their well-deserved holidays, with timely information and we need this from the government."" EasyJet, British Airways and Ryanair said they would continue to operate full schedules of flights to Spain, though EasyJet said its holidays would be cancelled for the next few weeks. Spain rushes to save tourism as cases surge Sun, sea and sanitiser: What your holiday will be like Sports minister confident fans will return safely to stadiums Among the thousands affected by the change in travel advice and quarantine requirement was Jason Ward who was on holiday in Ibiza with his wife when he heard the rules had changed. Jason Ward said he felt safer in Ibiza than in the UK The couple, from Stevenage, in Hertfordshire, arrived on Saturday for a two-week holiday and now face having to self-isolate for the same amount of time when they return to the UK. ""Both of us are key workers and have worked through lockdown,"" Mr Ward told the BBC. ""We feel safer here then back at home."" He called on ministers to ""remove the quarantine and allow the businesses here to have a chance to survive"".

"Prince William on lockdown, football and mental healthPrince William speaks to the Peter Crouch Podcast about his experience of lockdown, importance of football... and karaoke.","This video can not be played Prince William takes a curry delivery for Peter Crouch The guest on this week's That Peter Crouch Podcast is none other than Prince William. As president of the Football Association, the Duke of Cambridge has been keen to use his role to start conversations around mental health, including helping to rename the 2020 FA Cup final theHeads Up FA Cup final. ""We're hoping that renaming it is a big enough statement that the UK will show the world, and the football world in particular, that mental health really matters,"" William - making his first appearance on a podcast - tells Crouch. The podcast team met William at Kensington Palace before lockdown - and even shared a curry - before a follow-up Zoom call this month. Here are the highlights: Download the full episode here Prince William says he finds it very important to talk to people about football Asked if football is his ""release"", William replies: ""It is now. Since becoming a dad, without a doubt, football has become way more important than it used to be. ""I need to go and be amongst other guys and let out some steam, shout a bit,"" he explains, joking he stops short of abusing the referee. ""I'm the president of the FA and I can't do that!"" William adds: ""It has become a lot more relevant to me and I need it. Talking about football helps a lot."" Later in the podcast, he says: ""This period of time has allowed us to all revalue things. The thing about lockdown is that it has been a little bit of an awakening that we maybe take our lives a bit for granted sometimes and there's a lot of things out there that can wobble all of us at any time. ""I think particularly now, as a parent, it starts to make you look a bit more to the future at what kind of world we are going to hand over to the next generation. There's been a lot of time to think - and you can also have too much time to think, and that's also what worries me."" William says he really missed football during its hiatus. ""I was trying to pretend I didn't care too much it wasn't around,"" he says. ""But by the end of the third weekend, I was really missing it. It just goes with the weekend."" And he's all for having crowd noise in empty stadiums. ""It's better than hearing the players puffing and swearing at each other,"" he says. What are among the things a royal worries about during lockdown? Home-schooling and keeping young kids entertained, apparently. ""I found it pretty testing, trying to keep the children engaged and interested in some sort of work,"" he says. ""It's been an interesting few months. ""I've learned my patience is a lot shorter than I thought it was! That's probably the biggest eye-opener for me, and my wife has super patience."" He goes on to admit he's struggled with year two maths. Comforting. This video can not be played Prince William is asked whether his son Prince George could be a professional footballer. Prince William is famously a Villa fan. He says he fell in love during his first trip to an FA Cup game - Villa against Bolton - when he was 11. ""I sat there among all the Villa fans and I loved it. I thought the atmosphere was great,"" he recalls. He says at the time he ""desperately"" didn't want to support ""someone like Manchester United or Chelsea"" - like everyone else at school did. He was also attracted to Villa's proud history - William was born in 1982, when they, as English champions, won the European Cup. ""I felt a real connection with the club,"" he says. ""I felt Villa was a very proud Midlands club and it felt very special. ""Only in the last few years have I got a grip of Villa as my real team and I watch them a lot and I get into the stats."" After being put on the spot, William says he's the only person in his team who wears shin pads. There is a good reason. ""In school, I basically got targeted the whole time,"" says William, who says he usually plays at right-back. Apparently, aged 15, he once asked a police officer with him to use a laser pen and 'red dot' one of the opposition players. ""I kept saying to him, 'see, he's following you',"" William laughed: ""It put him off for about 10 minutes!"" When Crouch and the team ask William if - in his role as president of the FA - he might get rid of Gareth Southgate were England to have a bad run of games, he concedes that ""that might be a bit difficult!"". ""Gareth is a legend, I really like Gareth and I think he's doing a great job with the England team,"" he says. ""That's not to say that conversations haven't been had where I give him a little nudge and say: 'Why isn't Grealish in the England squad?'"" he jokes. ""That would be the end of my life - you'd never see me on a balcony again,"" he says. ""I'd be locked in."" William tells a great story about watching Blackpool, then managed by Ian Holloway, on a stag do with friends from the Royal Air Force. Apparently the manager came to meet the group at half-time, which William says surprised him - given he should probably have been delivering his team talk at that point. ""He was just like, 'there's no point doing a team talk, they're not listening anyway',"" William says. When the team talked about bad presents they had given their wives, William admitted he once bought the Duchess of Cambridge a pair binoculars, despite her not being a keen birdwatcher. ""That was early on in the courtship. I think that sealed the deal,"" he jokes. ""I even tried convincing myself by saying: 'These are amazing, look how far you can see.'"" Asked about Kate's reaction to the gift, he said: ""Kate opened them and said: 'But they're binoculars, what's going on?''"" ""They deliberately keep me away from that. When Liverpool won that amazing Champions League semi-final against Barcelona [in May 2019], I grabbed hold of the Twitter thing and just posted. ""It was an amazing match, I was blown away by it. It was one of the best games of football I've ever seen. I got completely out of control. I was like: 'Tweet that! Get it out!' ""And nearly every Villa match we've won  - which isn't many this season - I've been trying to get hold of it, but they keep it away from me now."" ""I've met a lot of players. It's very interesting, how different sports and different teams behave in a changing room,"" William says. ""Whenever I go into the England dressing room there does always feel a lot more pressure. I don't know what it is, but you do notice guys find it much more difficult to relax. ""We talk about physical fitness. We never really talk about mental fitness. We all need to stay mentally fit, none more so than professional athletes who - under special circumstances playing for England under huge pressure - have got to have their heads razor sharp as well as their feet and legs."" This video can not be played ""People talk about physical fitness, we never really talk about mental fitness"" And the answer to the question you never realised that you had always wanted to know. It would be Queen, wouldn't it? ""It's one of the few songs I know all the lyrics to,"" he explains.

More free school meals 'would stop diet disaster'A national food strategy for England calls for an extension of the scheme to end childhood hunger.Family & Education,"Is the food industry encouraging people towards unhealthy eating habits? Free school meals should be extended to another 1.5 million children in England, says a government-commissioned review into food and healthy eating. The National Food Strategy warns that England's eating habits are a ""slow-motion disaster"". The review,externalwarns of the toxic connection between child poverty, poor diet and hunger. And it warns of ""wilfully misleading"" packaging which can give a false impression that foods are healthy. The food industry is accused of ""clothing itself, and its products, in false virtue"" - with the report highlighting the packaging for Percy Pig sweets sold in Marks & Spencer. The report says these sweets are promoted with the claim they have ""no artificial colours or artificial flavourings"" and to be ""soft gums made with fruit juice"". Have government anti-obesity plans ever made any difference? Offers on unhealthy food encourage obesity Marcus Rashford gets result in U-turn over free school meals Who gets free school meals? But it asks how any parents check to see that the ""three largest ingredients by weight are glucose syrup, sugar and glucose-fructose-syrup"". Report author, Henry Dimbleby, said he was singling out Marks & Spencer ""not because it is the biggest sinner"" but because it is a ""well-trusted company"" which pledges to ""always strive to do the right thing"". The review proposes widening access to free school meals and food for families during the summer holidays In response, a spokesman for Marks & Spencer said: ""All our products have clear labelling so that customers can make informed choices about what they buy"" - and that there was a ""range of Percy Pigs with one third less sugar"". The food review from Mr Dimbleby, co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain, takes issue with the language used to sell food. Email us atHaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp us at +44 7756 165803 Tweet us@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Phrases such as ""low fat"" might mean ""high starch"" and labels such as ""'free from' and 'less' are sprinkled around without context,"" says the report, which ""if not quite lies, are at least wilfully misleading"". Mr Dimbleby said some snacks might be ""clothed in a veneer of goodness and might not be better for you than a Mars bar"". Footballer Marcus Rashford campaigned for school meals to continue through the summer holiday The negative impacts of unhealthy eating or going hungry are long-lasting and corrosive, says the review, which is claimed as the most significant in England for decades. ""One of the miserable legacies of Covid-19 is likely to be a dramatic increase in unemployment and poverty and therefore hunger,"" says the food strategy report. As an immediate intervention, the review calls for many more children to be eligible for a free meal at school, as ""only 1% of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards of a school meal"". The review says they should be available to a further 1.5 million children, in addition to the 1.3 million already eligible - so almost one in three children would get free meals. The extension of free school meals, at a cost of Â£670m per year, would expand eligibility to all children in households where the parent or guardian is claiming universal credit or equivalent benefits. Such a move would aim to stop pupils being hungry at school and prevent the negative consequences for learning and behaviour. Footballer Marcus Rashford recently raised the profile of the importance of school meals during the summer holidays for families who are struggling financially,forcing a U-turn which will see vouchers continuing over the summer break. The food strategy proposes making a long-term commitment to feeding more families over the summer holidays, by making another 1.1 million children in England eligible for the ""holiday activity and food programme"", at a cost of Â£200m per year. Paul Whiteman, leader of the Nation Association of Head Teachers, said there were already too many children who ""arrive at school hungry and unable to learn"". ""Free school meals at least guarantee that children going hungry at home get one nutritious meal a day,"" he said. There are serious consequences from a poor diet, says the review, with one in seven deaths in the UK attributable to poor diets. ""A nutritionally poor-quality diet is the leading risk factor for ill-health in the UK, yet we do not treat it with the same seriousness afforded to other risk factors. FEELING LOST?:How to start thinking about the future 'HOMELESS HOTEL':Lockdown life inside emergency accommodation ""That has to change,"" said Susan Jebb, Oxford University professor of diet and population health, who worked on the report. ""This report reinforces the urgent need for action on the two biggest food challenges facing Britain: the growing scandal of food poverty and the need to prevent British farmers being undercut in new trade deals,"" said Luke Pollard, Labour's shadow environment secretary. This is the first part of the review, with the second part next year expected to focus on environmental issues, such as climate change, pollution, sustainable farming and the spread of diseases. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the food industry had ""worked round the clock"" to keep supplies going through the Covid-19 lockdown. ""But we know there is more to do and we will carefully consider this independent report and its recommendations as we emerge from the pandemic and build a stronger food system for the future,"" said Mr Eustice.
