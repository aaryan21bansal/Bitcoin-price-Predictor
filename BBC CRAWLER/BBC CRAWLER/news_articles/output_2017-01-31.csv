Off the street,"After years of working the streets of Mexico City, Carmen Munoz wondered what happened to sex workers like her when they got old - so she campaigned to set up a retirement home. It was on the historic Plaza Loreto in Mexico City - surrounded by buildings that date back to the 16th Century - that Carmen Munoz set out on her path as a sex worker. She had come to the city looking for work and had been told that the priest at the Santa Teresa la Nueva Church sometimes found jobs for domestic workers. She was 22, illiterate, and had seven children to feed - including one whom she carried in her arms. For four days she anxiously waited to see the priest, but when she finally succeeded he gave her no help and sent her away. ""He only told me that there was tons of work, and to look for it around the area,"" she recalls. ""I left crying because it hurt me deeply to hear the priest talk that way."" At that moment a woman approached Munoz to console her. ""She said to me: 'That man over there says he'll give you 1,000 pesos if you go with him,'"" Munoz remembers. At the time it seemed a fortune, although at today's exchange rate - taking into account a 1993 revaluation when one new peso was valued at 1,000 old pesos - it is barely five US cents. ""I said: 'I've never seen 1,000 pesos all in one place - where am I going with him?' ""She said: 'To a room.' And I said: 'A room? How will I know what work to do?' ""'No!' she said: 'You don't understand, to a hotel.' ""I asked: 'What's a hotel?'"" The woman told her bluntly what she would have to do. When Munoz understood, she was shocked. ""Oh senorita no, no, not that!"" she said. But the woman replied: ""You prefer to give it to your husband who doesn't even provide enough money for soap to wash, than to give it to others who will provide for your children?"" Feeling desperate, she went with the man. He gave her the 1,000 pesos as promised but said he wanted nothing in return. He didn't want to exploit her desperation, he said, and as she cried he pressed the money into her hand. Perhaps he knew she would be back. The following day, Munoz's despair had turned into defiance. She returned to the same corner in Plaza Loreto thinking to herself: ""From now on, my children won't go hungry any more."" Soledad, a resident of Casa Xochiquetzal, in her bedroom For the next 40 years she made her living as a sex worker on the corners of the Plaza and surrounding streets. The area is known as the Merced - 106 bustling blocks that form part of a Unesco World Heritage Site, containing some of the city centre's oldest buildings, its main commercial hub, and the biggest of the city's seven red light districts. There is at least one seedy hotel on every block. Find us on Facebook,external ""When I first entered sex work I was dazzled by the money,"" says Munoz. ""I realised I had worth, that someone would pay to be with me, when the father of my children told me that I was worth nothing and that I was very ugly."" But working on the streets took its toll. Both the authorities and pimps demanded money. Beatings and sexual harassment were common, and she became addicted to drugs and alcohol. Yet, despite all this, she is grateful. ""Thanks to sex work I was able to take care of my kids and provide them with a roof over their heads - a dignified place to live,"" she says. And years later, she was able to provide a home for others too. Luchita, a resident of Casa Xochiquetzal, puts on make-up in her bedroom at the shelter One night, she passed by a dirty, moving tarpaulin on the side of the street. ""I went over to it and pulled it up, thinking there were going to be children underneath,"" she says. What she found instead were three elderly women huddled together for warmth. She recognised them as fellow sex workers. ""It hurts you, it hurts you as a human being to see them like that,"" says Munoz. She helped the women up, bought them coffee, and got them a room in a cheap hotel. It made her realise how many elderly women were working in the Plaza. Once their looks had faded, because of their advancing years and the hard life on the streets, many ended up destitute. Their families didn't want them so they had nowhere to go. Munoz became determined to do something about it. This video can not be played Listen: Carmen tells Outlook why she wanted to help women such as Marbella Aguilar Get the Outlook podcastfor more extraordinary real-life stories For the next 13 years she lobbied the city authorities to provide a retirement home for elderly and homeless sex workers. With the support of several well-known artists, neighbours from the Merced and fellow sex workers, she finally persuaded them. The city gave them a large 18th Century building, just a few blocks from Plaza Loreto. The women's feeling of elation when they first walked through the doors was immeasurable. ""It was an amazing experience,"" Munoz says. ""We cried with joy, laughed and shouted: 'Wow, we now have a home!'"" Norma, a resident of Casa Xochiquetzal, rests in her bedroom It took a lot of work to clean up the building, a former boxing museum, but in 2006 the first women moved in. They named the shelter Casa Xochiquetzal, after the Aztec goddess of women's beauty and sexual power. When I leave the Merced's cacophonous streets and enter Casa Xochiquetzal, the women are listening to music. Jewellery and flower-making workshops are under way and the smell of baking fills the air - a dozen residents are busy baking cakes. While teaching the women new skills, Casa Xochiquetzal also aims to improve their health and well-being by providing self-esteem workshops, medical check-ups and  counselling. Residents of the Casa Xochiquetzal celebrate Mexico's Bicentennial Marbella Aguilar's room off the central courtyard is filled with books - her favourite authors are Pablo Neruda, Leo Tolstoy and Franz Kafka. ""Books have been my refuge since the age of nine,"" she says. As a child, nearly 60 years ago, her parents threw her out. Fortunately another woman took her in but when she died, Aguilar - now 16 - had to find the rent and pay for her studies by herself. When this proved impossible, she began to sell her body. ""There was nothing else I could do,"" she says. Through a mixture of jobs and occasional sex work, Aguilar managed to support her own three children through school. But when a teenage daughter died of leukaemia, she fell into a deep depression, could not work and was thrown out of her home for failing to pay the rent. At this point Casa Xochiquetzal rescued her and she now makes money selling jewellery in nearby markets. ""This house taught me that my life is worth a lot, that I am as dignified as any other woman,"" she says. ""Now I say that a woman can lose her honour, but never her dignity."" Her only sadness is that her surviving children no longer speak to her. Canela and Norma, both residents of Casa Xochiquetzal, at the shelter There are currently 25 other elderly or homeless women living in Casa Xochiquetzal - aged from 55 to their mid-80s. Though many have retired, some still work the streets. Over the past 11 years, more than 250 sex workers have been given shelter here. There have been big challenges though. Casa Xochiquetzal's finances are precarious - its grant from the city government has been cut back and it is reliant on charitable donations. MarÃ­a Isabel, a resident of Casa Xochiquetzal, in her bedroom On top of that, not everyone gets along. Although the women are friends and roommates now, some were formerly competitors and enemies on the streets. ""We have been so used, abused, so beaten, and so marginalised, that we are almost always on edge,"" explains Munoz. ""We have our nails out, ready to attack if we are attacked."" But disagreements happen in any family, Aguilar says. ""Here we have been taught to have respect for each other, that there are things worth fighting for - and that brings harmony to the house."" And if not harmony, at least a sense of peace, and the reassurance that they will not die uncared-for on the streets. ""We deserve a place where we spend the last days of our lives with dignity and tranquillity,"" says Munoz. One day she expects to move in herself.

Lord Coe 'aware' of corruption claims,"This video can not be played Coe knew more than he let on - MP Collins Claims that Lord Coe misled an MPs' inquiry have grown after new emails confirmed he was ""made aware"" of corruption allegations in his sport four months before they became public. The president of the IAAF, athletics' governing body, told a select committee in December 2015 he was ""not aware"" of specific allegations of corruption around the Russian doping scandal. Butthe email,externalfrom Lord Coe to the IAAF's ethics commission in August 2014 states: ""I have now been made aware of the allegations."" In 2015, Lord Coe told Parliament: ""I was certainly not aware of the specific allegations that had been made around the corruption of anti-doping processes in Russia."" Lord Coedenies there is any discrepancy,externalbetween his evidence and what the emails say he knew. Lord Coe is a two-time Olympic gold medallist MPs had wanted the IAAF [International Association of Athletics Federations] president to return to the committee after former athlete David Bedford's testimony to the Culture, Media and Sport select committee inquiry into doping in sport appeared to contradict Lord Coe's. The president has so far declined to return to the committee, but agreed to two requests from MPs to release missing correspondence between him and Michael Beloff, chair of the IAAF ethics commission. The emails, published on Tuesday by the committee, cast fresh light on the issue of what Lord Coe knew - and when - about the burgeoning Russian corruption and doping scandal which has blighted world athletics. Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova exposed the doping at the heart of Russian athletics Committee chairman Damian Collins told the BBC: ""Whatever excuse he gives, it is clear that Lord Coe decided not to share with the committee information that was relevant to our inquiry on doping in sport. ""The committee asked him about his knowledge of doping in Russian athletics and of corruption within the sport. In his answers, he gave the impression that he was unaware of specific allegations. ""Thanks to evidence that was presented by the BBC Panorama programme last year, and by David Bedford to the committee this January, we can see that he was aware, at least in general terms, of the allegations that had been brought forward by the Russian athlete Liliya Shobukhova."" Dr Rosena Allin-Khan MP, shadow minister for sport, said: ""These are very troubling allegations. The release of these emails by the select committee casts serious doubts over the evidence previously given by Lord Coe to the inquiry. ""World Athletics is going through one of the most serious doping scandals in its history and requires the strongest possible leadership. Lord Coe must immediately come back to the select committee and clarify his evidence in light of this new information. ""He must be honest about which allegations he knew of and when he found out about them. The IAAF and BOA [British Olympic Association] need transparency and honesty throughout their organisations now more than ever, and that has to start at the very top."" This video can not be played Archive: Coe 'not aware of specific allegations' Last June the BBC's Panorama programme and the Daily Mail alleged Lord Coe - then an IAAF vice-president - had been alerted to the scandal months before it was revealed by the German journalist Hajo Seppelt in December 2014. The programme revealed Lord Coe had been sent an email by Bedford, the former world 10,000m record holder, containing several attachments detailing allegations from Russian marathon champion Shobukhova that she had paid almost half a million euros to cover up positive doping tests after being blackmailed by senior IAAF officials. Collins told Panorama it appeared Lord Coe had ""deliberately misled"" them. Lord Coe told the programme he hadn't opened the attachments and had simply forwarded the email on to the IAAF's Ethics Committee, and that since he did not open the attachments, he had not been aware of the detail of the corruption allegations and therefore had not misled Parliament. His spokeswoman told the BBC his failure to open the attachments had been nothing more than a ""lack of curiosity"". In his evidence to the select committee in December, Bedford said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" that Lord Coe, who became president of the IAAF in August 2015, said he had not opened the attachments. However, fresh questions have emerged for Lord Coe following his disclosure to the committee of the full email chain between him and Mr Beloff. Former London Marathon race director David Bedford first made Coe aware of the allegations The email, from Lord Coe to Mr Beloff, is dated August 2014 and reads: ""I have in the last couple of days received copied documentation of serious allegations being made by and on behalf of the Russian female athlete Shobukhova from David Bedford. ""I have spoken to David today on the phone and he advises me that he has shared this information with you. Should I forward this documentation to you? ""The purpose of this note is of course to advise you that I have now been made aware of the allegations... but would be grateful for your advice."" In a detailed four-page letter to the select committee, which accompanies the disclosure of the emails, Lord Coe says there is ""no discrepancy"". He said he was not asked specifically by MPs about when he first heard of the corruption of doping cases. He said he was on holiday abroad when he received a call from Mr Bedford asking if he was aware of the Shobukhova allegations, and on answering ""no"", Mr Bedford agreed to send them without going into the detail of what the allegations were. Lord Coe says he then dictated the 14 August email to an assistant. The letter to the committee reads: ""David had thought the allegations were serious enough to send information about them first to the ethics commission and then to me, and I knew I therefore had a duty to inform the ethics commission that I was aware of allegations having being made, and I wanted to ensure that Michael [Beloff] had all the information David [Bedford] had sent to me."" Mr Beloff responded on 16 August 2014 that he already had the information. Lord Coe wrote: ""Having received these responses from Michael [Beloff] I was satisfied that I had done what I was required to do under the code of ethics. ""I have made clear I did not read David Bedford's emailed documents but asked my office to forward them to the person and the commission with exclusive authority to investigate. ""I trust this clarifies the matter to the satisfaction of the committee, and as such there are no grounds for suggesting that I misled the committee in any way."" Questions remain as to why Lord Coe, if he was unaware of the detail of the allegations, would state to Beloff he had ""now been made aware of the serious allegations being made by, and on behalf of the Russian female athlete Shobukhova"". Collins told the BBC: ""It was not possible to know this, without some knowledge of the attachments contained in the email, as all David Bedford's email to Lord Coe said was that the documents he was sending to him related to 'an issue that is being investigated by the IAAF ethics commission'. ""However, if it is true that Lord Coe was somehow unaware of the details of the complaint that had been made by Shobukhova, it is regrettable that neither he nor his team could find the time to read the 1,700 word summary of the allegations that was sent to him by David Bedford. ""This episode adds further weight to the concern that senior figures within athletics could have done more to make themselves fully aware of serious allegations of corruption and doping within their sport, and then acted on that information to make sure that it was being properly investigated."" Lord Coe, as a member of the House of Lords, cannot be compelled to give evidence to a select committee, unlike members of the public, but it is likely that the committee will take a dim view of Lord Coe's refusal to return when writing up their final report on doping in sport, which is expected to be published within weeks. The BBC Panorama programme also revealed claims Lord Coe had been helped to the presidency of theIAAF by Papa Massata Diack,at a time when Diack was under investigation for serious corruption. Diack, who is the son of the disgraced former president of the IAAF Lamine Diack, is now banned for life from athletics, is wanted by Interpol and remains in hiding in Senegal.

Bacteria boost,"Can what you eat change the bacteria in your gut for the better? Dr Michael Mosley has been finding out which foods and drinks can make the most difference. The gut microbiome - the diverse community of bacteria that inhabits our intestines - is a hot topic in science right now. Almost every day we come across headlines claiming that it has the power to influence our health in new and surprising ways, whether it's our weight, our mood or our ability to resist infection. Unsurprisingly, given this explosion of interest in our inner ecosystem, our supermarket shelves and pharmacies now stock an array of probiotic products - products containing live bacteria and yeasts - that claim to be able to influence our gut microbiome for the better. But is any of this actually possible? To find out,Trust Me, I'm A Doctorset up an experiment in Inverness with the help of NHS Highland and 30 volunteers and scientists around the country. We split our volunteers into three groups and over four weeks asked each group to try a different approach that, it's claimed, can boost gut bacteria for the better. Lactobacillus casei - a bacterium found in the intestines and mouth Our first group tried an off-the-shelf probiotic drink of the type found in most supermarkets. These drinks usually contain one or two species of bacteria that can survive the journey through our powerful stomach acid to set up home in our intestines. Our second group tried a traditional fermented drink called kefir which contains an array of bacteria and yeast. Our third group was asked to eat foods rich in a prebiotic fibre called inulin. Prebiotics are substances that feed the good bacteria already living in our guts, and inulin can be found in Jerusalem artichokes, chicory root, onions, garlic and leeks. Jerusalem artichokes are rich in prebiotic fibre What we found at the end of our study was fascinating. The group consuming the probiotic drink saw a small change in one bacteria type known to be good for weight management, bacteria called Lachnospiraceae. However this change wasn't statistically significant. But our other two groups did see significant changes. The group eating foods rich in prebiotic fibre saw a rise in a type of bacteria known to be good for general gut health - something that is in line with other studies. Our biggest change, however, was in the kefir group. These volunteers saw a rise in a family of bacteria called Lactobacillales. We know that some of these bacteria are good for our overall gut health and that they can help conditions such as traveller's diarrhoea and lactose intolerance. ""Fermented foods by their very nature are quite acidic and so these microbes have had to evolve in order to cope with these sorts of environments so they're naturally able to survive in acid,"" says Dr Paul Cotter from the Teagasc Research Centre in Cork, who helped with our analysis.  ""That helps them to get through the stomach in order to then have an influence in the intestine below."" So we decided to investigate fermented foods and drinks further - we wanted to know what you should look for when selecting these products to get the best bacteria boost. With the help of Dr Cotter and scientists at the University of Roehampton, we selected a range of homemade and shop-bought fermented foods and drinks and sent them off to the lab for testing. Trust Me, I'm A Doctoris on BBC Two at 20:00 GMT, Wednesday 1 February -catch up on BBC iPlayer There were some striking differences between the products. While the homemade foods and products made by traditional methods contained a wide array of bacteria, some of the commercial products contained barely any. ""Typically, with commercial varieties, they would be subjected to pasteurisation after preparation to ensure their safety and extend their shelf life, which can kill off the bacteria, whereas that wouldn't be the case for the homemade varieties,"" says Dr Cotter. So if you want to try fermented foods to improve your gut health it's best to look for products that have been made using traditional preparation and processing, or make them yourself, to ensure you're getting the healthy bacteria you're after.

What's in a name?,"Lisa McInerney won the 2016 Bailey's Women's Prize for Fiction for The Glorious Heresies It's all change in the world of literary prizes. This year will be the last Women's Prize for Fiction has the word Baileys attached to it. The liqueur company, owned by Diageo, said it had""regretfully decided to make way for a new sponsor"". Orange sponsored the award for 17 years up to 2012 before Baileys took over in 2014. The shifting nature of commercial partnerships means that book prizes can often change their names every few years. It can just be a minor tweak - such as a simple change of prefix. But sometimes well-known prize names can be rendered suddenly unrecognisable. Up until 2015 the the most prestigious non-fiction prize was known as theSamuel Johnson Prize. In 2016 it became theBaillie Gifford Prizeto reflect a new sponsorship deal. First awarded in 1999, it has also been known as theBBC Four Samuel Johnson Prizeand then theBBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction. Margo Jefferson and Svetlana Alexievich were among the nominees in the 2016 Baillie Gifford Prize TheCosta Book Awardsstarted out asthe Whitbread Awardsin 1971 and only became known by their current name in 2006. The overall 2017 winner is announced this week. The best-known literary prize of them all, theMan Booker Prize, was founded by the Booker McConnell company in 1968. Investment company Man Group began its sponsorship in 2002 and retained Booker in the official title. The Folio Prizeis a new kid on the block in terms of book awards. It was first announced as the Literature Prize in 2011 amid a row about the decision by Man Booker Prizes judges that year to focus on ""readability"". It was the first major English language book prize open to writers from around the world. Ahdaf Soueif will chair this year's Rathbones Folio Prize Under the sponsorship of The Folio Society, its first Â£40,000 accolade was handed out in 2014.  After the 2015 award, the Folio Society announced that it would not renew its partnership. The prize took a year off in 2016 while it searched for a new sponsor and is back in 2017 as theRathbones Folio Prize, with backing from Rathbone Investment Management. Andrew Kidd, co-founder of the Folio Prize and of digital book club Alexi, knows all about the challenge of changing sponsor. ""We are a very young prize and we are still building public awareness,"" he says. ""We haven't established ourselves enough to say we have a right to exist. We were born out of a particular moment."" During its year off it was decided to open the fiction prize to any literary genre, including non-fiction. Mr Kidd says the search for a new sponsor wasn't as hard as he had expected. ""Because we waited until we had our own USP [Unique Selling Point] it was not that difficult at all. We had a compelling story to tell."" This year's winner will be announced on 24 May, with the Egyptian author Ahdaf Soueif as chair of the judging panel. Its co-founder, novelist Kate Mosse, is, as you might expect, optimistic. ""We feel very confident about attracting a new sponsor,"" she told the BBC. Kate Mosse is co-founder of the Women's Prize for Fiction ""We know that brands want to be associated with something that's inspirational... and we know customers like to be involved with companies that have some sort of social purpose."" Mr Kidd agrees: ""Even when it was the Orange Prize everybody knew what it was. They've been so successful at building that unique brand that I would imagine it will be relatively easy to find a sponsor."" He said that having such a high profile advocate in Kate Mosse also puts them in a strong position. ""There's no question that there's an important place for a prize that focuses on female voices,"" he added. ""I would imagine that a lot of sponsors will be interested in associating themselves with something that has such a strong purpose.""

Queen for a day,"Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody was turned into a VR fantasy mixing real footage with animation Imagine finding yourself on a futuristic stage with rock legends Queen as they blast out their greatest hit, Bohemian Rhapsody. A neon-rendered Freddie Mercury struts around you. Well, now that fantasy experience can be a reality - albeit a virtual one. Last year Queen collaborated with Google Play and Enosis VR to create a360-degree virtual reality (VR) take,externalon the groundbreaking video for the band's 1975 hit. This video is often credited with fuelling the boom in pop videos that characterised the 1980s. The interactive app uses 2D and 3D animations combined with motion-captured ballet dancers to immerse the viewer in the late Freddie Mercury's ""subconscious mind"". VR wizardry transports fans on to a virtual stage with the late Freddie Mercury The narrative changes based on where your gaze falls as you watch through your VR headset. The original song was also remixed and mastered to create an interactive audio experience, the sound changing as the viewer turns their head. So-called ""immersive"" technologies are transforming what used to be a marketing tool into a new revenue stream for an industry whose business model was decimated by digital 20 years ago. ""It's a powerful sensation to watch something in 360 degrees, far more so than to watch it on a flat, framed screen,"" says Dylan Southard, creative director at US design studio VR Playhouse. His firm has worked on 360-degree VR videos with artists such as US R&B singer Dawn Richard. Singer Dawn Richard worked with VR Playhouse on a VR video ""You're more present and so things are more heightened,"" says Mr Southard. ""It can be emotionally intense. You can feel as if you're right inside the story."" Although it is still early days for the technology - affordable VR headsets have only recently come on to the market - experimentation is rife in the music industry. Zach Fuller, paid content analyst at UK media and technology firm MIDiA Research, says VR is emerging in an increasingly ""visual-centric"" music landscape. 360-degree images from Biffy Clyro's single Flammable ""Examples are the accompanying film for Beyonce's Lemonade [album] and Frank Ocean's 'visual album' Endless, suggesting a strong future for visual music experiences that bodes well for VR,"" he says. In a world where consumers are able to stream songs anywhere at any time, standing out from the crowd is no mean feat. ""There's so much competition for attention, so anything that's new and potentially remarkable is going to get played with,"" says Ross Cairns, a UK-based creative director who worked on a VR video to accompany Biffy Clyro's single Flammable last summer. As well as giving music fans more exciting, immersive videos to watch, VR has great potential in the live music space as well. ""The sense of presence we can achieve in VR is incomparable to any other medium,"" says Jacek Naglowski, chief executive of Circus Digitalis, a Polish publisher that worked on one of the first cinematic VR music videos in Europe. ""Experiencing the concert in VR is something that people would be willing to pay for,"" he says. ""In future it may be one of the most important revenue streams for musicians and producers."" Special VR cameras record a Coldplay concert; live VR streaming could be a big money spinner Live concert and festival specialist Live Nation announced last year that it would be teaming up with US bank Citi and NextVR to create a series of VR live events. ""The obvious thing is to use this technology to open up live concerts to a wider audience and give them a better experience than just watching video in flat screen,"" says Tom Szirtes, creative technologist at UK digital design studio Mybronic. With arrays of cameras that can capture 360-degree images from a number of vantage points - including on stage - a VR live concert could be an even more thrilling experience than being there in person. The technology also offers bands the opportunity to perform live in a shared VR space, freeing them from the need to hire expensive venues. In 2014, UK indie rock band The Indelicates released a VR single, The Generation That Nobody Remembered. Vocalist Simon Clayton believes fans and other musicians could even play along. ""[Technology] could let us form bands in chatrooms with musicians from all over the world,"" he says. Mybronic is already experimenting in this space. ""Imagine a band projecting themselves into a computer-generated environment and allowing other people to connect,"" says Mr Szirtes. ""It opens up all sorts of interesting possibilities for artists to connect to new audiences in new ways."" Tyler Hurd's VR video for Future Islands' track Old Friend is a fully immersive experience The future will be about entering the musician's world, rather than simply engaging with an individual song. Anthony Batt, co-founder of US-based VR creative studio Wevr, says: ""The [VR experience] won't necessarily constantly entertain like a music video, but consumers will enter into the artist's space, into their gallery."" Wevr produced the VR video experience for the track Old Friend from the band Future Islands last year. VR Playhouse's Dylan Southard agrees: ""A pop star will be able to create a whole world that their fans can visit and interact with."" The challenge, as always, is making all this VR tech commercially viable. Users pay $2.99 (Â£2.40) to enjoy Wevr's Old Friend VR experience, and Mr Batt says sales are ""in the thousands"". Wevr also has a VR subscription network called Transport. ""In turn, we recycle that money back to the artists and musicians,"" he says. VR tech could give bands a virtual space in which to interact with their fans US company Vrtify specialises in taking traditional music content and transforming it into an immersive experience, paying 70% of its income back to artists. ""Immersive technologies aren't mainstream, but we all see how quickly they're evolving,"" says Marcus Behrendt, Vrtify's chief marketing officer. ""It will soon represent a very important income for the music industry because it is changing how fans are consuming music."" New revenue streams from advertising, membership subscriptions and pay-per-view are possible once the audience grows, he believes. But the tech needs to improve before this form of musical entertainment goes mainstream, Mybronic's Mr Szirtes argues. ""We need to have lighter, smaller, more comfortable headsets that are cheap to produce, combined with lots of great creative content that really understands the strengths of the medium.""

Birds of prey take flight - on Airbus,"The falcons were reported to be well behaved despite their scant attention to fasten seatbelt signs A photo of 80 birds of prey on board an airliner in the Middle East has gone viral after being posted on Reddit. Ahmet Yasar, the businessman who posted the image, told the BBC it was taken within the last four weeks by a friend who works as an airline captain. Mr Yasar said the falcons were flying to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia for what is thought to be a hunting trip. ""The picture was taken on board an Airbus flying from an unknown origin to Saudi Arabia,"" Mr Yasar told the BBC. ""It is quite common for airlines in the Middle East to transport birds for hunting purposes. In this case each falcon is estimated to be worth about $8,000 (Â£6,435),"" the Turkey-based businessman said. ""The picture I posted has gone viral attracting interest from all over the world,"" he said. ""It is thought the birds were to be used to hunt geese."" Mr Yasar said the airline captain who took the picture did not want to be named.

Economy passengers are allowed one bird per seat Emirates:There are no restrictions on the number of pets you can carry on Emirates flights,the airline's website says,external, although strict rules apply on how they should be caged and on the number of animals some countries will accept The popularity of hunting in the Middle Eastwas clearly seen in December 2015,when gunmen kidnapped at least 27 Qatari hunters - including members of the ruling family - in a desert area of Iraq near the Saudi border. Iraq - like Saudi Arabia - is one of several countries frequented by wealthy practitioners of the ancient sport of falconry as they search for prey that either does not exist in their own countries or which has been almost hunted to extinction there. Hunters use falcons (top) to target their prey, such as the Asian houbara bustard (bottom) - here shown during a competition in the UAE Their favoured prey is the Asian houbara bustard, akin to a small turkey, and to find it and other similar species, Gulf hunters often travel to Morocco, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan. BBC Nature - Birds of prey How a shy but beautiful bird became a foreign policy issue They take with them their prized falcons, typically peregrines, sakers and lanners, which are expertly trained to home in on their quarry at high speed.

"No, this isn't Trump's brother","Okay, you've probably guessed it. This isn't Donald Trump's Kenyan half-brother. But that hasn't stopped the internet having a good laugh at this man's uncannily Trump-esque locks. When the photo was shared on American comedian and radio host Ricky Smiley's Facebook page back in January, hundreds joined in on the comments, and thousands more shared the post. And that's not the only comedy meme. Another makes the claim that the man in the photo is one 'Nyirongo Trump' of Malawi. But who is the man in the memes? Well, we've had a dig round and we've deduced his identity. Are you ready? It is in fact Ghanaian president Nana Akufo-Addo. A reverse image search on the meme led Trending to the original - un-Photoshopped - image, where he is seen greeting a celebrity supporter of his New Patriotic Party (NPP), Ghanaian actor Kofi Adu. Nana Akufo-Addo meeting Ghanaian actor Kofi Adu So how many have picked up on the man's true identity? On the original Rickey Smiley show Facebook post, out of 311 comments, only two people seem to have noticed that the man is, in fact, the Ghanaian president. Despite not being Trump's half-brother, President Addo has been nicknamed 'Nana Trump' by some of his supporters, mainly due to the fact that his campaign and inauguration happened in very close time-proximity to President Trump's. And it seems that the meme traces its origin back to an image that was shared by some of his supporters back in December, with the text ""Nana Trump: Make Ghana great again"". Mystery solved.

Airport angst,"Anisha Turner, 36, had problems finding a room to breastfeed at Heathrow Airport To most people, leaving baby at home for a solo trip abroad sounds like a dream. But is it easy to travel as a breastfeeding mum? Women often use pumps to get milk from the breasts - if you don't breastfeed regularly, it can cause problems with milk supply and can even stop milk altogether. Also, not breastfeeding can lead to very engorged and painful breasts. After reporting the story of mumGayathiri Bosewho said she had to squeeze her breast in front of Frankfurt Airport security officials to prove that she was lactating, we asked women for their stories. Anisha Turner breastfeeds her one year old daughter Ayrianna but in December 2016 she travelled without her from London to India to scatter her mother's ashes. ""It is tricky to travel as breastfeeding mum so I went to India for just a couple of days and I brought my electric breast pump with me. ""I knew it would be very painful to travel on a long-haul flight without expressing milk - and if you do not pump it can lead tomastitis,external(breast tissue inflammation). ""I planned to express milk where I could and I was hoping to find a mum and baby room in Heathrow to plug in the pump. ""I could not find a room with a socket - I asked a security guard who was unhelpful but in the end I found an official who understood how uncomfortable it would be for me to fly without pumping. ""In the end I had to buy a universal socket in the airport and I stood in the disabled toilet to pump. ""Later when we transferred at Mumbai airport, there were mum and baby rooms and loads of facilities to accommodate me. ""I was so surprised -  I thought that I would have problems in Mumbai but in fact it was Heathrow Airport that had no facilities at all. ""Breastfeeding mums are not really thought about - the difficulties that we encounter are not understood - and you would think that an airport could accommodate us."" Caroline Watson-Felt, 35, was left in tears when flying home to Boston Caroline Watson-Felt took her first trip away from her infant son in January 2012. She was left crying in San Francisco Airport after security threatened to throw away her bottles of breast milk: ""He was really little - it was really hard to leave him and I felt very emotional and raw because of the hormones and tiredness. ""Breastfeeding is a hard job -  pumping makes you feel like some kind of farm animal on the best of days -  it is referred to as ""liquid gold"" by breastfeeding moms for a reason! ""For three days on the trip I expressed milk, but on the way home, the airport security scanner could not register the bags of milk properly. ""I had to unpack all the bags in front of everyone at security. ""So when the huffing and puffing airport security official told me 'I cannot believe you're even bothering to take this home - I'll probably just throw it out', I was so upset and I started crying. ""I'm a formidable chick - it's not my style to stand and cry - but it's so emotional especially when you're exhausted and at their mercy. ""In the end a great lady came over - she said 'you've been hard at work, you've done a great job, good work momma'. ""It's especially hard for breastfeeding women - airports were built in the 1970s by men and for men. ""They need to be modernised to make them suitable for families."" Claire Dunn, 40, found herself explaining her 'strange-looking device' in Heathrow airport Claire Dunn travelled from London Heathrow airport to Istanbul but found herself explaining what is a breast pump to two male security officials who questioned why she was travelling with a strange-looking machine. ""I went on a girls' weekend away - my first trip away after my son was born - so I was tired, under-slept and had low resilience. I brought a double breast pump with me so I could carry on breastfeeding when I came home. ""When my carry-on luggage went through security, I was marched into a separate room by two male security guards in their late 40s. ""'What is this unusual object? What is it?' they kept asking. ""They had no idea what it was! ""They carried on questioning me - 'You're not travelling with your baby - why do you need a breast pump?' ""I had to explain everything - I was so tired I even offered to demonstrate how it works. ""I do understand their issue - the two conical parts of the pump do look weird - but the airport staff clearly required some training. ""They were really nice but somebody needs to take these guys aside and explain what a breast pump is!"".

Prisoner of a past war,"This video can not be played Wang Qi yearns to meet his family in China In 1963 a Chinese army surveyor crossed into India and was captured, weeks after a war between the countries. Wang Qi has been unable to leave India ever since - and longs to see his family in China. BBC Hindi's Vineet Khare met him. Tirodi village is a nearly five-hour drive from the nearest airport in Nagpur in central India. I am here to meet Wang Qi, a Chinese army surveyor who entered India in 1963 but could never go back. For over five decades, he has been longing to see his family back home. Sporting cropped white hair, black trainers and a body warmer, Mr Wang, who is now in his eighties, hugs me when we meet. We are about to try and make video contact with his family more than 3,000km (1,864 miles) away in China. Together we go to the government office, which is the only centre equipped with internet for miles around. ""I couldn't recognise him. He looked so old. He said he was alive just for me."" He watches in anticipation as I dial and then his eyes light up as the image of his elder brother Wang Zhiyuan, 82, appears on the screen, seated on a sofa in Xianyang, a city in China's Shaanxi province. The two brothers are seeing each other after more than 50 years. The conversation in Mandarin lasts 17 minutes. ""I couldn't recognise him. He looked so old. He said he was alive just for me,"" Wang Qi, also known by his Indian name Raj Bahadur, tells me in strongly accented Hindi as his three Indian-born children gather around to comfort him. Mr Wang's story is a long and sad one. How Chinese-Indians paid the price for 1962 war Muhammad Idrees: Abandoned by India and Pakistan Born to a farmer family in Shaanxi with four brothers and two sisters, he studied surveying and joined China's People's Liberation Army in 1960. Mr Wang says he was ""tasked with building roads for the Chinese army"" and was captured when he ""strayed erroneously"" inside India's territory in January 1963. ""I had gone out of my camp for a stroll but lost my way. I was tired and hungry. I  saw a Red Cross vehicle and asked them to help me. They handed me over to the Indian army,"" he said. Mr Wang's mother died in 2006 before he could go back and see her Indian officials said Mr Wang ""intruded into India"" and gave ""false background and the circumstances"" about his whereabouts to the authorities. He spent the next seven years in a number of different jails before a court ordered his release in 1969. Police took him to Tirodi, a far-flung village in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. He has not been allowed to leave the country ever since. It's still not clear whether Mr Wang is a prisoner of war. But he has been denied official Indian documents or citizenship and also been denied permission to travel back. His family says Mr Wang needs a document to exit India. Senior local official Bharat Yadav agrees that there have been ""deficiencies"" and a ""lack of interest"" in the case. ""There are no suspicions about his actions. If he wants to go back, we will try and help him,"" he said. An official at the Chinese embassy, which helped him secure a passport in 2013, acknowledged he was aware of the issue. A response to questions sent to India's federal home ministry is still awaited. It has been a long, excruciating wait for Mr Wang. Wang Qi joined China's People's Liberation Army in 1960 Be it language, food or a vastly different society, Mr Wang has had to adapt every step of the way. ""I began by working in a flour mill. But I cried in the night as I longed for my family. I missed my mother,"" he said. ""I wondered what I had got into."" Mr Wang married a local girl, Sushila, under ""pressure from friends"" in 1975. ""I was livid with my parents for marrying me off to an outsider. I had trouble understanding his language. I tolerated him for a few months. Then I got used to him,"" she says with a smile. Mr Wang tried his hand at business but his undefined legal status meant visits by local police. Mr Wang married a local girl, Sushila, under ""pressure from friends"" in 1975 ""I remember Mr Wang being beaten by the police for not bribing them. He was an honest man,"" says BB Singh, his neighbour for many years. ""He always talked about his home in China. His family lived in utter poverty. He would cycle for miles with no break,"" another former neighbour Jayanti Lal Waghela says. Mr Wang wrote letters home but received his first reply only in the 1980s. Family pictures were exchanged. He spoke to his mother for the first time in more than 40 years on the phone in 2002. ""She said she wanted to see me as her last days were near. I said I was trying to return. I wrote letters to everyone who mattered to provide me with exit documents but nothing moved."" She died in 2006. Mr Wang's family in China Mr Wang's nephew met him when he came to India as a tourist in 2009. It was he who helped him to get the necessary documents for his passport. It is still not clear whether Wang Qi will be able to go to China - and if he did, would he want to return to India? ""My family is here. Where would I go?"" he says, playing with his granddaughter in his lap. Sushila is worried though. ""I hope he comes back."" It is not clear whether Mr Wang will leave his family and return to China Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Inside neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

James Landale: The politics behind state visits31 January 2017 (16:09:46),"George Osborne was keen to use Xi Jinping's state visit to bolster UK-China trade ties Astate visitis the ultimate weapon of British diplomacy, the bunker buster of soft power that can break down the hardest of tyrannical hearts. Few world leaders can resist the siren lure of all that royal bling: horse-drawn coaches, state banquets, processions down the Mall, the sheer scale of all that gold leaf and pomp and flummery that allows them a brief window into a royal fantasy that many countries envy but can rarely match. This weapon is deployed sparingly, normally no more than twice a year. But it does get used. Trump state visit 'difficult' for Queen What is a state visit? In pictures: UK protests against Trump's travel ban If Donald Trump does touch down for a little red carpet treatment later this year, it will be the110th time the Queen has welcomed another head of state to these shores in her reign,external. And for now, despite the protests andgrowing online petition,Downing Street is continuing to stand firm, insisting that the invitation to the president stands. So state visits are not merely ceremonial affairs, they are political and purposeful. They are used by the British government of the day to further what they see as Britain's national interests. In 1973, the Queen welcomed President Mobutu of what was then called Zaire in Africa, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was a brutal, corrupt dictator but he was also seen as a vital anti-communist ally in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. So he got an invite to the Palace. President Mobutu's 1973 visit was extremely controversial President Suharto of Indonesia, another repressive leader who happened to be anti-communist, was also granted a state visit in 1979 for the same reasons. In 1971, Emperor Hirohito of Japan was welcomed by the Queen for a state visit as a deliberate attempt to help usher the country back into the family of nations after its post-war isolation. Not surprisingly, the invitation of the man who had led Japan during World War Two was hugely controversial, and many former army veterans and prisoners of war turned their backs on the royal procession in silent protest. Some wore red gloves to symbolise the blood they saw as being on his hands while others whistled ribald old army tunes. A tree the Emperor had planted was uprooted. In 1978, Nicolae Ceausescu, the notorious Romanian communist leader, and his wife Elena were given a state visit in the vain hope that they might be encouraged to introduce some pro-Western reforms. The Queen was so repulsed by them that, according to the royal author Robert Hardman, while out walking her dogs, she hid behind a bush in the Palace gardens to avoid bumping into the couple who were also out strolling. More than a decade later both Ceausescu and his wife were executed by a revolutionary firing squad. Huge crowds greeted Nelson Mandela in Brixton during his 1996 state visit And even the most uncontroversial of state visits, that of President Mandela in 1996, was not without political purpose. There was a feeling in the Foreign Office that South Africa was beginning to slip away from the West towards the unaligned nations, and they wanted to hug Madiba close and remind his country of Britain's anti-apartheid credentials. More recently, in 2014, the state visit of the Irish president to Britain was used as another step of reconciliation. The Irish president's state visit in 2014 drew former IRA leader Martin McGuiness to Windsor Castle Martin McGuiness, the former Northern Ireland deputy first minister and former IRA leader, not only put on white tie and tails for a state banquet at Windsor Castle, but he also stood for a toast to the Queen. And the state visit of President Xi in 2015 was a deliberate attempt by George Osborne, the then Chancellor, to curry favour with the Chinese and boost British trade links. As for American presidents, only two have been granted full state visits during the current Queen's reign: President Bush in 2003 and President Obama in 2011. What is unusual is the speed with which Mr Trump has been issued with an invitation for a state visit, just days into his presidency. Both Messrs Bush and Obama had to wait until well into their terms of office before they got the call. The haste reflects the importance the prime minister places on securing a good relationship with the new president and winning a post-Brexit trade deal, even if there is some political cost. Mr Bush's visit was by no means uncontroversial, coming so soon after the beginning of the Iraq war. There were demonstrations throughout the trip, including one involving tens of thousands in central London when an effigy of the president was toppled over in a parody of events in Baghdad. President Obama made a state visit half way through his first term of office So the Queen may be above politics but state visits are not. They are used for diplomacy and are often controversial. And whatever protests may surround any Trump state visit, the Queen will have seen it all before. Rarely has she shown herself unable to cope with whomsoever the government brings round for tea. As one royal insider told me dryly: ""She does have some experience in these matters."" Or as former foreign secretaryWilliam Hague wrote more bluntly in the Telegraph this morning,external, ""A Queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride.""

Is squatting art?Will GompertzArts editor30 January 2017 (17:42:21),"The squatters have turned the house into a homeless hostel I've been thinking a lot about ANAL today. That is the Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians who are currently squatting in a whopping five-story house in Eaton Square, an upmarket part of London near Buckingham Palace. According to the Guardian, the ""1,329 square metre property has polished parquet floors, tasteful uplighting and a grand spiral staircase"" and is owned by a wealthy Russian man (media shorthand: an oligarch) called Andrey Goncharenko. He is not in residence, but apparently has representatives seeking a possession order at a hearing scheduled for tomorrow so he can (presumably) get on with adding the gym etc. for which he has sought planning permission. Meanwhile, Anal argue that London is full of unoccupied buildings such as 102 Eaton Square, and that's daft when there's a palpable need for housing in the city. So, they have put into place their own plans by turning Mr Goncharenko's house into a homeless shelter with a projector for movie nights. Emin was among many artists who lived in squats I'm not going to get embroiled in the rights or wrongs on either side of this coming together of world views, but I will admit I'm interested in Anal. Its members are doing something I feel I've rather missed out on. I have never lived in a squat, although I have lived in places that thought they were squats, like a flat in Swiss Cottage, which was so rank that when a friend from New York came to stay he actually chose to sleep in his rental car. Nevertheless, I paid to live there, entered through the front door, and stored my belongings, consisting of a record collection that slowly warped in the damp. But it was legit, and therefore not cutting edge 1980s cool. The mansion in Eaton Square, Belgravia, was entered through an open window Back then, hipsters didn't live in smart apartments in Hoxton or gentrified high rises in Stoke Newington. They lived in squats. Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Jeremy Deller - they all lived in squats. It's what you did if you were an artist, which I wasn't. But maybe Anal are: although to my knowledge they are not proclaiming to be - but that doesn't matter anymore. When the architectural and design collective Assemble were shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 2015, it marked an important moment in the history of art. Not one of the members of the ensemble of 20-something architect-activists considered him or herself to be an artist; without asking or knowing, they were anointed to be such by the art world. Assemble won the Turner Prize for their work in Liverpool's Cairns Street No matter that Assemble members were handier with a slide-rule than a paintbrush, they won the Turner Prize anyway. And it was for a project that wasn't wildly dissimilar in conception to Anal's Eaton Square squat. They were working with local residents in the Toxteth area of Liverpool on a direct-action project to regenerate the run-down Granby Four Streets area, with ""the intention of bringing empty homes back into use"". There's a long history in art of political protest in the form of direct action. Dadaists, Surrealists and Situationists all sought to break down the barriers between art and life through protest, action and undermining the establishment. Property was often their conduit, as it has been more recently for street artists and performance artists such as Petr Pavlensky, who, when he's not nailing his scrotum to Red Square or sewing his lips together, makes his political point via interventions - including setting light to the front door of the FSB building in Moscow. Is there a huge difference between any of them and Anal? I don't think so. Will they be shortlisted for the 2017 Turner Prize in Hull? I doubt it. But it's not impossible. And if they were I assume they'd set up a squat as their entry (Assemble created an Arts & Crafts shop for its exhibit), which would be in the richly refurbished Ferens Art Gallery: An intervention I suspect its eponymous founder, the campaigning Thomas Ferens, would wholeheartedly support.

Olympian ends 52-year running streak,"Ron Hill was appointed MBE in 1971 A former Olympian has taken a day of rest to end a 52-year running streak of at least one mile every single day. Ron Hill, who competed at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 and Munich in 1972, has put on his running shoes every day since 20 December 1964 - a total of 52 years and 39 days. The 78-year-old won marathon gold medals at the European Championships in 1969 and the 1970 Commonwealth Games. He said he felt a pain in his chest while out running. ""After 400m my heart started to hurt and by the time I got to the one mile (1.6km) point I thought I was going to die,"" he added. ""I was in such pain and I thought 'no, hang on, this isn't going anywhere at the moment', and really in respect of my wife, two sons and friends I need to stop this."" Ron Hill finishes Manchester's 5km Heaton Park parkrun in December 2014 TheFacebook,externalpage for his clothing brand said he ""decided to take a day off"" due to illness. Paying tribute to his achievements on the social media page, David Hope said: ""An amazing achievement and an amazing and lovely fella. Well done, Ron."" Julie O'Brien wrote: ""We're wishing you a speedy recovery Ron, you're a total legend and inspire many many people."" Born in Accrington, Dr Ron Hill MBE was the first Briton to win the Boston Marathon in 1970. In the same year, he claimed a marathon time of two hours nine minutes 28 seconds in the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. A street in Accrington - Ron Hill Way - was named after him in 2014 Off the track he established Ron Hill Sports, pioneering use of synthetic fabrics in sportswear, and was given the Freedom of Accrington in 2012. A street in the town - Ron Hill Way - was named after him two years later. When he reached 50 years of running, the distance recorded in his log book added up to 160,000 miles - the equivalent of running around the world more than six times. Won the English Cross Country Championships in 1966 Represented Great Britain in the marathon at the 1964 Tokyo and 1972 Munich Olympics (pictured), though medals eluded him Became the first Briton to win the Boston Marathon in 1970 with a time of 2hrs 10mins 30secs Won gold at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in the same year, recording a time of 2hrs 9mins 28secs Was the first person to use synthetic fabrics in sportswear following a career as a textile chemist, leading him to set up Ron Hill Sports in September 1970 Has run every day since 20 December 1964 - even with a snapped sternum following a car crash in 1993 and for six weeks in a plaster cast after an operation on his foot Calls for knighthood for running legend Road name honour for marathon man Ron Hill How Â£1.5m of government cash has been spent by the council to boost Blackpool town centre Urgent appeal for missing teenage boy who has links to Blackpool 31 exceptional photos which rewind time in Blackpool to the era of 1950 and 1951 Urgent appeal for missing teenage boy who has links to Blackpool Cancer charity seeks participants for 40-mile Keswick to Barrow walk Record referrals for support as families continue to struggle across the City of Lancaster Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Inside neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

Train guard left behind at station,"A guard was accidentally stranded at a railway station when the train left without him. Passengers had to get out through the driver's cab door at the next stop and were delayed for an hour waiting for another train. The conductor on the 08:16 Ilkley to Leeds service was left behind at Burley-in-Wharfedale station. The train and its passengers stopped at Menston. Northern Rail said it was an ""operating incident"". Passenger Simon Painter said: ""We were offloaded on to the platform via the driver's cab and then waited at Menston for the next train. ""Left Ilkley at quarter past 8 and arrived Leeds at twenty to 10."" A spokesman for Northern Rail said: ""Shortly after 8.23am on Tuesday 31 January the 8.16am Ilkley to Leeds service was delayed after the train left Burley in Wharfedale station whilst the conductor was still on the platform. ""As a result, the service was terminated at Menston station.""

Scottish man mistaken for Trump adviser,"Steve Bannon (left) and Stephen Bannon (right) A Scottish man has ended up being confused with one of Donald Trump's closest advisers. Steve Bannon, who lives in England, has been mistaken for Stephen Bannon, the former Breitbart news executive and chief strategist to the US president. The Scot uses the Twitter handle@SteveBannon,external, while the other Mr Bannon uses@StephenBannon,external. Steve, not Stephen, has changed his Twitter bio to: ""Nothing to do with US politics or running the White House."" He has also changed the banner on his account to read: ""This is not the Steve Bannon you're looking for."" In a very patient fashion, Mr Bannon has also been replying to people who are tweeting him about the current situation in the States as Mr Trump's presidency takes shape. Despite Twitter ""melting"" his phone, Steve, originally from East Kilbride, has been directing people to ""go after the other guy"", ""go find the right Steve Bannon"" and to ""get the right guy"". He told BBC Scotland News that he has coped with it all so far, and that his younger girls think the attention from ""some cool social media sites"" has been hilarious. The office worker has issued a warning on her profile that she is not the US political adviser Mr Bannon is not the first Scot to end up in the spotlight because of the US election. In November, Kellyanne Conway, from Glasgow, was being confused on Facebook her with US namesake at Trump HQ - a Republican Party campaign manager. Ms Conway told BBC Scotland she could see the funny side after she received an array of ""strange"" emails including one that thanked her for ""boarding the Trump train!"". Scottish Kellyanne Conway (left) and the other Kellyanne Conway (right) She said messages had been sent to her intermittently throughout the US presidential race, but she was inundated when Mr Trump won the election.

Jenny Hill: Germany's rising tide of populism,"Germany's Baltic coastline can be a bleak place out of season. In the small fishing village of Freest, boats creak idly against their moorings. A lone fisherman, stark in his yellow overalls, stands on deck, scraping the scales from yesterday's catch. It feels a long way from Berlin. And inside the quayside smokehouse, as she carefully threads sprats on to long metal skewers, fish factory worker Ines tells me she feels forgotten by Angela Merkel's government. ""They just look after the big cities,"" she says. ""But these small communities up here - no. Nothing is being done for us. Nothing gets through to us."" It can be hard to make a good living here, especially in the winter. The workers in the smokehouse worry about unemployment. This is not a rich community and they feel it's time for political change. Fertile ground then for Germany's right wing, anti-Islam party Alternative for Germany (AfD). A regular poll for the national broadcaster suggests it would take 15% of the vote if the general election was held tomorrow. Ines. who works in a smoked fish factory, says she feels forgotten by the German government The party may well complicate coalition building come the autumn. Angela Merkel's CDU party still leads those polls at 37%, but her junior coalition partner, the SPD, is at 20% Roland delivers another load of slippery, silvery fish to the smokehouse. He pushes his woolly cap off and tells me AfD will be getting his vote. ""The other parties avoid the real problems,"" he explains. ""Merkel just sticks to her views, even though she sees what she's got us into - like the terror attacks. If she hadn't brought those people into the country,"" he insists, ""the victims of the Berlin Christmas markets would still be alive."" What does Alternative for Germany want? Angela Merkel's CDU suffers Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania poll blow Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Profile: German right-wing AfD leader Frauke Petry Freest is in the northern state of Mecklenburg Vorpommern. It is also home to Mrs Merkel's constituency. Last year AfD beat her Conservatives into third place in the regional election and now, they want to compound that humiliation by putting up a candidate - Leif-Erik Holm - directly against her. Mr Holm, a smartly-dressed former radio presenter who believes a large proportion of Europe's Muslims hold radical views and want to establish a global caliphate, is, in reality, unlikely to take the chancellor's seat. But it's not impossible. ""We have a big problem with radical Islam and we need to talk about it,"" he tells me. ""It's been taboo in Germany. The AfD broke that taboo and thank heavens people now talk about their fears. Just look at who's carrying out terror attacks in Europe, they're all extreme Islamists."" ""We don't create fear. We talk about it,"" says the AfD's Leif-Erik Holm It is AfD's vociferous anti-Islam, anti-migrant position which, critics argue, is key to its success. Certainly, support for what originally began as an anti-euro party surged during the latter part of the refugee crisis, as party leaders began to campaign against Mrs Merkel's asylum policy. But Mr Holm rejects the notion that AfD is a one issue party, seeking political gain by whipping up fear of Muslim immigrants. ""During the regional election hustings we spoke with people in small towns and villages and realised fear was the most prominent theme. We don't create fear, we talk about it - the everyday fear that people have of terrorism, of uncontrolled mass immigration. ""That's what we work with as politicians. We make politics for the people."" Geert Wilders, Frauke Petry and Marine Le Pen recently shared a platform in the German city of Koblenz AfD's anti-EU rhetoric is also growing louder as it seeks to emulate the success of the giants of Europe's far right. It recently hosted a rally of the right in the German city of Koblenz, sharing a stage - and a platform - with the French presidential candidate Marine le Pen and Geert Wilders, whose Freedom Party leads the polls ahead of the Dutch general election. Both Ms Le Pen and Mr Wilders have pledged referendums on EU membership. AfD's manifesto now promises to pull Germany out if significant structural reforms are not implemented. During the rally (from which the mainstream German broadcasters and press were banned) its leader Frauke Petry likened the EU to Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union and joined Ms Le Pen and Mr Wilders in their calls for a revolution in Europe. This was a show of solidarity, a display of unity from Europe's right. Emboldened by Brexit and Donald Trump's victory, the leaders are keen to focus on the threefold message which unites them; a visceral dislike of Islam, a loathing of Mrs Merkel's refugee policy and that contempt for the EU. And they believe 2017 will be their year. Angela Merkel is to stand for a fourth term as chancellor It's hard to say whether they create, reflect or exploit social division, but an interesting recent German survey gave a fascinating glimpse into what might motivate AfD supporters. The poll found, for example, that despite last year's terror attack in Berlin, 73% of those polled felt safe in Germany. But when the researchers asked AfD supporters, they found that only 34% felt secure. Similarly, when asked whether life is better or worse than 50 years ago, 17% of Germans said it is worse, but this figure rises to 40% among AfD supporters. In 2017, Europe's real election battles will take place in communities like Freest, where people feel forgotten by their national governments and left behind by establishment parties. If Europe's leaders want to halt the rise of the right, they must reconnect with those voters and regain their trust. Because in this windblown harbour on the German coast, those who feel left out in the cold are warming to what Europe's right already refer to (prematurely perhaps) as the ""patriotic spring"". This article is part of the 100 Days season, presented by Katty Kay and Christian Fraser, Monday - Thursday at 19:00 GMT on BBC News Channel, BBC Fourand BBC World News.

Trump's weapon in trade war,"There is a three letter word that ends in ""x"" which gets people hot under the collar and is a big part of most relationships. That word is of course tax. While the headlines from Donald Trump's first 12 days in office have focused on immigration and security, business leaders seem agreed that some of the most profound changes to the role of the US in the global economy will come about via tax reform. It is easy for eyes to glaze over at the mention of tax. Not only is it an unsexy subject, there have also been many false alarms sounding the imminent overhaul of a tax system that all parts of the political spectrum agree needs fixing. The US has some of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. At 35% it is nearly double the UK rate of 20% and that has seen US companies go to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying it. Although US companies pay 35% tax on profits generated in the US, it is only payable on profits made outside the US when those profits are repatriated. That is why those foreign earnings never do make it home. Some $2.5 trillion of US corporate profits are living in exile. They are lapping round the borders of low-tax jurisdictions like Ireland and Luxembourg, or squirrelled away among the palm trees in no-tax hideaways like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands. Donald Trump believes that dormant cash should come home to boost the US economy and he is proposing a tax amnesty - a one off charge of just 10% on repatriated cash - to achieve just that. That sounds simple. It is not, according to Professor Christopher Smart, a former trade and investment advisor to Barack Obama, and a senior fellow at Chatham House, a leading international affairs think tank. ""The potential is for a great deal of instability both on financial markets and politically,"" he says. ""On financial markets a large amount of money moving quickly tends to destabilise things but the real political issue is the potential for retaliation. ""Barriers we have been removing over the last ten to twenty years start to go back up again. We could get trade skirmishes, we could get a trade war,"" the professor warns. The second part of Donald Trump's tax plan could be even more provocative. As well as a one-off amnesty for exiled profits, the new president's plan involves slashing the headline rate of US corporation tax to 15% from 35%. At the same time he wants to impose taxes on imports to encourage companies to locate production in the US. A border tax on US cars made in Mexico is just one example of a policy that would have profound, and many say chaotic, ramifications. Retailers, for example, would find it almost impossible to make a profit on imported goods. John Viemeyer, the global chairman of the huge accountancy firm KPMG, sounds a similar warning. ""You can't look at US tax in a vacuum, you push here and there will be equal and opposite reactions,"" he says. ""There's been a lot of talk about border taxes on imports that US companies use in their production, that in itself could certainly cause a trade war"" To many observers, President Trump's spat with Mexico is just a bit of sparring before the heavyweight clash with China. There are many close to the new president who think the current relationship is unfair and needs to change. Anthony Scaramucci, a senior adviser to the president, told the BBC recently at the World Economic Forum gathering in Switzerland that the relationship with China was ""asymmetrical"", and that he was doubtful of China's ability to exact revenge on the US. ""What are they going to do, [are] they going to move against our move for fairness?"" he asked, pointedly. ""That's going to cost them way more than it is ever going to cost us, and I think they know that."" Who wins a US-China trade war? That is simple, according to Christopher Smart. ""No-one. There is huge fallout for the United States and for China and frankly for the global economy,"" he says. Who said tax was boring?

Is Trump's immigration order legal?,"A lawyer holds a sign offering his services to those affected by President Trump's immigration order, at Los Angeles International Airport Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may have offered the most prescient reaction to President Donald Trump's executive order suspending refugee resettlement and blocking individuals from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. ""It's going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far,"" he said. To make matters worse for Mr Trump, he has had difficulties with his own Justice Department. Hefired acting US Attorney General Sally Yatesafter she questioned the legality of the immigration ban. Ms Yates was replaced by Dana Boente, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who has directed the department to enforce Mr Trump's order. Even with government lawyers on his side, Mr Trump's presidential authority on immigration issues is broad, but it's not without limitations - and those limitations are interpreted and enforced by the US judicial system. In the case of Mr Trump's immigration action, that's already happening. This video can not be played Trump voters say US president is 'doing a fabulous job' In the days after Mr Trump signed the executive order, federal judges in four states granted the request of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for temporary injunctions prohibiting individuals who were detained at US airports from being sent back to their countries of origin. ""The petitioners have a strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and others similarly situated violates their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution,"" New York federal judge Ann Donnelly writes in her court decision. Then, on 3 February, a judge in Seattle went one step farther, responding to a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota with a national injunction suspending implementation of Mr Trump's immigration order in its entirety, pending a trial on its merits. ""At the end of the day, either you're abiding by the Constitution or you are not,"" Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said. ""And in our view, the president is not adhering to the Constitution when it comes to this executive action."" Thousands join anti-Trump protests Diplomats' dissent falls on deaf ears Amateur hour at the White House? Although the rulings have been heralded as victories for Mr Trump's opponents, they are temporary in nature. The major frontal assaults on the order are still in their infancy. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair)has also filed,externala legal case against what it terms the ""Muslim Exclusion Order"" on behalf of a group of Muslim-Americans and unnamed citizens of nations covered by the ban currently residing in the US. This video can not be played President Trump: ""A very good day"" The ACLU, fresh off its injunction success, is also gunning to take down the entire order. Here are some of the ways they're building their cases. Washington state, Cair, and others argue that by implicitly singling out those of the Muslim faith, Mr Trump's order amounts to an establishment of a state religion, in violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. (""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.""). This video can not be played White House makes ultimatum to diplomats They cite comments by Mr Trump on the campaign trail, and his political surrogates, along with the exemption that the immigration order provides for religious minorities as evidence of discriminatory intent - even though the order did not mention Muslims or Christians by name. Although Mr Trump backed away from his pledge to ban US entry to all Muslims,writes,externalthe ACLU's David Cole, he ""never gave up his focus on the religion of Islam. Friday's executive orders are of a piece with his many anti-Muslim campaign promises."" Mr Trump's challengers also argue the action violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of ""due process of the law"" by denying entry to individuals who have valid visas. ""The very concept of due process emerged from a desire to limit the king's ability to order unlawful arrests,"" writes Mark Joseph Stern in Slate. ""It appears we are returning to the days when the head of state can detain purported threats without a whiff of evidence that they have broken a law."" The conservative counter-argument to these claims is straightforward. Foreign nationals on foreign soil have no grounds for claiming constitutional protections. ""Foreigners have no right under our Constitution to demand entry to the United States or to challenge any reason we might have to refuse them entry, even blatant religious discrimination,""writes,externalDan McLaughlin in the National Review. In his order, Mr Trump quotes a 1952 immigration law that gives the president the ability to suspend entry ""of all aliens or any class of aliens"" into the US when he deems it ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" A 1965 revision of the law, however, says individuals cannot be ""discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa"" because of their ""race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence"". This video can not be played Donald Trump supporters give their views on the ban from New York's Staten Island David J Beir, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute,contends,externalthat this language means discriminating against immigrants based on where they are from - whether it's Iraq, Sudan or Canada - is illegal. ""Mr Trump may want to revive discrimination based on national origin by asserting a distinction between 'the issuance of a visa' and the 'entry' of the immigrant,"" he writes. ""But this is nonsense. Immigrants cannot legally be issued a visa if they are barred from entry."" He did note, however, that the language applies only to immigrants. Tourists, students and other temporary residents could still be kept out. Mr Beir's view is far from universal, however. Andrew McCarthy,writing,externalin the National Review, says presidential power supersedes congressional legislation in this case. Demonstrators protest against President Trump outside the US Supreme Court ""At issue is a matter related to the conduct of foreign affairs - a matter of the highest order of importance since it involves foreign threats to national security,"" he writes. ""If there were a conflict here, the president's clear constitutional authority to protect the United States would take precedence over Congress's dubious authority to limit the president's denial of entry to foreign nationals."" He also contends that when Congress passed - and President Barack Obama signed - legislation exempting individuals who had visited the seven countries in question from the Visa Waiver Programme, it was effectively authorising discrimination based on country of origin, at least for those particular nations. Cair is also arguing that Mr Trump's order violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which says a government action can't be ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law"" or ""unsupported by substantial evidence"". It's a particular provision that has been used tostrike down,externalpast executive actions by President George W Bush and Mr Obama. Internationallaw During a phone call with Mr Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the president his immigration order may also run afoul of international commitments. A protester holds up a sign outside the highest court in the land ""The Geneva refugee convention requires the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds,"" Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibertwrote,externalin a statement. ""All signatory states are obligated to do. The German government explained this policy in their call yesterday."" At least so far, no lawsuits have been brought challenging the order on this grounds - although the US Supreme Court has the power to strike down a law or presidential action as contrary to US obligations under international treaties. ""The US has signed and ratified a number of international treaties that prohibit religious and race discrimination in the operation of legal systems, and this extends to operating a migration system in line with international non-discrimination protections,"" writes Liam Thornton of the University College Dublin. Some Supreme Court justices have also cited international consensus as informing their interpretation of US law and constitutional principles - although it's a view that has been roundly criticised in conservative legal circles. Opponents of Mr Trump's immigration action feel confident that they have a solid legal case against the measure - and there certainly is precedent for federal courts throwing a wrench in the best-laid plans of presidents. In February 2015, a judge in the south Texas town of Brownsville issued an injunction preventing implementation of President Obama's efforts to offer normalised immigration status to the undocumented families of US citizens and permanent residents. It took more than a year for the case to reach the US Supreme Court, which then deadlocked on whether to uphold the injunction. The case is still in legal limbo. All it requires is one judge friendly to the challengers to work a similar number on Mr Trump's actions - and Mr Trump's opponents appear to have found one in Seattle's James Robart. If the appeals courts uphold his stay, it could be a while before the immigration order is re-instated, even if the administration ends up prevailing in the end.

May under pressure over Trump visit,"The main story in almost all the papers remains Donald Trump's controversial travel ban, and whether his invitation to come to Britain on a state visit should stand. The Daily Mirror,externalsays 10,000 protesters marched on Downing Street. It says they showed their strength of feeling against a ""disgraceful"" ban. The Times cartoonist draws a grumpy looking Queen holding a briefing paper entitled, ""Trump state visit"". ""One suddenly feels tempted to build a wall!"" she says.  In the background,  a corgi covers its eyes while Prince Charles is seen tapping his name into the online petition against the visit.Steve Bell in the Guardian,externaldraws the Queen in her state coach with Donald Trump; she is pawing at the windows to get out. The Sun says,externalthe hysteria in Britain is off the chart.  It points out that when a US president first targeted seven Muslim-majority countries in an anti-terror crackdown, no-one protested. Why? Because the president in question was Barack Obama, darling of the liberal left.  The Sun concludes it would be insane to make an enemy of Trump. The Daily Mail,externalhas a photo of the football presenter, Gary Lineker, on its front page, reporting that he joined the protests.  On the inside pages it is dismissive of celebrities taking up the cause.  ""Luvvies love a chance to appear right-on,"" it says. Most papers also look ahead to today's Commons debate on the European Union Bill. ""At last,""the Guardian says,external, ""Parliament moves to the centre of the Brexit process."" The paper believes it would be a mistake not to try to get in the way of Theresa May's self-imposed deadline of the end of March for triggering Brexit. TheDaily Telegraph,externalsays it can disclose that Conservative ministers and MPs have been told to stay in the Commons until midnight, amid fears of an ""ambush vote"" by pro-Remain MPs.

He wasturned down leaveto appeal against his conviction and sentence last year but has now launched a second bid. His case is due to be heard at the Court of Appeal on 28 February. Johnson's trial at Bradford Crown Court heard that he kissed and touched the schoolgirl in his Range Rover in a secluded spot in County Durham. He admitted grooming the girl and one charge of sexual activity relating to kissing her. The footballer abused the girl in his car after she asked for a signed shirt A jury found him guilty of sexual touching. He was cleared of one charge relating to another sexual act. Judge Jonathan Rose told him there had been ""an abuse of trust - you are trusted by young fans to behave properly"" and ordered him to pay Â£50,000 of the prosecution's Â£67,132 costs. Children's charity the NSPCC also condemned Johnson after his trial, saying: ""Adam Johnson cynically used his celebrity status as a professional footballer to groom and sexually abuse an impressionable schoolgirl. ""His behaviour throughout was inexcusable, made even worse by the fact his not guilty pleas forced his young victim to suffer the harrowing experience of giving evidence in court.""

'Don't see that portrayed',"Jacob Boehme has put his experiences of being a gay, indigenous, HIV-positive man into a solo show Jacob Boehme remembers when he knew something was seriously wrong. It was 1998 and Boehme had had a nagging cold for months. An Aboriginal elder ""sat me in the middle of her legs and started to sing over me"", he recalls. Performing a healing ceremony, she wiped the sweat from his armpits and smothered it on his head and neck. Eventually, she muttered: ""Ahh, you need to go to a Western doctor. Everything is red. I cannot help you."" Boehme was diagnosed with HIV. In an era when antiretroviral treatments were in their infancy, it was the first news of its kind his doctor had delivered. ""He was choked up and almost crying,"" Boehme says. ""I had to console him."" Now 43, Boehme is not only still alive, he has put his experiences of being a gay, indigenous, HIV-positive man into a solo show. Blood on the Dance Floor, which just played at the Sydney Festival, explores what our understanding of blood means, from heritage to health. Combining storytelling and dance, the work includes a skit on being a camp ""gay elder"" in drag, discussion of stigma around HIV in the gay community (particularly when trying to find a partner), and moments when Boehme is framed, moving, against streams of blood, with bubbling red cells projected against the wall. Most important, he says, is rewriting the conversation on what being HIV-positive means. Why talk of a cure for HIV is premature HIV 'game-changer' now on NHS Boehme's show features a projection representing blood cells ""Anything shown in the media or entertainment, it's always been some kind of memorialisation of the Aids crisis back in the '80s. Everybody dies,"" he elaborates. ""That's not relevant to me and to many of the other men and women that I know living with HIV. There isn't an image of a healthy functioning person with employment and prospects - you don't see that portrayed anywhere."" Another key step, he says, is broadening our understanding of who suffers from the virus. According to the University of New South Wales, notification rates (the reporting of newly-diagnosed cases) of indigenous men with HIV doubled in the past five years from 6.2 per 100,000 to 12.4 per 100,000. In contrast, non-indigenous notification rates fell by 12%,said the report by the university's Kirby Institute,external. Despite this, education campaigns largely remain directed towards white men, says Boehme. ""Tell me the last time you saw an HIV education campaign with someone from the Aboriginal, Asian or African identity on those posters? You just see gay white men in their underwear,"" he points out. ""It makes quite a lot of people feel completely dismissed and it's not just the gay male community - it's heterosexual males living with HIV, kids living with HIV too. It's never been a gay white man's disease."" Born in Melbourne to a non-indigenous mother and father from the Narungga and Kaurna peoples of South Australia, Boehme knew he was gay from the age of four. The dancer - who is the incoming creative director of the Melbourne Indigenous Arts Festival - has always had the support of his family. Boehme uses blood to explore themes of heritage and health Others are often not as lucky. In some Aboriginal communities, stigma towards homosexuality remains, insists Boehme. ""When you go into communities that are very much still holding up the values of the old mission days, that's when you get a problem, through those Christian and very Victorian ideas of sex, gender and sexuality,"" he says. Blood on the Dance Floor was dreamed up after rehearsals in a warehouse. Boehme was ""obsessed about my blood, about the cleanliness of my blood"". After nicking his heel on an exposed nail, ""I sat back down and realised I left a trail of blood on the dance floor. And [my friend] went 'ah, there's your title'."" ""Blood, it's a life force that connects us, it can be used to define us and can be used to discriminate, to separate, or to actually unite,"" Boehme says. When writing the show, the artist kept a small crystal decanter of his own blood on his desk. ""Suddenly I was connected to my dad, then my grandmother, then a whole line of our ancestors that I never met and through that, those voices started to then speak through me. In that blood, in those codes, there are thousands of generations sitting in that little decanter."" Boehme says blood connects him to his past and, above all, to his illness. But it also releases him. ""Regardless of what features or skin colour we have, really our blood is the thing that ties us together,"" he says. The artist is set to begin as creative director of the Melbourne Indigenous Arts Festival A particularly raw moment in Blood on the Dance Floor touches on the suicide of Boehme's friend in 1996 after discovering he was HIV-positive. It was a time when ""there was still this spectre hanging around like it was a death sentence. There was a lot more shame around HIV and he just couldn't cope."" Boehme still remembers when he found out. His friend's boyfriend, drunk, announced at a dinner party that his partner was positive. ""I looked at him. And he said, 'I don't want that look. I don't want anyone's pity. Don't you dare give me that look.'"" Just two years later - as antiretroviral drugs were being rolled out to the larger population - Boehme received his own diagnosis. In Australia in the 1990s around 1,000 people died each year of Aids. Today, deaths are so low they are not recorded. ""That's exactly why I insisted we honour him,"" Boehme says of his friend. ""He didn't get a chance."" If you are feeling emotionally distressed and would like details of organisations in the UK which offer advice and support, go online tobbc.co.uk/actionline.

Ocado trials fruit-picking robot,"Online grocer Ocado has shown off a soft robotic hand that can pick fruit and vegetables, without damaging them, in its warehouses. The firm has an automated warehouse in Andover, Hampshire, where robots select crates containing specific items that make up customer orders. They are currently brought over to a human team for selection but, in future, the hand could replace them. Also in development is a humanoid maintenance robot called SecondHands. It will work alongside a human colleague to maintain the warehouse. SecondHands, the robot maintenance technician, with its human colleague The fruit and vegetable picker is part of a five-year research EU-funded collaboration between five European universities and Disney calledSoma (Soft Manipulation),external, said Ocado spokesman Alexandru Voica. The demonstration device is an early prototype, he said. ""People have tried suction cups, robot hands with three fingers... What we are trying to do is to actually mimic the human hand. ""The gripper is based on air pressure, which controls the movement of the robotic fingers. ""What we are trying to do is combine computer vision - being able to recognise products by looking at them - with the control aspect which is the gripping aspect."" At the moment, only the gripper is being demonstrated but ultimately the robot will learn to distinguish fruit ripeness through machine learning. It will also be able to pick other items which require different care - such as wine bottles and detergent. ""Fruit and vegetables are the hardest to pick,"" said Mr Voica. ""When the customer gets their bag of bananas or tomatoes, if they see the product is damaged they don't care whether it's a human or a robot that's picked it."" The robot warehouse contains crates containing various goods which the robots select Prof Chris Melhuish, director of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, said that building robotic devices - or manipulators - to carry out multiple tasks is difficult. ""A general purpose manipulator is a really tough thing to build, and certainly understanding and exploiting the way the human hand functions, because it is so flexible and adaptive, makes a lot of sense,"" he told the BBC. ""There are lots of groups that are looking at robotic manipulation but often it is for a specific purpose - picking up a concrete block is not the same as doing artificial suturing for example - so the tendency has been to build different types of manipulators for different domains.""

Down and anxious,"Molly Forbes is a sociable person - but became very lonely when she had a baby A commission started by murdered MP Jo Cox isinvestigating loneliness,externalin the UK, which it says is an epidemic affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. Here, two young women share their stories. In 2010 Molly Forbes had her first child, Freya. But after the birth she was confronted with something she had not prepared for: loneliness. A ""sociable person"", Molly - then 26 - was one of the first of her friends to have a baby. Her husband was out at work all day and she did not have any close family living by. ""The loneliness of being a new mother was a real surprise for me. It just hit me,"" she said. ""You're suddenly at home with a baby. You feel safer there so you stay home - but it makes you more isolated. ""When you go out, you want to be seen to be doing a good job and being happy. If you admit you're lonely, you might be labelled as not coping."" ""You want to be seen to be doing a good job and being happy"", says Molly The commission - planned by West Yorkshire Labour MP Jo Cox before she was murdered last June - says a fifth of the population privately admit they are ""always or often lonely"". But two-thirds of those would never confess to having a problem in public, it says Molly, from Devon, said that rather than being honest about how she was feeling, she had ""put a brave face on - and that can make you more lonely"". ""Looking back, I was definitely feeling quite anxious. ""I was worrying about money, about whether I'd go back to my job - and when you don't have someone to talk to, these worries can spiral out of control."" Molly had lots of friends, but found she couldn't talk to them about her post-baby concerns. That was when she started writing ablog,external. ""I made connections with other mums online, and from there I started meeting up with people and found friends that way."" The commission says three-quarters of people who are lonely on a regular basis do not know where to turn for support. It is looking for practical solutions to beat loneliness. Molly's advice for new mums? ""Spend time making friends with other pregnant women, so you have a support network ready to go once the baby is born."" Find other mums to provide a support network, Molly says Parents - Action for Children found 24% of parents surveyed werealways or often lonely,external Teenagers - 62% are'sometimes lonely',externaland one in 20 never spend time with friends at weekends Carers - 8 out of 10 carers havefelt lonely or isolated,externalas a result of looking after a loved one Refugees and migrants - 58% of those surveyed in Londoncited lonelines,externals and isolation as their biggest challenge The elderly - 1 in 3 people aged 75 and over say that feelings of loneliness areout of their control,external The deafblind charity Sense has said that up tohalf of disabled people,externalwill be lonely on any given day Have you experienced loneliness? Do you have advice or tips about how to deal with feeling isolated? Email your comments tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Talking is key, says Michelle For Michelle Ornstein, who has a learning disability, there is nothing worse than being alone. ""When I'm here on my own, I feel really down and anxious,"" she said. The 22-year-old, from Essex, said her anxieties had got worse in recent years, leading her to leave college. There had been an incident on the school bus, where Michelle was wearing her hearing aids close to a group of people being loud. ""I just burst out in tears on the bus. I got myself so worked up and thought this is it. I can't do this,"" Michelle said. ""At one point I couldn't be left on my own at all, I wouldn't let [my parents] out the door."" Spending time out of the house and with friends can be key to countering loneliness but, Rossanna Trudgian, Head of Campaigns at Mencap explained, almost a third of youngsters with learning disabilities spend less than an hour outside their homes on a Saturday. ""Social isolation and fear of negative attitudes can remain huge barriers towards feeling welcome and included in society,"" she said. But things have got better for Michelle. Talking things through with her family has helped - and this week, she starts a new course. Michelle's advice is ""talk"". She said: ""If you keep it to yourself, you will bottle it up and build up more anxieties and won't go out."" Michelle is by no means the only young person experiencing loneliness. The Mix,externalis an online support service for under-25s. This year, it has seen a 26% rise in the numbers of those accessing their loneliness support service, compared to the previous year. Jo Cox had begun setting up the commission before she was murdered in her constituency last June Community manager James Pickstone said loneliness was ""an underlying issue"" shared by many people who visit the service, even though it was ""rarely discussed openly"". He said: ""We see a lot of young people feeling isolated at college and university, living away from home and not having the social life expected and associated with the university experience."" And younger people can experience loneliness differently from how older adults do. Prof Graham Davey from the University of Sussex explained: ""Younger people appear to be focused on friendship networks - the number of relationships they have - and experience loneliness as a function of the fewer friends they have."" And in today's society, friendship networks are represented nowhere more obviously than on social media. ""Whether you perceive yourself to be a successful user of social media is likely to have an impact on feelings of loneliness, anxiety, paranoia and mental health generally,"" the psychology professor said. But you won't find too many status updates about feeling lonely because ultimately - Prof Davey argued - loneliness has a stigma and ""few people want to admit they're lonely"".

High end survival,"This video can not be played ""We took a weapon of mass destruction and turned it into the complete opposite,"" says Larry Hall Larry Hall leads the way out of the elevator and into an apartment, one of several in a new development that he has recently built. The space is elegantly furnished. Mr Hall says the standard of the finishes and attention to detail has met with an enthusiastic response from his customers. ""When they come here for their walkthroughs and the closings, I've had several clients that literally cried when they saw it - with joy."" But there's something very unusual about these dwellings. They are situated many metres below ground in an obsolete nuclear missile site, in the middle of Kansas in the US. Mr Hall calls his development Survival Condos. ""These are luxury, nuclear-hardened bunkers that are engineeredâ¦ to accommodate not just your physical protection but your mental wellbeing as well,"" he says. Larry Hall has already completed one complex and has just started work on another Despite the fact that the apartments cost millions of dollars each to buy, starting at $1.5m (Â£1.2m), Mr Hall says he is seeing strong demand from wealthy customers. It seems extraordinary, not least because nearby above-ground homes (admittedly without protection against nuclear bombs) can be had for a tiny fraction of the cost of one of these bunker units. So how has he managed to build an apparently successful business selling ""survival chic""? It all began after the 9/11 attacks in New York in 2001. At the time Mr Hall was an entrepreneur with an internet business; he also had experience of designing and constructing computer data centres. Demand for computer back-up facilities grew after the terrible events of 9/11, says Mr Hall. This gave him an idea: make a data centre that could withstand a nuclear bomb attack. ""It's like a miniature cruise ship,"" is how Larry Hall describes the interiors of the nuclear bunker Potential clients showed interest in such a facility. It was a short step from this to the notion of offering bunkers that could give long-term protection for residents against nuclear war or other disasters. The Kansas site eventually chosen for the venture used to house an intercontinental ballistic missile. There are many such abandoned missile launch bases across the mid-West, but Mr Hall says only a small number were in a fit state to be realistic prospects for the project. Even then, he says, the construction and engineering challenges involved in building the facility were daunting. Still, the site had one huge advantage - it came with built-in protection against nuclear bomb blasts. If you had to build this element from scratch today, ""you'd better have a very thick cheque book, it's very expensive,"" Mr Hall says. The bunkers include window-like high definition screens displaying views of what is happening above ground Mr Hall says he has spent millions on providing the complex with every possible feature to keep residents safe both now and for an indefinite period, should a catastrophic event occur. These include air and water filtration systems, a range of energy sources (including wind power), and the capacity to grow plants and breed fish for food supplies. Armed guards patrol the entrance. They also include access to a communal swimming pool There are many other features too, such as a cinema, swimming pool, surgery, golf range, and even a rock climbing wall. ""It's like a miniature cruise ship,"" says Mr Hall. He believes that luxury touches like these could help to explain a development that may seem a little surprising. At first, he says, clients saw owning an apartment as ""like life insurance"",  just something to be used in case of an emergency. But now some purchasers have come to regard their apartments as second homes, making regular use of them for weekends or longer breaks. ""Everyone comments on how well they sleep here,"" he adds. The outside and inside of the nuclear bunkers are constantly monitored Mr Hall is by no means the only player in the specialist market for survival bunkers, with rivals offering facilities at several locations across the globe. But with his use of luxury elements, experts say, Mr Hall is exploiting a growing trend. ""There's a market now because the traditional idea that somehowâ¦ you should 'rough it for the sake of your soul' is disappearing,"" says Peter York, an adviser to many large luxury businesses. In this market, he says, ""you're hitting a cohort of rich people who don't value the idea of even temporary Spartan-ness - they want everything to be luxurious all the time."" Even though he may be pushing at an open door, Mr Hall says he faces many challenges in running his business, over and above the obvious difficulties of building the facilities in the first place. One of the biggest issues is marketing. His clients, many of whom are wealthy, tend to be secretive. ""Saying that you own a bunker apparently, for whatever reason, is just like saying you saw a UFO. A lot of these people have learned that they don't want other people to know that they have a bunker,"" he says. Then there is the question of how residents would get along together in the aftermath of a catastrophic event. ""It's a lot of fun building these,"" says Larry Hall Mr Hall says he has put a lot of effort into researching the psychological aspects, with the aim of ensuring that the underground community would function well in times of calamity. Measures taken include special lighting, and varying ceiling heights, with high ceilings in communal areas, and lower ones in the medical wing ""where people may feel vulnerable"", says Mr Hall. In a long-term situation where the complex was secured against the outside world, residents would rotate various jobs on a monthly basis. ""One month you might be working in the general store, the next month you'd be working in the hydroponics, tending the plants,"" says Mr Hall. This would help to keep people occupied, as well as ensuring that, over time, ""they have a complete understanding of the facility"". Despite the challenges involved, Mr Hall appears to enjoy himself, with one complex already completed, and another one well under way. ""It's a lot of fun building these,"" he says.

Why is the US Supreme Court so important?,"Ginsburg was the second woman to sit on the Supreme Court The death of liberal judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the age of 87 has raised questions over the future direction of the US Supreme Court. Ginsburg, a prominent feminist and key liberal voice, served on the court for 27 years. Each of the nine judges - known as justices - serves a lifetime appointment after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. But with just six weeks until the 3 November presidential election between incumbent President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee and former Vice-President Joe Biden, a Supreme Court vacancy adds another controversial turn to an already fiercely contested campaign. Vicious court fight could upend US election Who are the current justices? Meet the Supremes How has Trump's Supreme Court changed America? So what is the Supreme Court and who will pick Ginsburg's successor? The highest court in the US is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. It hears fewer than 100 cases a year and the key announcements are made in June. Mourners have paid tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsburg Cases are usually brought to the court after they are appealed from a series of lower courts, although in time-sensitive cases, lawyers can petition for a hearing. The court's opinions can also create precedents, directing other judges to follow their interpretation in similar cases. In recent years, the court has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, allowed for President Donald Trump's travel ban to be put in place and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward. While a majority of Supreme Court cases do not break on ideological lines, there are conservative and liberal wings and key cases have been decided by just one vote. Ginsburg herself voted for progressive issues in the court, including upholding key parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and legalising same-sex marriage. The supreme court justices pictured in 2018 Since his election in 2016, President Donald Trump has picked two new justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Before Ginsburg's death, the court was seen to have a 5-4 conservative majority, leading to what some have called the most conservative-leaning court in modern US history. However, US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who was nominated by a Republican president, has sided with the four liberal justices on several rulings, including a case involving abortion. Supreme Court justices are appointed by the president - but in an election year, the key question is whether the decision should be made before or after the new presidential term begins. This video can not be played Trump and Biden react to Ginsburg death In 2016, Republicans in the Senate blocked the confirmation hearing for a justice nominated by Barack Obama, saying that no appointment should be made during an election year. President Trump nominated a conservative judge, Neil Gorsuch, to fill the vacancy within days of taking office in January 2017. President Trump is expected to name a conservative replacement for Ginsburg as soon as possible,White House sources told BBC partner CBS News,external. However, Ginsburg strongly disapproved of such a move. ""My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,"" she wrote in a statement to her granddaughter,according to National Public Radio,external. Joe Biden, who served as vice-president to Barack Obama, has also rejected the idea. ""Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg,"" he wrote on Twitter. US research suggests that the influence of the Supreme Court abroad has diminished over the past two decades, as court systems elsewhere in the world develop and US influence in general wanes. Fewer courts internationally cite US Supreme Court opinions, increasingly citing the European Court of Human Rights and other national supreme courts. In 2016 a Supreme Court decision on emissions from coal-fired power plants on US soil threatened the Paris Climate Agreement, but enough other countries ratified the treaty for it to come into force. Donald Trump's controversial travel ban, which affects Middle East countries designated as terror-prone, was cemented by the Supreme Court, with the outcome affecting millions internationally. And back in 2000, the Supreme Court decided the outcome of the presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore - a decision which more recent history shows still has a significant impact around the world.

Quebec attack: Who were the victims?,"From left to right: Khaled Belkacemi, Azzedine Soufiane, and Aboubaker Thabti Canadian police have charged a 27-year-old man over the deadly shooting at a Quebec City mosque on Sunday. The six worshippers who died were immigrants who had moved to Quebec to seek a better life. Mr Belkacemi studied chemical engineering in his native Algeria before moving to Canada in the 1980s.  He taught food science at Quebec's Laval University and was married to a fellow professor there. His wife was also at the mosque when the shooting occurred during Sunday prayers, but she escaped unhurt. The head of Laval's food science department, Jean-Claude Dufour, described Mr Belkacemi as ""an extraordinary person"" who was ""always smiling"" and ""an outstanding teacher who loved his graduate students"". Mr Soufiane was born in Morocco and settled in Quebec three decades ago. He ran a halal shop in the suburb of Sainte-Foy and is described as a important member of the local Muslim community. Karim Elabed, an imam in nearby Levis, said Mr Soufiane had helped many newcomers in Quebec City.  ""When I arrived here eight years ago, [his shop] was the first place I learned about and pretty much all of Quebec's Muslims did their groceries there,"" Mr Elabed told Canadian media. Abdelkrim Hassane studied information technology in Algeria before emigrating. A colleague quoted by the Globe and Mail newspaper said Mr Hassane had lived in Paris and Montreal before settling in Quebec City. Mr Hassane worked as a programmer for the Quebec government. The colleague, Abderrezak Redouane, said he was ""a very peaceful, sensitive man"". He had three children. The two men, described as brothers by Radio Canada, were born in Guinea in West Africa. They are described as IT workers. Mamadou Tanou was a father of two and was reportedly sending money home to Guinea. ""Tanou lost his father three years ago, so it became his responsibility to support not only his family here but also his family in Africa. Now that's all been cut,"" a family friend told the Globe and Mail. Ibrahima worked for the province's health-insurance agency and had four children. Born in Tunisia, Mr Thabti is reported to have moved to Quebec a decade ago and worked in a pharmacy. He was married with two young children, his brother said on Facebook. A friend, Abder Dhakkar, told the Globe and Mail: ""He's so kind; everyone loves him - everyone.""

Virtual rock god,"Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody was turned into a VR fantasy mixing real footage with animation Imagine finding yourself on a futuristic stage with rock legends Queen as they blast out their greatest hit, Bohemian Rhapsody. A neon-rendered Freddie Mercury struts around you. Well, now that fantasy experience can be a reality - albeit a virtual one. Last year Queen collaborated with Google Play and Enosis VR to create a360-degree virtual reality (VR) take,externalon the groundbreaking video for the band's 1975 hit. This video is often credited with fuelling the boom in pop videos that characterised the 1980s. The interactive app uses 2D and 3D animations combined with motion-captured ballet dancers to immerse the viewer in the late Freddie Mercury's ""subconscious mind"". VR wizardry transports fans on to a virtual stage with the late Freddie Mercury The narrative changes based on where your gaze falls as you watch through your VR headset. The original song was also remixed and mastered to create an interactive audio experience, the sound changing as the viewer turns their head. So-called ""immersive"" technologies are transforming what used to be a marketing tool into a new revenue stream for an industry whose business model was decimated by digital 20 years ago. ""It's a powerful sensation to watch something in 360 degrees, far more so than to watch it on a flat, framed screen,"" says Dylan Southard, creative director at US design studio VR Playhouse. His firm has worked on 360-degree VR videos with artists such as US R&B singer Dawn Richard. Singer Dawn Richard worked with VR Playhouse on a VR video ""You're more present and so things are more heightened,"" says Mr Southard. ""It can be emotionally intense. You can feel as if you're right inside the story."" Although it is still early days for the technology - affordable VR headsets have only recently come on to the market - experimentation is rife in the music industry. Zach Fuller, paid content analyst at UK media and technology firm MIDiA Research, says VR is emerging in an increasingly ""visual-centric"" music landscape. 360-degree images from Biffy Clyro's single Flammable ""Examples are the accompanying film for Beyonce's Lemonade [album] and Frank Ocean's 'visual album' Endless, suggesting a strong future for visual music experiences that bodes well for VR,"" he says. In a world where consumers are able to stream songs anywhere at any time, standing out from the crowd is no mean feat. ""There's so much competition for attention, so anything that's new and potentially remarkable is going to get played with,"" says Ross Cairns, a UK-based creative director who worked on a VR video to accompany Biffy Clyro's single Flammable last summer. As well as giving music fans more exciting, immersive videos to watch, VR has great potential in the live music space as well. ""The sense of presence we can achieve in VR is incomparable to any other medium,"" says Jacek Naglowski, chief executive of Circus Digitalis, a Polish publisher that worked on one of the first cinematic VR music videos in Europe. ""Experiencing the concert in VR is something that people would be willing to pay for,"" he says. ""In future it may be one of the most important revenue streams for musicians and producers."" Special VR cameras record a Coldplay concert; live VR streaming could be a big money spinner Live concert and festival specialist Live Nation announced last year that it would be teaming up with US bank Citi and NextVR to create a series of VR live events. ""The obvious thing is to use this technology to open up live concerts to a wider audience and give them a better experience than just watching video in flat screen,"" says Tom Szirtes, creative technologist at UK digital design studio Mybronic. With arrays of cameras that can capture 360-degree images from a number of vantage points - including on stage - a VR live concert could be an even more thrilling experience than being there in person. The technology also offers bands the opportunity to perform live in a shared VR space, freeing them from the need to hire expensive venues. In 2014, UK indie rock band The Indelicates released a VR single, The Generation That Nobody Remembered. Vocalist Simon Clayton believes fans and other musicians could even play along. ""[Technology] could let us form bands in chatrooms with musicians from all over the world,"" he says. Mybronic is already experimenting in this space. ""Imagine a band projecting themselves into a computer-generated environment and allowing other people to connect,"" says Mr Szirtes. ""It opens up all sorts of interesting possibilities for artists to connect to new audiences in new ways."" Tyler Hurd's VR video for Future Islands' track Old Friend is a fully immersive experience The future will be about entering the musician's world, rather than simply engaging with an individual song. Anthony Batt, co-founder of US-based VR creative studio Wevr, says: ""The [VR experience] won't necessarily constantly entertain like a music video, but consumers will enter into the artist's space, into their gallery."" Wevr produced the VR video experience for the track Old Friend from the band Future Islands last year. VR Playhouse's Dylan Southard agrees: ""A pop star will be able to create a whole world that their fans can visit and interact with."" The challenge, as always, is making all this VR tech commercially viable. Users pay $2.99 (Â£2.40) to enjoy Wevr's Old Friend VR experience, and Mr Batt says sales are ""in the thousands"". Wevr also has a VR subscription network called Transport. ""In turn, we recycle that money back to the artists and musicians,"" he says. VR tech could give bands a virtual space in which to interact with their fans US company Vrtify specialises in taking traditional music content and transforming it into an immersive experience, paying 70% of its income back to artists. ""Immersive technologies aren't mainstream, but we all see how quickly they're evolving,"" says Marcus Behrendt, Vrtify's chief marketing officer. ""It will soon represent a very important income for the music industry because it is changing how fans are consuming music."" New revenue streams from advertising, membership subscriptions and pay-per-view are possible once the audience grows, he believes. But the tech needs to improve before this form of musical entertainment goes mainstream, Mybronic's Mr Szirtes argues. ""We need to have lighter, smaller, more comfortable headsets that are cheap to produce, combined with lots of great creative content that really understands the strengths of the medium.""

Is Trumpâs immigration order legal?,"A lawyer holds a sign offering his services to those affected by President Trump's immigration order, at Los Angeles International Airport Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may have offered the most prescient reaction to President Donald Trump's executive order suspending refugee resettlement and blocking individuals from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. ""It's going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far,"" he said. To make matters worse for Mr Trump, he has had difficulties with his own Justice Department. Hefired acting US Attorney General Sally Yatesafter she questioned the legality of the immigration ban. Ms Yates was replaced by Dana Boente, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who has directed the department to enforce Mr Trump's order. Even with government lawyers on his side, Mr Trump's presidential authority on immigration issues is broad, but it's not without limitations - and those limitations are interpreted and enforced by the US judicial system. In the case of Mr Trump's immigration action, that's already happening. This video can not be played Trump voters say US president is 'doing a fabulous job' In the days after Mr Trump signed the executive order, federal judges in four states granted the request of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for temporary injunctions prohibiting individuals who were detained at US airports from being sent back to their countries of origin. ""The petitioners have a strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and others similarly situated violates their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution,"" New York federal judge Ann Donnelly writes in her court decision. Then, on 3 February, a judge in Seattle went one step farther, responding to a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota with a national injunction suspending implementation of Mr Trump's immigration order in its entirety, pending a trial on its merits. ""At the end of the day, either you're abiding by the Constitution or you are not,"" Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said. ""And in our view, the president is not adhering to the Constitution when it comes to this executive action."" Thousands join anti-Trump protests Diplomats' dissent falls on deaf ears Amateur hour at the White House? Although the rulings have been heralded as victories for Mr Trump's opponents, they are temporary in nature. The major frontal assaults on the order are still in their infancy. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair)has also filed,externala legal case against what it terms the ""Muslim Exclusion Order"" on behalf of a group of Muslim-Americans and unnamed citizens of nations covered by the ban currently residing in the US. This video can not be played President Trump: ""A very good day"" The ACLU, fresh off its injunction success, is also gunning to take down the entire order. Here are some of the ways they're building their cases. Washington state, Cair, and others argue that by implicitly singling out those of the Muslim faith, Mr Trump's order amounts to an establishment of a state religion, in violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. (""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.""). This video can not be played White House makes ultimatum to diplomats They cite comments by Mr Trump on the campaign trail, and his political surrogates, along with the exemption that the immigration order provides for religious minorities as evidence of discriminatory intent - even though the order did not mention Muslims or Christians by name. Although Mr Trump backed away from his pledge to ban US entry to all Muslims,writes,externalthe ACLU's David Cole, he ""never gave up his focus on the religion of Islam. Friday's executive orders are of a piece with his many anti-Muslim campaign promises."" Mr Trump's challengers also argue the action violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of ""due process of the law"" by denying entry to individuals who have valid visas. ""The very concept of due process emerged from a desire to limit the king's ability to order unlawful arrests,"" writes Mark Joseph Stern in Slate. ""It appears we are returning to the days when the head of state can detain purported threats without a whiff of evidence that they have broken a law."" The conservative counter-argument to these claims is straightforward. Foreign nationals on foreign soil have no grounds for claiming constitutional protections. ""Foreigners have no right under our Constitution to demand entry to the United States or to challenge any reason we might have to refuse them entry, even blatant religious discrimination,""writes,externalDan McLaughlin in the National Review. In his order, Mr Trump quotes a 1952 immigration law that gives the president the ability to suspend entry ""of all aliens or any class of aliens"" into the US when he deems it ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" A 1965 revision of the law, however, says individuals cannot be ""discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa"" because of their ""race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence"". This video can not be played Donald Trump supporters give their views on the ban from New York's Staten Island David J Beir, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute,contends,externalthat this language means discriminating against immigrants based on where they are from - whether it's Iraq, Sudan or Canada - is illegal. ""Mr Trump may want to revive discrimination based on national origin by asserting a distinction between 'the issuance of a visa' and the 'entry' of the immigrant,"" he writes. ""But this is nonsense. Immigrants cannot legally be issued a visa if they are barred from entry."" He did note, however, that the language applies only to immigrants. Tourists, students and other temporary residents could still be kept out. Mr Beir's view is far from universal, however. Andrew McCarthy,writing,externalin the National Review, says presidential power supersedes congressional legislation in this case. Demonstrators protest against President Trump outside the US Supreme Court ""At issue is a matter related to the conduct of foreign affairs - a matter of the highest order of importance since it involves foreign threats to national security,"" he writes. ""If there were a conflict here, the president's clear constitutional authority to protect the United States would take precedence over Congress's dubious authority to limit the president's denial of entry to foreign nationals."" He also contends that when Congress passed - and President Barack Obama signed - legislation exempting individuals who had visited the seven countries in question from the Visa Waiver Programme, it was effectively authorising discrimination based on country of origin, at least for those particular nations. Cair is also arguing that Mr Trump's order violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which says a government action can't be ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law"" or ""unsupported by substantial evidence"". It's a particular provision that has been used tostrike down,externalpast executive actions by President George W Bush and Mr Obama. Internationallaw During a phone call with Mr Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the president his immigration order may also run afoul of international commitments. A protester holds up a sign outside the highest court in the land ""The Geneva refugee convention requires the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds,"" Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibertwrote,externalin a statement. ""All signatory states are obligated to do. The German government explained this policy in their call yesterday."" At least so far, no lawsuits have been brought challenging the order on this grounds - although the US Supreme Court has the power to strike down a law or presidential action as contrary to US obligations under international treaties. ""The US has signed and ratified a number of international treaties that prohibit religious and race discrimination in the operation of legal systems, and this extends to operating a migration system in line with international non-discrimination protections,"" writes Liam Thornton of the University College Dublin. Some Supreme Court justices have also cited international consensus as informing their interpretation of US law and constitutional principles - although it's a view that has been roundly criticised in conservative legal circles. Opponents of Mr Trump's immigration action feel confident that they have a solid legal case against the measure - and there certainly is precedent for federal courts throwing a wrench in the best-laid plans of presidents. In February 2015, a judge in the south Texas town of Brownsville issued an injunction preventing implementation of President Obama's efforts to offer normalised immigration status to the undocumented families of US citizens and permanent residents. It took more than a year for the case to reach the US Supreme Court, which then deadlocked on whether to uphold the injunction. The case is still in legal limbo. All it requires is one judge friendly to the challengers to work a similar number on Mr Trump's actions - and Mr Trump's opponents appear to have found one in Seattle's James Robart. If the appeals courts uphold his stay, it could be a while before the immigration order is re-instated, even if the administration ends up prevailing in the end.

100 Days: Germany's rising tide of populism31 January 2017 (01:43:05),"Germany's Baltic coastline can be a bleak place out of season. In the small fishing village of Freest, boats creak idly against their moorings. A lone fisherman, stark in his yellow overalls, stands on deck, scraping the scales from yesterday's catch. It feels a long way from Berlin. And inside the quayside smokehouse, as she carefully threads sprats on to long metal skewers, fish factory worker Ines tells me she feels forgotten by Angela Merkel's government. ""They just look after the big cities,"" she says. ""But these small communities up here - no. Nothing is being done for us. Nothing gets through to us."" It can be hard to make a good living here, especially in the winter. The workers in the smokehouse worry about unemployment. This is not a rich community and they feel it's time for political change. Fertile ground then for Germany's right wing, anti-Islam party Alternative for Germany (AfD). A regular poll for the national broadcaster suggests it would take 15% of the vote if the general election was held tomorrow. Ines. who works in a smoked fish factory, says she feels forgotten by the German government The party may well complicate coalition building come the autumn. Angela Merkel's CDU party still leads those polls at 37%, but her junior coalition partner, the SPD, is at 20% Roland delivers another load of slippery, silvery fish to the smokehouse. He pushes his woolly cap off and tells me AfD will be getting his vote. ""The other parties avoid the real problems,"" he explains. ""Merkel just sticks to her views, even though she sees what she's got us into - like the terror attacks. If she hadn't brought those people into the country,"" he insists, ""the victims of the Berlin Christmas markets would still be alive."" What does Alternative for Germany want? Angela Merkel's CDU suffers Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania poll blow Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Profile: German right-wing AfD leader Frauke Petry Freest is in the northern state of Mecklenburg Vorpommern. It is also home to Mrs Merkel's constituency. Last year AfD beat her Conservatives into third place in the regional election and now, they want to compound that humiliation by putting up a candidate - Leif-Erik Holm - directly against her. Mr Holm, a smartly-dressed former radio presenter who believes a large proportion of Europe's Muslims hold radical views and want to establish a global caliphate, is, in reality, unlikely to take the chancellor's seat. But it's not impossible. ""We have a big problem with radical Islam and we need to talk about it,"" he tells me. ""It's been taboo in Germany. The AfD broke that taboo and thank heavens people now talk about their fears. Just look at who's carrying out terror attacks in Europe, they're all extreme Islamists."" ""We don't create fear. We talk about it,"" says the AfD's Leif-Erik Holm It is AfD's vociferous anti-Islam, anti-migrant position which, critics argue, is key to its success. Certainly, support for what originally began as an anti-euro party surged during the latter part of the refugee crisis, as party leaders began to campaign against Mrs Merkel's asylum policy. But Mr Holm rejects the notion that AfD is a one issue party, seeking political gain by whipping up fear of Muslim immigrants. ""During the regional election hustings we spoke with people in small towns and villages and realised fear was the most prominent theme. We don't create fear, we talk about it - the everyday fear that people have of terrorism, of uncontrolled mass immigration. ""That's what we work with as politicians. We make politics for the people."" Geert Wilders, Frauke Petry and Marine Le Pen recently shared a platform in the German city of Koblenz AfD's anti-EU rhetoric is also growing louder as it seeks to emulate the success of the giants of Europe's far right. It recently hosted a rally of the right in the German city of Koblenz, sharing a stage - and a platform - with the French presidential candidate Marine le Pen and Geert Wilders, whose Freedom Party leads the polls ahead of the Dutch general election. Both Ms Le Pen and Mr Wilders have pledged referendums on EU membership. AfD's manifesto now promises to pull Germany out if significant structural reforms are not implemented. During the rally (from which the mainstream German broadcasters and press were banned) its leader Frauke Petry likened the EU to Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union and joined Ms Le Pen and Mr Wilders in their calls for a revolution in Europe. This was a show of solidarity, a display of unity from Europe's right. Emboldened by Brexit and Donald Trump's victory, the leaders are keen to focus on the threefold message which unites them; a visceral dislike of Islam, a loathing of Mrs Merkel's refugee policy and that contempt for the EU. And they believe 2017 will be their year. Angela Merkel is to stand for a fourth term as chancellor It's hard to say whether they create, reflect or exploit social division, but an interesting recent German survey gave a fascinating glimpse into what might motivate AfD supporters. The poll found, for example, that despite last year's terror attack in Berlin, 73% of those polled felt safe in Germany. But when the researchers asked AfD supporters, they found that only 34% felt secure. Similarly, when asked whether life is better or worse than 50 years ago, 17% of Germans said it is worse, but this figure rises to 40% among AfD supporters. In 2017, Europe's real election battles will take place in communities like Freest, where people feel forgotten by their national governments and left behind by establishment parties. If Europe's leaders want to halt the rise of the right, they must reconnect with those voters and regain their trust. Because in this windblown harbour on the German coast, those who feel left out in the cold are warming to what Europe's right already refer to (prematurely perhaps) as the ""patriotic spring"".

Jack Goodman: Why these seven countries for travel ban?30 January 2017 (16:28:36),"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that banned travel into the United States for citizens from these seven countries for 90 days: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The restrictions were part of wide ranging immigration controls,externalthat also suspended refugee arrivals. It appears that existing restrictions in place during the Obama administration informed Mr Trump's list. These countries were already named as ""countries of concern"" after a law passed by a Republican-led Congress in 2015 altered a visa admissions programme. The Visa Waiver Program allows citizens from 38 countries to enter the US for 90 days without a visa. The UK, France and Germany are among those countries allowed in under the waiver programme. Visitors apply for an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta). In December 2015 Congresspassed a law - created by senators from both parties,external, and supported and signed by the White House - that removed waiver benefits for foreign nationals who had visited certain countries since March 2011. The countries were identified as having a terrorist organisation with a significant presence in the area, or the country was deemed a ""safe haven"" for terrorists. The executive order has been followed by demonstrations across the United States After Libya, Somalia and Yemen were added to the list in February 2016, the ""countries of concern"" were the seven named in Mr Trump's order. According to the restrictions, citizens who had been eligible for the waiver programme and had visited one of those seven countries in the time period were forced to apply for a visa. The Obama administration passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. The Act, however, unlike Trump's much more broad order, only affected people eligible for the visa waiver programme, rather than suspend all citizens' travel from one of those seven countries. Trump's executive order: Who does travel ban affect? Trump's 'extreme vetting' order sows seeds of panic White House stands firm over travel ban Million sign petition to stop UK visit In a statement on 29 January, President Trump said his policy was ""similar"" to an Obama order that ""banned visa for refugees from Iraq"". Trump referred to an incident in May 2011 when the FBI indicted two Iraqi citizens in Kentucky on federal terrorism charges. Both were accused of providing material support to al-Qaeda and had been involved in attacks against US forces in Iraq. A hearing before the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence found that the pair had ""exploited special Iraqi refugee programs"". The vetting system came under review and this resulted in fewer Iraqi refugee admissions that year. The number of refugees from Iraq dropped from 18,016 to 9,388 as a result of the suspension. That number increased to 12,163 the following year. Mr Trump's order said that foreign-born individuals have been responsible for ""numerous"" terrorism-related crimes since 9/11, including foreign nationals who have entered the country on visa or refugee programmes. The 9/11 attackers came from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Lebanon and Egypt. In September 2015the Homeland Security Committee reported,externalthat the so-called Islamic State had inspired or directed 60 terror plots or attacks in Western countries, including 15 in the United States. There are 250 American citizens known to have joined Islamist extremist groups. Significant recent attacks in the US were not committed by citizens from any of the seven countries included in the order. This list includes: Fort Lauderdale airport shooting (January 2017): A US citizen Orlando nightclub shooting (June 2016): A US citizen with Afghan parents San Bernardino shooting (December 2015): A US citizen with Pakistani parents, and a Pakistani citizen Chattanooga shootings (July 2015): A Kuwait-born US citizen Charleston church shooting (June 2015): A US citizen Boston marathon bombing (April 2013): Two men originally from Chechnya, Russia There have been a few non-fatal attacks by individuals from two of the countries on the banned list. According to the New America Foundation,external, 82% of all terrorism incidents since 2001 were conducted by citizens and permanent residents. Since 9/11, jihadists have killed 94 people inside the United States. A Cato Institute study,externalfound that Americans are 253 times more likely to die in a regular homicide than dying in a terrorist attack committed by a foreigner in the US. US Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have said the order ""may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security"", because of the signal it sends to the Muslim world. But President Trump has rejected that notion, saying in an interview that America's enemies were already angry and it was his number one responsibility to keep the country safe. And his supporters wholeheartedly agree. ""Donald Trump says this is temporary and I trust him,"" said one resident in New York's Staten Island. ""His number one job is to protect the American people."" What are executive orders?

Pricey puff,"Australia was the first country in the world to introduce mandatory plain packaging for tobacco products - and the UK will have followed suit by May this year. But will any country copy Australia's plan to keep increasing taxes until a packet of cigarettes costs AUD$40 (Â£24)? It's not easy being a smoker in Australia. The smoking bans started inside - in workplaces, bars and restaurants - and moved out. ""Smokers would congregate on footpaths and near public transport creating clouds of smoke - what we call 'smoking hotspots',"" says Mark Driver, Sydney's Park and Recreation Planner. ""Now, smoking is prohibited within 10m (33ft) of a playground, within 4m (13ft) of the entrance to a public building, at rail platforms, taxi ranks and bus stops."" Those are the rules in New South Wales, but they are mirrored in many other states. Smoking is banned on many beaches, and most Australian states have now banned cigarettes in jail. All states ban smoking in vehicles if children are present. Fines vary, but in some places you may be fined AUD$2,000 (Â£1,210) if you smoke in the wrong place. And even if you don't, you'll be paying more than that each year by 2020, if you smoke just one AUD$40 pack a week. It's already five years since Australia became the first place in the world to make plain cigarette packaging compulsory. Tobacco-advertising has long been banned, and now branding has too. The boxes are a drab, dark brown colour (deemed the ugliest in the world by a team of Australian researchers), they carry no logos, and graphic health warnings cover most of the front of the box. ""You see this gigantic, see-and-never-forget kind of image of throat cancer - a hole in the neck, or what a stroke looks like with a brain sliced open,"" Chapman explains. ""Some smokers say they don't even look at it, but there has been research which shows that with the people who engage in those avoidance strategies, it's actually a predictor of them quitting later on."" All this came on top of anti-smoking campaigns that have been driving down smoking rates in Australia since the 1970s. ""It's a toxic, poisonous mix of substances, including ammonia, the bleach in toilet cleaner; acetone, the chemical in nail polish remover; benzene, found in paint stripper; and hydrogen cyanide, used in rat poison,"" went one advertisement. ""And smoking delivers it straight to your body."" ""The evidence shows that these hard-hitting, graphic ads that really show the harms of smoking are some of the most effective,"" says Scott Walsberger, head of tobacco control at Cancer Council NSW. But other campaigns have also tried a gentler approach, emphasising how quickly a smoker's health starts to improve once he or she has quit. It was this approach that was taken by the creators of an interactive, behavioural change app called My Quit Buddy, launched in 2012. Offering tips for giving up, daily motivational messages, distractions to overcome cravings, and a place to share success stories and celebrate milestones, it has now been downloaded more than 400,000 times in Australia alone. In a world where a lot is going wrong, there is also a lot going right. So, what if you could build a country with policies that actually worked, by homing in on ideas from around the world that have been truly successful? Listen toMy Perfect Countryon the BBC World Service Ordownload the podcast Email the programme,external ""It shows people that just by even quitting for five days, you can start to see changes - you'll have more money in your wallet, your skin becomes clearer,"" says Paul Den, one of My Quit Buddy's creators. ""And the community forum shows people that they're not alone - people generally trust other people more than they trust the government."" The cumulative effect of these policies is that smoking rates for adults have almost halved since 1980, says Henrietta Moore, of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College, London, and are now at about 13%, compared to a global average of about 20%. There has also been a decrease of almost 23% in the rate of hospital admissions caused by smoking. Simone Dennis, an associate professor at Australian National University, says a culture of shame surrounding smoking has begun to emerge, and that itself has become a smoking deterrent. Take, for example, the policy of confining smokers to areas where they will not create a public nuisance. ""If you think about smoking in public, those tend to be spaces that no-one wants to hang out in anyway,"" she says. ""So smokers feel marginalised because they can't be citizens in public spaces any more, because they're restricted to these kind of 'dirty spaces.'"" The government has committed to reduce the number of adults smoking on a daily basis to 10% by 2018 Plain-packaging rules insist that 75% of the front of a cigarette pack is covered by a health warning, and 90% of the back Tobacco taxes rose 25% in 2010, and are now rising 12.5% every year The Tasmanian parliament has discussed a bill that would ban smoking for those born after 2000 Australia has not gone as far as Bhutan, andreportedly also Turkmenistan, which have banned the sale of tobacco products Read:The battle for control of the cigarette packet These days, smoking is often taken up by people who are on the lowest rungs of the socio-economic ladder, she points out, ""and that adds a burden of shame to people who might already be marginalised"". If it's the poor who are now the most likely to smoke, it's hard to see how they will ever afford the AUD$40 pack of cigarettes.
