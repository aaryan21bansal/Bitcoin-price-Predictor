London slavery statue removed from outside museum,"This video can not be played The statue of Robert Milligan was removed by the Canal and River Trust to ""recognise the wishes of the community"" A statue of noted slaveholder Robert Milligan has been removed from outside the Museum of London Docklands. Sadiq Khan earlier announced a review of all of London's statues and street names, saying any with links to slavery ""should be taken down"". On Sunday, anti-racism protesters in Bristoltore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. Milligan's monument was removed to ""recognise the wishes of the community"" said the Canal and River Trust. There were cheers and clapping as the monument was lifted from its plinth using a crane. The Museum of London Docklands said the statue of the prominent British slave trader, who owned two sugar plantations and 526 slaves in Jamaica, had ""stood uncomfortably"" outside its premises ""for a long time"". ""The Museum of London recognises that the monument is part of the ongoing problematic regime of white-washing history, which disregards the pain of those who are still wrestling with the remnants of the crimes Milligan committed against humanity,"" they added. The Canal and River Trust said it had worked with the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, the museum and partners in Canary Wharf to have it removed. As the Milligan statue was lowered from its plinth,thousands of people gathered outside an Oxford collegeto demand the removal of a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes. Milligan was a noted slaveholder and founder of London's global trade hub, West India Docks Mr Khan said London had to face ""an uncomfortable truth"" with its historical links to slavery. The Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm will review the city's landmarks - including murals, street art, street names, statues and other memorials - and consider which legacies should be celebrated before making recommendations. Mr Khan said London was ""one of the most diverse cities in the world"", but said recent Black Lives Matter protests had highlighted that the city's statues, plaques and street names largely reflect Victorian Britain. ""It is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade,"" he said. ""While this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored."" Johnson urges peaceful struggle against racism Head removed from pub sign amid racism row Schools consider dropping Colston name During a Black Lives Matter protest in central London on Sunday, a statue of Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was sprayed with graffiti. But Mr Khan said he did not consider statues of the likes of Churchill to be included in the review. He said pupils needed to be educated about famous figures ""warts and all"" and that ""nobody was perfect"", including the likes of Churchill, Gandhi and Malcolm X. The statue of Robert Milligan was covered with fabric and Black Lives Matter sign before being removed Mr Khan toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmehe did not have ownership of the statues and the land they are on. He also said it would be ""inappropriate"" to single out which statues and street names he thinks should go. Instead a number of new memorials in the capital have been pledged by Mr Khan, including ones for Stephen Lawrence, the Windrush generation, a National Slavery Museum or memorial and a National Sikh War Memorial. A statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti during a Black Lives Matter protest The Local Government Association's (LGA) Labour group has also announced that Labour councils across England and Wales are to review ""the appropriateness"" of monuments and statues in their towns and cities. Campaigns calling for the removal or amendment of monuments celebrating controversial figures have increased in volume around the UK in recent days. In Oxford, 26 councillors and an MP have called for a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodesto be removed from an Oxford University college. A plaque is to be added to a Henry Dundas monument in Edinburghto ""reflect"" the city's links with slavery, while the leader of Cardiff Council said he would support the removal of a statue of slave-owner Sir Thomas Picton from the city's civic building. Guy made his money from the the stock market bubble of 1720. He had shares in the South Sea company when it started trading in 1711, with slaves sold to the Spanish colonies. Robert Milligan was a noted West Indian merchant, slaveholder and founder of London's global trade hub, West India Docks. Aside from founding an educational charity, Sir John Cass was a major figure in the Royal African Company, which was involved in the Atlantic slave economy.

Zoos and safari parks set to reopen from 15 June - PM,"London Zoo had said it faced an ""uncertain future"" Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas are set to reopen in England from Monday, the PM has said. Speaking at Wednesday's daily briefing, Boris Johnson outlined the latest steps in the easing of the coronavirus lockdown. He said the outdoor attractions can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. Some zoos, including Chester Zoo and London Zoo, have reported financial struggles during the pandemic. A number of Tory MPshave been calling for zoos to reopen to ensure they survive the crisis. The move will pave the way for zoos to reopen in England alongside non-essential shops, which can also open from 15 June. What will happen when zoos reopen? 'It is a worrying time to be running a zoo' London Zoo faces 'perilous future' Zoo remains 'on a knife edge' despite support But Mr Johnson faced criticism from the Labour leader at Prime Minister's Questions, after theplan for the reopening of all primary schools in England by the summer was ditched by the government. Sir Keir Starmer said the government's plan for getting children back to school in England was ""in tatters"", blaming the situation on a lack of leadership from Mr Johnson. He called for a ""national taskforce"" to be set up, to find a way forward. Mr Johnson said Sir Keir had previously said school reopenings were happening too quickly and accused him of trying to have it both ways. Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the daily briefing why children could go to the zoo but not school, the prime minister said he had wanted all children to return before the summer holidays but the ""continued prevalence"" of the disease meant it wasn't possible. He said the government would be doing ""a huge amount of catch up for pupils over the summer"" and the education secretary would be setting out further details. He defended the government's policy on reopening schools saying: ""We're very much in line or slightly ahead of some other European countries."" The chair of the education select committee, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, has called on the PM to ""set out a national plan on how we get schools opening again and a catch up programme for left-behind pupils whose life chances are being damaged by being off school for 40% of school year"". Earlier this week Chester Zoo - which has been closed since 21 March - said its future was ""on a knife edge"", despite a government pledge to provide financial support. And last month London Zoo - closed since 20 March - said it faced an ""uncertain future"" without immediate support. This video can not be played A large zoo says it needs government grants as it has no visitors or income Speaking at the daily press conference, the prime minister said outdoor attractions where visitors remain in their cars can reopen because the risk of spreading the disease is lower outside. He said zoos would be able to reopen ""provided visitor numbers are managed and safeguards are put in place - that includes keeping indoor places such as reptile houses closed"". Zoos must also ensure amenities including cafes are take-away only. Downing Street continues to emphasise that the UK government wants to move forward carefully in further easing the lockdown. Wednesday's announcement on zoos reflects the belief the risk of transmission is lower outdoors and is based on social distancing rules being followed. We also know non-essential shops in England and Northern Ireland will reopen in the coming days (though we don't know when this will happen in Scotland and Wales). Small parts of normal life are returning, even if they will likely feel quite different. But while steps to reopen the economy are being taken, the slow progress on schools shows that coming out of lockdown is not always easy and not always in the hands of ministers. The delay in getting primary school pupils back to classrooms in England is a reminder that practicalities - and in some cases public reluctance - are important too. The government says it has already provided a Â£14m support fund for zoos. They have also been eligible to apply for a ""range of support schemes"", including business rate relief, during the pandemic. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Andrew Hall, spokesperson for Biaza - British and Irish Association for Zoos and Aquariums - said he was ""delighted"" with the announcement, but added the sector was ""not out of the woods"". ""Aquariums are still closed, and zoos and safari parks have taken a real hit,"" he said. ""For some zoos, particularly those reliant on tourism, reopening isn't going to be financially viable for them."" He said the announcement was ""not the full answer"" and government support would still be required, especially with limited entry. He added: ""Zoos and aquariums in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will still be facing significant challenges and we will be working hard to achieve positive outcomes in these nations.""

Babylon Health admits to GP app data breach,"Babylon Health has acknowledged that its GP video appointment app has suffered a data breach. The firm was alerted to the problem after one of its users discovered he had been given access to dozens of video recordings of other patients' consultations. A follow-up check by Babylon revealed a small number of further UK users could also see others' sessions. The firm said it had since fixed the issue and notified regulators. Babylon allows its members to speak to a doctor, therapist or other health specialist via a smartphone video call and, when appropriate, sends an electronic prescription to a nearby pharmacy. It has more than 2.3 million registered users in the UK. Leeds-based Rory Glover had access to the service via his membership of a private health insurance plan with Bupa, one of Babylon's partners. On Tuesday morning, when he went to check a prescription, he noticed he had about 50 videos in the Consultation Replays section of the app that did not belong to him. Clicking on one revealed that the file contained footage of another person's appointment. ""I was shocked,"" he told the BBC. ""You don't expect to see anything like that when you're using a trusted app. It's shocking to see such a monumental error has been made."" Mr Glover said he alerted a work colleague to the fact, who used to work for Babylon. He in turn flagged the issue to the company's compliance department. Mr Glover discovered dozens of replay videos in his app that he should not have had access to Shortly afterwards, Mr Glover's access to the clips was rescinded. Babylon, which has its headquarters in London, has since confirmed the breach. ""On the afternoon of Tuesday 9 June we identified and resolved an issue within two hours whereby one patient accessed the introduction of another patient's consultation recording,"" it said in statement. ""Our investigation showed that three patients, who had booked and had appointments today, were incorrectly presented with, but did not view, recordings of other patients' consultations through a subsection of the user's profile within the Babylon app."" On Wednesday, the firm amended its statement to make clear that it meant two patients in addition to Mr Glover - who had in fact viewed a recording - to make the total of three. ""This was the result of a software error rather than a malicious attack,"" it continued. ""The problem was identified and resolved quickly. ""Of course we take any security issue, however small, very seriously and have contacted the patients affected to update, apologise to and support where required."" A spokesman said that Babylon's engineering team was already aware of the issue before it was contacted by Mr Glover's workmate. He said the problem had been accidentally introduced via a new feature that lets users switch from audio to video-based consultations part way through a call. And he said that Babylon had informed the Information Commissioner's Office of the matter. ""Affected users were in the UK only and this did not impact our international operations,"" he added. However, Mr Glover said he still had concerns and did not intend to use the service again. ""It's an issue of doctor-patient confidentiality,"" he said. ""You expect anything you say to be private, not for it to be shared with a stranger."" The Information Commissioner's Office has confirmed that it had been contacted by Babylon and that it was now waiting to receive the company's breach report. ""People's medical data is highly sensitive information, not only do people expect it to be handled carefully and securely, organisations also have a responsibility under the law,"" said a spokeswoman. ""When a data incident occurs, we would expect an organisation to consider whether it is appropriate to contact the people affected, and to consider whether there are steps that can be taken to protect them from any potential adverse effects."" Babylon told the BBC it had already been in touch with everyone involved to inform them and apologise.

cinemas will be able to reopen in England from 15 June, the prime minister is due to announce. Boris Johnson is expected to
outline the latest step in the easing of the coronavirus lockdown at
Wednesday's daily briefing. He will say the outdoor
attractions can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. Some zoos, including Chester Zoo
and London Zoo, have reported financial struggles during the pandemic. The move will pave the way for the sites to reopen on the same day asnon-essential shops. A vigil for medical workers who died from Covid-19 was held in Iquitos, Peru Peru's Health Ministry has released its latest figures, showing confirmed cases of coronavirus have risen to 203,736. The country has also registered 5,738 deaths, since its first case on 6 March. It has the second highest number of cases in Latin America, after Brazil. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Weibo user Bai Jingting says he'd spend more time with his family The pandemic has had many of us wishing we could turn back the clock and start the year all over again. And thatâs what more than a million social media users in China were discussing on Tuesday: what they would do differently, if that was an option? A whopping 1.8 million users of the popular Sina Weibo platform have used the hashtag#WhatWouldYouDoIf2020Restarted,external. Many have said the pandemic has made them realise things they had taken for granted. One netizen said they would âhave a picture taken with my whole family, because this epidemic has made me understand that my familyâs health is the most important thingâ. Some say they would be ""more humble"", and regret leaving jobs just before Chinese New Year â a common trend around this period. Others are simply reflecting on how they wish theyâd âappreciated othersâ better. âI wish Iâd been a better person,â says one. Working conditions for migrant workers in Canada are placing them at risk from coronavirus, an advocacy group warns. ""While millionaire corporations are being bailed out, migrant worker â the ones that actually grow foodâ are in crisis,â the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change says. The report said,externalthat in Ontario province alone, at least two migrant workers had died with the virus and there were 280 cases. It also said workers were told to work in groups while waiting for test results, and that they were being housed in cramped quarters. Many migrants had the start of their work season delayed because of coronavirus restrictions. Once they did arrive, the new rules forced them to quarantine. During their quarantine, the report found they were underpaid, underfed and not given good health information. The report was based on calls with 180 workers who were speaking on behalf of 1,162 workers, mostly from the Caribbean.  Brazil has restoredits website with detailed coronavirus data,external, following a ruling earlier on Tuesday by the Supreme Court. The health ministry caused outrage when it removed pages of detailed Covid-19 data over the weekend and said it would no longer publish cumulative totals. But on Tuesday the country's highest court ordered the ministry to resume the publication of figures for deaths and infections.
Judge Alexandre de Moraes said the government's actions ""made it impossible"" to monitor the spread of the virus and implement adequate controls. The UK government is coming under increasing pressure from MPs and businesses to relax the 2m (6ft) rule for social distancing. Trade body UK Hospitality insists the current separation ruleswould be impossible for bars and restaurants to follow, and the Financial Times is reporting thatthe ""majority of the cabinet"" supports a reduction,external. The 2m distance is also one of the challenges schools face in reopening: head teachers and governors have said they lack the space to bring all pupils back. But scientistscontinue to question whether a reduction would be safe, given how little is known about how far coronavirus can spread. Read more from our science editor David Shukman. The doves are a popular attraction at the mosque More than 1,000 doves kept at a famous mosque in Afghanistan have died of starvation after the building was closed due to the coronavirus. Caretakers at the 12th-Century, blue-tiled mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif told AFP news agency that the doves were dying because there were no visitors to feed them. ""Every day about 30 doves die. We bury them outside the shrine,"" said mosque official Qayum Ansari, adding that more than 1,000 had already died. The birds are a popular attraction and many visitors consider them sacred. The mosque is one of many buildings closed in a nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus. The country has registered more than 21,000 confirmed cases but the real number is thought to be much higher. Government officials in Balkh province have now promised to supply bird food for the doves, if mosque managers will allow it. The ancient mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif is famous for its blue tiles Helen BriggsBBC science and health journalist A new study has linked blood group to susceptibility to coronavirus. The data, regarded as preliminary, suggests that individuals
with blood type O, the most common in the UK, are less likely to test positive for
Covid-19. The research, carried out by genetic-testing company 23andMe,external, echoes other studies on the blood groups of coronavirus patients. Many teams have been investigating how genetic factors could explain why
some people who contract the virus have relatively few symptoms, while others
become severely ill. Last
week, a study from Italy and Spain found patients with type A blood were more
likely to need oxygen or go on a ventilator. An earlier Chinese study produced similar results. But scientists say itâs not clear whether it is
blood group that influences risk, or some other genetic factor. There are four main blood groups â A, B, AB and O â and they're determined by the genes inherited from your parents. Students in the UK must decide by the middle of next week whether or not to accept university offers for the new academic year. It's a big decision - even more so this year as many lectures are due to take place online and socialising could be very difficult when term begins. So, will universities open in September? Many have already decided to alter their normal schedule. Cambridge will hold lectures online for the entire year, while Manchester will have online lectures for the first autumn term. The deadline for prospective studentsto decide on whether to accept offers has been pushed back,externalto 18 June. See here for a breakdown of what you need to be thinking aboutif deciding whether you're going to start your studies in September.

Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there will be a âlimited exemptionâ for immediate family members of Canadian citizens to cross into Canada from the US. Theborder has been closed to non-essential travel since 21 Marchand the earliest it would reopen would be 21 June. Many non-Canadian citizens have been denied entry, despite being married to Canadians. Those affected includeexpectant parents Ashley and Tim Cook,external. Ashley Cook is a Canadian living in Windsor, Ontario and her husband and the father of her child lives just over the border in Michigan. The new announcement reiterated that anyone coming from the US, which has been hit hard by the virus, would have to quarantine for 14 days. ""If you don't follow these rules, you could face serious penalties,"" Trudeau said. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The aviation
industry is in a deep crisis, and governments around the world have responded.
Today alone, we have seen the announcement of a major support package for
aerospace in France, while Cathay Pacific received a Â£4bn bail-out from the Hong Kong government. Lockdowns have forced airlines to ground aircraft, depriving them of much of their income. That in turn means they will struggle
to afford new planes, so manufacturers have had to slash production - forcing their suppliers to cut back as well. In France, some
300,000 jobs rely on the aerospace industry. That's why the government in
Paris thinks it is worth providing some Â£12bn in grants, loans and
guarantees (Â£5.5bn for Air France alone) to prop it up. In the UK, by
contrast, there has been little government largesse. Easyjet and
British Airways have borrowed under Covid-19 loan schemes, and many
companies have been able to furlough employees. But there has been nothing on the scale of the rescues seen elsewhere. And job cuts are mounting. People within the
industry say there is deep frustration that the UK government has been willing to introduce a stringent quarantine regime that threatens to do more damage, but hasnât done a great deal to
help them. Time, they say,
is running out. Justin RowlattChief Environment correspondent Coronavirus has changed the way we use energy - at least for now. But could the pandemic finally finish off coal, the most polluting of all fossil fuels? The Covid-19 crisis has been an extraordinary and terrifying time for us all, but it has been a fascinating period to cover environmental issues. We've all enjoyed the unusually clean air and clear skies. They are the most obvious evidence that we have been living through a unique experiment in energy use. Locking hundreds of millions of us down in our homes around the world has led to an unprecedented fall in energy demand, including for electricity. And that has, in turn, revealed something striking about the economics of the energy industry: the underlying vulnerability of coal, the fuel that powered the creation of the modern world. Read more.

Prof Heneghan said the data showed it was best to get coronavirus under the age of 45 Society will need to have ""rational debates"" about when is the least risky age to be infected with coronavirus if a vaccine does not materialise, an expert has said. Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, said Covid-19 is behaving in a way similar to seasonal flu in its disproportionate impact on the elderly. He told a Science Media Centre briefing: ""It matters when you get infections in relation to your risk - I think that's incredibly important. ""So we will start to have some rational debates, because many infections, we know if you get them when you're very young you actually do very well, for instance chickenpox, you get that when you're young and you confer immunity. ""So, if you took away the concept that there were no vaccinations, let's park that aside and this becomes a circulating endemic infection, we will start to have to have a debate around when is it better to get this infection? ""If you look at the data, it is when you're under 45. As you get older then it's worse for you."" The queue for food at New York's Barclays Center stretched around the block Since the start of the US outbreak, Food Bank for New York City has distributed 21m meals, marking a 20% increase from the same period last year, the charity say. Almost 80% of food pantries and soup kitchens reported an increase in families with children visiting. According to the report, the crushing demand for food assistance caused more than half of the food banks to run out of supplies in April. Food Bank for New York City CEO Leslie Gordon said the rise in demand represents ""the new normal"". At the peak of the outbreak 40% of the city's food banks were closed, largely because they are run by seniors who are particularly at risk of infection. A safari park in England has questioned why changes to the lockdown have allowed drivers ""to get a Big Mac, but not to see our big cats"". Knowsley Safari near Liverpool, which has been closed since 23 March, said people would be safe to visit as it was similar to using a McDonald's drive-through. A spokeswoman said being told to remain closed while the restaurants are allowed to reopen""doesn't make sense"". She added: ""We can't understand why it's now OK for people to go into shops or visit public spaces where there's no enforced social distancing, but not stay in their vehicle on the safari drive."" Reality Check Earlier, UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma was asked about the 2m (6ft)
social distancing rule, during the government'sDowning Street briefing. ""When safe to do so we'll see if we can move to a
shorter distance,"" he said. For now, the rule remains. Keeping people from different households at least 2m apart helps prevent the spread of coronavirus. But is also makes it much
harder to open places such as cafes and restaurants â leading to calls for a
review. The World Health Organization says a distance of 1m is
safe, and that rule is also in place in China, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Lithuania
and Singapore. The rule is 1.5m in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy,
the Netherlands and Portugal. Apart from the UK, the 2m rule is in place in Canada and Spain. You can read more about the evidence behind the 2m rule here. BBC Radio 5 Live The focus today in England has been on primary schools, and the roll back from allowing all pupils to return before the summer holidays. But the government has also confirmed that secondary schools in the country will not be opening until September at the earliest. So just how have
pupils been coping during lockdown? One 16-year-old A-level student from Hackney, east London, has been telling BBC Radio 5 Live that she has found it hard to stay motivated. âA lot of my friends descended into this kind of panic,"" she told presenter Emma Barnett. ""Feeling
we were doomed - and that was reflected in a lack of online engagement and
education.â But says she is now ""feeling a little bit more
hopefulâ and the lockdown has given her âtime to think about discipline
and how I learn, and educate myself"". Miriam Jordan Keane from the National Citizen Service said her organisation has set up an online hub for pupils, instead of running its regular schemes this summer. ""We had no idea of what the summer of 'no you can't' was
going to feel like for young people - no you can't go to school, no you can't
do your exams, no you can't celebrate the summer of a lifetime,â she said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
All shops in England can reopen on Monday if safe,"Signs remind shoppers of social distancing rules in a River Island store in Liverpool All non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen in England on Monday, the business secretary has confirmed. Alok Sharma said ""we continue to meet""the government's five tests for lifting coronavirus lockdown restrictions. He said retailers can open as long as they follow safety guidelines, or they could face enforcement notices. But asked about the possibility of reducing the 2m social distancing rule, Mr Sharma said ""we keep these matters under review"" but did not give a date. He also said pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers will not be able to reopen until 4 July ""at the earliest"". In Northern Ireland,all shops are allowed to open from Friday. No dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland and Wales, although each country has set out its planned stages for lifting lockdown. It comes as the number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus increased by 286 to a total of 40,883,official government figures on Tuesday show.,external The previous day, the UKhad recorded its lowest daily risein deaths - 55 - since before the lockdown on 23 March. There tends to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. The number of new confirmed cases in the UK has also increased by 1,387. Deaths linked to coronavirus continue to fall Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsignalled in Maythat all non-essential shops would be allowed to reopen in England on 15 June. Confirming that it was still going ahead at the daily Downing Street briefing on Tuesday, Mr Sharma said the change would allow the High Street to ""spring back to life"". He said businesses must follow the government'ssocial distancing and hygiene guidelines,externalpublished last month, and all retailers that open must complete a coronavirus risk assessment. Enforcement notices can be issued if shops reopen without the safety steps in place, Mr Sharma added. A member of staff at a south London furniture store tests a customer's temperature Open air markets were among the businesses allowed to open at the start of June Some retailers have already said they will open their stores in England gradually from 15 June. Department store John Lewis will only open 13 branches initially, while Next will only open 25 of its 500 stores at first. Some shops, such as supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations have been able to remain open during the coronavirus lockdown. And others - including furniture stores, open-air markets and car showrooms - were allowed to reopen at the start of June. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft 5ins ) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. And those measures are also likely to feature in other shops. But some more unfamiliar measures are also expected to be put in place to try to reduce the spread of the virus. Shoe shop Kurt Geiger will put footwear aside for 24 hours after a customer has tried them on, and Waterstones has said it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. Stores have been askedto encourage people to shop alone, if they can,,externaland talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible,to stop people using public transport. Read more about shops reopening. Mr Sharma said other businesses such as restaurants, pubs, bars and hairdressers will remain closed until 4 July at the earliest, as per the government's ""road map"". Pub companieshave calledon the government to halve the 2m rule, saying many pubs would struggle to operate. The trade body UK Hospitality estimated that, with a 2m rule still in place, outlets would be able to make about 30% of normal revenues, whereas 1m would mean about 60-75%. Asked about the distance, Mr Sharma said: ""We, of course, take advice from our scientists and of course when it is safe to do so we will see whether you can move to a shorter distance but ultimately we keep all of these things under review."" He acknowledged that other countries had moved to shorter distances but said ""they are further along in terms of their road map, in terms of opening up businesses"". 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented?

Thousands demand Cecil Rhodes statue removal,"This video can not be played Protesters gathered in Oxford's High Street outside Oriel College, which owns the statue Thousands of people have gathered outside an Oxford college to demand the removal of a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes. A group of councillors earlier backed the campaign to remove it and called on Oxford University to ""decolonise"". Twenty-six Oxford city councillors signed a letter saying the figure at Oriel College was ""incompatible"" with the city's ""commitment to anti-racism"". Oriel College said it ""abhors racism and discrimination in all its forms"". Campaigners said Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa, represented white supremacy and is steeped in colonialism and racism. A statue of slaveholder Robert Milligan wasearlier removed from outside the Museum of London Docklandsafter mayor Sadiq Khan said any links to slavery ""should be taken down"". At the protest, organisers from the Rhodes Must Fall group drew chalk crosses on either side of High Street in Oxford outside the college's entrance to enforce social distancing. Protesters chanted ""take it down"" and then held a silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in memory of George Floyd - the same length of time a white police officer was seen to kneel on his neck. The protest coincided withGeorge Floyd's funeral in Houston. In London about 50 activists gathered at Nelson Mandela's statue in Parliament Square to observe a minute's silence in his honour before marching to Downing Street. Protesters filled Oxford's High Street and traffic was rerouted Oxford's two MPs joined calls to remove the Rhodes statue, which have reignited after the statue ofEdward Colston, a 17th Century slave trader, was toppled in Bristol on Sunday. About 240,000 people had signed online petitions by 19:30 BST calling for the statue's removal, while city councillors said in a letter that the ""city's public art and monuments should reflect its values"". Why is Cecil Rhodes such a controversial figure? ""The presence of this statue on our high street is incompatible with our city's proud internationalist heritage and commitment to anti-racism,"" added the letter, which was signed by most of Labour's 34 councillors on the 48-seat council. City council leader Susan Brown did not sign the letter with her Labour colleagues buttweeted,externalsaying she had ""great sympathy"" with the campaign. She urged the college to apply to the council for planning permission to remove the statue. Because of its Grade II-listed status, she said, it could be ""placed in a museum, such as the Ashmolean or the Museum of Oxford"". Protestors have been calling for the statue of the British Imperialist Cecil Rhodes to be removed for several years Femi Nylander, Rhodes Must Fall campaigner, told the BBC the university needed to improve its representation of black students, ""decolonise"" its curriculum and remove the statue. ""They should not be continuing to celebrate this man,"" he added. ""Having a statue is a celebration."" In anopen letter,externalto the university's vice-chancellor Louise Richardson, a host of Oxford student groups and organisations said the university had""failed to address its institutional racism"" and set out a series of demands to ""make upholding anti-racist values a reality"". Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor and Oxford East MP, said: ""[The statue's] presence is a visible symbol of racism and prejudice for many. It is clear that there is now an overwhelming consensus for its removal. ""I support Susan Brown's call for Oriel College to seek a means of removing the statue."" Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat Oxford West and Abingdon MP, said the Rhodes statue ""must come down"" but said she did not endorse ""vigilante action"". The protest observed an eight-minute 46-second silence in memory of George Floyd In a statement, Oriel College said it aimed ""to fight prejudice and champion equal opportunities for everyone regardless of race, gender, sexuality or faith"". ""We believe black lives matter and support the right to peaceful protest. The power of education is a catalyst for equality and inclusiveness."" It earlier said it ""continued to debate and discuss the issues"" raised by the ""contested heritage"" of Cecil Rhodes. Oriel Collegedecided not to remove the statue in High Street in 2016and said the figure ""was a reminder of the complexity of history and of the legacies of colonialism"". It denied claims that donors threatened to withdraw more than Â£100m of funding if the statue was removed. Thames Valley Police tweeted: ""You may have seen a number of us out policing the organised protest today. We have been working with the organisers and the public to facilitate a peaceful protest & keep our communities safe. ""We would like to thank the public for their co-operation, patience & continued support."" Oxford University has not responded to requests for comment.

Head removed from pub sign amid racism row,"Mark Redfern said the head was ""saved by the people of Ashbourne"" A figure of a black man's head has been removed from a pub sign amid a row over racism. Derbyshire Dales District Council said on Monday the 18th Century iron and wood feature in Ashbourne would be""removed with immediate effect"". About 150 residents gathered to take down the figure, vowing to return it, before the council could act. A petition to remove the head, launched on Friday, has gathered more than 40,000 signatures. The district council said permanent removal of the head would need listed building consent and consultation with Historic England Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Ashbourne resident Mark Redfern said the head, which is part of the Grade II*-listed sign for The Green Man & Black's Head Royal Hotel in St John Street, ""will be restored while on the ground and returned to its position at a later date"". He said local councillors witnessed the removal. In a Facebook post, Mr Redfern said the head would be given ""a lick of black paint"", and claimed the move was to save it from vandalism. His son, 17-year-old Shaun Redfern, has gathered more than 4,000 signatures on a petition calling for the head to remain for historical reasons. The district council said it intended to remove the sign as it was a public safety concern and the issue required urgent discussion Resident Darren Waring, who said he was involved in taking down the feature, said: ""People are making these racist overtures without knowing the facts."" He said the figure is a head of a Turkish man who came to Ashbourne hundreds of years ago and traded coffee. ""He brought prosperity. He was a well-respected and well-loved Turkish man so in his honour they put his head up. It has nothing to do with slavery,"" he said. He added in the 1980s, he went up to the sign to restore it with his father. ""The sign was actually dark brown,"" he said. ""My dad explained to me this is a Turkish man, not a black man. It was painted brown then something has gone wrong in the restoration."" A 19-year-old student from the town said: ""Having it in the middle of the street in a small town is so unwelcoming"" Derbyshire Dales District Council's decision to remove the head followed the statue of a slave trader in Bristol beingtorn downduring demonstrations on Sunday. A council spokesman said a councillor spoke to the group, explaining the council needed to take down the figure temporarily in the interests of public safety ahead of a consultation. He said: ""The group, who had ladders, then decided they would remove the figure themselves for safe keeping and, not wanting to create a confrontation, in the circumstances we did not object. ""We expect to have possession of the head figure later today."" Historic England said: ""As the government's adviser on heritage, we will be ready to advise the council on next steps if they need it."" The mid-18th Century sign bridges St John Street One 20-year-old anthropology student from the town - who did not want to be named - said the sign resembled a gollywog, a 19th Century rag doll which is largely considered racist. ""I think people are ashamed of it,"" she said. Matthew Holt, a 19-year-old international relations student from Ashbourne, said: ""It should be in a museum where we can learn about it with a description to contextualise it."" Councillor Barry Lewis, Derbyshire's County Council leader,said,externalthe figure should not be taken down, although it was ""clearly culturally insensitive and racist"". He added: ""Cultural heritage is there to challenge us sometimes, to make us uncomfortable."" The district council said it was gifted the sign a number of years ago A Derbyshire Police spokesman said officers attended from 21:00 until 23:00 BST to ""monitor the situation and ensure there were no breaches of the peace"".

London slavery statues 'should be taken down',"This video can not be played The statue of Robert Milligan was removed by the Canal and River Trust to ""recognise the wishes of the community"" A statue of noted slaveholder Robert Milligan has been removed from outside the Museum of London Docklands. Sadiq Khan earlier announced a review of all of London's statues and street names, saying any with links to slavery ""should be taken down"". On Sunday, anti-racism protesters in Bristoltore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. Milligan's monument was removed to ""recognise the wishes of the community"" said the Canal and River Trust. There were cheers and clapping as the monument was lifted from its plinth using a crane. The Museum of London Docklands said the statue of the prominent British slave trader, who owned two sugar plantations and 526 slaves in Jamaica, had ""stood uncomfortably"" outside its premises ""for a long time"". ""The Museum of London recognises that the monument is part of the ongoing problematic regime of white-washing history, which disregards the pain of those who are still wrestling with the remnants of the crimes Milligan committed against humanity,"" they added. The Canal and River Trust said it had worked with the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, the museum and partners in Canary Wharf to have it removed. As the Milligan statue was lowered from its plinth,thousands of people gathered outside an Oxford collegeto demand the removal of a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes. Milligan was a noted slaveholder and founder of London's global trade hub, West India Docks Mr Khan said London had to face ""an uncomfortable truth"" with its historical links to slavery. The Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm will review the city's landmarks - including murals, street art, street names, statues and other memorials - and consider which legacies should be celebrated before making recommendations. Mr Khan said London was ""one of the most diverse cities in the world"", but said recent Black Lives Matter protests had highlighted that the city's statues, plaques and street names largely reflect Victorian Britain. ""It is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade,"" he said. ""While this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored."" Johnson urges peaceful struggle against racism Head removed from pub sign amid racism row Schools consider dropping Colston name During a Black Lives Matter protest in central London on Sunday, a statue of Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was sprayed with graffiti. But Mr Khan said he did not consider statues of the likes of Churchill to be included in the review. He said pupils needed to be educated about famous figures ""warts and all"" and that ""nobody was perfect"", including the likes of Churchill, Gandhi and Malcolm X. The statue of Robert Milligan was covered with fabric and Black Lives Matter sign before being removed Mr Khan toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmehe did not have ownership of the statues and the land they are on. He also said it would be ""inappropriate"" to single out which statues and street names he thinks should go. Instead a number of new memorials in the capital have been pledged by Mr Khan, including ones for Stephen Lawrence, the Windrush generation, a National Slavery Museum or memorial and a National Sikh War Memorial. A statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti during a Black Lives Matter protest The Local Government Association's (LGA) Labour group has also announced that Labour councils across England and Wales are to review ""the appropriateness"" of monuments and statues in their towns and cities. Campaigns calling for the removal or amendment of monuments celebrating controversial figures have increased in volume around the UK in recent days. In Oxford, 26 councillors and an MP have called for a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodesto be removed from an Oxford University college. A plaque is to be added to a Henry Dundas monument in Edinburghto ""reflect"" the city's links with slavery, while the leader of Cardiff Council said he would support the removal of a statue of slave-owner Sir Thomas Picton from the city's civic building. Guy made his money from the the stock market bubble of 1720. He had shares in the South Sea company when it started trading in 1711, with slaves sold to the Spanish colonies.

Satellite images may suggest virus hit Wuhan earlier,"An apparent surge in traffic outside Wuhan hospitals from August 2019 may suggest the coronavirus hit the area earlier than reported, a study says. Harvard researchers say satellite images show an increase in traffic outside five hospitals in the Chinese city from late August to December. The traffic spike coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like ""cough"" and ""diarrhoea"". China said the study was ""ridiculous"" and based on ""superficial"" information. It is believed thatthe virus first appeared in China some time in November. Authorities reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019. ""Clearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic,"" Dr John Brownstein, who led the research, told ABC news. The study,externalhas not been peer-reviewed. The researchers examined commercial satellite data from outside five Wuhan hospitals, comparing data from late summer and autumn 2018 to the same time period in 2019. In one case, researchers counted 171 cars parked at one of Wuhan's largest hospitals, Tianyou Hospital in October 2018. Satellite data from the same time in 2019 showed 285 vehicles in the same place, an increase of 67%. A surge in online searches for words associated with the symptoms of coronavirus on the Chinese search engine Baidu seemed to emerge at the same time. ""This is all about a growing body of information pointing to something taking place in Wuhan at the time,"" Dr Brownstein told ABC. This video can not be played Paul Adams asks whether China is being bolder in the wake of the pandemic ""Many studies are still needed to fully uncover what took place and for people to really learn about how these disease outbreaks unfold and emerge in populations. So this is just another point of evidence."" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed the findings at a press briefing on Tuesday. ""I think it is ridiculous, incredibly ridiculous, to come up with this conclusion based on superficial observations such as traffic volume,"" she said. The BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says there were limits on the data set used by researchers - for example, they could not always compare satellite images taken on the same day in consecutive years due to cloud cover in some of the photos. But if the infection was present - undetected perhaps - some people could have been leaving Wuhan and travelling abroad and that fits with some of the other evidence we have begun to see in other parts of the world suggesting early cases of Covid-19, our correspondent says. The mystery of early 'Covid' cases However it may be unfair to use the study as evidence of a cover-up or delay in China's response, because with a previously unknown illness taking root in a community it is quite possible that there was some undetected spread before it was noticed officially, our correspondent adds. The researchers studied and annotated satellite images showing Wuhan hospitals China reported pneumonia cases with an unidentified cause to WHO on 31 December 2019. Nine days later, Chinese authorities revealed they had detected a novel coronavirus (later named Sars-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19) in several of the pneumonia cases. Wuhan and other Chinese cities went into lockdown on 23 January 2020. The WHO declared Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency of Global Concern on 30 January 2020 -this followed 82 confirmed cases outside China. Analysis byHelen Briggs, BBCHealth correspondent The precise events around the virus timeline are still unclear, more than six months on. The first known cluster of cases in Wuhan in December 2019 was centred around a local seafood market, which also sold live animals, including wildlife. Tests suggest the virus was present in some form, but not all cases were connected with the market and no animal source has been pinned down. Evidence has since emerged suggesting the virus might have been circulating earlier, including from a French doctor who said his patient tested positive for coronavirus in late December. Now there is an intriguing new clue, gleaned not from direct evidence, but from studying satellite imagery and internet search terms, which suggest hospital traffic and internet searches for symptoms were on the rise in Wuhan as early as late summer/early autumn. Only further research into the virus, both in animals and humans will give an answer, although it is possible we will never know exactly where and when it emerged. Is China bolder after Covid-19?

Hundreds demand Cecil Rhodes statue removal,"This video can not be played Protesters gathered in Oxford's High Street outside Oriel College, which owns the statue Thousands of people have gathered outside an Oxford college to demand the removal of a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes. A group of councillors earlier backed the campaign to remove it and called on Oxford University to ""decolonise"". Twenty-six Oxford city councillors signed a letter saying the figure at Oriel College was ""incompatible"" with the city's ""commitment to anti-racism"". Oriel College said it ""abhors racism and discrimination in all its forms"". Campaigners said Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa, represented white supremacy and is steeped in colonialism and racism. A statue of slaveholder Robert Milligan wasearlier removed from outside the Museum of London Docklandsafter mayor Sadiq Khan said any links to slavery ""should be taken down"". At the protest, organisers from the Rhodes Must Fall group drew chalk crosses on either side of High Street in Oxford outside the college's entrance to enforce social distancing. Protesters chanted ""take it down"" and then held a silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in memory of George Floyd - the same length of time a white police officer was seen to kneel on his neck. The protest coincided withGeorge Floyd's funeral in Houston. In London about 50 activists gathered at Nelson Mandela's statue in Parliament Square to observe a minute's silence in his honour before marching to Downing Street. Protesters filled Oxford's High Street and traffic was rerouted Oxford's two MPs joined calls to remove the Rhodes statue, which have reignited after the statue ofEdward Colston, a 17th Century slave trader, was toppled in Bristol on Sunday. About 240,000 people had signed online petitions by 19:30 BST calling for the statue's removal, while city councillors said in a letter that the ""city's public art and monuments should reflect its values"". Why is Cecil Rhodes such a controversial figure? ""The presence of this statue on our high street is incompatible with our city's proud internationalist heritage and commitment to anti-racism,"" added the letter, which was signed by most of Labour's 34 councillors on the 48-seat council. City council leader Susan Brown did not sign the letter with her Labour colleagues buttweeted,externalsaying she had ""great sympathy"" with the campaign. She urged the college to apply to the council for planning permission to remove the statue. Because of its Grade II-listed status, she said, it could be ""placed in a museum, such as the Ashmolean or the Museum of Oxford"". Protestors have been calling for the statue of the British Imperialist Cecil Rhodes to be removed for several years Femi Nylander, Rhodes Must Fall campaigner, told the BBC the university needed to improve its representation of black students, ""decolonise"" its curriculum and remove the statue. ""They should not be continuing to celebrate this man,"" he added. ""Having a statue is a celebration."" In anopen letter,externalto the university's vice-chancellor Louise Richardson, a host of Oxford student groups and organisations said the university had""failed to address its institutional racism"" and set out a series of demands to ""make upholding anti-racist values a reality"". Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor and Oxford East MP, said: ""[The statue's] presence is a visible symbol of racism and prejudice for many. It is clear that there is now an overwhelming consensus for its removal. ""I support Susan Brown's call for Oriel College to seek a means of removing the statue."" Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat Oxford West and Abingdon MP, said the Rhodes statue ""must come down"" but said she did not endorse ""vigilante action"". The protest observed an eight-minute 46-second silence in memory of George Floyd In a statement, Oriel College said it aimed ""to fight prejudice and champion equal opportunities for everyone regardless of race, gender, sexuality or faith"". ""We believe black lives matter and support the right to peaceful protest. The power of education is a catalyst for equality and inclusiveness."" It earlier said it ""continued to debate and discuss the issues"" raised by the ""contested heritage"" of Cecil Rhodes. Oriel Collegedecided not to remove the statue in High Street in 2016and said the figure ""was a reminder of the complexity of history and of the legacies of colonialism"". It denied claims that donors threatened to withdraw more than Â£100m of funding if the statue was removed. Thames Valley Police tweeted: ""You may have seen a number of us out policing the organised protest today. We have been working with the organisers and the public to facilitate a peaceful protest & keep our communities safe. ""We would like to thank the public for their co-operation, patience & continued support."" Oxford University has not responded to requests for comment.

George Floyd's funeral under way in Houston,"Mourners wore ""I can't breathe"" badges at the service The funeral of George Floyd, an African American whose death in police custody spawned global outrage, has heard impassioned pleas for racial justice. Speakers in the church in Houston, Texas, lined up to remember a man whose ""crime was that he was born black"". Mr Floyd died in Minneapolis last month as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, his final moments filmed on phones. Four police officers involved have been sacked and chargedover his death. His coffin was taken from the church driven in a motorcade to the Houston Memorial Gardens where he was to be buried beside his mother. This video can not be played George Floyd's niece: 'This is not just murder, but a hate crime' One of Mr Floyd's nieces, Brooke Williams, called for a change in laws which, she argued, were designed to disadvantage black people. ""Why must this system be corrupt and broken?"" she asked. ""Laws were already put in place for the African-American system to fail. And these laws need to be changed. No more hate crimes, please! Someone said 'Make America Great Again', but when has America ever been great?"" Republican President Donald Trump's Democratic opponent in the November presidential election, Joe Biden, addressed the service in a video message, saying: ""When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America."" George Floyd's body was loaded into a hearse Mr Biden has sharply criticised Mr Trump,accusing him at the weekend of making ""despicable"" speculative remarks about Mr Floyd. But the Democratic politician was himself recently accused of taking black American votes for grantedwhen he said African Americans ""ain't black"" if they even considered voting for Mr Trump. The service was held at the Fountain of Praise church,attended by some 500 guests,externalincluding politicians and celebrities. ""George Floyd was not expendable - this is why we're here,"" said Al Green, the local Democratic congressman. ""His crime was that he was born black."" Veteran civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton told the service: ""All over the world I see grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters' statues."" Talking about Mr Floyd's difficult life, he said: ""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that's gonna change the whole wide world."" In Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz called on people to honour the funeral by observing silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time Mr Floyd was pinned to the ground before he died. Mourners paid respects before the service Many wore ""I can't breathe"" badges Mr Floyd's coffin was taken to a cemetery in Pearland, south of Houston, for a private burial ceremony. For the last mile of the procession it was conveyed in a horse-drawn carriage. Barriers were erected along the route to allow members of the public to pay their respects,externalsafely as the procession passed. Mr Floyd will be interred in a mausoleum in Pearland His body was on display at the church for six hours on Monday. This video can not be played George Floyd's ex partner: 'Gianna doesn't have a father' Memorial services were also held in Minneapolis and North Carolina, where Mr Floyd was born. After visiting the family on Monday, the Democratic candidate told CBS: ""His little daughter was there, the one who said 'daddy's going to change the world', and I think her daddy is going to change the world.""

What Trump states make of unrest,"President Donald Trump talks about imposing law and order, and his hardline approach towards the protesters this week is helping to shore up his base of supporters. But what do the parts of the US that propelled him to victory in 2016 think of his aggressive strategy? Shirley Hartman, an artist who works in watercolour and acrylics, moved to Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, years ago because she wanted to feel safe. She had been robbed in Philadelphia, a city about 60 miles away, and she was looking for a place where she did not have to worry about violence. With protests unfolding across the US, she says that she is again concerned about her safety and is glad that the president acted forcefully, threatening to deploy the military. The demonstrators went too far, she says, and he responded appropriately. ""It's gotten out of hand,"" says Ms Hartman. ""They've gone to extremes, and sometimes it's necessary to go to extremes, too, to respond."" The protests have continued for more than a week, with tens of thousands taking to the streets across the US. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, however, anda Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests,externalmost people in the US disapprove of the president's hardline approach. Breonna Taylor: Protesters call on people to 'say her name' Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Timeline: From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology Still a significant number of people, one-third of those who were surveyed, support the president and his actions. Many of them are like Ms Hartman - they live in suburban areas of the country and are concerned about security. Their views will play a significant role in the November election. Ms Hartman lives in a swing district in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which Mr Trump won in 2016 and is widely viewed as crucial to his chances again this time around. This video can not be played ""Keep pushing"": Washington DC protesters on keeping the momentum going For that reason, political operatives, scholars and others are watching closely to see how the president's law-and-order message plays in key states across the country. In a week of more than 20 interviews in Pennsylvania, Missouri and North Carolina - three states Trump won in 2016 - most people echoed the views of Ms Hartman and agreed that the president's tough rhetoric was necessary and say they will support him in November. Some said they supported the protesters and their goals, but were concerned about those who had become violent. ""I understand how people feel about George Floyd and I agree that something needs to change. But burning a church, looting, turning over cars - I don't agree with that. I don't agree with burning a town to the ground,"" says Brian Bufka, 47, who lives in Warrenton, Missouri, and runs a printing company. ""I support our president - I think his heart is in the right place, and I will vote for him again."" This video can not be played What Trump voters think of his handling of the virus outbreak Lyle Updike, who is 75 and lives in Kearney, Missouri, says: ""I'm strong on law and order. I don't tolerate this violence - this rioting. I'd like to see the president tighten the screws better."" He added: ""The mayors and governors won't do it, so he needs to."" Rosella Roberts, who works for a musical theatre company in Steelville, Missouri, says she is concerned about the violence: ""I'm not saying that all of the people who are protesting are evil. But when you shoot at a policeman - that's just evil."" The election is still five months away, and the fortunes of the candidates and their political parties may change dramatically. One of the factors is the economy. For many conservatives, the Trump presidency has been a blessing - spiritually as well as financially. Brian Watts, 45, from Kearney, Missouri, says that he loves the image of the president holding a bible while walking near the White House: ""It shows he's for the church."" Brian Watts, who lives in Missouri, says the president has ""got to have security"" Mr Watts' radio station has survived the financial problems brought about by the pandemic, and he is confident that Mr Trump will pull the country out of its malaise. This upbeat view could play a crucial role in the election. As Matthew Mackowiak, a Texas-based political consultant, points out, most elections hinge on economic concerns, not social issues. ""In the end the president's law-and-order mandate probably won't contribute much to the election,"" says Mr Mackowiak. ""But coronavirus and the economy will."" Economists are predicting an uptick in the coming months, a trend that is likely to help Mr Trump. The monthly job numbers this week were better than expected but it's unclear how the pandemic - and possible new infection spikes - will affect the economic recovery. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? Others the BBC spoke to said they have been energised by the protests and horrified by the White House response. They fear the president's language would embolden aggressive police officers. ""People have been turned off by the president's behaviour,"" says Lauren Arthur, 32, a Democratic state senator in Missouri's 17th district, which includes parts of suburban Kansas City. She won in 2018 and believes that progressive women, disturbed by the president's actions, will vote in large numbers: ""They're saying: 'We are going to show up in full force.'"" In Durham, North Carolina, an important battleground state, Gemynii, a 35-year-old poet, wasn't happy to see Mr Trump hold a bible in front of a church near the White House after peaceful protesters were cleared out of the way. Gemynii at a beauty-supply store in North Carolina: ""He's definitely not my president"" ""Yeah, it definitely feels like a nightmare,"" says Gemynii of the president's efforts to impose order. ""I can understand how other countries look at us and don't have respect because of what's going on."" The experience of watching the president in news clips this week has made Gemynii and her friends in Durham even more determined to change the country's leadership. She was distressed when Mr Trump was elected, and his recent actions have reinforced her mission: ""It's another wake-up call for America."" The dismay among Democrats is near-universal, and many of those who have felt lukewarm about Mr Biden, who has centrist roots, now have a different view. They are focused on getting the president out of the White House. Says Peggy Wilson, 68, a retired schoolteacher in Kansas City: ""I don't care who is it - it could be anybody. Just someone to replace him."" Shirley Hartman says that she's had her ups and downs as an artist in Philadelphia, New York and most recently in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania and voted for Democrats in some elections. She chose Mr Trump last time. Afterwards, she says, her business ""slowly went up, year after year"". She has been happy with him as president. With the onset of the pandemic, business has dropped off again, and she is spending time at home with her cats, Darma and Peanut. She takes walks in the park, ""sketching and doing pastels in the grass"", and is hoping for a speedy economic recovery. This variable, one that is still unknown, is likely to decide her vote.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Weibo user Bai Jingting says he'd spend more time with his family The pandemic has had many of us wishing we could turn back the clock and start the year all over again. And thatâs what more than a million social media users in China were discussing on Tuesday: what they would do differently, if that was an option? A whopping 1.8 million users of the popular Sina Weibo platform have used the hashtag#WhatWouldYouDoIf2020Restarted,external. Many have said the pandemic has made them realise things they had taken for granted. One netizen said they would âhave a picture taken with my whole family, because this epidemic has made me understand that my familyâs health is the most important thingâ. Some say they would be ""more humble"", and regret leaving jobs just before Chinese New Year â a common trend around this period. Others are simply reflecting on how they wish theyâd âappreciated othersâ better. âI wish Iâd been a better person,â says one.

The report said,externalthat in Ontario province alone, at least two migrant workers had died with the virus and there were 280 cases. It also said workers were told to work in groups while waiting for test results, and that they were being housed in cramped quarters. Many migrants had the start of their work season delayed because of coronavirus restrictions. Once they did arrive, the new rules forced them to quarantine. During their quarantine, the report found they were underpaid, underfed and not given good health information. The report was based on calls with 180 workers who were speaking on behalf of 1,162 workers, mostly from the Caribbean.  Brazil has restoredits website with detailed coronavirus data,external, following a ruling earlier on Tuesday by the Supreme Court. The health ministry caused outrage when it removed pages of detailed Covid-19 data over the weekend and said it would no longer publish cumulative totals. But on Tuesday the country's highest court ordered the ministry to resume the publication of figures for deaths and infections.
Judge Alexandre de Moraes said the government's actions ""made it impossible"" to monitor the spread of the virus and implement adequate controls. The UK government is coming under increasing pressure from MPs and businesses to relax the 2m (6ft) rule for social distancing. Trade body UK Hospitality insists the current separation ruleswould be impossible for bars and restaurants to follow, and the Financial Times is reporting thatthe ""majority of the cabinet"" supports a reduction,external. The 2m distance is also one of the challenges schools face in reopening: head teachers and governors have said they lack the space to bring all pupils back. But scientistscontinue to question whether a reduction would be safe, given how little is known about how far coronavirus can spread. Read more from our science editor David Shukman. The doves are a popular attraction at the mosque More than 1,000 doves kept at a famous mosque in Afghanistan have died of starvation after the building was closed due to the coronavirus. Caretakers at the 12th-Century, blue-tiled mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif told AFP news agency that the doves were dying because there were no visitors to feed them. ""Every day about 30 doves die. We bury them outside the shrine,"" said mosque official Qayum Ansari, adding that more than 1,000 had already died. The birds are a popular attraction and many visitors consider them sacred. The mosque is one of many buildings closed in a nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus. The country has registered more than 21,000 confirmed cases but the real number is thought to be much higher. Government officials in Balkh province have now promised to supply bird food for the doves, if mosque managers will allow it. The ancient mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif is famous for its blue tiles Helen BriggsBBC science and health journalist A new study has linked blood group to susceptibility to coronavirus. The data, regarded as preliminary, suggests that individuals
with blood type O, the most common in the UK, are less likely to test positive for
Covid-19. The research, carried out by genetic-testing company 23andMe,external, echoes other studies on the blood groups of coronavirus patients. Many teams have been investigating how genetic factors could explain why
some people who contract the virus have relatively few symptoms, while others
become severely ill. Last
week, a study from Italy and Spain found patients with type A blood were more
likely to need oxygen or go on a ventilator. An earlier Chinese study produced similar results. But scientists say itâs not clear whether it is
blood group that influences risk, or some other genetic factor. There are four main blood groups â A, B, AB and O â and they're determined by the genes inherited from your parents. Students in the UK must decide by the middle of next week whether or not to accept university offers for the new academic year. It's a big decision - even more so this year as many lectures are due to take place online and socialising could be very difficult when term begins. So, will universities open in September? Many have already decided to alter their normal schedule. Cambridge will hold lectures online for the entire year, while Manchester will have online lectures for the first autumn term. The deadline for prospective studentsto decide on whether to accept offers has been pushed back,externalto 18 June. See here for a breakdown of what you need to be thinking aboutif deciding whether you're going to start your studies in September.

Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there will be a âlimited exemptionâ for immediate family members of Canadian citizens to cross into Canada from the US. Theborder has been closed to non-essential travel since 21 Marchand the earliest it would reopen would be 21 June. Many non-Canadian citizens have been denied entry, despite being married to Canadians. Those affected includeexpectant parents Ashley and Tim Cook,external. Ashley Cook is a Canadian living in Windsor, Ontario and her husband and the father of her child lives just over the border in Michigan. The new announcement reiterated that anyone coming from the US, which has been hit hard by the virus, would have to quarantine for 14 days. ""If you don't follow these rules, you could face serious penalties,"" Trudeau said. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The aviation
industry is in a deep crisis, and governments around the world have responded.
Today alone, we have seen the announcement of a major support package for
aerospace in France, while Cathay Pacific received a Â£4bn bail-out from the Hong Kong government. Lockdowns have forced airlines to ground aircraft, depriving them of much of their income. That in turn means they will struggle
to afford new planes, so manufacturers have had to slash production - forcing their suppliers to cut back as well. In France, some
300,000 jobs rely on the aerospace industry. That's why the government in
Paris thinks it is worth providing some Â£12bn in grants, loans and
guarantees (Â£5.5bn for Air France alone) to prop it up. In the UK, by
contrast, there has been little government largesse. Easyjet and
British Airways have borrowed under Covid-19 loan schemes, and many
companies have been able to furlough employees. But there has been nothing on the scale of the rescues seen elsewhere. And job cuts are mounting. People within the
industry say there is deep frustration that the UK government has been willing to introduce a stringent quarantine regime that threatens to do more damage, but hasnât done a great deal to
help them. Time, they say,
is running out. Justin RowlattChief Environment correspondent Coronavirus has changed the way we use energy - at least for now. But could the pandemic finally finish off coal, the most polluting of all fossil fuels? The Covid-19 crisis has been an extraordinary and terrifying time for us all, but it has been a fascinating period to cover environmental issues. We've all enjoyed the unusually clean air and clear skies. They are the most obvious evidence that we have been living through a unique experiment in energy use. Locking hundreds of millions of us down in our homes around the world has led to an unprecedented fall in energy demand, including for electricity. And that has, in turn, revealed something striking about the economics of the energy industry: the underlying vulnerability of coal, the fuel that powered the creation of the modern world. Read more. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The environmentâs big moment? Prof Heneghan said the data showed it was best to get coronavirus under the age of 45 Society will need to have ""rational debates"" about when is the least risky age to be infected with coronavirus if a vaccine does not materialise, an expert has said. Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, said Covid-19 is behaving in a way similar to seasonal flu in its disproportionate impact on the elderly. He told a Science Media Centre briefing: ""It matters when you get infections in relation to your risk - I think that's incredibly important. ""So we will start to have some rational debates, because many infections, we know if you get them when you're very young you actually do very well, for instance chickenpox, you get that when you're young and you confer immunity. ""So, if you took away the concept that there were no vaccinations, let's park that aside and this becomes a circulating endemic infection, we will start to have to have a debate around when is it better to get this infection? ""If you look at the data, it is when you're under 45. As you get older then it's worse for you."" The queue for food at New York's Barclays Center stretched around the block Since the start of the US outbreak, Food Bank for New York City has distributed 21m meals, marking a 20% increase from the same period last year, the charity say. Almost 80% of food pantries and soup kitchens reported an increase in families with children visiting. According to the report, the crushing demand for food assistance caused more than half of the food banks to run out of supplies in April. Food Bank for New York City CEO Leslie Gordon said the rise in demand represents ""the new normal"". At the peak of the outbreak 40% of the city's food banks were closed, largely because they are run by seniors who are particularly at risk of infection. A safari park in England has questioned why changes to the lockdown have allowed drivers ""to get a Big Mac, but not to see our big cats"". Knowsley Safari near Liverpool, which has been closed since 23 March, said people would be safe to visit as it was similar to using a McDonald's drive-through. A spokeswoman said being told to remain closed while the restaurants are allowed to reopen""doesn't make sense"". She added: ""We can't understand why it's now OK for people to go into shops or visit public spaces where there's no enforced social distancing, but not stay in their vehicle on the safari drive."" Reality Check Earlier, UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma was asked about the 2m (6ft)
social distancing rule, during the government'sDowning Street briefing. ""When safe to do so we'll see if we can move to a
shorter distance,"" he said. For now, the rule remains. Keeping people from different households at least 2m apart helps prevent the spread of coronavirus. But is also makes it much
harder to open places such as cafes and restaurants â leading to calls for a
review. The World Health Organization says a distance of 1m is
safe, and that rule is also in place in China, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Lithuania
and Singapore. The rule is 1.5m in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy,
the Netherlands and Portugal. Apart from the UK, the 2m rule is in place in Canada and Spain. You can read more about the evidence behind the 2m rule here. BBC Radio 5 Live The focus today in England has been on primary schools, and the roll back from allowing all pupils to return before the summer holidays. But the government has also confirmed that secondary schools in the country will not be opening until September at the earliest. So just how have
pupils been coping during lockdown? One 16-year-old A-level student from Hackney, east London, has been telling BBC Radio 5 Live that she has found it hard to stay motivated. âA lot of my friends descended into this kind of panic,"" she told presenter Emma Barnett. ""Feeling
we were doomed - and that was reflected in a lack of online engagement and
education.â But says she is now ""feeling a little bit more
hopefulâ and the lockdown has given her âtime to think about discipline
and how I learn, and educate myself"". Miriam Jordan Keane from the National Citizen Service said her organisation has set up an online hub for pupils, instead of running its regular schemes this summer. ""We had no idea of what the summer of 'no you can't' was
going to feel like for young people - no you can't go to school, no you can't
do your exams, no you can't celebrate the summer of a lifetime,â she said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

cinemas will be able to reopen in England from 15 June, the prime minister is due to announce. Boris Johnson is expected to
outline the latest step in the easing of the coronavirus lockdown at
Wednesday's daily briefing. He will say the outdoor
attractions can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. Some zoos, including Chester Zoo
and London Zoo, have reported financial struggles during the pandemic. The move will pave the way for the sites to reopen on the same day asnon-essential shops. A vigil for medical workers who died from Covid-19 was held in Iquitos, Peru Peru's Health Ministry has released its latest figures, showing confirmed cases of coronavirus have risen to 203,736. The country has also registered 5,738 deaths, since its first case on 6 March. It has the second highest number of cases in Latin America, after Brazil. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Weibo user Bai Jingting says he'd spend more time with his family The pandemic has had many of us wishing we could turn back the clock and start the year all over again. And thatâs what more than a million social media users in China were discussing on Tuesday: what they would do differently, if that was an option? A whopping 1.8 million users of the popular Sina Weibo platform have used the hashtag#WhatWouldYouDoIf2020Restarted,external. Many have said the pandemic has made them realise things they had taken for granted. One netizen said they would âhave a picture taken with my whole family, because this epidemic has made me understand that my familyâs health is the most important thingâ. Some say they would be ""more humble"", and regret leaving jobs just before Chinese New Year â a common trend around this period.

All shops in England can open on Monday - ministerBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma confirms retailers can open if they follow coronavirus safety rules.UK,"Signs remind shoppers of social distancing rules in a River Island store in Liverpool All non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen in England on Monday, the business secretary has confirmed. Alok Sharma said ""we continue to meet""the government's five tests for lifting coronavirus lockdown restrictions. He said retailers can open as long as they follow safety guidelines, or they could face enforcement notices. But asked about the possibility of reducing the 2m social distancing rule, Mr Sharma said ""we keep these matters under review"" but did not give a date. He also said pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers will not be able to reopen until 4 July ""at the earliest"". In Northern Ireland,all shops are allowed to open from Friday. No dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland and Wales, although each country has set out its planned stages for lifting lockdown. It comes as the number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus increased by 286 to a total of 40,883,official government figures on Tuesday show.,external The previous day, the UKhad recorded its lowest daily risein deaths - 55 - since before the lockdown on 23 March. There tends to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. The number of new confirmed cases in the UK has also increased by 1,387. Deaths linked to coronavirus continue to fall Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsignalled in Maythat all non-essential shops would be allowed to reopen in England on 15 June. Confirming that it was still going ahead at the daily Downing Street briefing on Tuesday, Mr Sharma said the change would allow the High Street to ""spring back to life"". He said businesses must follow the government'ssocial distancing and hygiene guidelines,externalpublished last month, and all retailers that open must complete a coronavirus risk assessment. Enforcement notices can be issued if shops reopen without the safety steps in place, Mr Sharma added. A member of staff at a south London furniture store tests a customer's temperature Open air markets were among the businesses allowed to open at the start of June Some retailers have already said they will open their stores in England gradually from 15 June. Department store John Lewis will only open 13 branches initially, while Next will only open 25 of its 500 stores at first. Some shops, such as supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations have been able to remain open during the coronavirus lockdown. And others - including furniture stores, open-air markets and car showrooms - were allowed to reopen at the start of June. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft 5ins ) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. And those measures are also likely to feature in other shops. But some more unfamiliar measures are also expected to be put in place to try to reduce the spread of the virus. Shoe shop Kurt Geiger will put footwear aside for 24 hours after a customer has tried them on, and Waterstones has said it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. Stores have been askedto encourage people to shop alone, if they can,,externaland talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible,to stop people using public transport.

Mr Sharma said other businesses such as restaurants, pubs, bars and hairdressers will remain closed until 4 July at the earliest, as per the government's ""road map"". Pub companieshave calledon the government to halve the 2m rule, saying many pubs would struggle to operate. The trade body UK Hospitality estimated that, with a 2m rule still in place, outlets would be able to make about 30% of normal revenues, whereas 1m would mean about 60-75%. Asked about the distance, Mr Sharma said: ""We, of course, take advice from our scientists and of course when it is safe to do so we will see whether you can move to a shorter distance but ultimately we keep all of these things under review.""

All shops in England can open on Monday - minister,"Signs remind shoppers of social distancing rules in a River Island store in Liverpool All non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen in England on Monday, the business secretary has confirmed. Alok Sharma said ""we continue to meet""the government's five tests for lifting coronavirus lockdown restrictions. He said retailers can open as long as they follow safety guidelines, or they could face enforcement notices. But asked about the possibility of reducing the 2m social distancing rule, Mr Sharma said ""we keep these matters under review"" but did not give a date. He also said pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers will not be able to reopen until 4 July ""at the earliest"". In Northern Ireland,all shops are allowed to open from Friday. No dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland and Wales, although each country has set out its planned stages for lifting lockdown. It comes as the number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus increased by 286 to a total of 40,883,official government figures on Tuesday show.,external The previous day, the UKhad recorded its lowest daily risein deaths - 55 - since before the lockdown on 23 March. There tends to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. The number of new confirmed cases in the UK has also increased by 1,387. Deaths linked to coronavirus continue to fall Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsignalled in Maythat all non-essential shops would be allowed to reopen in England on 15 June. Confirming that it was still going ahead at the daily Downing Street briefing on Tuesday, Mr Sharma said the change would allow the High Street to ""spring back to life"". He said businesses must follow the government'ssocial distancing and hygiene guidelines,externalpublished last month, and all retailers that open must complete a coronavirus risk assessment. Enforcement notices can be issued if shops reopen without the safety steps in place, Mr Sharma added. A member of staff at a south London furniture store tests a customer's temperature Open air markets were among the businesses allowed to open at the start of June Some retailers have already said they will open their stores in England gradually from 15 June. Department store John Lewis will only open 13 branches initially, while Next will only open 25 of its 500 stores at first. Some shops, such as supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations have been able to remain open during the coronavirus lockdown. And others - including furniture stores, open-air markets and car showrooms - were allowed to reopen at the start of June. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains how to keep safe while shopping Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft 5ins ) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. And those measures are also likely to feature in other shops. But some more unfamiliar measures are also expected to be put in place to try to reduce the spread of the virus. Shoe shop Kurt Geiger will put footwear aside for 24 hours after a customer has tried them on, and Waterstones has said it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. Stores have been askedto encourage people to shop alone, if they can,,externaland talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible,to stop people using public transport. Read more about shops reopening. Mr Sharma said other businesses such as restaurants, pubs, bars and hairdressers will remain closed until 4 July at the earliest, as per the government's ""road map"". Pub companieshave calledon the government to halve the 2m rule, saying many pubs would struggle to operate. The trade body UK Hospitality estimated that, with a 2m rule still in place, outlets would be able to make about 30% of normal revenues, whereas 1m would mean about 60-75%. Asked about the distance, Mr Sharma said: ""We, of course, take advice from our scientists and of course when it is safe to do so we will see whether you can move to a shorter distance but ultimately we keep all of these things under review."" He acknowledged that other countries had moved to shorter distances but said ""they are further along in terms of their road map, in terms of opening up businesses"". 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented?

Daniel Radcliffe criticises JK Rowling trans tweets,"Eddie Redmayne is the second major Wizarding World star to speak out against its creator JK Rowling and in support of trans people. ""I disagree with Jo's comments. Trans women are women, trans men are men and non-binary identities are valid,"" the actor said in a statement. Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe released a similar statement on Monday. JK Rowling has been criticised for tweets taking issue with the phrase ""people who menstruate"". Eddie Redmayne plays Newt Scamander in the Harry Potter spin-off film series Fantastic Beasts, which are written by JK Rowling. He was also nominated for an Oscar in 2016 for his portrayal of a fictional version of trans woman Lili Elbe in The Danish Girl. Eddie Redmayne has played Newt Scamander in two Fantastic Beasts films so far His statement, given toVariety,,externalwent on to say: ""I would never want to speak on behalf of the community but I do know that my dear transgender friends and colleagues are tired of this constant questioning of their identities, which all too often results in violence and abuse. ""They simply want to live their lives peacefully, and it's time to let them do so."" Daniel Radcliffeposted,externalon the website of The Trevor Project, an LGBT suicide prevention charity. ""Transgender women are women,"" he wrote. ""Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people."" He added that he hopes JK Rowling's comments about gender will not ""taint"" the Harry Potter series for fans. Radcliffe said this was not about ""in-fighting"" - instead he felt ""compelled to say something"" because Rowling was responsible for the ""course his life has taken"". ""If these books taught you that love is the strongest force in the universe... that dogmatic ideas of pureness lead to the oppression of vulnerable groups; if you believe that a particular character is trans, non-binary, or gender fluid, or that they are gay or bisexual; if you found anything in these stories that resonated with you and helped you at any time in your life - then that is between you and the book that you read, and it is sacred. ""I hope that these comments will not taint that too much."" The actor started supporting the charity, which provides suicide-prevention counselling to young people in the US, in 2009. The author tweeted at the weekend about an article discussing ""people who menstruate"". ""I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?"" In response, she was called transphobic. Rowling stood by her comments, saying it ""isn't hate to speak the truth"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Radcliffe said it's important not to ""invalidate"" transgender people's identities and ""cause further harm"". ""Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I.""

Leung tweeted: ""So, you want my thoughts on Cho Chang? Okay, here goes..."" Instead of commenting, she used the rest of the thread to share links to charities helping black trans people. Transgender people say they just want equal rights, but some groups believe that will lessen women's rights. A key differentiation is between the words ""sex"" and ""gender"". Our sex, which is physical - male or female - is distinct from our gender, which is psychological and social. ""Women are oppressed on the basis of their biological sex, not their gender identity. There has to be a place for the female sex as a distinct group,"" said Stephanie Davies-Arai, who founded the Transgender Trend website - a place for parents to discuss trans issues. This argument - the distinction between sex and gender - is refuted by some, including trans activist Julia Serano, who arguesthere are more than two discrete mutually exclusive sexes.,external Instead, she argues sex is made up of a number of variable dimorphic traits - like chromosomes and reproductive organs - that sometimes align in a person and sometimes don't.

""No matter what torture I was feeling, I could escape it. What people said to me couldn't hurt me. I was no longer in Birmingham, I was at Hogwarts."" Now she no longer wants to read the books. ""As children, watching the movies, you'd with siblings and say 'I'll be Hermoine! I'll be Harry!'. She's taken that away. I know she thinks I can't be a woman because I wasn't born one. ""It feels like this magical world she created for me, where anyone can be themselves, wasn't real."" Scarlet Marie says the Harry Potter books ""saved"" her Rowling was criticised in December last year for defending a woman wholost her job after saying children cannot change their biological sex. At Maya Forstater's employment tribunal, which she lost, the judge spoke about the ""enormous pain that can be caused by misgendering"".

George Floyd's funeral to be held in Houston,"Mourners wore ""I can't breathe"" badges at the service The funeral of George Floyd, an African American whose death in police custody spawned global outrage, has heard impassioned pleas for racial justice. Speakers in the church in Houston, Texas, lined up to remember a man whose ""crime was that he was born black"". Mr Floyd died in Minneapolis last month as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, his final moments filmed on phones. Four police officers involved have been sacked and chargedover his death. His coffin was taken from the church driven in a motorcade to the Houston Memorial Gardens where he was to be buried beside his mother. This video can not be played George Floyd's niece: 'This is not just murder, but a hate crime' One of Mr Floyd's nieces, Brooke Williams, called for a change in laws which, she argued, were designed to disadvantage black people. ""Why must this system be corrupt and broken?"" she asked. ""Laws were already put in place for the African-American system to fail. And these laws need to be changed. No more hate crimes, please! Someone said 'Make America Great Again', but when has America ever been great?"" Republican President Donald Trump's Democratic opponent in the November presidential election, Joe Biden, addressed the service in a video message, saying: ""When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America."" George Floyd's body was loaded into a hearse Mr Biden has sharply criticised Mr Trump,accusing him at the weekend of making ""despicable"" speculative remarks about Mr Floyd. But the Democratic politician was himself recently accused of taking black American votes for grantedwhen he said African Americans ""ain't black"" if they even considered voting for Mr Trump. The service was held at the Fountain of Praise church,attended by some 500 guests,externalincluding politicians and celebrities. ""George Floyd was not expendable - this is why we're here,"" said Al Green, the local Democratic congressman. ""His crime was that he was born black."" Veteran civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton told the service: ""All over the world I see grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters' statues."" Talking about Mr Floyd's difficult life, he said: ""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that's gonna change the whole wide world."" In Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz called on people to honour the funeral by observing silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time Mr Floyd was pinned to the ground before he died. Mourners paid respects before the service Many wore ""I can't breathe"" badges Mr Floyd's coffin was taken to a cemetery in Pearland, south of Houston, for a private burial ceremony. For the last mile of the procession it was conveyed in a horse-drawn carriage.

Britain goes coal free as fossil fuels edged out,"This video can not be played Here are some coal-fired power stations being demolished over the years Britain is about to pass a significant landmark - at midnight on Wednesday it will have gone two full months without burning coal to generate power. A decade ago about 40% of the country's electricity came from coal; coronavirus is part of the story, but far from all. When Britain went into lockdown, electricity demand plummeted; the National Grid responded by taking power plants off the network. The four remaining coal-fired plants were among the first to be shut down. The last coal generator came off the system at midnight on 9 April. No coal has been burnt for electricity since. The current coal-free period smashes the previous record of 18 days, 6 hours and 10 minutes which was set in June last year. Can coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external(PDF, 10.4MB) Coronavirus: Five charts about the biggest carbon crash The figures apply to Britain only, as Northern Ireland is not on the National Grid. But it reveals just how dramatic the transformation of our energy system has been in the last decade. That the country does not need to use the fuel that used to be the backbone of the grid is thanks to a massive investment in renewable energy over the last decade. Two examples illustrate just how much the UK's energy networks have changed. A decade ago just 3% of the country's electricity came from wind and solar, which many people saw as a costly distraction. This video can not be played Could coronavirus be the environment's big moment? Now the UK has the biggest offshore wind industry in the world, as well as the largest single wind farm, completed off the coast of Yorkshire last year. At the same time Drax, the country's biggest power plant, has been taking a different path to renewable energy. The plant, which is also in Yorkshire, generates 5% of the country's electricity. A decade ago, it was the biggest consumer of coal in the UK but has been switching to compressed wood pellets. Drax plans to phase out coal entirely by March next year. Drax power station in Yorkshire has been switching from coal to wood pellets ""We here at Drax decided that coal was no longer the future,"" explains Will Gardiner, the chief executive of the power group. ""It has been a massive undertaking and then the result of all that is we've reduced our CO2 emissions from more than 20 million tonnes a year to almost zero."" That is a controversial claim. Environmental activists point out that wood actually produces more carbon dioxide per unit of power generated than coal when it is burnt to generate electricity. They also say it will take many years for the trees in US forests where Drax sources the seven million tonnes of wood pellets it now burns each year to absorb the CO2 the power plant and its wood processing operations produce each year. And it is not just coal that is being eclipsed by renewables. So far this year, renewables have generated more power than all fossil fuels put together. Breaking it down, renewables were responsible for 37% of electricity supplied to the network versus 35% for fossil fuels. Nuclear accounted for about 18% and imports for the remaining 10% or so, according to figures from the online environmental journal, Carbon Brief. ""So far this year renewables have generated more electricity than fossil fuels and that's never happened before"", says Dr Simon Evans of Carbon Brief. ""With gas also in decline, there's a real chance that renewables will overtake fossil fuels in 2020 as a whole."" Setting the figures for this year context shows just how quickly this turnaround has happened. The first day when renewable power out-generated fossil fuels was in December 2016. Before this year, there had been a total of 154 days when the combined power created from renewable sources exceeded those from fossil fuels. Carbon Brief says that 91 of those days occurred in 2019. The decline in the role of fossil fuels in general and coal in particular looks set to continue. The remaining three coal plants in the UK will be shut down within five years. Then the fuel that sparked the industrial revolution here in Britain almost two centuries ago will be a thing of the past.

School still out for most pupils but what do parents think?,"Victoria Rogers says children need some degree of normality Relief that children will be kept away from school for another few months, or despair that they are losing out on education and time with their friends? What do parents make of the government's ditching of a plan for all primary school years in England to go back to school for four weeks before the end of term? Jonathan Wills a parent from Barnton Primary in Northwich in Cheshire says families need to get back to some sort of routine. ""I think it's going to be extremely difficult for kids and some families, because it's a long time to try to recreate the structure that schools give you. ""And I think without that structure, a lot of schools and kids will struggle, particularly with the stresses of financial problems and then all the types of psychological problems. ""I think the kids that were struggling before will be struggling even more now."" Mother-of-two Victoria Rogers agrees: ""I do think children should start coming back to school, as we need to get back to some form of normality."" Jonathan Wills says many families are struggling But elsewhere, mother-of-one Molly told the BBC she is relieved that not all primary years will be returning this term, as she would not have been prepared to send her daughter back to school. ""Until it is safe for parliament to sit next to each other and until it's 'safe' to cuddle your own blood mother, then how is it deemed safe to mix your children with numerous other households? Plan dropped for all primary pupils back in school Schools to remain shut over virus infection fear ""But our children can be placed into school with numerous other households' children. Even at small groups of 15, how is that safe? When we are only allowed to meet up in groups of six? ""It's either dangerous to us all or it's not as dangerous as what they are making out. ""As much as my daughter needs to go back to school and the lockdown has taken its toll with her, I will not be sending her back. ""If it's this big killer, keeping us away from blood relatives, then it's not safe."" For some families, there is a difference of opinion even within the family. One mother-of-three - who was expecting two of hers to return to school before the summer - told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that her children had opposing views on the matter. ""I know that one of them is going to be really disappointed at the prospect of not seeing her friends. ""That's been something she's really counting down to, even though we knew it was uncertain. ""But the boy in Year 5 will be absolutely delighted!"" As for her, she remains ambivalent on it all: ""I feel sort of resigned to it really. I just feel sad for them that they're not going to see their friends for such a long time now."" Nigel Rowlands says his daughter is happier now she is back to school Another mother told Today said she was ""unsurprised"" but ""incredibly disappointed"" by the news. ""I feel really sad for my son. I've got one son in year two, and another one in reception. ""My child in reception's gone back, albeit only four days a week, every other week. ""And my older son, who is just about to turn seven, is desperate to go back, can't understand, thinks it's so unfair - which it is. ""He and the school are going to have to put up with my rather inadequate home schooling, while I'm stuck at home, also with a one-and-a-half year old, trying to juggle a business and everything else."" But another mother, with two children aged eight and six, told Today she thought a return before the summer was too early. ""I'm actually relieved if schools don't go back until September because I think it's too soon. ""They don't socially distance at that age. I don't think there's enough protective equipment available in school."" However, for Nigel Rowlands, the past few weeks have been very difficult and he is glad to have his daughter back in school. ""It's been difficult - we've been through a lot. There's no structure, learning at home is entirely different to learning at school,"" he told the BBC. ""I've been working from home. So we've just spent a huge amount of time together, confined within four walls with not a lot of other places to go to. ""We try to get out and do a daily walk, but that's not the same as spending all day in school with other people. ""Having her back in school now has given some of that structure back and that's reflected in her being connected with other children and you can see that in that her demeanour is completely different since she's been back in school.""

"Head removed from pub sign amid racism rowResidents, who acted before the council could remove it, vowed to return the head ""at a later date"".Derby","Mark Redfern said the head was ""saved by the people of Ashbourne"" A figure of a black man's head has been removed from a pub sign amid a row over racism. Derbyshire Dales District Council said on Monday the 18th Century iron and wood feature in Ashbourne would be""removed with immediate effect"". About 150 residents gathered to take down the figure, vowing to return it, before the council could act. A petition to remove the head, launched on Friday, has gathered more than 40,000 signatures. The district council said permanent removal of the head would need listed building consent and consultation with Historic England Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Ashbourne resident Mark Redfern said the head, which is part of the Grade II*-listed sign for The Green Man & Black's Head Royal Hotel in St John Street, ""will be restored while on the ground and returned to its position at a later date"". He said local councillors witnessed the removal. In a Facebook post, Mr Redfern said the head would be given ""a lick of black paint"", and claimed the move was to save it from vandalism. His son, 17-year-old Shaun Redfern, has gathered more than 4,000 signatures on a petition calling for the head to remain for historical reasons. The district council said it intended to remove the sign as it was a public safety concern and the issue required urgent discussion Resident Darren Waring, who said he was involved in taking down the feature, said: ""People are making these racist overtures without knowing the facts."" He said the figure is a head of a Turkish man who came to Ashbourne hundreds of years ago and traded coffee. ""He brought prosperity. He was a well-respected and well-loved Turkish man so in his honour they put his head up. It has nothing to do with slavery,"" he said. He added in the 1980s, he went up to the sign to restore it with his father. ""The sign was actually dark brown,"" he said. ""My dad explained to me this is a Turkish man, not a black man. It was painted brown then something has gone wrong in the restoration."" A 19-year-old student from the town said: ""Having it in the middle of the street in a small town is so unwelcoming"" Derbyshire Dales District Council's decision to remove the head followed the statue of a slave trader in Bristol beingtorn downduring demonstrations on Sunday. A council spokesman said a councillor spoke to the group, explaining the council needed to take down the figure temporarily in the interests of public safety ahead of a consultation. He said: ""The group, who had ladders, then decided they would remove the figure themselves for safe keeping and, not wanting to create a confrontation, in the circumstances we did not object. ""We expect to have possession of the head figure later today."" Historic England said: ""As the government's adviser on heritage, we will be ready to advise the council on next steps if they need it."" The mid-18th Century sign bridges St John Street One 20-year-old anthropology student from the town - who did not want to be named - said the sign resembled a gollywog, a 19th Century rag doll which is largely considered racist. ""I think people are ashamed of it,"" she said. Matthew Holt, a 19-year-old international relations student from Ashbourne, said: ""It should be in a museum where we can learn about it with a description to contextualise it."" Councillor Barry Lewis, Derbyshire's County Council leader,said,externalthe figure should not be taken down, although it was ""clearly culturally insensitive and racist"". He added: ""Cultural heritage is there to challenge us sometimes, to make us uncomfortable."" The district council said it was gifted the sign a number of years ago A Derbyshire Police spokesman said officers attended from 21:00 until 23:00 BST to ""monitor the situation and ensure there were no breaches of the peace"". ""There were no arrests,"" he said. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external. Send your story ideas toeastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk.

"Daniel Radcliffe criticises JK Rowling trans tweetsThe Harry Potter star said he was ""compelled to say something"" after Rowling was called transphobic.","Eddie Redmayne is the second major Wizarding World star to speak out against its creator JK Rowling and in support of trans people. ""I disagree with Jo's comments. Trans women are women, trans men are men and non-binary identities are valid,"" the actor said in a statement. Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe released a similar statement on Monday. JK Rowling has been criticised for tweets taking issue with the phrase ""people who menstruate"". Eddie Redmayne plays Newt Scamander in the Harry Potter spin-off film series Fantastic Beasts, which are written by JK Rowling. He was also nominated for an Oscar in 2016 for his portrayal of a fictional version of trans woman Lili Elbe in The Danish Girl. Eddie Redmayne has played Newt Scamander in two Fantastic Beasts films so far His statement, given toVariety,,externalwent on to say: ""I would never want to speak on behalf of the community but I do know that my dear transgender friends and colleagues are tired of this constant questioning of their identities, which all too often results in violence and abuse. ""They simply want to live their lives peacefully, and it's time to let them do so."" Daniel Radcliffeposted,externalon the website of The Trevor Project, an LGBT suicide prevention charity. ""Transgender women are women,"" he wrote. ""Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people."" He added that he hopes JK Rowling's comments about gender will not ""taint"" the Harry Potter series for fans. Radcliffe said this was not about ""in-fighting"" - instead he felt ""compelled to say something"" because Rowling was responsible for the ""course his life has taken"". ""If these books taught you that love is the strongest force in the universe... that dogmatic ideas of pureness lead to the oppression of vulnerable groups; if you believe that a particular character is trans, non-binary, or gender fluid, or that they are gay or bisexual; if you found anything in these stories that resonated with you and helped you at any time in your life - then that is between you and the book that you read, and it is sacred. ""I hope that these comments will not taint that too much."" The actor started supporting the charity, which provides suicide-prevention counselling to young people in the US, in 2009. The author tweeted at the weekend about an article discussing ""people who menstruate"". ""I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?"" In response, she was called transphobic. Rowling stood by her comments, saying it ""isn't hate to speak the truth"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

I do not believe it's hateful to say so. ""I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives."" Radcliffe said it's important not to ""invalidate"" transgender people's identities and ""cause further harm"". ""Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I.""

Conversation online had touched on the representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic characters in the Harry Potter series, with Cho Chang trending on Twitter. Leung tweeted: ""So, you want my thoughts on Cho Chang? Okay, here goes..."" Instead of commenting, she used the rest of the thread to share links to charities helping black trans people. Transgender people say they just want equal rights, but some groups believe that will lessen women's rights. A key differentiation is between the words ""sex"" and ""gender"". Our sex, which is physical - male or female - is distinct from our gender, which is psychological and social. ""Women are oppressed on the basis of their biological sex, not their gender identity. There has to be a place for the female sex as a distinct group,"" said Stephanie Davies-Arai, who founded the Transgender Trend website - a place for parents to discuss trans issues. This argument - the distinction between sex and gender - is refuted by some, including trans activist Julia Serano, who arguesthere are more than two discrete mutually exclusive sexes.,external Instead, she argues sex is made up of a number of variable dimorphic traits - like chromosomes and reproductive organs - that sometimes align in a person and sometimes don't.

""No matter what torture I was feeling, I could escape it. What people said to me couldn't hurt me. I was no longer in Birmingham, I was at Hogwarts."" Now she no longer wants to read the books.

Holiday lettings firm reverses no-refund policy,"The holiday firm behind Hoseasons and Cottages.com has agreed to give customers refunds for trips which have been cancelled because of the coronavirus crisis. The Competition and Markets Authority said,externalVacation Rentals had changed its policy after action by the regulator. The CMA said a ""significant proportion"" of complaints it received about holiday lettings were about Vacation Rentals. However, the firm said it had been offering refunds since 30 April. This date is when the CMA published guidance to travel firms on consumer rights and refunds, a Vacation Rentals spokesman said. ""We believe we have acted fairly and responsibly at all times,"" the spokesman said. ""We responded and adapted to the evolving issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic whenever new guidelines from the government were made available."" Vacation Rentals runs 22 brands offering holiday lets in the UK, as well as Italy, France and Ireland. Its other sites include Blue Chip Holidays and Welcome Cottages. The competition watchdog said Vacation Rentals voluntarily changed its policy after originally failing to offer refunds to all customers whose trips were cancelled. The company has now given a formal commitment that customers will have the option of a full refund if a booking has been cancelled because of restrictions associated with the coronavirus outbreak, the CMA said. Airlines warned over passenger refund rights Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund? In a statement, the CMA said:,external""The CMA's Covid-19 Taskforce has so far received around 4,500 reports about UK holiday rental companies, with complaints about Vacation Rentals making up a significant proportion of those reports."" However, Vacation Rentals maintains it had been offering refunds for some time. A spokesman said: ""Following the CMA's statement on 30 April clarifying its view on the law on cancellations of consumer contracts during the Covid-19 pandemic, we acted immediately and expanded the options available to any customers who were due to travel during the government imposed lockdown period to include a full cash refund. ""By the time the CMA's investigation into our business commenced, we were already acting in line with the CMA's guidance."" The CMA is hoping that by trumpeting its success with one holiday let provider, it can push the others into paying full refunds. There are plenty of others which have been reluctant to pay full refunds, in some cases arguing that they are simply the agents and should not be liable. It is important that people who have been fobbed off with vouchers can now go back and demand their money, even if they accepted them. Companies may now decide there is no point in holding out against the CMA if they are going to have to re-open previous cases as well. The CMA said other holiday companies face ""further scrutiny"" because, despite consumer law on refunds being clear, some firms are still refusing to offer customers their money back. Legal action was a possibility, the CMA said. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""Our Covid-19 Taskforce is working hard to ensure that consumers get what they are entitled to, so it's good news that Vacation Rentals has agreed to offer people the refunds they are due. We welcome this step and other holiday lets firms must now follow suit."" He acknowledged that some firms faced financial challenges, ""but it's not right that people are being left hundreds or even thousands of pounds out of pocket - on top of having to sacrifice their holidays. ""Consumer protection law exists for a reason; businesses must observe the law or face the possibility of enforcement action."" The CMA said that common complaints it had received included companies refusing to provide full refunds at all or offering only vouchers instead of cash refunds. The holiday lettings business is just one area where consumers are complaining about refunds. Airlines have also faced a barrage of criticism from disgruntled customers. Rory Boland, travel editor at the consumer group Which?, said: ""While it is positive to see some firms changing their policy on refunds, there are still many customers struggling to get their money back for cancelled holiday accommodation and package travel bookings. ""The CMA must continue to investigate these sectors and come down strongly on any firms found to be flouting the law."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

"London slavery statues 'should be taken down'Mayor Sadiq Khan says the capital has ""an uncomfortable truth"" with historical links to slavery.London","This video can not be played The statue of Robert Milligan was removed by the Canal and River Trust to ""recognise the wishes of the community"" A statue of noted slaveholder Robert Milligan has been removed from outside the Museum of London Docklands. Sadiq Khan earlier announced a review of all of London's statues and street names, saying any with links to slavery ""should be taken down"". On Sunday, anti-racism protesters in Bristoltore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. Milligan's monument was removed to ""recognise the wishes of the community"" said the Canal and River Trust. There were cheers and clapping as the monument was lifted from its plinth using a crane. The Museum of London Docklands said the statue of the prominent British slave trader, who owned two sugar plantations and 526 slaves in Jamaica, had ""stood uncomfortably"" outside its premises ""for a long time"". ""The Museum of London recognises that the monument is part of the ongoing problematic regime of white-washing history, which disregards the pain of those who are still wrestling with the remnants of the crimes Milligan committed against humanity,"" they added. The Canal and River Trust said it had worked with the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, the museum and partners in Canary Wharf to have it removed. As the Milligan statue was lowered from its plinth,thousands of people gathered outside an Oxford collegeto demand the removal of a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes. Milligan was a noted slaveholder and founder of London's global trade hub, West India Docks Mr Khan said London had to face ""an uncomfortable truth"" with its historical links to slavery. The Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm will review the city's landmarks - including murals, street art, street names, statues and other memorials - and consider which legacies should be celebrated before making recommendations. Mr Khan said London was ""one of the most diverse cities in the world"", but said recent Black Lives Matter protests had highlighted that the city's statues, plaques and street names largely reflect Victorian Britain. ""It is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade,"" he said. ""While this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored."" Johnson urges peaceful struggle against racism Head removed from pub sign amid racism row Schools consider dropping Colston name During a Black Lives Matter protest in central London on Sunday, a statue of Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was sprayed with graffiti. But Mr Khan said he did not consider statues of the likes of Churchill to be included in the review. He said pupils needed to be educated about famous figures ""warts and all"" and that ""nobody was perfect"", including the likes of Churchill, Gandhi and Malcolm X. The statue of Robert Milligan was covered with fabric and Black Lives Matter sign before being removed Mr Khan toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmehe did not have ownership of the statues and the land they are on. He also said it would be ""inappropriate"" to single out which statues and street names he thinks should go. Instead a number of new memorials in the capital have been pledged by Mr Khan, including ones for Stephen Lawrence, the Windrush generation, a National Slavery Museum or memorial and a National Sikh War Memorial. A statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti during a Black Lives Matter protest The Local Government Association's (LGA) Labour group has also announced that Labour councils across England and Wales are to review ""the appropriateness"" of monuments and statues in their towns and cities. Campaigns calling for the removal or amendment of monuments celebrating controversial figures have increased in volume around the UK in recent days. In Oxford, 26 councillors and an MP have called for a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodesto be removed from an Oxford University college. A plaque is to be added to a Henry Dundas monument in Edinburghto ""reflect"" the city's links with slavery, while the leader of Cardiff Council said he would support the removal of a statue of slave-owner Sir Thomas Picton from the city's civic building. Guy made his money from the the stock market bubble of 1720. He had shares in the South Sea company when it started trading in 1711, with slaves sold to the Spanish colonies. Robert Milligan was a noted West Indian merchant, slaveholder and founder of London's global trade hub, West India Docks. Aside from founding an educational charity, Sir John Cass was a major figure in the Royal African Company, which was involved in the Atlantic slave economy.

George Floyd murder suspect's bail set at $1.25m,"This video can not be played The history of police violence in the US The Minneapolis ex-policeman accused of killing unarmed black man George Floyd has made his first court appearance, where his bail was set at $1.25m (Â£1m). Prosecutors cited the ""severity of the charges"" and public outrage as the reason for upping his bail from $1m. Derek Chauvin faces charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other arresting officers are charged with aiding and abetting murder. Mr Floyd's death in May led to global protests and calls for police reform. Mr Chauvin, who is white, knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while he was being arrested in Minneapolis on 25 May. He and the three other police officers have since been fired. Who are the officers charged over George Floyd's death? What Trump states make of unrest Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Meanwhile, mourners in Houston, Texas, where Mr Floyd lived before moving to Minneapolis, have been viewing his body, publicly on display for six hours at The Fountain of Praise church. On Tuesday, a private funeral service will be held in Houston. Memorial services have already been held in Minneapolis and North Carolina, where Mr Floyd was born. It is believed a family member escorted Mr Floyd's body on a flight to Texas late on Saturday. Democratic US presidential candidate Joe Biden met privately with Mr Floyd's relatives in Houston to offer his sympathies on Monday. ""He listened, heard their pain, and shared in their woe,"" said Floyd family spokesman Benjamin Crump, who tweeted a photo of the meeting. ""That compassion meant the world to this grieving family."" Aides to the former vice-president said he would also record a video message for Tuesday's service. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Chauvin, a 19-year police veteran, did not enter a plea as he appeared via teleconference on Monday. He did not speak during the 15-minute hearing, and was handcuffed and wearing an orange jumpsuit as he sat at a small table. Judge Jeannice M Reding set a bail of $1.25m with no preconditions, or $1m with conditions that include Mr Chauvin not contacting Mr Floyd's family, surrendering his firearms and not working in law enforcement or security as he awaits trial. His lawyer did not object to the bail price. Mr Chauvin, 44, is currently being held at the Minnesota state prison in Oak Park Heights, after being transferred several times. His next court appearance is set for 29 June. He faces three separate charges: unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, for which the maximum penalties are prison terms of 40, 25 and 10 years respectively. Derek Chauvin is to appear in court by video link Further charges could be brought butit appears unlikely he will be accused of first-degree murder,externalas prosecutors would have to prove premeditation, intent and motive, the Associated Press reports. By bringing multiple charges, prosecutors give jurors a choice and increase the chances of a conviction. Minneapolis city council has voted to ban chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers, and Democrats in Congress have unveiled sweeping legislation on police reform. In France, which saw Black Lives Matter protests over the weekend, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner announced that police would no longer be allowed to use chokeholds to arrest people. France's police watchdog has revealed that there were 1,500 complaints against officers last year, half of them for alleged assaults. It is the turn of people in Houston to pay their respects Masked and gloved mourners have been filing past Mr Floyd's coffin in line with coronavirus social distancing requirements, with only 15 guests allowed in the church at a time. Mr Floyd's body is on display at the Fountain of Praise church Anti-racism protests started by Mr Floyd's death are now entering their third week in the US. Huge rallies have been held in several cities, including Washington DC, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. With the rallying cries ""Black Lives matter"" and ""No Justice, No Peace"", the demonstrations are among the largest US protests against racism since the 1960s. Saturday's gatherings included a protest in the Texas town of Vidor, once infamous as a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group. The majority of protests have been peaceful, however episodes of looting and violence have been reported.President Donald Trump has threatened to call up troops to quash any unrest.

Protesters in European cities including London and Rome also gathered to show their support for Black Lives Matter over the weekend, whileanti-racism protests in Australia were attended by tens of thousands. In the city of Bristol in the UK, protesters tore down a statue of Edward Colston, a prominent 17th Century slave trader. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"".

Biden: I think Floyd will change the world,"Mourners wore ""I can't breathe"" badges at the service The funeral of George Floyd, an African American whose death in police custody spawned global outrage, has heard impassioned pleas for racial justice. Speakers in the church in Houston, Texas, lined up to remember a man whose ""crime was that he was born black"". Mr Floyd died in Minneapolis last month as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, his final moments filmed on phones. Four police officers involved have been sacked and chargedover his death. His coffin was taken from the church driven in a motorcade to the Houston Memorial Gardens where he was to be buried beside his mother. This video can not be played George Floyd's niece: 'This is not just murder, but a hate crime' One of Mr Floyd's nieces, Brooke Williams, called for a change in laws which, she argued, were designed to disadvantage black people. ""Why must this system be corrupt and broken?"" she asked. ""Laws were already put in place for the African-American system to fail. And these laws need to be changed. No more hate crimes, please! Someone said 'Make America Great Again', but when has America ever been great?"" Republican President Donald Trump's Democratic opponent in the November presidential election, Joe Biden, addressed the service in a video message, saying: ""When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America."" George Floyd's body was loaded into a hearse Mr Biden has sharply criticised Mr Trump,accusing him at the weekend of making ""despicable"" speculative remarks about Mr Floyd. But the Democratic politician was himself recently accused of taking black American votes for grantedwhen he said African Americans ""ain't black"" if they even considered voting for Mr Trump. The service was held at the Fountain of Praise church,attended by some 500 guests,externalincluding politicians and celebrities. ""George Floyd was not expendable - this is why we're here,"" said Al Green, the local Democratic congressman. ""His crime was that he was born black."" Veteran civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton told the service: ""All over the world I see grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters' statues."" Talking about Mr Floyd's difficult life, he said: ""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that's gonna change the whole wide world."" In Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz called on people to honour the funeral by observing silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time Mr Floyd was pinned to the ground before he died. Mourners paid respects before the service Many wore ""I can't breathe"" badges Mr Floyd's coffin was taken to a cemetery in Pearland, south of Houston, for a private burial ceremony. For the last mile of the procession it was conveyed in a horse-drawn carriage.

Woman in abuse case challenges legal aid rules,"Women often cannot claim legal aid because there is equity in homes they co-own with their ex-partners A woman is challenging rules which deprived her of legal aid for action to protect her from her former partner. ""Claire"" gets universal credit but not legal aid because there is equity in the home she owns with her ex-partner. About one in five women who suffer domestic violence cannot access legal aid because they are deemed to have ""capital"" - even if they cannot access it - lawyers say. A review of these rules, promised by government, has not yet been completed. Claire, who asked not to use her real name, lives with her two children in the home she co-owns with her ex-partner. She says he subjected her to physical, emotional and psychological abuse, so she went to court to obtain a non-molestation order to stop the abuse and an occupation order to remove him from the home. However, even though she receives universal credit, she was not entitled to legal aid because she owns some of the equity in the home. Claire cannot sell the home because that would make her and her children homeless, meaning her equity is ""trapped"". In any event, whether the house should be sold is itself subject to proceedings for which she needs legal aid. She cannot borrow against its value because she would require her ex-partner's consent. ""My ex-partner has all the money, controlled all the money. I didn't have any of it. He has to agree to everything because the mortgage is joint. He wouldn't agree to anything. ""Selling would also mean that me and my children were homeless. So we are basically fighting for our safety, and we would be made homeless because we were being forced to sell our house to get any legal support and advice,"" she told BBC News. Claire had no option but to represent herself in court. She describes the experience as ""horrendous, because I had to speak for myself"". ""I was in a really vulnerable position. I had to speak against his barrister who was a top barrister. He could afford to have a barrister and I couldn't."" Despite that, she succeeded in getting the non-molestation and occupation orders. Claire returned to court for a second hearing four weeks later, but this time her ex was present. ""It was the first time I saw him after he'd been removed from the home. So I knew he was extremely angry. I was terrified and I didn't have any legal advice or help. When I heard his voice it made me physically vomit in court. ""The judge told him and his barrister to leave, they got some people to help me to get rid of the vomit and give me some water."" Claire is challenging the rules at the High Court Claire needs legal aid for proceedings about arrangements for her children and to respond to her ex's application to force a sale of their home. Her application has been refused by the Legal Aid Agency, and she is challenging the decision at the High Court. She is being supported by the rights group Public Law Project (PLP), which sees contradiction and unfairness in the Department for Work and Pensions not taking into account the equity in a main home in calculating benefits, while the Legal Aid Agency does take it into account for assessing eligibility for legal aid. ""It means that the same person can be destitute enough to get Universal Credit but not destitute enough, even if they are a victim of domestic violence, to get legal aid to protect them from their abuser,"" says PLP lawyer Katy Watts, who is representing Claire. Ms Watts also points out such equity is often ""dead"" for domestic violence victims, in that ""even though they may have equity on paper, this is trapped capital. They often have no way of accessing it. Selling will involve getting permission from the person who has been abusing them"". In 2012 the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (LASPO) made large cuts to legal aid in England and Wales, removing many areas of civil and family law from its scope. The only route to getting legal aid for a private family law matter is if a person is a victim of domestic violence - but this is still subject to a means test of both income and capital. In February 2019, the Ministry of Justice promised to conduct a review to ""assess the effectiveness with which the means-testing arrangements appropriately protect access to justice, particularly with respect to those who are vulnerable"". The review would include a look at capital thresholds for domestic violence victims, the MoJ promised. Lawyers argue the rules limit women's access to justice The review has not yet concluded 15 months later. ""Sadly I am having to turn cases like Claire's away every single day,"" says her solicitor Jenny Beck, whose firm Beck Fitzgerald is working ""pro bono"" for her. ""The current rules mean that one in five women who are living on benefits and suffering abuse will not get legal aid, and will face the terrifying task of representing themselves. ""The justice system should be accessible to all, and this undermines both access to justice and the rule of law."" Many family lawyers believe that with the reported incidence of domestic violence and deaths resulting from it rising during lockdown the need for non-means tested legal aid for victims, is urgent and overwhelming. The Legal Aid Agency says it cannot comment on ongoing proceedings.

'Yelled at' for standing too close to people,"This video can not be played Angharad Paget Jones said she and her dog Tudor have been ""yelled at"" in shops People with sight loss say they have been abused and abandoned during the coronavirus pandemic. Many say they are struggling to access services during the lockdown. Some have been verbally abused because they find it hard to follow social distancing rules. The Fight for Sight charity is calling for health services and retailers to ensure that people who are visually impaired can get the help they need and ""are not excluded"". A survey it carried out of 325 people with sight loss found one in four find it difficult to follow social distancing. More than half of respondents said their access to food and other services had become worse during the lockdown period. Angharad Paget Jones says her guide dog Tudor is her eyes on four paws - she's only confident leaving her home in Port Talbot with him by her side. But during lockdown, she has found people are far less tolerant of her disability, making a trip to the shops a scary experience. ""I've been yelled at in stores for being too close to people when they can see I've got the dog - I can't see them,"" she said. ""Tudor is trained to find the door of a supermarket - I don't know there's a queue because he's shown me where the door is and I've been yelled at for not queuing. ""I'm lucky I'm quite thick-skinned, but if someone just told me they were there or told me 'sorry actually, there's a queue', it doesn't take two seconds to let me know. ""I have a lot of help - I have friends and family around me. But some people don't have that help and they do have to go to these places alone and if their confidence is knocked, they won't want to go outside."" People scared to get help are 'going slowly blind' 'Meaningless' test 'hits sight loss claims' My life as a blind 'Luddite' Sherine Krause, chief executive of Fight for Sight, said there needed to be more advice given to retailers on social distancing measures ""to ensure the needs of people with poor vision are not excluded"".

"Johnson urges peaceful struggle against racismThe prime minister says the death of George Floyd awakened an anger and an ""undeniable feeling of injustice"".UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'I will not support those who flout the rules on social distancing' Boris Johnson has urged the country to ""work peacefully, lawfully"" to defeat racism and discrimination. Writing in the Voice,,externalthe PM said the government could not ignore the anger and ""undeniable feeling of injustice"" sparked by George Floyd's killing. But he said the cause risked being ""undermined"" by a minority who attack police and property during protests. The UK, he said, had made ""huge strides"" in tackling racism in recent decades but more had to be done. More protests are taking place on Tuesday, including in London and Oxford, with the latter focusing on calls fora statue at Oriel College of imperialist Cecil Rhodes to be taken down. Parliament holds minute's silence for George Floyd The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Torn down slave trader statue 'was an affront' Pub name rethink over slave trade link Thedeath of George Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis, in the United States, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck, triggered an international outcry and sparked days of mass protests in cities across the UK. While the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, they turned violent in London on Saturday when police officers were confronted with flares, and a statue of wartime leader Winston Churchill was vandalised. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has asked his officials to develop an action plan with community groups - to tackle racism, discrimination and inequality. Mr Khan said the protests that have followed the death of George Floyd should be a ""catalyst for change"". Protesters chant ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""no justice, no peace"" In Bristol, demonstrators pulled down a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the River Avon. Home Secretary Priti Patel condemned a ""lawless minority of protesters"" who ""regrettably turned to violence"", adding: ""This hooliganism is utterly indefensible."" London slavery statues 'should be taken down' Black man's head pub sign to go in racism row Cecil Rhodes: Renewed calls to remove university statue In an article for the Voice, the prime minister said Mr Floyd's death had ""awakened an anger and a widespread and incontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice, a feeling that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination: in education, in employment, in the application of the criminal law"". This video can not be played Anti-racism protests on Sunday were mostly peaceful; in London there were clashes as police tried to clear Whitehall ""We simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered by that spectacle, of a black man losing his life at the hands of the police,"" he wrote. ""We who lead and who govern simply can't ignore those feelings because in too many cases, I am afraid, they will be founded on a cold reality."" While he believed the UK was a much less racist society than it was 40 years ago, the PM said he ""heard"" the Black Lives Matter protesters and accepted much more needed to be done to ensure everyone was treated equally. ""We must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do - in eradicating prejudice, and creating opportunity, and the government I lead is committed to that effort."" Are you allowed to protest during lockdown? Why we need a say over public statues Thanking those who abided by social distancing while taking to the streets, the PM warned that further mass demonstrations endangered the UK's efforts to bring the coronavirus epidemic under control. This video can not be played Priti Patel: ""This hooliganism is utterly indefensible, no justification for it"" And he said he could not condone those who ""hijacked"" peaceful protests by breaking the law or desecrating public monuments, saying they damaged the legitimate cause that people were fighting for. ""We have a democracy in this country. If you want to change the urban landscape, you can stand for election, or vote for someone who will. ""And so I must say clearly that those who attack public property or the police - who injure the police officers who are trying to keep us all safe - those people will face the full force of the law. ""So let's work peacefully, lawfully, to defeat racism and discrimination wherever we find it, and let us continue to work together across all the communities of this country, as we put Britain back on its feet."" This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Mr Khan also appealed to people not to protest as they may ""inadvertently catch the virus"" and pass it on to loved ones. But the London Mayor criticised comments made by Ms Patel anda tweet by Boris Johnson,externalafter protests at the weekend. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I am quite clear the law has got to be followed. What I am also clear about is I don't lead with words like 'thuggery, recklessness and lawlessness'. ""I lead with empathy and emotional intelligence, recognising the upset and anger people have about their voices not being heard for many years and many decades."" In a statement to Parliament on Monday, the home secretary said 137,500 people had attended more than 200 protests across the UK over the weekend. She said 135 people had been arrested in total, while 35 police officers had been injured since protests began. She was challenged by a Labour MP Florence Eshalomi, who asked her whether she recognised the ""structural inequality, discrimination and racism"" in the UK and called on her to act. But Ms Patel said she would ""not take lectures"" from others about racism, and gave examples of the racist abuse she had personally received, including facing racial slurs in the playground and on the streets, and being advised to use her husband's surname in order to advance her career. 'When one is hurt, we're all hurt' How black Britons reacted to George Floyd's death What does white privilege mean? How many black people die in police custody? Avon and Somerset Police told the BBC 17 people had been identified in connection with the toppling of Colston's statue. No arrests have yet been made. Chief Constable Andy Marsh defended the decision taken by commanders on the ground not to intervene when the statue was torn down and dumped in the harbour. He said arresting suspects could have had ""very serious ramifications"" for the city of Bristol, including injuries to protesters, police and bystanders.

"Holiday lettings firm reverses no-refund policyRegulators got a ""significant proportion"" of complaints about the firm behind Hoseasons and Cottages.com.","The holiday firm behind Hoseasons and Cottages.com has agreed to give customers refunds for trips which have been cancelled because of the coronavirus crisis. The Competition and Markets Authority said,externalVacation Rentals had changed its policy after action by the regulator. The CMA said a ""significant proportion"" of complaints it received about holiday lettings were about Vacation Rentals. However, the firm said it had been offering refunds since 30 April. This date is when the CMA published guidance to travel firms on consumer rights and refunds, a Vacation Rentals spokesman said. ""We believe we have acted fairly and responsibly at all times,"" the spokesman said. ""We responded and adapted to the evolving issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic whenever new guidelines from the government were made available."" Vacation Rentals runs 22 brands offering holiday lets in the UK, as well as Italy, France and Ireland. Its other sites include Blue Chip Holidays and Welcome Cottages. The competition watchdog said Vacation Rentals voluntarily changed its policy after originally failing to offer refunds to all customers whose trips were cancelled. The company has now given a formal commitment that customers will have the option of a full refund if a booking has been cancelled because of restrictions associated with the coronavirus outbreak, the CMA said. Airlines warned over passenger refund rights Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund? In a statement, the CMA said:,external""The CMA's Covid-19 Taskforce has so far received around 4,500 reports about UK holiday rental companies, with complaints about Vacation Rentals making up a significant proportion of those reports."" However, Vacation Rentals maintains it had been offering refunds for some time. A spokesman said: ""Following the CMA's statement on 30 April clarifying its view on the law on cancellations of consumer contracts during the Covid-19 pandemic, we acted immediately and expanded the options available to any customers who were due to travel during the government imposed lockdown period to include a full cash refund. ""By the time the CMA's investigation into our business commenced, we were already acting in line with the CMA's guidance."" The CMA is hoping that by trumpeting its success with one holiday let provider, it can push the others into paying full refunds. There are plenty of others which have been reluctant to pay full refunds, in some cases arguing that they are simply the agents and should not be liable. It is important that people who have been fobbed off with vouchers can now go back and demand their money, even if they accepted them. Companies may now decide there is no point in holding out against the CMA if they are going to have to re-open previous cases as well. The CMA said other holiday companies face ""further scrutiny"" because, despite consumer law on refunds being clear, some firms are still refusing to offer customers their money back. Legal action was a possibility, the CMA said. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""Our Covid-19 Taskforce is working hard to ensure that consumers get what they are entitled to, so it's good news that Vacation Rentals has agreed to offer people the refunds they are due. We welcome this step and other holiday lets firms must now follow suit."" He acknowledged that some firms faced financial challenges, ""but it's not right that people are being left hundreds or even thousands of pounds out of pocket - on top of having to sacrifice their holidays. ""Consumer protection law exists for a reason; businesses must observe the law or face the possibility of enforcement action."" The CMA said that common complaints it had received included companies refusing to provide full refunds at all or offering only vouchers instead of cash refunds. The holiday lettings business is just one area where consumers are complaining about refunds. Airlines have also faced a barrage of criticism from disgruntled customers. Rory Boland, travel editor at the consumer group Which?, said: ""While it is positive to see some firms changing their policy on refunds, there are still many customers struggling to get their money back for cancelled holiday accommodation and package travel bookings. ""The CMA must continue to investigate these sectors and come down strongly on any firms found to be flouting the law."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

BBC Sport Coronavirus has officially brought a premature end to this season's League One and Two campaigns in English football, afterclubs voted against attempts to resume games. Instead, as per an earlier vote, the league tables will be decided on an unweighted points-per-game basis, worked out from the results and table so far. It means Coventry and Rotherham are promoted from the third tier League One, while Tranmere, Southend and Bolton are relegated to League Two. The play-offs will take place and involve Wycombe, Oxford, Fleetwood and Portsmouth. From League Two, Swindon, Crewe and Plymouth go up and Stevenage are set to go down, as Bury were already expelled from the league mid-season. The play-offs involve Cheltenham, Exeter, Colchester and Northampton. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit The government said children in nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 could start going back to school from last Monday. According to the data 659,000 children did so by last Thursday. But is that a big number? We know from the data it includes thousands of vulnerable pupils as well as 284,000 children of key workers in all years, who have been allowed to go school throughout the lockdown. According to last year's school census there are more than two million children in the year groups that were eligible to return, if their schools were able to open and their families wanted to send them. So while the government data doesn't show exactly how many children were in the returning year groups, we do know that most of those pupils were still at home. About half of schools with nursery, Reception, Year 1 or Year 6 pupils were open to at least one of these year groups by last Thursday and the government expects this to increase as some schools reported they'd be able to open from yesterday.

Fingerprinting migrants 'will spark violence',"UK Border Force officers will face violent attacks after the government told them to take the fingerprints of migrants who try to board Eurotunnel trains, a trade union has said. The Home Office order was made to staff at the terminal in Coquelles, near Calais, after a spike in small boat crossings to the UK by migrants. Trade union ISU said both staff and migrants will get hurt. But the Home Office said effective risk assessments were made to minimise harm. BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4programme spoke to some of the hundreds of migrants living rough in Calais during the coronavirus lockdown, who said unbearable conditions were driving them to attempt to cross the Channel in small boats. Since the lockdown began in March, more than 1,000 migrants have reportedly crossed to the UK on small boats. Arecord 166 migrants attempted to reach the UK on small boats in a single daylast week. Are migrants who cross the Channel sent back? Priti Patel vows to stop illegal Channel crossings Home Office staff give face masks to migrants The total for this year is already estimated to have exceeded the number who reached the UK in the whole of 2019, despite a pledge made last year by Home Secretary Priti Patel to ensure small boat crossings become an""infrequent phenomenon by spring 2020"",external. Now the home secretary has ordered UK border control officers, working at the Eurotunnel terminal in Coquelles, in the ""pas de Calais"" area, to take fingerprints of migrants they find trying to board trains illegally. A migrant climbs onto a train in Coquelles, France The Home Office said registering fingerprints may assist in returning people to France - via an EU law called the Dublin Regulation - should they later make a successful crossing into the UK. But Lucy Moreton, of the ISU, a union representing front-line officers, said the move would spark violence as migrants try to avoid being registered in France. ""That is quite a challenge, particularly if they really don't want to have their fingerprints taken,"" she said. ""We don't have digital fingerprint recorders, we only have wet ink. So you have literally got to hold their hands and roll their fingers from side to side to get a print. ""That's quite a lot of avenue to fight back if that's what they want to do. I'm very concerned about the levels of violence that will result and the fact that there will be, eventually, staff and migrants injured."" Migrants used to have their fingerprints taken by UK Border Force officers at the port in Calais, but the practice was stopped in 2010 and was also later abandoned at Coquelles. Ms Moreton said: ""All it resulted in was a lot of physical violence and individuals - both our staff and migrants being injured. And migrants deliberately harming themselves in order to damage their fingertips so that their fingerprints can't be taken. ""That's not something that anyone wants to be forced to do."" The Home Office told the BBC people fleeing persecution should stay in the first safe country they entered and there was ""no reason why they need to make an often dangerous trip"" to claim asylum. It added the Border Force has robust risk assessments in place to minimise the risk of harm to both migrants and officers.

'Yelled at' for standing too close to peoplePeople with sight loss are verbally abused and struggling to access services during the pandemic.Wales,"This video can not be played Angharad Paget Jones said she and her dog Tudor have been ""yelled at"" in shops People with sight loss say they have been abused and abandoned during the coronavirus pandemic. Many say they are struggling to access services during the lockdown. Some have been verbally abused because they find it hard to follow social distancing rules. The Fight for Sight charity is calling for health services and retailers to ensure that people who are visually impaired can get the help they need and ""are not excluded"". A survey it carried out of 325 people with sight loss found one in four find it difficult to follow social distancing. More than half of respondents said their access to food and other services had become worse during the lockdown period. Angharad Paget Jones says her guide dog Tudor is her eyes on four paws - she's only confident leaving her home in Port Talbot with him by her side. But during lockdown, she has found people are far less tolerant of her disability, making a trip to the shops a scary experience. ""I've been yelled at in stores for being too close to people when they can see I've got the dog - I can't see them,"" she said. ""Tudor is trained to find the door of a supermarket - I don't know there's a queue because he's shown me where the door is and I've been yelled at for not queuing. ""I'm lucky I'm quite thick-skinned, but if someone just told me they were there or told me 'sorry actually, there's a queue', it doesn't take two seconds to let me know. ""I have a lot of help - I have friends and family around me. But some people don't have that help and they do have to go to these places alone and if their confidence is knocked, they won't want to go outside."" People scared to get help are 'going slowly blind' 'Meaningless' test 'hits sight loss claims' My life as a blind 'Luddite' Sherine Krause, chief executive of Fight for Sight, said there needed to be more advice given to retailers on social distancing measures ""to ensure the needs of people with poor vision are not excluded"".

As we approach the end of today's live coverage, here is a round-up of developments. Chester Zoo has been preparing for the day it can reopen Zoos, safari parks and drive-in
cinemas will be able to reopen in England from 15 June, the prime minister is due to announce. Boris Johnson is expected to
outline the latest step in the easing of the coronavirus lockdown at
Wednesday's daily briefing. He will say the outdoor
attractions can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. Some zoos, including Chester Zoo
and London Zoo, have reported financial struggles during the pandemic. The move will pave the way for the sites to reopen on the same day asnon-essential shops. A vigil for medical workers who died from Covid-19 was held in Iquitos, Peru Peru's Health Ministry has released its latest figures, showing confirmed cases of coronavirus have risen to 203,736. The country has also registered 5,738 deaths, since its first case on 6 March. It has the second highest number of cases in Latin America, after Brazil. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Weibo user Bai Jingting says he'd spend more time with his family The pandemic has had many of us wishing we could turn back the clock and start the year all over again. And thatâs what more than a million social media users in China were discussing on Tuesday: what they would do differently, if that was an option? A whopping 1.8 million users of the popular Sina Weibo platform have used the hashtag#WhatWouldYouDoIf2020Restarted,external. Many have said the pandemic has made them realise things they had taken for granted. One netizen said they would âhave a picture taken with my whole family, because this epidemic has made me understand that my familyâs health is the most important thingâ. Some say they would be ""more humble"", and regret leaving jobs just before Chinese New Year â a common trend around this period. Others are simply reflecting on how they wish theyâd âappreciated othersâ better. âI wish Iâd been a better person,â says one. Working conditions for migrant workers in Canada are placing them at risk from coronavirus, an advocacy group warns. ""While millionaire corporations are being bailed out, migrant worker â the ones that actually grow foodâ are in crisis,â the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change says. The report said,externalthat in Ontario province alone, at least two migrant workers had died with the virus and there were 280 cases. It also said workers were told to work in groups while waiting for test results, and that they were being housed in cramped quarters. Many migrants had the start of their work season delayed because of coronavirus restrictions. Once they did arrive, the new rules forced them to quarantine. During their quarantine, the report found they were underpaid, underfed and not given good health information. The report was based on calls with 180 workers who were speaking on behalf of 1,162 workers, mostly from the Caribbean.  Brazil has restoredits website with detailed coronavirus data,external, following a ruling earlier on Tuesday by the Supreme Court. The health ministry caused outrage when it removed pages of detailed Covid-19 data over the weekend and said it would no longer publish cumulative totals. But on Tuesday the country's highest court ordered the ministry to resume the publication of figures for deaths and infections.
Judge Alexandre de Moraes said the government's actions ""made it impossible"" to monitor the spread of the virus and implement adequate controls. The UK government is coming under increasing pressure from MPs and businesses to relax the 2m (6ft) rule for social distancing. Trade body UK Hospitality insists the current separation ruleswould be impossible for bars and restaurants to follow, and the Financial Times is reporting thatthe ""majority of the cabinet"" supports a reduction,external. The 2m distance is also one of the challenges schools face in reopening: head teachers and governors have said they lack the space to bring all pupils back. But scientistscontinue to question whether a reduction would be safe, given how little is known about how far coronavirus can spread. Read more from our science editor David Shukman. The doves are a popular attraction at the mosque More than 1,000 doves kept at a famous mosque in Afghanistan have died of starvation after the building was closed due to the coronavirus. Caretakers at the 12th-Century, blue-tiled mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif told AFP news agency that the doves were dying because there were no visitors to feed them. ""Every day about 30 doves die. We bury them outside the shrine,"" said mosque official Qayum Ansari, adding that more than 1,000 had already died. The birds are a popular attraction and many visitors consider them sacred. The mosque is one of many buildings closed in a nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus. The country has registered more than 21,000 confirmed cases but the real number is thought to be much higher. Government officials in Balkh province have now promised to supply bird food for the doves, if mosque managers will allow it. The ancient mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif is famous for its blue tiles Helen BriggsBBC science and health journalist A new study has linked blood group to susceptibility to coronavirus. The data, regarded as preliminary, suggests that individuals
with blood type O, the most common in the UK, are less likely to test positive for
Covid-19. The research, carried out by genetic-testing company 23andMe,external, echoes other studies on the blood groups of coronavirus patients. Many teams have been investigating how genetic factors could explain why
some people who contract the virus have relatively few symptoms, while others
become severely ill. Last
week, a study from Italy and Spain found patients with type A blood were more
likely to need oxygen or go on a ventilator. An earlier Chinese study produced similar results. But scientists say itâs not clear whether it is
blood group that influences risk, or some other genetic factor. There are four main blood groups â A, B, AB and O â and they're determined by the genes inherited from your parents. Students in the UK must decide by the middle of next week whether or not to accept university offers for the new academic year. It's a big decision - even more so this year as many lectures are due to take place online and socialising could be very difficult when term begins. So, will universities open in September? Many have already decided to alter their normal schedule. Cambridge will hold lectures online for the entire year, while Manchester will have online lectures for the first autumn term. The deadline for prospective studentsto decide on whether to accept offers has been pushed back,externalto 18 June. See here for a breakdown of what you need to be thinking aboutif deciding whether you're going to start your studies in September.

Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there will be a âlimited exemptionâ for immediate family members of Canadian citizens to cross into Canada from the US. Theborder has been closed to non-essential travel since 21 Marchand the earliest it would reopen would be 21 June. Many non-Canadian citizens have been denied entry, despite being married to Canadians. Those affected includeexpectant parents Ashley and Tim Cook,external. Ashley Cook is a Canadian living in Windsor, Ontario and her husband and the father of her child lives just over the border in Michigan. The new announcement reiterated that anyone coming from the US, which has been hit hard by the virus, would have to quarantine for 14 days. ""If you don't follow these rules, you could face serious penalties,"" Trudeau said. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent The aviation
industry is in a deep crisis, and governments around the world have responded.
Today alone, we have seen the announcement of a major support package for
aerospace in France, while Cathay Pacific received a Â£4bn bail-out from the Hong Kong government. Lockdowns have forced airlines to ground aircraft, depriving them of much of their income. That in turn means they will struggle
to afford new planes, so manufacturers have had to slash production - forcing their suppliers to cut back as well. In France, some
300,000 jobs rely on the aerospace industry. That's why the government in
Paris thinks it is worth providing some Â£12bn in grants, loans and
guarantees (Â£5.5bn for Air France alone) to prop it up. In the UK, by
contrast, there has been little government largesse. Easyjet and
British Airways have borrowed under Covid-19 loan schemes, and many
companies have been able to furlough employees. But there has been nothing on the scale of the rescues seen elsewhere. And job cuts are mounting. People within the
industry say there is deep frustration that the UK government has been willing to introduce a stringent quarantine regime that threatens to do more damage, but hasnât done a great deal to
help them. Time, they say,
is running out. Justin RowlattChief Environment correspondent Coronavirus has changed the way we use energy - at least for now. But could the pandemic finally finish off coal, the most polluting of all fossil fuels? The Covid-19 crisis has been an extraordinary and terrifying time for us all, but it has been a fascinating period to cover environmental issues. We've all enjoyed the unusually clean air and clear skies. They are the most obvious evidence that we have been living through a unique experiment in energy use. Locking hundreds of millions of us down in our homes around the world has led to an unprecedented fall in energy demand, including for electricity. And that has, in turn, revealed something striking about the economics of the energy industry: the underlying vulnerability of coal, the fuel that powered the creation of the modern world. Read more.

Prof Heneghan said the data showed it was best to get coronavirus under the age of 45 Society will need to have ""rational debates"" about when is the least risky age to be infected with coronavirus if a vaccine does not materialise, an expert has said. Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, said Covid-19 is behaving in a way similar to seasonal flu in its disproportionate impact on the elderly. He told a Science Media Centre briefing: ""It matters when you get infections in relation to your risk - I think that's incredibly important. ""So we will start to have some rational debates, because many infections, we know if you get them when you're very young you actually do very well, for instance chickenpox, you get that when you're young and you confer immunity. ""So, if you took away the concept that there were no vaccinations, let's park that aside and this becomes a circulating endemic infection, we will start to have to have a debate around when is it better to get this infection? ""If you look at the data, it is when you're under 45. As you get older then it's worse for you."" The queue for food at New York's Barclays Center stretched around the block Since the start of the US outbreak, Food Bank for New York City has distributed 21m meals, marking a 20% increase from the same period last year, the charity say. Almost 80% of food pantries and soup kitchens reported an increase in families with children visiting. According to the report, the crushing demand for food assistance caused more than half of the food banks to run out of supplies in April. Food Bank for New York City CEO Leslie Gordon said the rise in demand represents ""the new normal"". At the peak of the outbreak 40% of the city's food banks were closed, largely because they are run by seniors who are particularly at risk of infection. A safari park in England has questioned why changes to the lockdown have allowed drivers ""to get a Big Mac, but not to see our big cats"". Knowsley Safari near Liverpool, which has been closed since 23 March, said people would be safe to visit as it was similar to using a McDonald's drive-through. A spokeswoman said being told to remain closed while the restaurants are allowed to reopen""doesn't make sense"". She added: ""We can't understand why it's now OK for people to go into shops or visit public spaces where there's no enforced social distancing, but not stay in their vehicle on the safari drive."" Reality Check Earlier, UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma was asked about the 2m (6ft)
social distancing rule, during the government'sDowning Street briefing. ""When safe to do so we'll see if we can move to a
shorter distance,"" he said. For now, the rule remains. Keeping people from different households at least 2m apart helps prevent the spread of coronavirus. But is also makes it much
harder to open places such as cafes and restaurants â leading to calls for a
review. The World Health Organization says a distance of 1m is
safe, and that rule is also in place in China, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Lithuania
and Singapore. The rule is 1.5m in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy,
the Netherlands and Portugal. Apart from the UK, the 2m rule is in place in Canada and Spain. You can read more about the evidence behind the 2m rule here. BBC Radio 5 Live The focus today in England has been on primary schools, and the roll back from allowing all pupils to return before the summer holidays. But the government has also confirmed that secondary schools in the country will not be opening until September at the earliest. So just how have
pupils been coping during lockdown? One 16-year-old A-level student from Hackney, east London, has been telling BBC Radio 5 Live that she has found it hard to stay motivated. âA lot of my friends descended into this kind of panic,"" she told presenter Emma Barnett. ""Feeling
we were doomed - and that was reflected in a lack of online engagement and

hopefulâ and the lockdown has given her âtime to think about discipline
and how I learn, and educate myself"". Miriam Jordan Keane from the National Citizen Service said her organisation has set up an online hub for pupils, instead of running its regular schemes this summer. ""We had no idea of what the summer of 'no you can't' was
going to feel like for young people - no you can't go to school, no you can't
do your exams, no you can't celebrate the summer of a lifetime,â she said. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Pandemic pushes US into official recessionEconomists say America's economic expansion ended in February, but markets remain on the upswing.Business","The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research made the designation on Tuesday, citing the scale and severity of the current contraction. It said activity and employment hit a ""clear"" and ""well-defined"" peak in February, before falling. The ruling puts a formal end to what had been more than a decade of economic expansion - the longest in US history. Meanwhile, US markets continued their rebound on Monday, as investors remained optimistic that the downturn will be short-lived. What 2008 recession can teach us about this one Coronavirus: Australia set for first recession in three decades Coronavirus could 'drag on US economy for a decade' A recession was expected after the US economy contracted 5% in the first three months of the year. Employers also reported cutting roughly 22 million jobs in March and April, as restrictions on activity intended to help control the virus forced many businesses to close. Some economists are hopeful that the job losses have now stopped, and a rebound has begun. In May, US employers added 2.5 million jobs, as states started reopening. The National Bureau of Economic Research,  a private research organisation, said it viewed the scale of the decline that started in February as more significant than its duration. ""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,"" it said. The bureau typically defines a recession as an economic contraction that lasts ""more than a few months"". It has declared 12 recessions since 1948, the longest of which was the Great Recession, which lasted 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009. US financial markets, which tumbled in February amid signs of the economic collapse, have been on the upswing since March, due to investor hopes that economic damage will be limited, thanks toemergency relief from Congress and the central bank. On Monday, the Nasdaq index closed at 9,924.7, gaining 1.1% to top its pre-pandemic record.

The two indexes are now less than 10% lower than their pre-pandemic peaks. US President Donald Trump has celebrated the rebound. ""Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction. Jobs are coming back FAST. Next year will be our greatest ever,"" he wrote on Twitter on Monday morning.

Many economists have warned that the economic pain is likely to linger, even if the worst has passed. The World Bank on Monday said it expected the global economy to shrink by 5.2% this year, in the deepest recession since World War Two. It said it expected the US economy to contract by 6.1% and the Euro area to shrink by 9.1%. While global growth of 4.2% is expected to return next year, the bank warned that the outlook is ""highly uncertain and downside risks are predominant, including the possibility of a more protracted pandemic, financial upheaval and retreat from global trade and supply linkages"".
