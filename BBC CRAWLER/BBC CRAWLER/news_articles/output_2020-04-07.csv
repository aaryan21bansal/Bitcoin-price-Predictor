Workers beg Holland & Barrett bosses to shut shops,"Holland & Barrett has kept its shops open during the coronavirus crisis, but staff are campaigning for them to shut arguing their health is at risk. The alternative health chain has 750 UK stores and counts as an essential retailer because its products cater for people with special dietary needs. But staff have set upa petition,external, pleading with management to close stores over safety concerns. The chain said staff and customer safety is of ""paramount importance."" The petition has attracted 2,600 signatures. Workers have two complaints. They argue that what the chain sells is not essential, unlike supermarkets or pharmacies. But they also warn that most stores are too small to be safe, with no room for social-distancing. A Holland & Barrett worker - who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job - told the BBC: ""Holland & Barrett is putting our lives in danger with the pursuit of profit over life. ""The general atmosphere is one of fear and stress with a lot of our workers and colleagues quite frightened to speak their minds."" They said: ""We do not sell essentials and have people coming in to purchase flapjacks and sticks of liquorice, hardly an essential purchase."" In many of the shops, they said: ""It is almost practically impossible to maintain social distancing, as the aisles are very short width and when we have to deal with customer queries, they do not respect the boundaries.

A Holland & Barrett spokesperson told the BBC it had been advised by the government that it is one of the retailers that are expected to remain open. ""This relates to the fact that 90% of what we sell is food, vitamins and food supplements, which many of our customers rely on to manage their dietary or underlying conditions,"" they added. Examples the company cited included pregnant women in need of folic acid supplementation; Coeliacs; those with milk and egg allergies; those outlined by the government as ""at-risk"" groups in need of vitamin D supplementation; and those caring for customers with compromised immune systems, in need of additional support at this time. Waitrose in U-turn on virus pay policy Easter egg crackdown over essential status 'wrong' Holland & Barrett said it has provided gloves, masks and hand sanitiser to all stores and has also installed shielding screens at the counter. It said social distancing is being enforced ""with clear guidance in store"". ""We have limited the maximum number of customers allowed in the stores at any one time, dependent on store size, and tape has been installed marking out a two metre distance from the tills with clear signage throughout stores."" Staff have pointed out that customers wanting to buy any of the products Holland & Barrett sell can do so through its online store. Holland & Barrett said: ""We are bolstering our online capacity as quickly as possible so customers can order from home where possible, and have set also up a new customer phone line for those customers who cannot access our website for home delivery.""

Twitter boss pledges $1bn for coronavirus relief,"Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter and payment app Square, has said he will donate $1bn (Â£810m) towards efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. According to Mr Dorsey, the donation represented approximately 28% of his wealth. He made the announcement on Twitter, writing that the ""needs are increasingly urgent"". Mr Dorsey did not lay out exactly where the funds would be sent to help in the battle against Covid-19. In the US there is a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment, and business and individuals are also struggling economically. Mr Dorsey will use shares he owns in Square to fund the donations which will be distributed through the Start Small Foundation. The 43-year-old is the chief executive of both Twitter and Square. He said he was using shares of Square and not Twitter because he owned ""a lot more"" of them. The shares will be sold over time, which could impact on their value and the overall size of the donation. Once the Covid-19 pandemic has been ""disarmed"", the funds will go toward girls health and education and research into universal basic income. In a six-part Twitter thread, Mr Dorsey said he wanted to donate to causes where he could see an impact in his lifetime. The donations will be made through a limited liability company. It is a tool many wealth individuals use for donations, but is often criticized for a lack of transparency. Mr Dorsey sought to get ahead of this charge by posting a link to agoogle doc,externalwhich will publicly track the funds donations. The Twitter boss is not the only tech billionaire to pledge part of their wealth towards coronavirus-related efforts. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has committed $30m, the bulk of which is focused on efforts to create a treatment. Amazon's Jeff Bezos has donated $100m to food banks in the US to help those struggling with hunger during this period.

Coronavirus: Mental health hotline for NHS staff,"The NHS is launching a hotline to support and advise healthcare staff during the coronavirus pandemic. Volunteers from charities including Hospice UK, the Samaritans and Shout, will listen to concerns and offer psychological support. The phone line for England will be open between 07:00 and 23:00 every day, while the text service will be available around the clock. Staff can find detailshere,external.Samaritans,externalis available to the general public. It comes as staff face increasing pressure to care for rising numbers of patients who are seriously ill with the virus. Since the outbreak began, more than 6,000 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus and among them are front-line medical staff. Adil El Tayar (left) and Amged El-Hawrani - two British Sudanese doctors - were the first working medics to die of coronavirus in the UK Meet the ex-NHS staff who are returning to work The NHS workers leaving their families to keep us safe I'm a frontline carer but feel undervalued Coming 5,000 miles to die for the NHS Why healthcare workers are at risk of moral injury As well as workload pressures and the emotional toll, some staff say they have had to work in situations where they feel unsafe because of a lack personal protective equipment (PPE). Prof Tom Dening from the Institute of Mental Health at the University of Nottingham said: ""The mental health of NHS staff is going to be absolutely crucial in the nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic. ""Staff are being exposed to high levels of personal risk, long hours in difficult environments clad in PPE, and also the possibility of something known as moral injury, which is the distressing awareness you may feel when you know you can't meet all the needs of the people you are trying to care for. ""This combination of factors would rattle even the most resilient of us."" Aimee O'Rourke died in the hospital in Kent where she worked as a nurse While staff can still talk to each other and their managers, the NHS hotline will offer support outside the workplace. There will be 1,500 volunteers to support the 1.4 million nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers in the NHS. Anyone who requires further help will be signposted to services ranging from practical and financial assistance to specialist bereavement and psychological support, says the service. Danny Mortimer, from NHS Employers, said: ""As the pandemic continues, our people will face new and growing challenges on a daily basis, and it's therefore more important than ever that they are able to access resources to help them manage their wellbeing, in a way that suits their needs."" Prerana Issar, chief people officer for the NHS, said: ""We need to do everything we can to support our incredible NHS people as they care for people through this global health emergency."" Meanwhile, a group of mental health experts, led by Dr Michael Bloomfield at University College London, have issued advice anda video,externalfor front-line healthcare workers on how to cope with stress during the Covid-19 crisis: Give yourself permission to take regular breaks during your shifts Eat, drink and sleep as well as you can Try to use strategies that have helped you cope with stressful situations in the past Take time out between shifts Stay in touch with friends and family - video-call and phone them if you can't see them in person Engage in physical activity Maintain a routine as much as possible Plan regular activities that make you feel good, and tasks that take your mind off the crisis Avoid unhelpful coping strategies such as smoking, alcohol or other drugs Try to limit the time spent watching, reading or listening to the news Reach out for help if you need support Are you a NHS worker?

"'I'm out of hospital, but I have to remember to breathe'","Ria Lakhani on the day she was discharged from hospital Breathing is perhaps the most natural of reflexes. Who has to remember to breathe? Ria Lakhani does. In recovery at home in north-west London after a severe case of Covid-19, the sales executive is learning something that most of us never give a second thought to. ""It used to be such a natural action but now I have to remember how to inhale and exhale,"" she says. In self-isolation, she still can't hug her husband, or see her parents and siblings. And she still wakes up at night struggling to breathe. Ria started to show symptoms of Covid-19 while in hospital, where she had been admitted for an operation. Seven years ago, she was diagnosed with a rare condition which makes swallowing difficult and means she often regurgitates solids. The surgery was designed to help her manage this oesophageal disease, called achalasia. But she stresses her condition had made her especially careful about looking after her health. Her admission to hospital was supposed to be routine. But while recovering there she began to struggle with her breathing. She then developed a temperature. While everyone hoped it was just a side-effect of her surgery, a Covid swab test was taken as a precaution. Ria was restless and started taking notes on her phone, documenting her experience on Facebook. ""My room was now cordoned off and the rest of the ward evacuated,"" she wrote. ""I closed down an entire ward?! I miss my family so much. With Covid-19 tests so limited I felt ashamed I was being given a swab so quickly when there are others who were more likely to have it. I was certain I was clear. I followed all guidelines."" It was to no avail. Ria's virus test was positive. Ria was given oxygen at hospital As her condition deteriorated, and she required more oxygen, she was transferred to one of London's major Covid-19 treatment centres. Ria remembers the concerned looks on the faces of doctors watching her during two difficult days and one night, as her body tried desperately to fight off the disease. She says what she went through in that time has irrevocably changed her. ""Things went from bad to worse - taking a breath became as hard as climbing a mountain,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""I could see the more and more concerned looks on the faces of the many heroes treating me. More and more doctors looking in, murmuring to each other - observations taken every minute and scrutinised incessantly. Scary, uncertainty, unnerving, so many feelings, so many thoughts in my head, questions I was scared to hear the answers to."" ""I almost died,"" she says, speaking from home to the BBC. ""I almost didn't come out of there. There was a point when I actually started to write difficult messages to my family. I almost died now I'm alive. How can life go back to normal after that?"" Ria is not clear whether she developed pneumonia but says even now, from her recovery bed at home in Harrow she can hear a ""crackling sound"" in her lungs"". LIVE:China reports no new virus deaths for first time A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Her recovery has been slow. In hospital she could barely move at first and was given morphine on top of the oxygen because of the pain. She says it was hard to talk. ""Getting a sentence out was like running a marathon."" But amid it all, there were glimpses of hope. She developed a bond with a 96-year-old deaf woman, named Iris, in the neighbouring bed. They began to look out for each other despite the age difference. ""I needed her as much as she needed me,"" she adds. And she found hope in the small acts of kindness of medical staff - ""true heroes"" in her words. ""It was the small wins and things like the nurses making sure Iris had a constant supply of hot tea and a sneaky extra slice of cake that made me smile."" At home, she has to maintain a distance from her husband and continues to be besieged by coughing fits. But she's relieved that she was able to fight the virus, especially considering how many people have died. ""There was a point in this journey that I didn't know if I would see the light of day again. Nothing was certain, and even though I've always known how much I love my family - in those moments I learned how much I need them. I can't explain the moment I left the hospital, I'll never take anything for granted again.""

UK forests 'could do more harm than good',"Mass tree planting in the UK could harm the environment if not planned properly, a report warns. Badly-planned trees would  increase greenhouse gas emissions,say the governmentâs advisers on the economic value of the natural environment.,external The report comes from the Natural Capital Committee (NCC), which says planting trees into peat bogs would prove a serious mistake. Peat locks up vast quantities of carbon - but trees dry out peat. This can release more greenhouse gases than the trees absorb. One NCC member, Prof Ian Bateman from the University of Exeter, said: âThe mantra has to be âthe right tree in the right placeâ.â âWe would be crazy to undertake the massive scale of planting being considered if we did not also consider the wider effects upon the environment including impacts on wildlife, benefits in terms of reducing flood risks and effects on water quality, improvements to recreation and so on.â Will millions more trees really stop climate change? Right trees in right places The report adds that carpeting upland pastures with trees would reduce the UKâs ability to produce meat â which may lead to increasing imports from places that produce beef by felling rainforests. It also makes a similar point on industry. Thereâs no point closing dirty UK factories, the authors say, if weâre then going to import goods from places with worse emissions. The authors note that huge publicity has been given to the UKâs plans for planting 11 million trees to lock up carbon emissions, but they warn that conserving carbon in soils is equally or more important. The report points out that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that in 2007 UK soils contained approximately 4,019 million tonnes of carbon (MtC), thatâs 94.2% of the total stock of biological carbon - excluding fossil fuel carbon. They say soil degradation through erosion, intensive farming and development creates losses estimated at between Â£0.9 â1.4bn per year for England and Wales alone. Soils underpin everything Prof Kathy Willis from Oxford University and an NCC member, told BBC News:  âWe love looking at trees â we get all these positive emotions, smells and sounds â but most of us don't look at soil that actually underpins everything.â The NCC calls formuch better monitoring of soils.And it says that farming on lowland peat such as the rich fields of East Anglia should be halted if soil there continues to be lost. This recommendation may be strongly resisted by farmers, although some of them say theyâre addressing the problem by using âcover cropsâ tobind the soil together while cash crops are being planted. Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) told BBC News: ""You improve soil by taking good care of it - reducing ploughing and using organic manure for example. You do not just give up and stop farming the land - particularly at a time when the country is becoming increasingly reliant on high quality, locally produced food."" The NCC notes previous reports projecting a reduction in the consumption of amount of red meat and dairy produce by at least 20% per person and reducing food waste by 20%. This implies around a 10% reduction in cattle and sheep numbers by 2050, compared with 2017 levels. The report outlines the scale of the challenge for measures taken to tackle climate change through land use policies in the UK. It says: âThese figures make it clear that â far from being an option for major offsetting of emissions from other sectors â the measures will not even mitigate the emissions of the agriculture, land use and peatlands sectors.""

The world in lockdown,"Coronavirus has now infected more than one million people worldwide, but its impact extends far beyond just those who have had it. Even the frequency of use of the word ""unprecedented"" is unprecedented at the moment. According to Google Trends it's been used three times more over the last two weeks than the highest point recorded previously. As governments around the world have enacted new measures and given official advice, we take a look at the impact that it's had on people and the world around them. The approaches to dealing with coronavirus across the world have been wide-rangingto say the least. In Colombia the days that you're allowed to leave the house depend on the number of your national ID card; in Serbia a designated dog-walking hour was introduced; and in Belarus the president has gone against medical advice, recommending vodka and saunas as a way to stay safe. Some of the more common approaches have seen governments issue recommendations on social distancing for part or all of the country, while others have acted to restrict all non-essential internal movement. The latter is often called a lockdown. When the virus was first identified in China in late 2019, lockdown seemed extreme. But as the outbreak has spread around the world, it has become more difficult to manage. More countries have opted to take the strictest measures possible to contain it. Well over 100 countries worldwide had instituted either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March 2020, affecting billions of people. And many others had recommended restricted movement for some or all of their citizens. In regions that have only recently confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, many countries appear to be learning from their Asian and European counterparts. Governments seem to be acting faster and more strictly in Africa as well. China has managed to ease its restrictions after passing through the worst period of climbing cases and deaths, but life is still far from normal. The rest of us may have a long way to go. When the virus first appeared, several countries brought in initial restrictions on flights from China, or required visitors from at-risk areas to be quarantined on arrival. After it had been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on 11 March, there were more all-encompassing measures. President Trump blocked all non-essential arrivals to the US from the European Union on 15 March, and a day later the EU did the same to all visitors from outside the Schengen free-travel zone. By the end of March, air traffic from some of the world's biggest airports had dropped to a fraction of what it was at the same time last year, or even what it was at the start of this month. The number of commercial flights last month was down by more than a quarter globally,according to flight tracking service Flightradar24,external. In the final week of March, as more and more countries introduced travel restrictions to try to contain the virus, traffic declined 63% from the same period last year. On 25 March, Heathrow - one of the busiest airports in the world serving about 80 million passengers per year - recorded more than 1,000 fewer flights compared with an equivalent day in 2019. It's not just getting from city to city. Travel within major cities across the globe has ground to a halt as restrictions on movement and social contact have come into force. As of 31 March, residents in cities like Madrid, Paris, London and New York were making fewer than one-tenth as many journeys using the app as they did normally, according to data from travel app Citymapper. In Milan in northern Italy, which has been locked down for several weeks now, only 3% of trips were being planned via the Citymapper mobile app, compared with before the outbreak. The data also suggests that people cut down on travel in the days leading up to government-enforced shutdowns. For example, the partial lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, came into place on 24 March but trips had already declined sharply the week before. Even in cities where authorities have issued recommendations on social distancing and refrained from imposing strict lockdowns, it appears that people are still restricting their travel. ln Stockholm, Sweden, where the government has avoided draconian measures, issuing guidelines rather than strict rules, the Citymapper data suggests planned trips - which can include both walking and public transport - fell by 70%. Stockholm's public transport company reported last week that passenger numbers on subway and commuter trains had halved. Movement is also below normal rates in some of the Asian cities that Citymapper collects data for, like Hong Kong and Singapore, which have not enforced the type of shutdowns seen elsewhere. The South Korean capital Seoul hasn't come to a standstill like European capitals, despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases - a sign of the country's decision to focus on widespread testing and contact tracing rather than social distancing. We see the same behaviour with people on the roads. Major cities around the world were already becoming steadily less busy before official lockdown measures came in, congestion data from location technology specialists TomTom shows. In Tokyo there hasn't been an official lockdown yet, but schools have been shut since the beginning of March. That, and a lack of tourists, could explain why traffic there has been marginally below last year's levels without the sharp downturn obvious elsewhere. In Jakarta, Indonesia, where there has also been no official lockdown, congestion has already dropped to almost zero - similar to Los Angeles and New Delhi which shut down on different dates. The congestion score in the graphic below is an indication of how much longer it would take to make a journey through the city compared with when there is no traffic at all. A rating of 50 means that a trip will take 50% more time than it would if the roads were completely free, for example, so a half-hour drive would become 45 minutes. The regular low points on the chart generally come at weekends. In China there are signs that things are beginning to get back to normal. Traffic levels are back to about half the 2019 level in Beijing and Shanghai but have been steadily growing since the beginning of February following extended Chinese New Year celebrations from 25 January. In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, traffic levels are still next to zero compared with last year. One of the few positive effects of the shutdown is that there seems to have been a drop in pollution in some parts of the world. Levels of NO2 in the atmosphere fluctuate widely with factors like wind speed, and satellites trying to measure these levels can be hampered by cloud cover. This may explain some of the variability seen over Wuhan and northern Italy between January and March 2019 in the maps below. But in these places, shutdowns have been stricter and in place for longer than elsewhere, and the change in NO2 levels between 2019 and the months of 2020 in which the shutdowns have been in effect appears to be significant. In the UK, and in many other places, the available satellite data does not yet show either way whether the ongoing reduction in economic activity is being accompanied by a corresponding fall in emissions, althoughsome other sourcessuggest that it is. As countries have shut down, many workers have had to try to continue their office jobs from home. That means video calls and instant messaging have become invaluable workroom tools. The average number of messages sent by users in New York, Paris, London and Berlin has increased by more than a third in just a few weeks. Not everyone has got used to their new ways of working just yet. But - depending on where you are - there could be a good deal of time left to do so.

"Raab 'confident' PM will recover from coronavirusBoris Johnson is described as a ""fighter"" after he was moved into intensive care on Monday evening.","This video can not be played The foreign secretary says Boris Johnson is a ""fighter"" and ""will pull through"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said he is ""confident"" Boris Johnson will recover from coronavirus, describing the prime minister as a ""fighter"". Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Raab said Mr Johnson remained in ""good spirits"" and was breathing without assistance. He also described the PM as not only a colleague - but ""also a friend"". Later in the evening, No 10 said the PM remained in critical care but his condition was ""stable"". It is understood there will be no further update on Mr Johnson's condition until Wednesday. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Raab, who is deputising for the PM, said Mr Johnson was not only a boss but ""also a friend"". ""All of our thoughts and prayers are with the prime minister at this time, with Carrie, and with his whole family. ""And I'm confident he'll pull through because if there's one thing I know about this prime minister, he's a fighter. And he'll be back at the helm, leading us through this crisis in short order."" It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK rose to 6,159 - a record increase of 786 in a day,the Department of Health and Social Care said,external, compared with 439 on Monday. Mr Johnson was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital in central London with ""persistent symptoms"" of Covid-19 on Sunday and was moved to intensive care on Monday evening after his symptoms worsened. Mr Raab said the prime minister was receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any assistance, such as mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support. Amid questions about what his role will entail, the foreign secretary said he was standing in for the prime minister ""whenever necessary"", including leading the daily meetings of the coronavirus ""war cabinet"". Mr Raab, who chaired the government's daily coronavirus meeting on Tuesday, said he had ""total confidence"" in the arrangements Mr Johnson had put in place. ""Well first of all, decision making by government is made by collective cabinet responsibility, so that is the same as before,"" the foreign secretary said. ""But we've got very clear directions, very clear instructions from the prime minister, and we're focused with total unity and total resolve on implementing them so that when he's back, I hope in very short order, we will have made the progress that he would expect and that the country would expect."" Earlier, Buckingham Palace said the Queen had sent a message to Mr Johnson's family and his partner, Carrie Symonds, saying she was thinking of them, and wished the PM a full and speedy recovery. Prince William alsotweeted a personal message of sympathy to the PM's family,external, signing it off with his initial ""W"", while his father, the Prince of Wales, sent a message from himself and the Duchess of Cornwall wishing Mr Johnson a ""speedy recovery"", Clarence House said.

By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake There was a show of support for Boris Johnson from Dominic Raab on behalf of his cabinet colleagues. The PM, he said, was not only their boss but ""also our friend"". Some bullish language about Mr Johnson being a ""fighter"" who would be back ""in short order"" was clearly an attempt to keep spirits up at a difficult time. Although Mr Raab has been asked to deputise for the PM while he is in intensive care, we learned very little about exactly how much authority he has. In response to questions about whether his role allowed him to take decisions, he said there was ""total unity"" in government and referred to the system of collective responsibility. That, simply put, is the principle that all senior ministers agree to support a policy once it's agreed. It seems Downing Street and Dominic Raab himself are keen to show that he is simply carrying out the prime minister's orders until Boris Johnson returns. The hope is, of course, that he is able to do that as soon as possible. But with every day that goes by decisions will need to be made and someone will have to make them. This video can not be played Cabinet minister Michael Gove says the prime minister remains in intensive care in London As of 09:00 on Tuesday, 213,181 people have been tested, of which 55,242 tested positive, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Overall, 266,694 tests have been concluded, with 14,006 tests carried out on Monday. The daily figure for the number of people tested on Monday excludes data from Manchester and Leeds because of a ""data processing delay"", while the overall tests figure excludes Northern Ireland, the Department of Health added.

She said at the weekend that she is ""on the mend"" after herself being forced to self-isolate after displaying symptoms of the disease.

YouTube tightens Covid-19 rules after Icke interviewVideos will now be deleted if they falsely link coronavirus to 5G mobile networks.Technology,"A lengthy interview with David Icke was live-streamed on YouTube on Monday YouTube has banned all conspiracy theory videos falsely linking coronavirus symptoms to 5G networks. The Google-owned service will now delete videos violating the policy. It had previously limited itself to reducing the frequency it recommended them in its Up Next section. The move follows a live-streamed interview with conspiracy theorist David Icke on Monday, in which he had linked the technology to the pandemic. YouTube said the video would be wiped. During the interview, Mr Icke falsely claimed there ""is a link between 5G and this health crisis"". And when asked for his reaction to reports of 5G masts being set on fire in England and Northern Ireland, he responded: ""If 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it, human life as we know it is over... so people have to make a decision."" Several users subsequently called for further attacks on 5G towers in the comments that appeared alongside the feed. Mr Icke also claimed that a coronavirus vaccine, when one is developed, would include ""nanotechnology microchips"" that would allow humans to be controlled. He added that Bill Gates - who is helping fund Covid-19 vaccine research - should be jailed. His views went unchallenged for much of the two-and-a-half-hour show. The interview was watched by about 65,000 people as it was streamed, some of whom clicked an on-screen button to trigger payments to make their live chat reactions stand out. YouTube only deleted the content after the session had ended, despite being aware of the broadcast while it was ongoing. It changed its rules after the BBC questioned why the video was permitted. ""We have clear policies that prohibit videos promoting medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment, and we quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged to us,"" a spokeswoman for YouTube told the BBC. ""Now any content that disputes the existence or transmission of Covid-19, as described by the WHO [World Health Organization] and local health authorities is in violation of YouTube policies. ""This includes conspiracy theories which claim that the symptoms are caused by 5G. ""For borderline content that could misinform users in harmful ways, we reduce recommendations. We'll continue to evaluate the impact of these videos on communities around the world."" Users who repeatedly break the rules now face being prevented from being able to use YouTube's Live tool. The firm may also prevent repeat offenders from earning money, and said it would terminate channels as a last resort. Coronavirus: Scientists brand 5G claims 'complete rubbish' Tech firms summoned over 'crackpot' 5G conspiracies Mast fire probe amid 5G coronavirus claims In this case, YouTube is allowing the interview's host to keep earnings generated via the Super Chats tool while the video was still online. But it is giving its own cut of the proceeds to charity, and has put the channel involved under review. YouTube's rules update coincides with new restrictionson WhatsApp,external. WhatsApp is taking action to slow the spread of misinformation on its network Facebook's app is limiting users to only being able to forward a message to one chat at a time if the same post has already been shared five or more times by the wider community. Such posts are labelled with double arrows to make their status known. Previously, the app had limited such messages to being forwarded to five different chats at once - a limit it had first introduced in 2018 to combat the spread of disinformation in India. ""We've recently seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding, which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation,"" it said, explaining the latest move. ""We believe it's important to slow the spread of these messages down to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation."" Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Fact-checking charity Full Facthas linked the claims to two flawed theories,external. Vodafone and Three have reported attacks on their telecoms equipment over recent days One falsely suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other falsely claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still ""non-ionising"", meaning it lacks enough energy tobreak apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage. Earlier this year, scientists at the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protectioncompleted a major study of related research into the topic. While it recommended slightly tighter limits on the transmitting capabilities of handsets themselves to minimise any chance of damage caused by human tissue being heated, its key finding was that there was no evidence that either 5G networks or earlier systems could cause cancer or other kinds of illness. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea andwell outside mainstream scientific thought,external. In any case, Covid-19 is a virus rather than a bacteria. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology.

NHS volunteers to start receiving tasks,"People who volunteered to support the NHS in England during the coronavirus crisis are being given details of what tasks they can do to help. More than 750,000 people signed up to join the ""volunteer army"" - three times the government's original target - to help relieve pressure on the NHS. They will support 2.5 million people who are considered at risk. The volunteers may have to deliver food and medicines, drive patients to appointments and phone the isolated. The process is being managedthrough a mobile app called GoodSam,,externalwhere health professionals, pharmacists, and local authorities can upload requests for help from Tuesday. Thousands of approved volunteers can then pick which tasks they want to complete in their local area. Volunteers switch their app to ""on duty"" to show when they are available. Due to the huge response, the group of vulnerable people they will support in England was expanded from 1.5 million to 2.5 million. The government scheme initially had a target of recruiting 250,000 helpers. Recruitment was temporarily paused on 29 March to process the initial applications. The Royal Voluntary Service, the charity helping co-ordinate the scheme, will have completed checks on the applications by the end of Tuesday. Teacher Stacey Walsh is one of thousands who wants to volunteer One of the thousands to sign up was Stacey Walsh, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, who is still teaching but wants to volunteer in her spare time. She told BBC Breakfast: ""I've said I'll do whatever's needed. I'm a very social person so being able to provide people who are isolated with support over the telephone - that's something that I really am looking forward to. ""It's really important as public sector workers we stand alongside the NHS. There is a unity between us so I'm really happy that I can help."" Two days ago, Edward Butler-Ellis didn't expect to find himself outside the home of an elderly woman in London, talking about her pharmacy collection in Portuguese using Google Translate. She was one of several vulnerable people he has run errands for as part of the NHS coronavirus volunteering scheme over the past day. Edward told the BBC it was ""clear that there was a bit of a language barrier"" from the moment he first spoke to her on the phone. But rather than passing the call on to another volunteer, he turned to technology to help. ""I had to give her a quick lesson on the doorstep,"" he laughed. ""I [didn't] want to take the risk that it [would take] another 10 volunteers to find somebody who speaks Portuguese."" Edward runs his own planning and communications firm, and, when work began to dry up as a result of the outbreak, he decided he could fill his spare time with volunteering. He said it has made him realise how many vulnerable people live in the capital. ""A lady that I went to see yesterday she felt guilty for having to phone up to get somebody else's support,"" he said. ""I wanted to provide her with some reassurance that people did genuinely want to help."" The experience left him ""emotional"". ""It did make me realise that there are people who are genuinely living in fear of their lives - she was frightened to go outside, and she was quite frustrated that some people were still out and about enjoying themselves as if it were some sort of extended holiday,"" he said. Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of the Royal Voluntary Service, said it had been ""a mammoth effort"" to get the scheme up and running but it was now ""open for business"". She said: ""It's determined grit that has got us through 750,000 volunteers. To authenticate those under normal circumstances would take months, but we don't have months. We want to shield the most at-risk patients now."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

'I was asked for Â£430 a month for my shut nursery',"When Farrah Sharif, 30, was told she would have to continue paying 80% of her two-year-old son's nursery fees to hold his place in the coming months, she was confused. Like millions of other parents she had already taken him out of their east London nursery because of government guidelines, so she didn't feel she should pay anything. ""We asked them whether they would be applying for the government's worker retention scheme and the other financial support, but they were really unclear. ""Lots of parents complained and they said they would drop the fees by another 40%, but we still didn't feel that was right. So we said we would pay for March and then review the situation."" To her surprise the nursery emailed her back and said it was taking her son Zayn off the register, suggesting she had been ungrateful. ""I was really upset, I felt my son was being penalised for something beyond his control,"" she says. 'I don't want a flight voucher, where's my refund?' 'The future of our nursery is pretty bleak' Since 21 March, UK nurseries have only been allowed to serve the children of key workers, leaving many almost empty and forcing some to temporarily shut. But some parents are still being asked to carry on paying some or all of their monthly fees as a retainer to hold their child's place, with bills stretching to more than Â£1,000 in some cases. Nurseries say it is because they are struggling. As small businesses, they can access the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which covers 80% of a workers' salaries if they are put on paid leave, as well as a one-year business rates holiday. But many say that is not enough. But while some parents say they are happy to pay, others - particularly those who have lost jobs or are facing financial uncertainty - say the cost is too much to bear. Ashleigh Seymour, 26, from Romsey says she is ""angry"" at having to pay a 30% retainer to keep her three-year-old son's Hunter's place, setting her back more than Â£200 a month. ""We both have gym memberships, but gyms have closed and they don't expect you to keep paying for a service they can't provide. I don't see why the burden should fall on parents."" It's come at a bad time as her husband, who runs his own limited company, has seen his income totally dry up and will get little government support. But she says she will have to pay as ""it's impossible"" to get a full time nursery place where she lives. Fiona Peart, 37, from London wouldn't mind contributing something to hold her two-year-old's place, but not the 100% she has been asked for, which is about Â£800 a month. ""All my friends have been asked for between 0% and 20% and some friends got a refund for the last week of March when their nurseries were closed. We can afford it but is not ideal. ""My husband's hours have been reduced and who knows if we'll even have jobs in a few months?"" But Caroline Marks, who runs First Steps nursery in Poole, says the criticism is unfair. ""Government funding issues, huge business rates, minimum wage, employer pensions, rising food and fuel costs have all had a very detrimental effect on the sector and many nurseries are close to the sustainability threshold,"" she said. ""We proposed that our customers pay a 25% retainer fee if they are able to afford it to help keep us afloat until normal service resumes."" Another nursery owner, who is charging 40%, said she was ""operating at a loss"" by staying open for just seven key worker children. ""Quite simply put, if the parents don't contribute something towards nursery fees, we would have to close. ""The combined rent, other overheads such as refuse collection (who won't suspend the service) and staff costs for these children mean we are losing money."" Nurseries have closed to everyone except vulnerable children and those with a parent identified as a key worker The National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), which represents the sector, says the ""vast majority"" of nurseries are not charging parents during the shutdown, and those that do will have no other choice. It says many still have to pay overheads as well as making up the shortfall in their staff's incomes. Few can claim virus-related losses on their insurance, either. ""Nurseries are vital now as ever to support children of key workers and vulnerable children so we need them to be staffed and operational,"" boss Purnima Tanuku OBE says. ""They need to be able to pay their staff to maintain continuity when this settles down."" Some parents have said that they will not pay the retainers, while others have successfully lobbied to secure discounts. Lawyers say parents have a lot of leverage as they can threaten to withdraw their children, however the legal picture is unclear. Private nurseries, which deliver most provision in the UK, set their own terms and conditions and may include emergency closure clauses in their contracts. But the NDNA says these are designed for things that close the nursery for a few days like fire, flood and vandalism and ""have not been tested"" in a situation that could last for weeks or months. Last week, Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, called on the government to offer more financial support, saying some parents were being pushed ""into unnecessary hardship"". A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We expect nurseries to take a reasonable and proportionate approach to fees paid by parents, in light of these unprecedented circumstances, and to communicate any arrangements clearly with parents."" It added: ""We continue to fund them for the free entitlements for the duration of these closures, even if children are not attending. We have also put in place a significant package of financial support."" 'I don't want a flight voucher, where's my refund?'

Travel is shut down in Israel ahead of the Jewish Passover holiday Ashitha Nagesh, Max Matza, Joshua Cheetham and Jude Sheerin This concludes our Tuesday live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. The US is still the hardest-hit country, with Illinois and New York both recording their deadliest days so far. The virus is continuing to spread to smaller US cities, but officials in some states say the curve appears to be ""flattening"". New York has said their rate of new infections may be more of a ""plateau"". Black Americans have been dying in disproportionate numbers, with inequalities in healthcare access and higher rates of chronic illness cited among causes. We'll be back with more coverage on Wednesday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been ribbed on social media after he dropped the adverb ""moistly"" into a live TV address.

Voters queued for up to two hours to vote in parts of Wisconsin Trump said Democrats only asked to delay the Wisconsin election, ""fifteen minutes"" after he made his endorsement. He said this was the reason for the attempts to delay, and not ""safety"" concerns, as Democrats said. He called postal ballots - which were curtailed by the Supreme Court - ""corrupt"", adding that ""they're forgeries in many cases"". Wisconsin held in-person voting on Tuesday after Republicans blocked Democratic attempts to delay the election until June. After most polling sites closed, bottlenecks formed at remaining polling stations, and long queues of voters formed. Wisconsin has reported 2,578 cases and 94 deaths, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Voting took place despite orders to stay-at-home due to coronavirus. When asked if he will be responsible for any voters falling sick, Trump responds: ""Look all I did was endorse a candidate. I don't know anything about any lines."" A doctor who specialised in treating the elderly has died after testing positive for Covid-19. Dr Anton Sebastianpillai died after being admitted to Kingston Hospital in south-west London, the same hospital he worked at. It is believed he came out of retirement to help the NHS. ""It is with great sadness that I confirm the death of a consultant geriatrician who was part of the team at Kingston Hospital,"" a spokeswoman for Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said. ""Dr Anton Sebastianpillai died on Saturday having been cared for in the hospital's intensive care unit since 31 March. ""We would like to extend our sincere condolences to his family."" Read more about Dr Sebastianpillai here.  Zoe ThomasUS Business Reporter As we reported earlier, Jack Dorsey - the boss of Twitter and payment app Square - has pledged to donate $1bn (Â£810m) towards coronavirus relief efforts. He'll be making the donation through a limited liability company, and said the money amounts to 28% of his total wealth. To fund the efforts, the tech billionaire plans to sell his shares in the payment app Square. He said he was using shares of Square and not Twitter simply because he had more of them. The new fund will first focus on coronavirus relief. But Mr Dorsey said once the pandemic had âdisarmedâ, the donation would focus on girlsâ health and education on research into universal basic income. Mr Dorsey is not the first tech billionaire to donate to the coronavirus efforts. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos have all publicly pledged part of their wealth in the effort to battle back the disease. Trump said the World Health Organization is ""very China-centric"" and accuses the global health body of making the wrong decisions about the initial coronavirus outbreak in China. ""We're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it and we're gonna see,"" said Trump. He later modified his remarks to say he would look into ending funding. The US gives $58m each year to the WHO. ""They seem to err always on the side of China... we will look at ending funding because you know they called it wrong."" President Trump said he played no role in the acting secretary of the US Navy's decision to resign, after the official had called the captain of a coronavirus stricken ship ""stupid"". ""I had no role in it,"" said Trump. The captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt ""should not have written a letter"", in which he complained about the Pentagon's response to the onboard outbreak. ""He did not have to be Ernest Hemingway. He had a bad day,"" said Trump, ""but you shouldn't be writing letters and sending them to many people."" But the secretary of the Navy ""didn't have to resign"", said Trump, who went on to praise the decision as best for all involved. But he added that he would not have asked him to quit. Trump has spoken about black Americans being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus. We reported earlier about stats from Chicago, which showed that the city's Black residents account for half of its coronavirus cases and more than 70% of deaths - despite only making up 30% of the population. At the same time other cities with large black populations, including Detroit, Milwaukee, New Orleans and New York, have become coronavirus hotspots. Read the full storyhere. Doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients have to self-isolate away from family between shifts. To avoid the stresses of looking for accommodation, a social media group set up a way to link medical staff with owners of caravans throughout the United States. Christy Deike said: ""It answered a prayer for me in being able to help in some manner.""  Watch our video below. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Helping frontline medics with a place to stay The death rate among black Americans, which has been much higher than other racial groups, presents a ""tremendous challenge"", says Trump. ""It's terrible,"" he says, promising to ""provide support to African-American citizens of this country who are going through a lot"". ""But it's been disproportionate. They're getting hit very very hard."" Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist, says the medical community in the US has ""known literally forever"" that minority groups suffer high rates of ""diabetes, hypertension, disabilities and asthma"". These conditions represent co-morbidities that lead to much worse health outcomes for coronavirus, Fauci says. Trump says the UK has asked the US to send 200 ventilators to treat coronavirus patients there. ""We're going to work it out for them,"" Trump promises, saying the UK has been a great partner to the US. He says the UK needs ventilators ""desperately"". Trump thanks the ""genius companies"" that he says are working hard to quickly create ""a vaccine to protect us, totally protect us"" from coronavirus. He goes on to praise state governors, who have been racing to secure medical supplies from overseas and have been receiving some from the US federal stockpile. ""If you have a governor that fails, we're going to protect you,"" Trump says, promising to send medical gear to hotspots around the country. Trump sends his best wishes to the people of New York and New Jersey, and to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""He's become a great friend of ours,"" says Trump. ""He loves the USA and he's always been very good to us,"" says Trump, ""so we pray for him."" The president says that hopefully the rate of deaths in the US will slow ""in the next week, hopefully not much longer than that"". ""We're going to beat it with the grit and the heart"" that America is known for, he continues. The White House coronavirus taskforce is holding its daily briefing now. It comes as Trump continues to promote an unproven drug treatment, the head of the US Navy quits over his handling of a coronavirus-stricken ship, and Illinois and New York both record their deadliest days yet. An appeals court in Texas has ruled that the state can continue to ban nearly all abortions as part of its emergency order requiring ""non-essential"" services to be suspended in order to halt the spread of coronavirus. Abortions have been blocked for the past two weeks there, causing some patients to seek help in other states or self-terminate. According to the state's attorney general, any doctor who performs an abortion ""not medically necessary to preserve the life or health"" of the patient can be fined up to $1,000 (Â£810) or receive an 180-day jail sentence. Five other Republican-led states - Ohio, Texas, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahoma - have also taken steps to temporarily block abortions. Abortion access advocates have sued to overturn the bans. Kinderdijk, a Unesco World Heritage site, has been closed to visitors as part of the Dutch lockdown The Netherlands is looking at ways to ease lockdown measures, but life may never go back to the way it was BC (before coronavirus). Social distancing is here to stay, says Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. ""We should all start thinking about how we can adapt still further to the 1.5-metre society. The way back will be step by step and based on science,"" he told reporters. (In some parts of Europe, people are told to keep at least 1.5 metres away from others, although the WHO guidance says two metres.) If the curve of hospital and intensive care admissions continues to level off, the Dutch lockdown measures could be eased from 28 April. But Mr Rutte cautions against any hurry. ""We have an intelligent lockdown. It will be an intelligent un-lockdown.â  The government's emergency field hospital in London has admitted its first patients. The NHS Nightingale hospital in London's ExCel exhibition centre can hold as many as 4,000 patients. A spokesperson for NHS Nightingale said: ""Our first patients have now been admitted to NHS Nightingale London, as planned. ""There is also treatment capacity available in other hospitals across London to compliment the care being provided at the London Nightingale."" It is the first of several such facilities planned across the UK. The ExCel exhibition space - usually used for large events such as Comic Con - was transformed into a hospital in just nine days. Read about how it was built. Temperatures in Chicago have warmed significantly in the past few days Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has announced the largest single-day increase in coronavirus related deaths. According to the governor, 73 people died in the last 24 hours. There have now been 380 coronavirus-related fatalities in Illinois. People in Wuhan are now allowed to leave the city, for the first time since 23 January. Wuhan, in China's Hubei province, is where the virus was first reported at the end of December. Now, as life begins to return to normal, transport links out of the city have been reopened. At midnight local time (17:00 BST), people began to queue up outside Wuhan Wuchang Railway Station. The White House coronavirus taskforce is due to hold a briefing in the coming hour. President Donald Trump has frequently appeared to speak from the briefing room, as well as Vice President Mike Pence and other presidential advisers and health officials. As the Covid-19 death toll in the US rises to nearly 12,000 and over 380,000 Americans are confirmed to be infected, the group can expect questions on: Â© 2025 BBC.

'I'm a frontline carer but I feel undervalued'Care worker Precious Omoruyi says she was turned away from a supermarket during an NHS-only time slot.Scotland business,"Care worker Precious Omoruyi says she was turned away from a supermarket during an NHS-only time slot When Precious Omoruyi finished her 12-hour shift at a care home in Glasgow early on a Sunday morning, she headed to her local Tesco supermarket for essential supplies. The 22-year-old care assistant's shopping trip coincided with a time slot reserved for NHS staff but she felt, as a frontline care worker, she had every right to be there. She was shocked to discover that the store had other ideas. ""I went to the store because I had nothing at home and I was working the next night,"" she recalled. ""I was asked for my ID at the door but my work badge didn't have a photo, unlike an NHS badge, and I was told I couldn't go in. I offered to show them my uniform, which I had with me, but they said no. ""I was upset and disappointed but I wasn't in the mood to fight with them so I just left. I really felt under-appreciated."" Carer was 'dedicated to the most vulnerable' Eight dead after coronavirus outbreak at care home Virus suspected as 13 care home residents die For Ms Omoruyi, companies like Just Eat have fuelled that feeling by offering discounts only to NHS staff. ""I feel that care workers are not really given the credit they deserve but we give the same care and we share the same risks,"" she  explained. ""I go to work like them, and every shift I hope I don't get coronavirus."" How big is the Scottish independent social care sector? The sector employs more than 103,000 people - more than half of the total social services workforce - including approximately 5,000 nurses It provides 88% of care home places for older people The sector delivers about 55% of home care hours for older people Source: Scottish Care Donald Macaskill said the social care workforce had every right to feel undervalued Scottish Care, which represents 400 organisations in the independent social care services sector, said Ms Omoruyi's story was all too familiar. Chief executive Donald Macaskill explained: ""The social care workforce has every right to feel undervalued. ""While the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of this workforce and is seeming to shift the perception to some degree, including the weekly Clap for Carers, we are still seeing ignorance and under-appreciation of social care workers. ""Some of our supermarkets are refusing to allow them access to protected shopping hours like their NHS colleagues, and daily there are organisations offering commendable benefits to healthcare staff but ignoring their colleagues in the care community. ""This is disappointing and misguided. Social care services and their staff are playing a critical role in supporting our hospitals to manage this pandemic and are caring for some of our most vulnerable citizens through it."" When asked about its Sunday morning NHS-only policy, a Tesco spokesman said the company had no plans ""for the time being"" to include the independent sector. Iceland also offers ""exclusive hours"" to NHS workers, and it too has no immediate plans to open that up. On its website, the company says: ""We totally understand the need to look after social care workers at this time too, and have a huge amount of respect and gratitude for what they  are doing. ""But there are limits to what we can do as a relatively small supermarket at this time of exceptional demand, bearing in mind that the UK has 1.1 million workers in the NHS and a further 1.6 million employed in social care. ""Hence we have had to take the decision to prioritise only NHS staff and the elderly and the vulnerable at this  time, but we will continue to look for ways to help others."" Iceland is one of several supermarkets to offer NHS-only slots Other supermarkets, such as Sainsbury's and Morrisons, have included independent sector care workers in reserved shopping slots. Asda, which announced last month that it would be prioritising NHS workers in larger stores on certain days of the week, said on Friday that it had been a ""miscommunication"" and that ""all social care workers were welcome then and are welcome now"" during reserved slots. Just Eat, one of many businesses that are offering discounts only to NHS staff (in this case, 25%), suggested it might be open to amending its policy. A spokesman said: ""While this discount applies to NHS workers, we recognise that these are probably some of the most challenging times we will go through in our lifetime and want to show support in any way that we can. ""We are exploring a number of options to see how we can help more people on the front line, as well as support the wider government response to Covid-19."" Scottish Care hopes, rather than expects, that the pandemic will lead to a sea change in the way care workers are viewed by the public.

Thousands missed off coronavirus 'high risk' listTransplant patients and people with lung diseases are among those who have been missed off the list.EnglandComments,"The government has said about 1.5 million people have been identified as needing to ""shield"" Thousands of people have been missed off the government's high risk list for Covid-19 despite meeting the criteria. Among them have been transplant patients, people with asthma and some with rare lung diseases. Many are worried it will affect their ability to access food and medical supplies as they shield from the virus, unable to leave their homes for at least 12 weeks. Supermarkets have been using the list to give priority to vulnerable customers, meaning those not included have already missed out on opportunities for which they would have been eligible. ""It's like she's been forgotten,"" said Bev Pearson, mother of 20-year-old heart transplant patient Lucy Pearson. Miss Pearson, from Whitsbury in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, had her transplant 14 years ago and still visits hospital for regular check-ups. She has been shielding in the home she shares with her mother, brother and sister - none of whom have been venturing out in an attempt to protect her. ""I managed to book three food delivery slots before everybody got put into isolation but after that I can't get any more food delivery slots,"" Ms Pearson said. Despite registering her daughter on the government list herself, she said she had received no confirmation. When she asked her GP she was told it had ""nothing to do with the surgery"", she added. Ms Pearson said a neighbour was currently helping to collect medication for Lucy but she was ""worried about getting food"". ""We're OK for a couple of weeks but what after that? We've got another 11 weeks of this yet."" She said she had come across other transplant patients in the same position, and said: ""People are beginning to feel despondent."" ""I'd be fairly unlikely to survive if I got coronavirus,"" said 79-year-old Liz Goldfinch. Mrs Goldfinch, from Droitwich in Worcestershire, is self-isolating with her 88-year-old husband as she has cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP) - a rare lung condition - and Parkinson's disease. ""I haven't yet received a letter and if I have been missed off the list I feel pretty annoyed and worried I suppose,"" she said. ""At the moment we're OK as we have neighbours who have been helping deliver food and anything else we might need. ""I guess it all depends how long this goes on for. If they can no longer help, if they get ill or whatever, it could be a problem. ""I haven't been able to get a supermarket delivery slot up to now. So that would be a problem if no-one was able to help us."" Mrs Goldfinch said she hoped she would not be forced into a position that meant she or her husband would have to leave the house. ""If I just get a cold or flu then my COP means I am very likely to end up in hospital,"" she said. ""This has already happened on two occasions in he last three years. I suspect it would be a much more dire situation if I caught coronavirus."" ""Sometimes I can have three or four asthma attacks in one day if I catch a cold, and I find it really difficult to breathe,"" said Shivani Mistry, from Telford in Shropshire. The 23-year-old lives in a shared house and has been trying to isolate herself from the rest of her housemates. ""I'm not angry that I have been missed off the list as there are more vulnerable people than me but it is a bit of a horrible situation,"" she said. ""I can ask for help but I don't like asking,"" Ms Mistry said. She said money was also an issue because she had no cash in the house. ""I have had to wait for three weeks for a food delivery - I've got another week to go, so I have been surviving off the very last of my supplies from the week before, that were only supposed to last a week. ""For three days straight I was just living off potatoes. ""My boyfriend sent me some facemasks so I could risk going out to the shop, which I have tried but it is very scary. ""It was just insane the amount of people who were not considerate and keeping their distance. People were brushing past me."" Solid organ transplant recipients People with specific cancers: people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy people with lung cancer who are undergoing radical radiotherapy people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment people having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer people having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors people who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last six months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs Other conditions: People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe COPD People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell) People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of infection Women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired Source:NHS England,external NHS Digital, which compiled the list, said it had identified about 900,000 patients who should have already received an official letter or text. However, it said GPs and hospital doctors were now adding a further 600,000 patients. It also advised people to register themselves on thegovernment website,externalif they needed extra help and support. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Royal College of General Practitioners have also advised those who feel they had been missed off the list to contact their GPs. Meet the âshieldedâ enduring 12 weeks of isolation Coronavirus: What is shielding? 'I'm high-risk and got coronavirus: it can be OK' Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ""GP practices are working hard to notify patients who are considered to be in a vulnerable group, and therefore at higher-risk of getting Covid-19, about measures they should take to keep as safe as possible.""

By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake There was a show of support for Boris Johnson from Dominic Raab on behalf of his cabinet colleagues. The PM, he said, was not only their boss but ""also our friend"". Some bullish language about Mr Johnson being a ""fighter"" who would be back ""in short order"" was clearly an attempt to keep spirits up at a difficult time. Although Mr Raab has been asked to deputise for the PM while he is in intensive care, we learned very little about exactly how much authority he has. In response to questions about whether his role allowed him to take decisions, he said there was ""total unity"" in government and referred to the system of collective responsibility. That, simply put, is the principle that all senior ministers agree to support a policy once it's agreed. It seems Downing Street and Dominic Raab himself are keen to show that he is simply carrying out the prime minister's orders until Boris Johnson returns. The hope is, of course, that he is able to do that as soon as possible. But with every day that goes by decisions will need to be made and someone will have to make them.

Overall, 266,694 tests have been concluded, with 14,006 tests carried out on Monday. The daily figure for the number of people tested on Monday excludes data from Manchester and Leeds because of a ""data processing delay"", while the overall tests figure excludes Northern Ireland, the Department of Health added.

Who's in charge if a PM is incapacitated?What is the risk to men over 50?Who is Dominic Raab?,"Foreign SecretaryDominic Raabsaid he had ""all the authority"" he needed to make relevant decisions, as he deputised for Boris Johnson while he was in hospital with coronavirus. The prime minister,who has paid tribute to the NHS staff who cared for him, is now recovering at Chequers, and is not expected to return to work for some time. So who else shares power and how are decisions made while the prime minister is ill? Mr Raab is the foreign secretary, but he also has the title offirst secretary of state,external- giving him seniority above all other cabinet ministers. So if Mr Johnson did not return to his post, Mr Raab would take over in the first instance. When Mr Johnson was moved into intensive care, Mr Raab said the government would continue to focus ""at the prime minister's direction"" on defeating coronavirus. The role of deputy prime minister - like that of first secretary of state - is not a permanent position in government. Someone is appointed at the discretion of the prime minister. The last deputy PM was Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, during the 2010-15 coalition government with the Conservatives. Although Mr Raab was first asked to deputise for the PM while he was in intensive care, we know very little about the exact extent of his authority. There are various things only the prime minister can do - but some of these could be taken up by Mr Raab without much trouble. For example, he could make recommendations to the Queen on appointments to the senior judiciary and high-ranking positions in the Church of England. But it's harder to imagine him conducting a reshuffle - even though, formally, it seems he ought to have that power. It would be tricky for him to authorise military action at short notice. Other ministers would most likely have to agree first, but the buck would stop with Mr Raab. Then, there are theletters of last resort the prime minister writesfor nuclear submarines, giving commanding officers instructions about what to do in the event of a deadly attack. It's unlikely Mr Raab would have to write them unless Mr Johnson was incapacitated for a long time. When asked if his role let him take decisions, Mr Raab said there was ""total unity"" among his cabinet colleagues and referred to the system of collective responsibility. It means that in practice, any major decisions will probably be taken by Mr Raab in consultation with the cabinet or, where appropriate, senior civil servants. The cabinet is the ultimate decision-making body of government, made up of the most senior ministers including the home secretary, the health secretary and the chancellor of the exchequer. After February's general election, Boris Johnsonformed a cabinetof 22 full members - including himself - and four other attending members. So although he's the head of the government and has some individual powers, most important decisions are taken collectively in cabinet. And the principle of ""collective responsibility"" means each cabinet decision is binding for each member - even if they personally disagreed with it. Not all decisions are taken by full cabinet. It's normal for there to be ""cabinet committees"" - smaller groups of ministers focused on specific issues. There are four ""implementation committees"" working on different parts of the response. They're looking at healthcare, the public sector response, economics and business, and the international response. Each is chaired by a cabinet minister and feeding into a daily overarching ""C-19 meeting"" - led in the prime minister's absence by Dominic Raab. Power is no protection from harm If Boris Johnson wasn't able to continue as PM, the rules for what should happen next are unclear - a consequence of the UK's unwritten constitution. But we do have some idea of what might happen. Thecabinet manual,externalis the closest thing we have to a document which sets out the role of the prime minister. It suggests the cabinet would select a replacement who the Queen would ask to form a government. That could be Mr Raab or another senior MP. The expectation is that he or she would be in place until the Conservative Party appointed a new leader. According to the Institute for Government think tank, prime ministers continue in office unless they resign or die. It adds: ""While political parties usually have the ability to appoint an 'acting leader' if the leader resigns or is incapacitated, there is no formal 'acting prime minister' role. He or she would be prime minister until they chose to resign or if their cabinet forced them out."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Johnson spends night in intensive care,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has spent the night in intensive care at a central London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened. Mr Johnson, 55, is ""in very good hands"", said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is standing in for the PM and chaired the government's daily meeting. World leaders have sent messages to Mr Johnson wishing him well. It comes as Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove became the latest politician to go into quarantine. Mr Govesaid he was self-isolating,externalat home, after a family member showed mild symptoms. He is not suffering any symptoms and will work from home. What is intensive care and which patients need it? NHS volunteers to start receiving tasks Mr Johnson was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital with ""persistent symptoms"" on Sunday and moved to intensive care on Monday at 19:00 BST. He was moved as a precaution so he could be close to a ventilator - whichtakes over the body's breathing process- BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday: ""The prime minister's not on a ventilator. He has received oxygen support."" If there is any change in his condition ""No 10 will ensure the country is updated"", Mr Gove added. This video can not be played Cabinet minister Michael Gove says the prime minister remains in intensive care in London As the first secretary of state,Mr Raab is the minister designated to stand infor Mr Johnson if he is unwell and unable to work. Mr Raab said earlier there was an ""incredibly strong team spirit"" behind the prime minister and that he and his colleagues were making sure they implemented plans Mr Johnson had instructed them to deliver ""as soon as possible"". Mr Raab arrived at No 10 for his first job to lead the government's daily virus meeting Mr Johnson is the first major world leader to have announced he had the virus Some politicians have called for greater clarity on what Mr Raab's role as deputy entails, includingTory MP Tobias Ellwood who asked,externalfor details ""as to where responsibility for UK national security decisions now lies"". Lord Heseltine, who served as deputy prime minister under John Major, said it will be a ""very difficult personal position"" for Mr Raab, who ""will be tested by the loneliness of the job"".

He also sounded a warning to people who have broken social distancing guidelines, saying: ""I hope people who may have wandered out the other day and decided they can sit around having barbecues will really think about this carefully and recognise this is serious. ""If the most powerful man in Britain can come down with this, so can you"". Laura Kuenssberg: Power is no protection from harm Who's in charge if a PM is incapacitated? Profile: Dominic Raab Mr Johnson was initially taken to hospital for tests afterannouncing 11 days agothat he had coronavirus. His symptoms included a high temperature and a cough. Earlier on Monday,he tweeted he was,externalin ""good spirits"". Mr Gove is the latest cabinet minister to self-isolate, after Mr Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Scottish secretary Alister Jack. The government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty and the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings also spent time self-isolating after showing symptoms. After very, very little information was shared on Monday, the prime minister was taken into intensive care at around 19:00 BST. We've been told he is still conscious, but his condition had worsened over the course of Monday afternoon. And he has been moved to intensive care as a precaution in case he needs ventilation to get through this illness. The statement from Downing Street makes clear he is receiving excellent care and he wants to thank all of the NHS staff. But something important has changed, and he has felt it necessary to ask his foreign secretary to deputise for him where needs be. That is a completely different message from what we have heard over the past 18 hours or so, where it was continually ""the prime minister is in touch"" and ""he is in charge"" - almost like everything is business as usual. But clearly being in intensive care changes everything. Read more from Laura The Queen has been kept informed about Mr Johnson's health, Buckingham Palace said. Shealso issued a message thanking healthcare workers,externalfor their ""selfless commitment and diligence"" to mark World Health Day. It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK reached 5,373 - an increase of 439 in a day. The Department of Health and Social Care said there were now 51,608 confirmed coronavirus cases. Separate figuresfrom the Office for National Statistics have been released,showing the majority of coronavirus deaths are happening in hospitals but some are in hospices and care homes. Intensive care is where doctors look after the sickest patients. We do not know the full details of the prime minister's condition, but his admission to ICU is the clearest indication of how ill he is. Around two-thirds of patients admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 will need sedation and ventilation within 24 hours of arriving. This is a disease that attacks the lungs and can cause pneumonia and difficulty breathing. The body is left struggling to get enough oxygen into the blood and to the body's vital organs. Boris Johnson has already being given extra oxygen support. There is no proven drug treatment for Covid-19, although there are many experimental candidates. But the cornerstone of the prime minister's care will depend on getting enough oxygen into his body and supporting his other organs while his immune system fights the virus. Among those who have sent messages to Mr Johnson was Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who described it as ""terribly sad news"". ""All the country's thoughts are with the prime minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time,"" he added. Meanwhile, Russia's Vladimir Putin wished Mr Johnson a speedy recovery, saying he was ""convinced that your energy, optimism and sense of humour will help you overcome the disease"". US President Donald Trump said Americans ""are all praying for his recovery"", describing Mr Johnson as ""a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation"" who is ""strong"" and ""doesn't give up"".

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid she was ""sending [Mr Johnson] every good wish"",while Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster added she was ""praying for a full and speedy recovery"".

'I'm a frontline carer but I feel undervalued',"Care worker Precious Omoruyi says she was turned away from a supermarket during an NHS-only time slot When Precious Omoruyi finished her 12-hour shift at a care home in Glasgow early on a Sunday morning, she headed to her local Tesco supermarket for essential supplies. The 22-year-old care assistant's shopping trip coincided with a time slot reserved for NHS staff but she felt, as a frontline care worker, she had every right to be there. She was shocked to discover that the store had other ideas. ""I went to the store because I had nothing at home and I was working the next night,"" she recalled. ""I was asked for my ID at the door but my work badge didn't have a photo, unlike an NHS badge, and I was told I couldn't go in. I offered to show them my uniform, which I had with me, but they said no. ""I was upset and disappointed but I wasn't in the mood to fight with them so I just left. I really felt under-appreciated."" Carer was 'dedicated to the most vulnerable' Eight dead after coronavirus outbreak at care home Virus suspected as 13 care home residents die For Ms Omoruyi, companies like Just Eat have fuelled that feeling by offering discounts only to NHS staff. ""I feel that care workers are not really given the credit they deserve but we give the same care and we share the same risks,"" she  explained. ""I go to work like them, and every shift I hope I don't get coronavirus."" How big is the Scottish independent social care sector? The sector employs more than 103,000 people - more than half of the total social services workforce - including approximately 5,000 nurses It provides 88% of care home places for older people The sector delivers about 55% of home care hours for older people Source: Scottish Care Donald Macaskill said the social care workforce had every right to feel undervalued Scottish Care, which represents 400 organisations in the independent social care services sector, said Ms Omoruyi's story was all too familiar. Chief executive Donald Macaskill explained: ""The social care workforce has every right to feel undervalued. ""While the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of this workforce and is seeming to shift the perception to some degree, including the weekly Clap for Carers, we are still seeing ignorance and under-appreciation of social care workers. ""Some of our supermarkets are refusing to allow them access to protected shopping hours like their NHS colleagues, and daily there are organisations offering commendable benefits to healthcare staff but ignoring their colleagues in the care community. ""This is disappointing and misguided. Social care services and their staff are playing a critical role in supporting our hospitals to manage this pandemic and are caring for some of our most vulnerable citizens through it."" When asked about its Sunday morning NHS-only policy, a Tesco spokesman said the company had no plans ""for the time being"" to include the independent sector. Iceland also offers ""exclusive hours"" to NHS workers, and it too has no immediate plans to open that up. On its website, the company says: ""We totally understand the need to look after social care workers at this time too, and have a huge amount of respect and gratitude for what they  are doing. ""But there are limits to what we can do as a relatively small supermarket at this time of exceptional demand, bearing in mind that the UK has 1.1 million workers in the NHS and a further 1.6 million employed in social care. ""Hence we have had to take the decision to prioritise only NHS staff and the elderly and the vulnerable at this  time, but we will continue to look for ways to help others."" Iceland is one of several supermarkets to offer NHS-only slots Other supermarkets, such as Sainsbury's and Morrisons, have included independent sector care workers in reserved shopping slots. Asda, which announced last month that it would be prioritising NHS workers in larger stores on certain days of the week, said on Friday that it had been a ""miscommunication"" and that ""all social care workers were welcome then and are welcome now"" during reserved slots. Just Eat, one of many businesses that are offering discounts only to NHS staff (in this case, 25%), suggested it might be open to amending its policy. A spokesman said: ""While this discount applies to NHS workers, we recognise that these are probably some of the most challenging times we will go through in our lifetime and want to show support in any way that we can. ""We are exploring a number of options to see how we can help more people on the front line, as well as support the wider government response to Covid-19."" Scottish Care hopes, rather than expects, that the pandemic will lead to a sea change in the way care workers are viewed by the public. Mr Macaskill said: ""When we eventually do reach the end of the coronavirus pandemic, there must be a fundamental shift in how people  who work in this sector feel valued by society for the necessary and complex work they do.""

Petrol prices head towards Â£1 in the UK,"Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges. Watch your speed:The RAC says 45-50mph is the most efficient speed to drive for fuel efficiency Switch off the air conditioning: Extra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10%, according to the AA Check your tyre pressure:Underinflated tyres will use up extra petrol.

'Idiot' NZ health minister breaks lockdown at beach,"New Zealand's health minister has called himself an ""idiot"" after breaking the country's lockdown by driving his family to the beach. David Clark admitted the 12-mile (20km) drive was ""a clear breach of the lockdown principles"". He offered his resignation to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but kept his job because of the ongoing crisis. But he has been demoted in cabinet rankings and also lost a secondary position of associate finance minister. On Sunday, Scotland's chief medical officerresigned for making two trips to her second homeduring the lockdown. New Zealand went into its highest state of lockdown, level four, late on Wednesday 25 March. But on the first weekend, Mr Clark drove his family from their home in Dunedin to Doctor's Point beach. Mr Clark admitted the trip to Ms Ardern after being criticised for another breach of the rules. Last week, he drove a shorter distance to a mountain bike trail - and his van, featuring a picture of himself on the side, wasphotographed at the trail.,external ""People can go outside to get fresh air and drive short distances if needed, but we have asked people to avoid activities where there is a higher risk of injury,"" said Ms Ardern last week in response to the trail ride. ""The minister should have followed that guidance."" Mr Clark and Ms Ardern on 12 March, before the lockdown Mr Clark said he had offered to resign. ""As the health minister it's my responsibility to not only follow the rules but set an example to other New Zealanders,"" he said. ""At a time when we are asking New Zealanders to make historic sacrifices I've let the team down. I've been an idiot, and I understand why people will be angry with me."" Ms Ardern said ""under normal conditions"", Mr Clark would be sacked. Australia and NZ ban non-residents from entry GP stranded in New Zealand 'feels guilty' ""We cannot afford massive disruption in the health sector or to our response,"" she said. ""For that reason, and that reason alone, Dr Clark will maintain his role. But he does need to pay a price. He broke the rules. ""While he maintains his health portfolio, I am stripping him of his role as associate finance minister and demoting him to the bottom of our cabinet rankings.

PM spends night in intensive care after symptoms worsen,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has spent the night in intensive care at a central London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened. Mr Johnson, 55, is ""in very good hands"", said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is standing in for the PM and chaired the government's daily meeting. World leaders have sent messages to Mr Johnson wishing him well. It comes as Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove became the latest politician to go into quarantine. Mr Govesaid he was self-isolating,externalat home, after a family member showed mild symptoms. He is not suffering any symptoms and will work from home. What is intensive care and which patients need it? NHS volunteers to start receiving tasks Mr Johnson was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital with ""persistent symptoms"" on Sunday and moved to intensive care on Monday at 19:00 BST. He was moved as a precaution so he could be close to a ventilator - whichtakes over the body's breathing process- BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday: ""The prime minister's not on a ventilator. He has received oxygen support."" If there is any change in his condition ""No 10 will ensure the country is updated"", Mr Gove added. This video can not be played Cabinet minister Michael Gove says the prime minister remains in intensive care in London As the first secretary of state,Mr Raab is the minister designated to stand infor Mr Johnson if he is unwell and unable to work. Mr Raab said earlier there was an ""incredibly strong team spirit"" behind the prime minister and that he and his colleagues were making sure they implemented plans Mr Johnson had instructed them to deliver ""as soon as possible"". Mr Raab arrived at No 10 for his first job to lead the government's daily virus meeting Mr Johnson is the first major world leader to have announced he had the virus Some politicians have called for greater clarity on what Mr Raab's role as deputy entails, includingTory MP Tobias Ellwood who asked,externalfor details ""as to where responsibility for UK national security decisions now lies"". Lord Heseltine, who served as deputy prime minister under John Major, said it will be a ""very difficult personal position"" for Mr Raab, who ""will be tested by the loneliness of the job"". ""He will be surrounded by lots of people who know what Boris Johnson said, believe Boris will be quickly back and have their own personal agendas anyway,"" he said. LIVE:China reports no new virus deaths for first time A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the government will ""continue to work"" as decisions are made collectively by the cabinet. He also sounded a warning to people who have broken social distancing guidelines, saying: ""I hope people who may have wandered out the other day and decided they can sit around having barbecues will really think about this carefully and recognise this is serious. ""If the most powerful man in Britain can come down with this, so can you"". Laura Kuenssberg: Power is no protection from harm Who's in charge if a PM is incapacitated? Profile: Dominic Raab Mr Johnson was initially taken to hospital for tests afterannouncing 11 days agothat he had coronavirus. His symptoms included a high temperature and a cough. Earlier on Monday,he tweeted he was,externalin ""good spirits"". Mr Gove is the latest cabinet minister to self-isolate, after Mr Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Scottish secretary Alister Jack. The government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty and the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings also spent time self-isolating after showing symptoms. After very, very little information was shared on Monday, the prime minister was taken into intensive care at around 19:00 BST. We've been told he is still conscious, but his condition had worsened over the course of Monday afternoon. And he has been moved to intensive care as a precaution in case he needs ventilation to get through this illness. The statement from Downing Street makes clear he is receiving excellent care and he wants to thank all of the NHS staff. But something important has changed, and he has felt it necessary to ask his foreign secretary to deputise for him where needs be. That is a completely different message from what we have heard over the past 18 hours or so, where it was continually ""the prime minister is in touch"" and ""he is in charge"" - almost like everything is business as usual. But clearly being in intensive care changes everything. Read more from Laura The Queen has been kept informed about Mr Johnson's health, Buckingham Palace said. Shealso issued a message thanking healthcare workers,externalfor their ""selfless commitment and diligence"" to mark World Health Day. It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK reached 5,373 - an increase of 439 in a day. The Department of Health and Social Care said there were now 51,608 confirmed coronavirus cases. Separate figuresfrom the Office for National Statistics have been released,showing the majority of coronavirus deaths are happening in hospitals but some are in hospices and care homes. Intensive care is where doctors look after the sickest patients. We do not know the full details of the prime minister's condition, but his admission to ICU is the clearest indication of how ill he is. Around two-thirds of patients admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 will need sedation and ventilation within 24 hours of arriving. This is a disease that attacks the lungs and can cause pneumonia and difficulty breathing. The body is left struggling to get enough oxygen into the blood and to the body's vital organs. Boris Johnson has already being given extra oxygen support. There is no proven drug treatment for Covid-19, although there are many experimental candidates. But the cornerstone of the prime minister's care will depend on getting enough oxygen into his body and supporting his other organs while his immune system fights the virus. Among those who have sent messages to Mr Johnson was Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who described it as ""terribly sad news"". ""All the country's thoughts are with the prime minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time,"" he added. Meanwhile, Russia's Vladimir Putin wished Mr Johnson a speedy recovery, saying he was ""convinced that your energy, optimism and sense of humour will help you overcome the disease"". US President Donald Trump said Americans ""are all praying for his recovery"", describing Mr Johnson as ""a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation"" who is ""strong"" and ""doesn't give up"". This video can not be played Trump asks drug companies to assist PM's recovery Chancellor Rishi Sunak said his thoughts were with the prime minister and his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, and that Mr Johnson would ""come out of this even stronger"". On Saturday, Ms Symonds said she had spent a week in bed with the main symptoms. She said she had not been tested for the virus. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid she was ""sending [Mr Johnson] every good wish"",while Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster added she was ""praying for a full and speedy recovery"". Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford called it ""concerning news"". When do people go to hospital with coronavirus?

YouTube tightens Covid-19 rules after Icke interviewVideos will now be deleted if they falsely link coronavirus to 5G mobile networks.,"A lengthy interview with David Icke was live-streamed on YouTube on Monday YouTube has banned all conspiracy theory videos falsely linking coronavirus symptoms to 5G networks. The Google-owned service will now delete videos violating the policy. It had previously limited itself to reducing the frequency it recommended them in its Up Next section. The move follows a live-streamed interview with conspiracy theorist David Icke on Monday, in which he had linked the technology to the pandemic. YouTube said the video would be wiped. During the interview, Mr Icke falsely claimed there ""is a link between 5G and this health crisis"". And when asked for his reaction to reports of 5G masts being set on fire in England and Northern Ireland, he responded: ""If 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it, human life as we know it is over... so people have to make a decision."" Several users subsequently called for further attacks on 5G towers in the comments that appeared alongside the feed. Mr Icke also claimed that a coronavirus vaccine, when one is developed, would include ""nanotechnology microchips"" that would allow humans to be controlled. He added that Bill Gates - who is helping fund Covid-19 vaccine research - should be jailed. His views went unchallenged for much of the two-and-a-half-hour show. The interview was watched by about 65,000 people as it was streamed, some of whom clicked an on-screen button to trigger payments to make their live chat reactions stand out. YouTube only deleted the content after the session had ended, despite being aware of the broadcast while it was ongoing. It changed its rules after the BBC questioned why the video was permitted. ""We have clear policies that prohibit videos promoting medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment, and we quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged to us,"" a spokeswoman for YouTube told the BBC. ""Now any content that disputes the existence or transmission of Covid-19, as described by the WHO [World Health Organization] and local health authorities is in violation of YouTube policies. ""This includes conspiracy theories which claim that the symptoms are caused by 5G. ""For borderline content that could misinform users in harmful ways, we reduce recommendations. We'll continue to evaluate the impact of these videos on communities around the world."" Users who repeatedly break the rules now face being prevented from being able to use YouTube's Live tool. The firm may also prevent repeat offenders from earning money, and said it would terminate channels as a last resort. Coronavirus: Scientists brand 5G claims 'complete rubbish' Tech firms summoned over 'crackpot' 5G conspiracies Mast fire probe amid 5G coronavirus claims In this case, YouTube is allowing the interview's host to keep earnings generated via the Super Chats tool while the video was still online. But it is giving its own cut of the proceeds to charity, and has put the channel involved under review. YouTube's rules update coincides with new restrictionson WhatsApp,external. WhatsApp is taking action to slow the spread of misinformation on its network Facebook's app is limiting users to only being able to forward a message to one chat at a time if the same post has already been shared five or more times by the wider community. Such posts are labelled with double arrows to make their status known. Previously, the app had limited such messages to being forwarded to five different chats at once - a limit it had first introduced in 2018 to combat the spread of disinformation in India. ""We've recently seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding, which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation,"" it said, explaining the latest move. ""We believe it's important to slow the spread of these messages down to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation."" Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Fact-checking charity Full Facthas linked the claims to two flawed theories,external. Vodafone and Three have reported attacks on their telecoms equipment over recent days One falsely suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other falsely claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still ""non-ionising"", meaning it lacks enough energy tobreak apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage. Earlier this year, scientists at the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protectioncompleted a major study of related research into the topic. While it recommended slightly tighter limits on the transmitting capabilities of handsets themselves to minimise any chance of damage caused by human tissue being heated, its key finding was that there was no evidence that either 5G networks or earlier systems could cause cancer or other kinds of illness. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea andwell outside mainstream scientific thought,external. In any case, Covid-19 is a virus rather than a bacteria. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology.

As it happened: Monday's coronavirus updates in WalesRead back through the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Wales.Wales,"First Minister Mark Drakeford and opposition party leaders say their thoughts are with Boris Johnson and his family following the ""concerning news"" that the prime minister is in intensive care Another 27 deaths in Wales linked to coronavirus were confirmed on Monday, taking the total to 193 There are now 3,499 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Wales, an increase of 302 An intensive care consultant in Newport says she has never seen so many sick young patients Nicola Bryan, David Dulin and Ben Frampton That wraps up today's live coverage of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Gavin and Stacey star Rob Brydon is backing a scheme that offers support vulnerable residents who have been told to self-isolate but donât have any family, friends or neighbours to call on for help. Neath Port Talbot council's Safe and Well scheme makes arrangements for a trusted volunteer to help with daily living tasks such as food shopping, collecting medical supplies, posting mail and any other reasonable tasks. From tomorrow, the law about staying two metres apart will extend to all workplaces. The new rules apply to those workplaces not already covered by the original stay-at-home rules introduced almost two weeks ago. Guidance will be issued to explain what can reasonably be expected of employers and businesses. A consultant has described the reality of treating coronavirus patients in one of the worst-hit areas of Wales. Dr Ami Jones is looking after 13 patients on ventilatorsat Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, which is double the usual number. ""If we have to get to that 10 times capacity surge, we're going to be absolutely at the limit,"" she said. The Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart has sent his ""warmest wishes to the prime minister
and, of course, Carrie, for whom this must be an especially worrying time."" Boris Johnson has been moved to intensive care in hospital after his coronavirus symptoms ""worsened"", Downing Street has said. His pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds has been self-isolating after suffering coronavirus symptoms. In February they announced they were engaged and are expecting a baby in early summer. Mr Hart added: ""The
Boris we all know is a fighter and a winner. He will tackle this setback as he
does every other challenge in life, and I wish him well for a full and speedy
recovery.â Little Mollie drew this rainbow for her dad and his colleagues at North Wales Police. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jeff Lavington was in hospital recovering from a stroke The son of an
81-year-old man who died after contracting coronavirus in hospital has blamed
his father's death on a lack of testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline
NHS staff. Jeff Lavington, from Carmarthen, caught the virus while recovering from a stroke at the town's Glangwili General Hospital. His son Mark Lavington said the staff
caring for him did an ""amazing job"", but claimed some of those
treating him were protected only by disposable gloves, disposable polythene
aprons, and surgical masks. He said: ""From talking to two members of staff on the ward, I gather that one of the members of staff had been exhibiting symptoms."" Mandy Rayani, director of nursing, quality and patient experience for Hywel Dda University
Health Board, said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family at this
time and our door is open should they wish to discuss any matters about the
care of their loved one. ""Our staff
working in our hospitals and communities are working tremendously hard and
adjusting environments and pathways of care during these extraordinary times,
in line with expert guidance and in order to keep our patients as safe as
possible. ""Our staff
have been issued with personal protective equipment and are using this in line
with guidance and we have been testing frontline NHS staff in Wales for several
weeks."" Jeff Lavington died at Glangwili General Hospital in Carmarthen Farmers are being forced to dump milk because of a collapse
in the market. Llyr Griffiths, a farmer in Llangoedmor, near Cardigan, had to dump his milk after his processor, which supplies coffee shops and cruises, lost the majority of its milk sales because of the Covid-19
pandemic. He said: ""It was heartbreaking. I had to dump Â£3,000-worth of milk
in half an hour, while supermarkets apparently have empty shelves... ""Getting rid of the milk in front of my four-year-old boy was
difficult."" More than Â£3,000 worth of milk was dumped in half an hour There could be rising tensions in family homes during the coronavirus pandemic, a researcher into relationships has said. Prof Jacqui Gabb from the Open University said people typically spend two-and-a-half hours together each day, but this has rocketed to 15 or 16 hours per day since lockdown began. ""All the ingredients"" for additional stresses on relationships are there, she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"NHS volunteers to start receiving tasksMore than 750,000 people signed up to join the ""volunteer army"" to support 2.5 million at-risk people.UK","People who volunteered to support the NHS in England during the coronavirus crisis are being given details of what tasks they can do to help. More than 750,000 people signed up to join the ""volunteer army"" - three times the government's original target - to help relieve pressure on the NHS. They will support 2.5 million people who are considered at risk. The volunteers may have to deliver food and medicines, drive patients to appointments and phone the isolated. The process is being managedthrough a mobile app called GoodSam,,externalwhere health professionals, pharmacists, and local authorities can upload requests for help from Tuesday. Thousands of approved volunteers can then pick which tasks they want to complete in their local area. Volunteers switch their app to ""on duty"" to show when they are available. Due to the huge response, the group of vulnerable people they will support in England was expanded from 1.5 million to 2.5 million. The government scheme initially had a target of recruiting 250,000 helpers. Recruitment was temporarily paused on 29 March to process the initial applications. The Royal Voluntary Service, the charity helping co-ordinate the scheme, will have completed checks on the applications by the end of Tuesday. Teacher Stacey Walsh is one of thousands who wants to volunteer One of the thousands to sign up was Stacey Walsh, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, who is still teaching but wants to volunteer in her spare time. She told BBC Breakfast: ""I've said I'll do whatever's needed. I'm a very social person so being able to provide people who are isolated with support over the telephone - that's something that I really am looking forward to. ""It's really important as public sector workers we stand alongside the NHS. There is a unity between us so I'm really happy that I can help."" Two days ago, Edward Butler-Ellis didn't expect to find himself outside the home of an elderly woman in London, talking about her pharmacy collection in Portuguese using Google Translate. She was one of several vulnerable people he has run errands for as part of the NHS coronavirus volunteering scheme over the past day. Edward told the BBC it was ""clear that there was a bit of a language barrier"" from the moment he first spoke to her on the phone. But rather than passing the call on to another volunteer, he turned to technology to help. ""I had to give her a quick lesson on the doorstep,"" he laughed. ""I [didn't] want to take the risk that it [would take] another 10 volunteers to find somebody who speaks Portuguese."" Edward runs his own planning and communications firm, and, when work began to dry up as a result of the outbreak, he decided he could fill his spare time with volunteering. He said it has made him realise how many vulnerable people live in the capital. ""A lady that I went to see yesterday she felt guilty for having to phone up to get somebody else's support,"" he said. ""I wanted to provide her with some reassurance that people did genuinely want to help."" The experience left him ""emotional"". ""It did make me realise that there are people who are genuinely living in fear of their lives - she was frightened to go outside, and she was quite frustrated that some people were still out and about enjoying themselves as if it were some sort of extended holiday,"" he said. Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of the Royal Voluntary Service, said it had been ""a mammoth effort"" to get the scheme up and running but it was now ""open for business"". She said: ""It's determined grit that has got us through 750,000 volunteers. To authenticate those under normal circumstances would take months, but we don't have months. We want to shield the most at-risk patients now."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Petrol prices head towards Â£1 in the UKAn oil price war and Covid-19 travel restrictions are cutting fuel costs but it is not good news for everyone.,"Motorists will have noticed that the price of petrol and diesel has been creeping up in recent weeks. These rising costs may pile further pressure on families whose budgets are already being squeezed. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year. Recent data from 13 August puts petrol at an average of 149.1p per litre on UK forecourts. In just two weeks, it has shot up by more than 4p and it marks the highest price seen since February. Diesel stands at an average of 150.6p per litre - a level not seen since late May. Although it now costs about Â£82 to fill up a 55-litre family car, prices have fallen back from the record highs seen last summer, which were sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on road fuel prices, said that this recent surge would, however, ""lump pressure back on diesel users, particularly on small businesses"". Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from. They are also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound would mean that fuel gets more expensive. Oil prices have risen in recent weeks as producers have tried to restrict output. Oil rich nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that form part of a group called Opec+ have cut back production. They are grappling with slow demand as economies around the world struggle with high prices and the adjustment after the Covid pandemic. The West has accused Opec of manipulating prices. As the biggest exporter and the leader of the pack, Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to stay elevated to make sure it has a steady stream of income while it tries to diversify its economy. What is Opec and what is happening to oil prices? Livia Gallarati, an oil markets analyst at Energy Aspects, said that prices could grind higher still because of supplies being dented. She suggested Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, could even move above $90 (Â£71) per barrel. Supplies have also been affected by recent outages at oil refineries across the United States and Asia. Oil prices jumped following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Brent crude hitting more than $120 a barrel in June 2022. Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that wasbefore punishing sanctions were imposed by the West. After peaking in summer last year, oil prices fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in March this year amid concerns over weak demand. Experts have said that motorists shouldn't expect petrol prices to go up much more unless garages and supermarkets decide to take a bigger cut - or margin - per litre sold. The price of diesel, however, might rise in the autumn and winter because large parts of Europe rely on it for their heating. Retailers said in July that they will to workwith the UK's competition watchdog to set up a scheme to allow motorists to compare live fuel prices online. It came after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that weak competition meant that the average annual supermarket margins on fuel had increased by 6p per litre between 2019 and 2022 - equivalent to Â£900m in extra costs for drivers. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that despite the recent announcement, ""there is still far too much regional variation in prices, particularly among the big four supermarkets, which unfairly penalises drivers in some areas."" He urged drivers to shop around where they can in a bid to save cash. In March, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also announced that fuel duty - a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel - would be frozen for another year, having been cut by 5p the year before. It will cost the government more than Â£5bn and think tanks such as theInstitute for Government have suggested,externalit might sit awkwardly with its climate-related pledges. Watch your speed:The RAC says 45-50mph is the most efficient speed to drive for fuel efficiency Switch off the air conditioning: Extra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10%, according to the AA Check your tyre pressure:Underinflated tyres will use up extra petrol.

Short-form streaming app launches to rival Netflix,"The mobile-first streaming service Quibi launched in the US on Monday, despite concerns the coronavirus outbreak might impact its viewership. The company has raised $1.8bn (Â£1.47bn) for the project intended to rival Netflix and YouTube. Quibi's shows are 10 minutes or shorter and movies are broken into segments. It has lined up a host of Hollywood and showbiz stars including Idris Elba, Sophie Turner, Steven Spielberg, Chrissy Teigen and Jennifer Lopez. Viewers are meant to watch the shows on their mobile phones, and a feature called Turnstile allows the video to stay full screen in both portrait or landscape. Some shows even encourage viewers to turn the device mid-show to reveal a different angle to the scene. On social media, Quibi's launch was met with mixed reviews. Quibi videos have a feature that allows the picture to rotate if viewers turn their device. Some of its highly promoted shows - like Punk'd featuring Chance the Rapper and Survive starring Sophie Turner - received praise. But watching alone on your smartphone - a fundamental feature of the app - was criticised. Users complained they couldn't share what they were watching with housemates or partners. The service costs $4.99 a month with adverts and $7.99 for ad-free viewing, although Quibi is giving away a 90-day free trial in the US. The company had said it planned to roll out its services to other countries gradually, but on Monday the ad-free version app appeared to be available in the UK. Quibi's chief executive Meg Whitman and founder Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to stick with the 6 April debut in the US despite concerns the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns could impact its target audience.  Many analysts expected Quibi viewers to watch while commuting or during a break at work or school, but those activities are on hold for many during government lockdown periods. Quibi says its target audience is between 18-44 years old viewers already comfortable with short-form storytelling and streaming on their smartphones. by Zoe Thomas, BBC News Technology Reporter In several ways, I am exactly the audience Quibi is after. I'm not what you would call a ""binge watcher"" - I find it hard to sit still through multiple 30-minute episodes. But I do watch plenty of short videos on YouTube and social media throughout the day. Still, the coronavirus lockdown has given me a lot more time to stream TV and movies, so did I need a service with only sub-10-minute episodes? After several hours of perusing Quibi's content, I think the service is on to something. The shows are entertaining and the creators clearly thought about how the audience would view the screen.  The episodes are no more than 10 minutes long and none of them felt cut off or too short. There are downsides - my arm is tired from holding the phone up all day, you can only share content with other Quibi subscribers and you can't play it on your television if you happen to be at home. I began my Quibi viewing with the show Survive, starring former Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner. The drama was promoted at the top of the app and given the current state of the world - why not start with a drama about a young woman battling suicidal thoughts while struggling to survive on a frozen mountaintop after a plane crash? I was hooked pretty fast. Quibi demonstrated its technology in January I also immediately started to test out the Turnstile feature that changes perspective of the pictures when the screen is turned from vertical to horizontal. To my great delight the shifts from portrait to landscape were fairly seamless. In Survive the picture always re-centred to keep you locked in the emotion of the scene - and the scenes are very emotional. As I kept watching throughout the day, I found myself using the Turnstile feature more naturally. If I got up to get water or stretch my legs I would take the phone, turning it from horizontal to vertical rather than pausing the show. Yes, I did bump into some things and I can imagine in world of commuting and crowded walkways Quibi could be a hazard. This video can not be played WATCH: Quibi aims to change how we watch shows on phones Quibi has poured money into its scripted shows and non-scripted/reality shows. Judging from the comments on Twitter I wasn't alone in really enjoy Punk'd - a revival of the MTV prank show now starring Chance the Rapper. Not only did I find the show funny I really wanted to share it with my friends, but as none of them had signed up for Quibi yet they couldn't view the episodes. For me this felt like a drawback. If I saw something funny on YouTube or Tiktok I could send it to friends - not with Quibi. Another feature I really liked were the news episodes (surprise surprise). Quibi has teamed up with NBC, BBC, ESPN and others to make bespoke news packages for the app. I found the ones I watched to be informative, the right length and pretty engaging. But I can't see why any of these videos should be unique to Quibi. Turning them doesn't make much of a difference so I couldn't see why news outlets couldn't just publish these videos themselves. I began my Quibi journey thinking I didn't need anything else to make me more anti-social these days. While hosting a Netflix viewing party may give me a way to interact with my friends in real time, the quality content on Quibi leaves me thinking that when more people download it I'll have plenty to discuss with them.

A visual guide to the world in lockdown,"Coronavirus has now infected more than one million people worldwide, but its impact extends far beyond just those who have had it. Even the frequency of use of the word ""unprecedented"" is unprecedented at the moment. According to Google Trends it's been used three times more over the last two weeks than the highest point recorded previously. As governments around the world have enacted new measures and given official advice, we take a look at the impact that it's had on people and the world around them. The approaches to dealing with coronavirus across the world have been wide-rangingto say the least. In Colombia the days that you're allowed to leave the house depend on the number of your national ID card; in Serbia a designated dog-walking hour was introduced; and in Belarus the president has gone against medical advice, recommending vodka and saunas as a way to stay safe. Some of the more common approaches have seen governments issue recommendations on social distancing for part or all of the country, while others have acted to restrict all non-essential internal movement. The latter is often called a lockdown. When the virus was first identified in China in late 2019, lockdown seemed extreme. But as the outbreak has spread around the world, it has become more difficult to manage. More countries have opted to take the strictest measures possible to contain it. Well over 100 countries worldwide had instituted either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March 2020, affecting billions of people. And many others had recommended restricted movement for some or all of their citizens. In regions that have only recently confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, many countries appear to be learning from their Asian and European counterparts. Governments seem to be acting faster and more strictly in Africa as well. China has managed to ease its restrictions after passing through the worst period of climbing cases and deaths, but life is still far from normal. The rest of us may have a long way to go. When the virus first appeared, several countries brought in initial restrictions on flights from China, or required visitors from at-risk areas to be quarantined on arrival. After it had been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on 11 March, there were more all-encompassing measures. President Trump blocked all non-essential arrivals to the US from the European Union on 15 March, and a day later the EU did the same to all visitors from outside the Schengen free-travel zone. By the end of March, air traffic from some of the world's biggest airports had dropped to a fraction of what it was at the same time last year, or even what it was at the start of this month. The number of commercial flights last month was down by more than a quarter globally,according to flight tracking service Flightradar24,external. In the final week of March, as more and more countries introduced travel restrictions to try to contain the virus, traffic declined 63% from the same period last year. On 25 March, Heathrow - one of the busiest airports in the world serving about 80 million passengers per year - recorded more than 1,000 fewer flights compared with an equivalent day in 2019. It's not just getting from city to city. Travel within major cities across the globe has ground to a halt as restrictions on movement and social contact have come into force. As of 31 March, residents in cities like Madrid, Paris, London and New York were making fewer than one-tenth as many journeys using the app as they did normally, according to data from travel app Citymapper. In Milan in northern Italy, which has been locked down for several weeks now, only 3% of trips were being planned via the Citymapper mobile app, compared with before the outbreak. The data also suggests that people cut down on travel in the days leading up to government-enforced shutdowns. For example, the partial lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, came into place on 24 March but trips had already declined sharply the week before. Even in cities where authorities have issued recommendations on social distancing and refrained from imposing strict lockdowns, it appears that people are still restricting their travel. ln Stockholm, Sweden, where the government has avoided draconian measures, issuing guidelines rather than strict rules, the Citymapper data suggests planned trips - which can include both walking and public transport - fell by 70%. Stockholm's public transport company reported last week that passenger numbers on subway and commuter trains had halved. Movement is also below normal rates in some of the Asian cities that Citymapper collects data for, like Hong Kong and Singapore, which have not enforced the type of shutdowns seen elsewhere. The South Korean capital Seoul hasn't come to a standstill like European capitals, despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases - a sign of the country's decision to focus on widespread testing and contact tracing rather than social distancing. We see the same behaviour with people on the roads. Major cities around the world were already becoming steadily less busy before official lockdown measures came in, congestion data from location technology specialists TomTom shows. In Tokyo there hasn't been an official lockdown yet, but schools have been shut since the beginning of March. That, and a lack of tourists, could explain why traffic there has been marginally below last year's levels without the sharp downturn obvious elsewhere. In Jakarta, Indonesia, where there has also been no official lockdown, congestion has already dropped to almost zero - similar to Los Angeles and New Delhi which shut down on different dates. The congestion score in the graphic below is an indication of how much longer it would take to make a journey through the city compared with when there is no traffic at all. A rating of 50 means that a trip will take 50% more time than it would if the roads were completely free, for example, so a half-hour drive would become 45 minutes. The regular low points on the chart generally come at weekends. In China there are signs that things are beginning to get back to normal. Traffic levels are back to about half the 2019 level in Beijing and Shanghai but have been steadily growing since the beginning of February following extended Chinese New Year celebrations from 25 January. In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, traffic levels are still next to zero compared with last year. One of the few positive effects of the shutdown is that there seems to have been a drop in pollution in some parts of the world. Levels of NO2 in the atmosphere fluctuate widely with factors like wind speed, and satellites trying to measure these levels can be hampered by cloud cover. This may explain some of the variability seen over Wuhan and northern Italy between January and March 2019 in the maps below. But in these places, shutdowns have been stricter and in place for longer than elsewhere, and the change in NO2 levels between 2019 and the months of 2020 in which the shutdowns have been in effect appears to be significant. In the UK, and in many other places, the available satellite data does not yet show either way whether the ongoing reduction in economic activity is being accompanied by a corresponding fall in emissions, althoughsome other sourcessuggest that it is. As countries have shut down, many workers have had to try to continue their office jobs from home. That means video calls and instant messaging have become invaluable workroom tools. The average number of messages sent by users in New York, Paris, London and Berlin has increased by more than a third in just a few weeks. Not everyone has got used to their new ways of working just yet. But - depending on where you are - there could be a good deal of time left to do so.

"Don't bail out airlines, say climate campaigners","More than 250 trades unions and environment groups have signed an open letter opposing plans for bailing out the aviation industry. The letter to governments demands that any bailouts lead to better labour conditions and a cut in emissions. They say aviation should make changes already evident in other sectors amid the coronavirus lockdown. Thanks to a long-standing treaty, international aviation has largely been able to make its own rules. The campaigners say this must change now that firms are asking for new favours from governments Their informal group is called âStay Groundedâ. Its spokesperson Magdalena Heuwieser said: âFor decades the aviation industry has avoided contributing meaningfully to global climate goals and resisted the merest suggestion of taxes on fuel or tickets. âNow, airlines, airports and manufacturers are demanding huge and unconditional taxpayer-backed bailouts. We cannot let the aviation industry get away with privatising profits in the good times, and expect the public to pay for its losses in the bad times.â The aviation association IATA has conducted what it calls an âaggressive,externalâ global campaign aimed at persuading governments to introduce measures softening the effect of the virus emergency. Itâs asking for the immediate reduction of all charges and taxes; deferral of any planned increases in charges and taxes for 6-12 months; and the creation of funds to help airlines restart or maintain routes. It says without such measures, many airlines will go bankrupt â leading to the loss of routes and damage to the economy, as well as thousands of job losses. Several nations have agreed to some of the industry's demands but in the UK the Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told airlines to look to its own shareholders to keep them running. UK airports, meanwhile, are asking ministers to grant them a suspension of Air Passenger Duty and other measures when the crisis is over. Stay Grounded has a very different recipe for a successful outcome at the end of the crisis. It wants a focus on protecting workers not shareholders; making aviation firms contribute to emissions reductions by cutting air travel demand and strengthening low-carbon alternatives like rail travel; while imposing a kerosene tax and progressive levies on frequent flying. Pablo MuÃ±oz from the Spanish organisation Ecologistas en AcciÃ³n, said: âWhile we are rightly focused on saving lives during the immediate health threat of, our governments have a choice: they can hand taxpayersâ money to corporations unconditionally, or they can seize the opportunity to start building an economy which doesnât harm people or the planetâ. This touches on a much deeper debate about the nature of the post-Covid recovery. Thereâs a gulf between people who want to use the crisis for a green stimulus to the economy, whilst others warn that so much money will have been spent conquering the virus that there will be little left for clean energy investment. IATA has been approached for a comment.

Profile: Dominic Raab,"Dominic Raab has resigned as deputy prime minister, following an investigation into claims of alleged bullying. Mr Raab, who was also the justice secretary, had always denied the allegations but said he would quit if bullying claims were upheld. He has done that, but in his resignation letter to Rishi Sunak, and in an article penned for the Telegraph newspaper, Mr Raabalso hit back. While the report from senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC makes uncomfortable reading in parts, Mr Raab - who's changed his Twitter handle to ""MP for Esher and Walton, father of two, boxing fan"" - has thrown a punch of his own. In his letter to the PM, he said ministers needed to be able to give direct critical feedback and exercise direct oversight over their civil servant officials. He apologised for any ""unintended"" stress caused, but referred to the ""pace, standards and challenge"" he brought to the Ministry of Justice. The report cleared the former frontbencher of shouting and swearing at staff, and he was not found to have used physical gestures - but it did say that style of working as a minister was ""inquisitorial, direct, impatient and fastidious"". And it paints a picture of a man who worked from 7.30 in the morning until late at night and at weekends. Mr Raab was found to have described the work of officials as ""utterly useless"" and ""woeful"" while he was justice secretary. And as foreign secretary, a role he served in from 2019 to 2021, the report says in one instance ""he acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. His conduct also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates."" Date of birth:25 February 1974 (age 49) Job:Justice secretary, deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton Education:Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities Family:Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive, with two sons Before politics:Foreign Office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague Despite resigning, Mr Raab is entitled to a pay-off of nearly Â£17,000, a quarter of his ministerial salary, as long as he is not reappointed to another position within three weeks. But the MP, who paid his own legal fees during the investigation, faces a pay cut of Â£67,505 as he loses his ministerial salary. As an ordinary backbencher, he will earn Â£86,584 a year. Mr Raab was born in 1974, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938. He was brought up in Buckinghamshire and attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, before studying law at Oxford University and switching to Cambridge for his masters degree. He worked as a lawyer in the commercial sector and the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide to Brexit-supporting Conservative MP David Davis, and then Remain-backing Dominic Grieve. Raab under fire over Dover-Calais comment Raab 'confident' PM will recover from coronavirus Raab ex-colleagues speak as bullying probe nears end First elected to Parliament in 2010, the following year Mr Raab angered then-Home Secretary Theresa May by describing some feminists as ""obnoxious bigots"" in an online article also claiming men were getting ""a raw deal"". Mrs May accused him of fuelling ""gender warfare"". Mr Raab remained on the backbenches for five years after becoming an MP. But the karate black-belt became a junior justice minister following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015. He played a prominent role in the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over as prime minister. In 2017, Mr Raab was branded ""offensive"" by then-Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying ""the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty; it's someone who has a cash flow problem"". But in June that year he returned to government, as a justice minister, this time middle-ranking rather than junior. In Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle he became housing minister - one of the highest-profile non-cabinet roles in government. And in July that year, when David Davis quit, the prime minister promoted Mr Raab to Brexit secretary, a cabinet post. Yet his improved relationship with Mrs May did not last long. In November 2018, he quit, arguing that he could not ""in good conscience"" support the ""backstop"" arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. As an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected. After Mrs May announced she was standing down, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister. In a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs' votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him. Mr Johnson,to whom Mr Raab gave his supportafter his elimination from the race, promoted him to foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister. But he only narrowly managed to hold on to his Esher and Walton seat at the 2019 general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenge by 2,743 votes. The overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to ""get Brexit done"", meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January 2020. As foreign secretary and first secretary of state, he was the UK government's de-facto second-in-command. He was left in charge of running much of the government when the prime minister was hospitalised with Covid-19 in April 2020. Colleagues, including Mr Johnson's arch-critic and former aide Dominic Cummings, have praised Mr Raab's performance under extreme pressure. But he has continued to anger opponents with some of his comments, in 2020 telling talkRadio's Julia Hartley-Brewer he would only ""take the knee"" - go down on bended knee - for ""the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me"". He later qualified his remarks - following opposition criticism of his ""insulting"" and ""flippant"" tone - saying he ""fully"" supported the Black Lives Matter campaign. In fact, some of his remarks and gaffes have resulted in mockery. Despite a reputation for being a creature of habit, he dismissed an eye-catchingclaim by a former diary secretary that he insisted on the same Pret A Manger lunch every day. And as Brexit secretary, he came under fire for saying he""hadn't quite understood"" how reliant UK trade in goods was on the Dover-Calais crossing. As foreign secretary, Mr Raab was heavily criticised for his handling of the aftermath of the fall of Afghanistan, specifically for remaining on holiday in Crete while the Taliban marched back to power. He insisted he'd been across the detail and was in touch with the key players. Downing Street stood by the minister, however he was later demoted to the role of justice secretary, which although still a cabinet position is not as prestigious as foreign secretary. Mr Raab stayed publicly loyal to Mr Johnson, being one of the few ministers not to resign during the final chaotic week of his premiership. This video can not be played The deputy party leaders swap exchanges on bullying claims against him and her previous labelling for her opponents. In the leadership race that followed, he enthusiastically threw his backing behind Rishi Sunak - and in August fiercely attacked the rival candidate Liz Truss, calling her economic plans ""electoral suicide"". That broadside wasn't forgotten by Ms Truss's team and Mr Raab was not included in her cabinet when she became prime minister. However, Ms Truss was soon gone and Mr Raab returned to government in the familiar roles of justice secretary and deputy prime minister. As Mr Sunak's deputy, he stood in for his boss at Prime Minister's Question opposite Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy. Their exchanges across the despatch box were often fiery. As well as a big drop in salary, Mr Raab also loses the status of his position at the very top of government. Whether he will return to high office remains to be seen.

Town halls consider council tax payment help,"Annual bills are usually paid in 10 instalments over 12 months Vulnerable people and those most affected by the coronavirus outbreak are being offered help to pay their council tax. Support ranges from deferred payments to discounts for those on low incomes. A petition on the Parliament website calling for council tax to be scrapped during the duration of the crisis has attracted almost 100,000 signatures. Blanket deferrals or non-payment would reduce cash for the frontline response to the crisis, larger councils said. The County Councils Network, which represents 36 of England's county-level local authorities, said it ""recognised and understood the motivation behind these schemes...for the most vulnerable and those in the greatest need"". ""However, a blanket deferral or non-payment scheme offered across the board could create significant additional financial challenges for local government, reducing cashflow for vital services such as social care which are at the frontline in responding to coronavirus"", the network's chairman, Councillor David Williams, said. Annual bills are usually paid in 10 instalments over 12 months, from April to January. Under plans being drawn up by some town halls, residents will be able to defer their first payment until July. Councils offering a deferred payment include Manchester, Oldham, Stockport, Rochdale, Tameside, Trafford, Swindon and Wiltshire. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Not all councils are prepared to offer a deferred payment. Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said it was important to maintain Bristol City Council's finances during the crisis. He said the authority was the only one out of the UK's core cities to retain a 100% council tax reduction scheme. Most large councilswere already due to raise their bills by the full amountallowed before the pandemic struck. Some councils said they would make use of a Â£500m hardship fundgiven by government to local authoritiesin England to help vulnerable people in their areas. Leeds and Worcester city councils said those already in receipt of working age council tax support can receive a one-off reduction of up to Â£150 this year. Chelmsford City Council said if people were unable to pay council tax due on 8 April, they should contact banks directly to stop the payment. Councillor Stephen Robinson, its leader, said: ""It is not possible to apply a deferral across the board. ""The vast majority of council tax is used to pay police officers and staff, firefighters, care home workers, home care providers, education support workers, and other staff who keep us all safe. ""Applying relief across the board would make it impossible to keep public services going."" Councillor Richard Watts, from the Local Government Association, said: ""We are pleased that councils will now be able to provide much-needed support to many households on the lowest incomes by quickly reducing or removing the need for them to pay council tax.""

Calls for debt relief for world's poorest nations,"More than 100 global organisations are calling for debt payments of developing countries to be dropped this year. These countries include the world's poorest economies which are struggling with the impacts of coronavirus. Major charities including Oxfam and ActionAid International are asking for the debt relief, which would free up more than $25bn (Â£20bn) this year. They have written to world leaders and major central banks calling for a range of debt relief measures. The call is being spearheaded by UK-based charity Jubilee Debt Campaign and comes a day before a meeting of the G20 group of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies. World Bank - BBC News Coronavirus- Millions will be left in poverty, World Bank warns - BBC News IMF provides $50bn to fight coronavirus outbreak - BBC News ""Developing countries are being hit by an unprecedented economic shock, and at the same time face an urgent health emergency,"" said Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign. ""The suspension on debt payments called for by the IMF and World Bank saves money now, but kicks the can down the road and avoids actually dealing with the problem of spiralling debts."" The campaigners want debt payments to be cancelled with immediate effect, including payments to private creditors. ""This is the fastest way to keep money in countries to use in responding to Covid-19, and to ensure public money is not wasted bailing out the profits of rich private speculators,"" added Ms Clifton. Live: China reports no new virus deaths for first time Calculations from non-profit network Eurodad show that 69 of the world's poorest countries are due to pay $19.5bn to other governments and multilateral institutions, and $6bn to external private lenders this year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has made $50bn available in emergency financing while the World Bank has approved a $14bn response package to the most vulnerable economies. The IMF wants to target the money at countries with weak health systems to help them respond to the epidemic. Meanwhile, the World Bank's funding is aimed at both supporting the health and financial impact of the virus. These will include low-cost loans, grants and technical assistance. During the coronavirus pandemic, campaigners want debt relief to be applied for all countries in need, and most urgently for the poorest countries. Looking more long-term, they want a process to reduce debts to a sustainable level after the crisis. This involves asking the IMF to introduce clear guidelines on when a debt is unsustainable, and follow its policy only to lend to countries with unsustainable debts if there is a default or debt restructuring plan in place. In a blog on Monday, the IMF said the pandemic had pushed the world into a recession. ""For 2020 it will be worse than the global financial crisis. The economic damage is mounting across all countries, tracking the sharp rise in new infections and containment measures put in place by governments"".

Updates as UK's Johnson in intensive care,"UK PM Boris Johnson is moved to intensive care in a London hospital He has been suffering from coronavirus symptoms for 10 days, went to hospital on Sunday Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise in his absence Donald Trump joins other world leaders in wishing Johnson a speedy recovery The US records 1,150 new deaths with coronavirus in 24 hours More than 1.3 million cases have now been confirmed worldwide with nearly 75,000 deaths New infections have fallen in Spain and Italy in recent days - suggesting lockdowns are working In Asia, Japan is braced for a lockdown due to be announced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today Andreas Illmer, Yvette Tan, Anna Jones, Ashitha Nagesh, Helier Cheung, Jennifer Scott, Vicky Baker, Thom Poole, Georgina Rannard and Alix Kroeger We're closing this page now, after another day of dramatic developments, including the UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson being taken into intensive care. He was diagnosed with coronavirus more than a week ago, but as many patients are finding, his condition deteriorated rapidly. We'll bring you the latest on that as we get it. But our new coverage is up and running -you can follow it here. New Zealand has recorded 54 new virus cases - the lowest number the country has seen in two weeks. Earlier Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country appeared ""at this early stage to be on track"". New Zealand is currently in a state of emergency and a lockdown has been in place for almost two weeks. All schools and non-essential services have been closed and five million people told not to leave their house unless necessary. People have also been called to stick to their ""bubble"" - your family or the group of people that you live with. ""Whatever your bubble is for the month, this is the bubble that you must maintain,"" said Ardern. There are currently 1,160 confirmed cases in New Zealand, with one death. This video can not be played We're all having to find new ways to fill our time during lockdown. With no customers, Michael Purchase, a Nottinghamshire pub manager in the UK, found a way to serve himself a pint of ""rail ale"" at his bar. Take a watch. The lockdown of Luzon, the most populous island in the Philippines, has been extended to 30 April. The measures had been due to end next week. The Philippines was one of the first countries to adopt strict home quarantine measures. Rules restricting movement and gatherings have been in place in and around the capital, Manila, for nearly a month now since the confirmation of the first domestic transmission. There have been 3,660 positive tests and 163 deaths in the Philippines. But like many countries in the region, there have been very few tests carried out, so the actual number of infections is thought to be much higher. Donald Trump has said the US would ""retaliate"" if India turned down his request to release stocks of a drug that he has called a ""game-changer"" in the fight against Covid-19. Mr Trump called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, a day after the country banned the export of hydroxychloroquine, which it manufactures in large quantities. ""I said we'd appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesnât allow it to come out, that would be okay, but of course there may be retaliation,"" he said during a White House briefing on Monday. India is reportedly still ""considering"" the request. Hydroxychloroquine is very similar to Chloroquine, one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs. But is India really in a position to help the US? And does the drug even work against the coronavirus?

David Clark admitted the 12-mile (20km) drive was ""a clear breach of the lockdown principles"". He offered his resignation to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but kept his job because of the ongoing crisis. Clark admitted the trip to Ardern after being criticised for another breach of the rules. Last week, he drove a shorter distance to a mountain bike trail - and his van, featuring a picture of himself on the side, wasphotographed at the trail.,external With British PM Boris Johnson in intensive care, what does this mean for the UK government and the country as a whole? The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg breaks it down for us here: This video can not be played Coronavirus and Boris Johnson: 'Terrible time to be without a figurehead' Sweden's government has asked parliament to give it additional powers - which could be an indicator it's heading towards tighter measures or even a lockdown after all. Sweden so far has taken a markedly different approach - that is it did not enforce any tough measures like the rest of Europe has. Instead, the  government has called for people to simply be responsible and follow social distancing guidelines. But shops, restaurants and businesses remain open. Visits to elderly homes are no longer allowed, though. So far, there are 7,206 confirmed infections and 477 deaths in Sweden. While those numbers might seem low compared to the UK, Germany, Spain or Italy, do keep in mind that there are only about 10 million people living in Sweden. The major news out of the UK overnight has been that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened. Mr Johnson, who is the most prominent victim yet of the pandemic, is in St Thomas' Hospital in London. We've been told he was moved to intensive care in case he needs ventilation - help to breathe. A statement by Downing Street said he was receiving ""excellent care"". We've not received any further news as to his condition as yet. Farmers in Australia are using billboards to reassure people that there will be no shortage of food during the coronavirus outbreak. The National Farmers Federation is running street adverts in Melbourne that read: ""Donât panic. Weâre experts at working from home."" It comes as grocery stores see waves of panic buying by shoppers worried about food supplies. ""Farmers want all Australians to know that running out of food is one thing they donât need to be worrying about in these challenging times,"" the organisation's president Fiona Simson said in a statement. South Korea has reported fewer than 50 new cases for the second day in a row. It reported 47 new cases - of which 17 were overseas arrivals - on Monday, according to news site Yonhap News, which added that there are now 10,331 cases in the country. South Korea's approach to getting the virus under control has been praised by many. It's basically been down to two things - testing and tracing. It was quick to implement digital contact tracing and also carried out testing on a mass scale, with tens of thousands of people being tested every day. Belgium uses its well-loved food and drink to encourage people to keep their distance Until a few weeks ago, social distancing was an alien idea to most of us. Now, as we learn to navigate this new world, different countries and cultures are figuring out how to best explain new public health measures. Belgians should be keeping apart the same distance as 22 bottles of Orval beer, 10 cones of chips, or three crates of beer. (Presumably those supplies are useful for self-isolation, too.) While in Kenya, one graphic explains that the length of a lion is the correct distance to keep from others. But please don't use actual lions, it warns. A graphic in Kenya encourages people to stay the distance of one lion away from others And in Mexico, superhero Susana Distancia was launched by the government to encourage people to keep their distance and stay at home. Her name is a play on words that translate as ""your healthy distance"". Susana Distancia's superpower is extending her arms 1.5m to create a bubble protecting herself and others from infection Meanwhile in Egypt, a very catchy song with old footage of famous actor Adel Imam is being broadcast on television and even in the streets. ""Don't kiss, don't shake hands, don't transmit the virus,"" it sings. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There are growing concerns over the situation in Indonesia. The country has registered around 2,500 infections and 209 deaths with a confirmed Covid-19 link. But with very low levels of testing, Indonesia's Doctor's Association warnsthe situation could be far worse than the official statistics are suggesting. The news on Monday that 24 doctors are among the dead seemed to confirm the criticism that the health system is woefully unprepared. That picture above actually shows medical staff wearing raincoats instead of proper protective gear. In Jakarta, there's now a special police unit to guard the burials of Covid-19 victims because of fears that worried residents will block funerals. In several cities, angry citizens have already tried to block ambulances from bringing victims to the local cemetery. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Canadian hospitals near the US border in Michigan are asking staff to pick a
side and stay there. Some 1,600 healthcare workers from Windsor-Essex county in Canada travel over the border each day, the county's health authorities say. Windsor Regional Hospital has asked staff members who work in nearby
Detroit to choose a side. More than half chose to remain. The hospital's CEO David Musyj told the BBC he does not want to
stop workers from working in Detroit but he is concerned it is not safe for them to work both sides of the border during the pandemic. He worries that if these steps aren't taken, officials may close the border entirely, which would ""devastate"" Detroit's supply of healthcare workers. ""Our local public health leaders can and should put into place rigid screening mechanisms and self isolation mechanisms for these individuals if and when they come home to Windsor.""  Frances MaoSydney Weâre living in a weird time. However it plays out,
thereâs no doubt this coronavirus pandemic will be remembered as a
seismic world event. Whether youâre writing down notes in a diary, or sharing pictures
of your isolation routine on social media - youâre recording history. And the National Museum of Australia wants those everyday
observations. Itâs calling on all Australians to send in their stories toan official Facebook group,external, to help document the major moment weâre all
living through. Just scrolling through some of the personal entries is illuminating â and comforting. Itâs nice to read about other peopleâs experiences, particularly as we remain physically apart from one another. It can be a tricky time for you, if you're living with someone who has the virus. What's the best way to take care of them, and how can you stay safe yourself? The BBC's Laura Foster shares some tips. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How do you care for someone at home? China has reported 32 new confirmed virus cases - all of which were imported - but crucially no new deaths in the past day. According to news agency AFP, this is the first time China's National Health Commission has reported no new deaths since it started publishing its figures in January. There have been 81,740 confirmed cases nationally, and more than 3,300 deaths. Peter HoskinsBusiness reporter, BBC News Singapore Asian stock markets made gains on Tuesday after shares rallied in the US on signs of a slowdown in coronavirus-related deaths. Wall Street investors were encouraged by the slowing death toll from the virus across major European nations, including France and Italy. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all gained more than 7%. Oil prices also stabilised as traders wait for a potential agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut crude production as lockdown measures hammer demand for energy. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was 2.7% higher, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 0.8%, while China's Shanghai Composite was 1.5% higher. In early Asian trade Brent crude oil was 2.4% higher.  Late on Monday in the UK it was announced that Tony Lloyd, Labour MP for Rochdale, has been admitted to hospital with coronavirus. The 70-year-old was ""stable and responding to treatment"" at Manchester Royal Infirmary, his family said. In a statement, his family paid tribute to the ""brilliant doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff at the hospital."" The new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer wished him a ""swift recovery"".

Travel is shut down in Israel ahead of the Jewish Passover holiday Ashitha Nagesh, Max Matza, Joshua Cheetham and Jude Sheerin This concludes our Tuesday live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. The US is still the hardest-hit country, with Illinois and New York both recording their deadliest days so far. The virus is continuing to spread to smaller US cities, but officials in some states say the curve appears to be ""flattening"". New York has said their rate of new infections may be more of a ""plateau"". Black Americans have been dying in disproportionate numbers, with inequalities in healthcare access and higher rates of chronic illness cited among causes. We'll be back with more coverage on Wednesday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been ribbed on social media after he dropped the adverb ""moistly"" into a live TV address.

Voters queued for up to two hours to vote in parts of Wisconsin Trump said Democrats only asked to delay the Wisconsin election, ""fifteen minutes"" after he made his endorsement. He said this was the reason for the attempts to delay, and not ""safety"" concerns, as Democrats said. He called postal ballots - which were curtailed by the Supreme Court - ""corrupt"", adding that ""they're forgeries in many cases"". Wisconsin held in-person voting on Tuesday after Republicans blocked Democratic attempts to delay the election until June. After most polling sites closed, bottlenecks formed at remaining polling stations, and long queues of voters formed. Wisconsin has reported 2,578 cases and 94 deaths, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Voting took place despite orders to stay-at-home due to coronavirus. When asked if he will be responsible for any voters falling sick, Trump responds: ""Look all I did was endorse a candidate. I don't know anything about any lines."" A doctor who specialised in treating the elderly has died after testing positive for Covid-19. Dr Anton Sebastianpillai died after being admitted to Kingston Hospital in south-west London, the same hospital he worked at. It is believed he came out of retirement to help the NHS. ""It is with great sadness that I confirm the death of a consultant geriatrician who was part of the team at Kingston Hospital,"" a spokeswoman for Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said. ""Dr Anton Sebastianpillai died on Saturday having been cared for in the hospital's intensive care unit since 31 March. ""We would like to extend our sincere condolences to his family."" Read more about Dr Sebastianpillai here.  Zoe ThomasUS Business Reporter As we reported earlier, Jack Dorsey - the boss of Twitter and payment app Square - has pledged to donate $1bn (Â£810m) towards coronavirus relief efforts. He'll be making the donation through a limited liability company, and said the money amounts to 28% of his total wealth. To fund the efforts, the tech billionaire plans to sell his shares in the payment app Square. He said he was using shares of Square and not Twitter simply because he had more of them. The new fund will first focus on coronavirus relief. But Mr Dorsey said once the pandemic had âdisarmedâ, the donation would focus on girlsâ health and education on research into universal basic income. Mr Dorsey is not the first tech billionaire to donate to the coronavirus efforts. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos have all publicly pledged part of their wealth in the effort to battle back the disease. Trump said the World Health Organization is ""very China-centric"" and accuses the global health body of making the wrong decisions about the initial coronavirus outbreak in China. ""We're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it and we're gonna see,"" said Trump. He later modified his remarks to say he would look into ending funding. The US gives $58m each year to the WHO. ""They seem to err always on the side of China... we will look at ending funding because you know they called it wrong."" President Trump said he played no role in the acting secretary of the US Navy's decision to resign, after the official had called the captain of a coronavirus stricken ship ""stupid"". ""I had no role in it,"" said Trump. The captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt ""should not have written a letter"", in which he complained about the Pentagon's response to the onboard outbreak. ""He did not have to be Ernest Hemingway. He had a bad day,"" said Trump, ""but you shouldn't be writing letters and sending them to many people."" But the secretary of the Navy ""didn't have to resign"", said Trump, who went on to praise the decision as best for all involved. But he added that he would not have asked him to quit. Trump has spoken about black Americans being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus. We reported earlier about stats from Chicago, which showed that the city's Black residents account for half of its coronavirus cases and more than 70% of deaths - despite only making up 30% of the population. At the same time other cities with large black populations, including Detroit, Milwaukee, New Orleans and New York, have become coronavirus hotspots. Read the full storyhere. Doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients have to self-isolate away from family between shifts. To avoid the stresses of looking for accommodation, a social media group set up a way to link medical staff with owners of caravans throughout the United States. Christy Deike said: ""It answered a prayer for me in being able to help in some manner.""  Watch our video below. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Helping frontline medics with a place to stay The death rate among black Americans, which has been much higher than other racial groups, presents a ""tremendous challenge"", says Trump. ""It's terrible,"" he says, promising to ""provide support to African-American citizens of this country who are going through a lot"". ""But it's been disproportionate. They're getting hit very very hard."" Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist, says the medical community in the US has ""known literally forever"" that minority groups suffer high rates of ""diabetes, hypertension, disabilities and asthma"". These conditions represent co-morbidities that lead to much worse health outcomes for coronavirus, Fauci says. Trump says the UK has asked the US to send 200 ventilators to treat coronavirus patients there. ""We're going to work it out for them,"" Trump promises, saying the UK has been a great partner to the US. He says the UK needs ventilators ""desperately"". Trump thanks the ""genius companies"" that he says are working hard to quickly create ""a vaccine to protect us, totally protect us"" from coronavirus. He goes on to praise state governors, who have been racing to secure medical supplies from overseas and have been receiving some from the US federal stockpile. ""If you have a governor that fails, we're going to protect you,"" Trump says, promising to send medical gear to hotspots around the country. Trump sends his best wishes to the people of New York and New Jersey, and to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""He's become a great friend of ours,"" says Trump. ""He loves the USA and he's always been very good to us,"" says Trump, ""so we pray for him."" The president says that hopefully the rate of deaths in the US will slow ""in the next week, hopefully not much longer than that"". ""We're going to beat it with the grit and the heart"" that America is known for, he continues. The White House coronavirus taskforce is holding its daily briefing now. It comes as Trump continues to promote an unproven drug treatment, the head of the US Navy quits over his handling of a coronavirus-stricken ship, and Illinois and New York both record their deadliest days yet. An appeals court in Texas has ruled that the state can continue to ban nearly all abortions as part of its emergency order requiring ""non-essential"" services to be suspended in order to halt the spread of coronavirus. Abortions have been blocked for the past two weeks there, causing some patients to seek help in other states or self-terminate. According to the state's attorney general, any doctor who performs an abortion ""not medically necessary to preserve the life or health"" of the patient can be fined up to $1,000 (Â£810) or receive an 180-day jail sentence. Five other Republican-led states - Ohio, Texas, Iowa, Alabama and Oklahoma - have also taken steps to temporarily block abortions. Abortion access advocates have sued to overturn the bans. Kinderdijk, a Unesco World Heritage site, has been closed to visitors as part of the Dutch lockdown The Netherlands is looking at ways to ease lockdown measures, but life may never go back to the way it was BC (before coronavirus). Social distancing is here to stay, says Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. ""We should all start thinking about how we can adapt still further to the 1.5-metre society. The way back will be step by step and based on science,"" he told reporters. (In some parts of Europe, people are told to keep at least 1.5 metres away from others, although the WHO guidance says two metres.) If the curve of hospital and intensive care admissions continues to level off, the Dutch lockdown measures could be eased from 28 April. But Mr Rutte cautions against any hurry. ""We have an intelligent lockdown. It will be an intelligent un-lockdown.â  The government's emergency field hospital in London has admitted its first patients. The NHS Nightingale hospital in London's ExCel exhibition centre can hold as many as 4,000 patients. A spokesperson for NHS Nightingale said: ""Our first patients have now been admitted to NHS Nightingale London, as planned. ""There is also treatment capacity available in other hospitals across London to compliment the care being provided at the London Nightingale."" It is the first of several such facilities planned across the UK. The ExCel exhibition space - usually used for large events such as Comic Con - was transformed into a hospital in just nine days. Read about how it was built. Temperatures in Chicago have warmed significantly in the past few days Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has announced the largest single-day increase in coronavirus related deaths. According to the governor, 73 people died in the last 24 hours. There have now been 380 coronavirus-related fatalities in Illinois. People in Wuhan are now allowed to leave the city, for the first time since 23 January. Wuhan, in China's Hubei province, is where the virus was first reported at the end of December. Now, as life begins to return to normal, transport links out of the city have been reopened. At midnight local time (17:00 BST), people began to queue up outside Wuhan Wuchang Railway Station. The White House coronavirus taskforce is due to hold a briefing in the coming hour. President Donald Trump has frequently appeared to speak from the briefing room, as well as Vice President Mike Pence and other presidential advisers and health officials.

The prime minister, 55, was admitted to hospital in London with ""persistent symptoms"" on Sunday evening. The Queen has been kept informed about Mr Johnson's health by No 10, according to Buckingham Palace. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the prime minister was given oxygen late on Monday afternoon, before being taken to intensive care. However, he has not been put on a ventilator. A No 10 statement read: ""The prime minister has been under the care of doctors at St Thomas' Hospital, in London, after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus.

After very, very little information was shared today, the prime minister was taken into intensive care at around 19:00 BST. We've been told he is still conscious, but his condition has worsened over the course of the afternoon. And he has been moved to intensive care as a precaution in case he needs ventilation to get through this illness. The statement from Downing Street makes clear he is receiving excellent care and he wants to thank all of the NHS staff. But something important has changed, and he has felt it necessary to ask his foreign secretary to deputise for him where needs be. That is a completely different message from what we have heard over the past 18 hours or so, where it was continually ""the prime minister is in touch"" and ""he is in charge"" - almost like everything is business as usual. But clearly being in intensive care changes everything. Read more from Laura Last month, the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work,Mr Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK reached 5,373 - an increase of 439 in a day. The Department of Health and Social Care said there were now 51,608 confirmed coronavirus cases. Intensive care is where doctors look after the sickest patients - his admission to ICU is the clearest indication of how ill the prime minister is. We do not know the full details of Mr Johnson's condition, but he is conscious and not being ventilated. Not every patient in intensive care is ventilated, but around two-thirds are within 24 hours of admission with Covid-19. This is a disease that attacks the lungs and can cause pneumonia and difficulty breathing. This leaves the body struggling to get enough oxygen into the blood and to the body's vital organs. There is no proven drug treatment for Covid-19, although there are many experimental candidates. But the cornerstone of the prime minister's care will depend on getting enough oxygen into his body and supporting his other organs while his immune system fights the virus.

Short-form streaming app launches to rival Netfilx,"The mobile-first streaming service Quibi launched in the US on Monday, despite concerns the coronavirus outbreak might impact its viewership. The company has raised $1.8bn (Â£1.47bn) for the project intended to rival Netflix and YouTube. Quibi's shows are 10 minutes or shorter and movies are broken into segments. It has lined up a host of Hollywood and showbiz stars including Idris Elba, Sophie Turner, Steven Spielberg, Chrissy Teigen and Jennifer Lopez. Viewers are meant to watch the shows on their mobile phones, and a feature called Turnstile allows the video to stay full screen in both portrait or landscape. Some shows even encourage viewers to turn the device mid-show to reveal a different angle to the scene. On social media, Quibi's launch was met with mixed reviews. Quibi videos have a feature that allows the picture to rotate if viewers turn their device. Some of its highly promoted shows - like Punk'd featuring Chance the Rapper and Survive starring Sophie Turner - received praise. But watching alone on your smartphone - a fundamental feature of the app - was criticised. Users complained they couldn't share what they were watching with housemates or partners. The service costs $4.99 a month with adverts and $7.99 for ad-free viewing, although Quibi is giving away a 90-day free trial in the US. The company had said it planned to roll out its services to other countries gradually, but on Monday the ad-free version app appeared to be available in the UK. Quibi's chief executive Meg Whitman and founder Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to stick with the 6 April debut in the US despite concerns the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns could impact its target audience.  Many analysts expected Quibi viewers to watch while commuting or during a break at work or school, but those activities are on hold for many during government lockdown periods. Quibi says its target audience is between 18-44 years old viewers already comfortable with short-form storytelling and streaming on their smartphones. by Zoe Thomas, BBC News Technology Reporter In several ways, I am exactly the audience Quibi is after. I'm not what you would call a ""binge watcher"" - I find it hard to sit still through multiple 30-minute episodes. But I do watch plenty of short videos on YouTube and social media throughout the day. Still, the coronavirus lockdown has given me a lot more time to stream TV and movies, so did I need a service with only sub-10-minute episodes? After several hours of perusing Quibi's content, I think the service is on to something. The shows are entertaining and the creators clearly thought about how the audience would view the screen.  The episodes are no more than 10 minutes long and none of them felt cut off or too short. There are downsides - my arm is tired from holding the phone up all day, you can only share content with other Quibi subscribers and you can't play it on your television if you happen to be at home. I began my Quibi viewing with the show Survive, starring former Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner. The drama was promoted at the top of the app and given the current state of the world - why not start with a drama about a young woman battling suicidal thoughts while struggling to survive on a frozen mountaintop after a plane crash? I was hooked pretty fast. Quibi demonstrated its technology in January I also immediately started to test out the Turnstile feature that changes perspective of the pictures when the screen is turned from vertical to horizontal. To my great delight the shifts from portrait to landscape were fairly seamless. In Survive the picture always re-centred to keep you locked in the emotion of the scene - and the scenes are very emotional. As I kept watching throughout the day, I found myself using the Turnstile feature more naturally. If I got up to get water or stretch my legs I would take the phone, turning it from horizontal to vertical rather than pausing the show. Yes, I did bump into some things and I can imagine in world of commuting and crowded walkways Quibi could be a hazard. This video can not be played WATCH: Quibi aims to change how we watch shows on phones Quibi has poured money into its scripted shows and non-scripted/reality shows. Judging from the comments on Twitter I wasn't alone in really enjoy Punk'd - a revival of the MTV prank show now starring Chance the Rapper. Not only did I find the show funny I really wanted to share it with my friends, but as none of them had signed up for Quibi yet they couldn't view the episodes. For me this felt like a drawback. If I saw something funny on YouTube or Tiktok I could send it to friends - not with Quibi. Another feature I really liked were the news episodes (surprise surprise). Quibi has teamed up with NBC, BBC, ESPN and others to make bespoke news packages for the app. I found the ones I watched to be informative, the right length and pretty engaging. But I can't see why any of these videos should be unique to Quibi. Turning them doesn't make much of a difference so I couldn't see why news outlets couldn't just publish these videos themselves. I began my Quibi journey thinking I didn't need anything else to make me more anti-social these days. While hosting a Netflix viewing party may give me a way to interact with my friends in real time, the quality content on Quibi leaves me thinking that when more people download it I'll have plenty to discuss with them.

"A visual guide to the world in lockdownWith more than a million coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide, an analysis of the world in lockdown.","Coronavirus has now infected more than one million people worldwide, but its impact extends far beyond just those who have had it. Even the frequency of use of the word ""unprecedented"" is unprecedented at the moment. According to Google Trends it's been used three times more over the last two weeks than the highest point recorded previously. As governments around the world have enacted new measures and given official advice, we take a look at the impact that it's had on people and the world around them. The approaches to dealing with coronavirus across the world have been wide-rangingto say the least. In Colombia the days that you're allowed to leave the house depend on the number of your national ID card; in Serbia a designated dog-walking hour was introduced; and in Belarus the president has gone against medical advice, recommending vodka and saunas as a way to stay safe. Some of the more common approaches have seen governments issue recommendations on social distancing for part or all of the country, while others have acted to restrict all non-essential internal movement. The latter is often called a lockdown. When the virus was first identified in China in late 2019, lockdown seemed extreme. But as the outbreak has spread around the world, it has become more difficult to manage. More countries have opted to take the strictest measures possible to contain it. Well over 100 countries worldwide had instituted either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March 2020, affecting billions of people. And many others had recommended restricted movement for some or all of their citizens. In regions that have only recently confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, many countries appear to be learning from their Asian and European counterparts. Governments seem to be acting faster and more strictly in Africa as well. China has managed to ease its restrictions after passing through the worst period of climbing cases and deaths, but life is still far from normal. The rest of us may have a long way to go. When the virus first appeared, several countries brought in initial restrictions on flights from China, or required visitors from at-risk areas to be quarantined on arrival. After it had been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on 11 March, there were more all-encompassing measures. President Trump blocked all non-essential arrivals to the US from the European Union on 15 March, and a day later the EU did the same to all visitors from outside the Schengen free-travel zone. By the end of March, air traffic from some of the world's biggest airports had dropped to a fraction of what it was at the same time last year, or even what it was at the start of this month. The number of commercial flights last month was down by more than a quarter globally,according to flight tracking service Flightradar24,external. In the final week of March, as more and more countries introduced travel restrictions to try to contain the virus, traffic declined 63% from the same period last year. On 25 March, Heathrow - one of the busiest airports in the world serving about 80 million passengers per year - recorded more than 1,000 fewer flights compared with an equivalent day in 2019. It's not just getting from city to city. Travel within major cities across the globe has ground to a halt as restrictions on movement and social contact have come into force. As of 31 March, residents in cities like Madrid, Paris, London and New York were making fewer than one-tenth as many journeys using the app as they did normally, according to data from travel app Citymapper. In Milan in northern Italy, which has been locked down for several weeks now, only 3% of trips were being planned via the Citymapper mobile app, compared with before the outbreak. The data also suggests that people cut down on travel in the days leading up to government-enforced shutdowns. For example, the partial lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, came into place on 24 March but trips had already declined sharply the week before. Even in cities where authorities have issued recommendations on social distancing and refrained from imposing strict lockdowns, it appears that people are still restricting their travel. ln Stockholm, Sweden, where the government has avoided draconian measures, issuing guidelines rather than strict rules, the Citymapper data suggests planned trips - which can include both walking and public transport - fell by 70%. Stockholm's public transport company reported last week that passenger numbers on subway and commuter trains had halved. Movement is also below normal rates in some of the Asian cities that Citymapper collects data for, like Hong Kong and Singapore, which have not enforced the type of shutdowns seen elsewhere. The South Korean capital Seoul hasn't come to a standstill like European capitals, despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases - a sign of the country's decision to focus on widespread testing and contact tracing rather than social distancing. We see the same behaviour with people on the roads. Major cities around the world were already becoming steadily less busy before official lockdown measures came in, congestion data from location technology specialists TomTom shows. In Tokyo there hasn't been an official lockdown yet, but schools have been shut since the beginning of March. That, and a lack of tourists, could explain why traffic there has been marginally below last year's levels without the sharp downturn obvious elsewhere. In Jakarta, Indonesia, where there has also been no official lockdown, congestion has already dropped to almost zero - similar to Los Angeles and New Delhi which shut down on different dates. The congestion score in the graphic below is an indication of how much longer it would take to make a journey through the city compared with when there is no traffic at all. A rating of 50 means that a trip will take 50% more time than it would if the roads were completely free, for example, so a half-hour drive would become 45 minutes. The regular low points on the chart generally come at weekends. In China there are signs that things are beginning to get back to normal. Traffic levels are back to about half the 2019 level in Beijing and Shanghai but have been steadily growing since the beginning of February following extended Chinese New Year celebrations from 25 January. In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, traffic levels are still next to zero compared with last year. One of the few positive effects of the shutdown is that there seems to have been a drop in pollution in some parts of the world. Levels of NO2 in the atmosphere fluctuate widely with factors like wind speed, and satellites trying to measure these levels can be hampered by cloud cover. This may explain some of the variability seen over Wuhan and northern Italy between January and March 2019 in the maps below. But in these places, shutdowns have been stricter and in place for longer than elsewhere, and the change in NO2 levels between 2019 and the months of 2020 in which the shutdowns have been in effect appears to be significant. In the UK, and in many other places, the available satellite data does not yet show either way whether the ongoing reduction in economic activity is being accompanied by a corresponding fall in emissions, althoughsome other sourcessuggest that it is. As countries have shut down, many workers have had to try to continue their office jobs from home. That means video calls and instant messaging have become invaluable workroom tools. The average number of messages sent by users in New York, Paris, London and Berlin has increased by more than a third in just a few weeks. Not everyone has got used to their new ways of working just yet. But - depending on where you are - there could be a good deal of time left to do so.
