House party concerns amid rise in Covid cases,"Police and the council issued seven fines to organisers of illegal raves last weekend Young people in Leeds are being urged to take responsibility for controlling the spread of coronavirus following an increase in house parties in the city. Leeds was added to the Public Health England areas of concern as Covid rates rose to 32.5 cases per 100,000 people. Council leader Judith Blake said there had been an increase in music events, house parties and illegal raves adding fines of Â£10,000 were being given. She urged caution at a time when university students were set to return. More stories from around Yorkshire The city council said infections were broadly spread across its local communities, suggesting they were linked to social and leisure activities rather than single sites - with increasing numbers among people aged between 18 and 34. Ms Blake said it was premature to talk about a lockdown at this stage but the city was approaching a tipping point and restrictions would be considered. ""Unfortunately we have seen a rise in house parties, but we are working with police,"" Ms Blake said. ""Last weekend we issued, with the police, seven of the Â£10,000 fines for organisers of illegal raves."" The fines are part of newly-introduced legislation aimed at deterring illegal music events. Elsewhere in West Yorkshire, Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale feature on Public Health England's watchlist of areas that have seen infection rates increase. Police issued a photograph of one event was shut down last weekend in Kitson Road, Leeds, following reports that it was in breach of coronavirus restrictions. ""We feel there is a bit of complacency coming in,"" Ms Blake said. ""This virus isn't going to be contained just among younger people. ""The fact is that the social distancing measures have been working, but if we relax and it starts to spread back into the older more vulnerable communities we are going to see increased hospitalisation and all the things we saw at the beginning of the virus."" SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? She said the council had been working with the universities ahead of the return of students later this month. ""We want to really get across that the virus is still with us,"" Ms Blake said. The West Yorkshire city has been named alongside South Tyneside, Corby, Middlesbrough and Kettering as an area for concern. Wakefield, Neward and Sherwood, and Slough were all removed after case numbers fell. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Police and immigration protesters clash at port,"Police restrained a protester near the harbour Police and anti-immigration protesters have clashed outside the entrance to Dover harbour. At one point, several officers restrained a person on the ground and in total 10 people were arrested. It came as rival protests over migrants reaching the UK in small boats took place in the town. The Kent Anti-Racism Network said it wanted to show ""solidarity"" with refugees, while opposing groups want ""to protect Britain's border"". A message was beamed on to the White Cliffs overnight by humanitarian charity Freedom From Torture. It read: ""Rise above fear. Refugees welcome."" Kent Police increased their presence in Dover Anti-immigration protesters gathered to ""protect the border"" Police concentrated their officers in Market Square and at the railway station, and officers on horseback are also monitoring the situation. A group of about 60 people shouting ""freedom"" moved along Dover seafront, with many wearing Union flag masks and carrying flags. But, addressing a crowd of about 100, Peter Keenan from Kent Refugee Help said when society sees people who are fleeing war and turns them away ""that says something about the state of your society"". He continued: ""We are not those people."" Some protesters showed ""solidarity"" with migrants The protest was in response to migrants crossing the Channel in boats In atweet,external, the Port of Dover had warned there was disruption on the A20 because of the protest and advised the local community to consider alternative routes and travellers to allow plenty of time for their journeys. Protesters blocked the dual carriageway in both directions, leaving traffic at a standstill, with some singing Rule, Britannia! as they marched towards the town. Many wore Union flag face masks and carried banners. Some protesters carried banners and flags There were further clashes with a group of at least 50 police officers by the A20. Officers moved protesters along the road towards the town centre. By about 15:00 BST, all protesters had largely dispersed with the last few pushed towards the train station. At least 5,196 people have crossed the English Channel in about 318 boats in 2020. A sign was beamed on to the cliffs by campaigners Police made ten arrests in total, on suspicion of racially aggravated public order, violent disorder and assaulting an emergency worker. Officers said inquiries were ongoing to identify any further offences. Before the protests, Ch Supt Nigel Brooks said: ""As a force, it is our responsibility to facilitate peaceful protests, however we will not tolerate violence or disorder."" It is thought groups from across the country travelled to Dover. Protesters gathered around the A20 and the harbour Dover MP Natalie Elphicke had urged people to ""stay away"" to prevent a second wave of coronavirus. A Home Office spokeswoman said it had been aware of the protests and had contingency plans in place to minimise any potential disruption. Figures compiled by the BBC show at least 5,196 people crossed the Channel in about 318 boats in 2020.

'No signs of life' in Beirut blast survivor search,"A sensor machine detected possible signs of life on Thursday Rescuers in Beirut have found ""no sign of life"" in the rubble of a building destroyed in last month's massive port explosion, dashing hopes that someone could be rescued alive. A sensor machine detected possible signs of life on Thursday, but after clearing 95% of the rubble workers have not found the source of the reading. About 50 volunteers, including a team from Chile, have been at the scene. The blast killed about 190 people and left thousands of others injured. Crowds gathered at the building located between the residential districts of Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael, hoping for a miracle. A team of rescuers from Chile were walking through the area on Wednesday night when their sniffer dog gave a sign that there was a person inside. When they returned on Thursday, the dog again gave the same signal. Specialist sensor equipment then detected a pulsing signal in the area. Breathing was detected under the rubble at a depth of 3m (9.8ft). This video can not be played The BBC's Carine Torbey is at the scene of the search They continued to remove the rubble on Saturday, clearing much of it by hand. However they have still not located the source of the sensor reading. In a news conference on Saturday, Francisco Lermanda, head of volunteer rescue group Topos Chile, said: ""Technically speaking, there are no signs of life."" He told reporters that signs of life recorded over the past two days were the breaths of volunteers working inside the building. How long can survivors last under rubble? Efforts will now focus on clearing the rubble and looking for remains, he said. ""We never stop with even one percent of hope,"" he said. ""We never stop until the job is done"". The Chilean rescuers took part in the2010 rescue of 33 Chilean miners trapped 700m underground for more than two months. This video can not be played A candle vigil was among the events held to mark one month since the explosion Civil defence officer Qassem Khatersaid his team would not give up. ""We are not leaving the site until we've finished going through the rubble, even if a new building collapse threatens,"" he said. According to Lebanese officials, seven people are still missing following the blast. Beirut held a minute's silence on Friday, marking a month since the explosion which happened when 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonated.

Climate protesters target newspapers,"Protesters gathered outside the sites - including Broxbourne in Hertfordshire - owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists have delayed the distribution of several national newspapers after blocking access to three printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch. Protesters targeted Newsprinters presses at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, Knowsley in Merseyside, and near Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the action by demonstrators across the country was ""unacceptable"". Eighty people have been arrested. XR used vehicles along with individual protesters chaining themselves to structures to block roads to the presses The Sun tweeted to report copies of the paper would be delayed arriving at newsagents, adding the blockade was an ""attack on all the free press"".

The presses print the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp titles including the Sun, the Times, the Sun on Sunday, the Sunday Times, and the Scottish Sun. They also print the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, and the London Evening Standard. Demonstrators have accused the papers of failing to report on climate change. XR used vehicles to block roads to the printing plants, while individual protesters chained themselves to structures. Vans were covered with banners with messages including ""Free the truth"" and ""Refugees are welcome here"". Some protesters chained themselves to bamboo structures to block the road outside the building in Hertfordshire Boris Johnson saidon Twitter,external: ""A free press is vital in holding the government and other powerful institutions to account on issues critical for the future of our country, including the fight against climate change. ""It is completely unacceptable to seek to limit the public's access to news in this way."" Shadow Secretary of State for Digital Culture, Media and Sport, Jo Stephens, said: ""People have the right to read the newspapers they want. ""Stopping them from being distributed and printers from doing their jobs is wrong."" And Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted the overnight action by XR was an ""attack on democracy"". Newsprinters also condemned the protests as an ""attack on all of the free press"", which it said had affected workers going about their jobs and others such as newsagents who faced ""financial penalty"". ""Thanks to other industry partners, printing was transferred to other sites,"" it said. A protest near Motherwell passed peacefully with no arrests, police said Telegraph editor Chris Evans earlier emailed staff to say that although the paper was not XR's primary target, it was ""severely affected"". He told them: ""I'm also very concerned - and I hope you are too - by the attack on free speech. ""Whatever your politics you should be worried by this. There are also questions for the police who perhaps placed the right of these few people to protest above the right of the rest of the people to read a free press."" Hertfordshire Police said officers were called to Great Eastern Road near the Broxbourne plant at about 22:00 BST, where they found about 100 protesters who had ""secured themselves to structures and one another"". By 06:00 delivery lorries had still been unable to leave the site to distribute papers. Officers said 50 people had been arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance. Protesters at the Knowsley site had been cleared by about 10:30 BST Chief Constable Charlie Hall said the group's action had been ""an intentionally disruptive and unacceptable protest that had been pre-planned and carefully co-ordinated to create prolonged disruption to local businesses"". Hertfordshire officers arrived ""within five minutes of the initial report"", he said, however, ""the nature of the protest required highly specialist resources and cutting equipment in order to safely remove the protesters from their locations"". Each one had to be individually released from a bamboo structure they had erected, Mr Hall added. Although business had resumed at the site, he said officers would remain there to monitor the area. Merseyside Policetweeted,externalon Saturday morning that officers were at the Knowsley plant. The site had been cleared of protesters by about 10:30 and 30 people had been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass. Police Scotland said in a statement the protest at the Eurocentral plant near Motherwell ""was peaceful and there were no issues"". XR has accused the newspapers and their owners of ""failure to report on the climate and ecological emergency"" and ""polluting national debate"" on dozens of social issues. The Federation of Independent Retailers condemned the demonstrations, saying members left without supplies of papers were having ""to deal with angry customers who are unable to get their daily newspaper"". National president Stuart Reddish said it also meant retailers were unable to get papers to elderly and vulnerable customers. ""Newsagents have played a critical role during Covid-19 in getting newspapers into the hands of readers and this is not helpful at a time when every sale counts,"" he added. Extinction Rebellion accused some of the papers of failing to report on climate change Extinction Rebellion has planned 10 days of action and is calling on the government to do more to act on climate change. In an updated statement following the latest protest, a spokesman said: ""We are in an emergency of unprecedented scale and the papers we have targeted are not reflecting the scale and urgency of what is happening to our planet. ""To any small businesses disrupted by the action this morning we say, 'we're sorry. We hope that our actions seem commensurate with the severity of the crisis we face and that this day of disruption successfully raises the alarm about the greater disruption that is coming'."" On Thursday,more than 300 people were arrestedduring protests in central London. Meanwhile, climate change protesters have been warned they risk large fines if they fail to comply with coronavirus rules banning gatherings of more than 30 people. A procession of activists that set off walking from Brighton a week ago was due to march the final stretch to Parliament later. The Met Police said risk assessments of the march in Westminster ""did not meet the required standard"" and have banned XR from taking a 20ft model boat named after teenage activist Greta Thunberg to the streets of Westminster. At about 14:45 on Saturday a group accompanying the boat posted a video on social media saying members had been ""stopped on the A3 just after Kennington Park, by a lot of police and 14 police vans"". XR protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square in London had been largely dispersed, police said, and a spokeswoman for the Met Police said officers were also in Euston where a protester had locked themselves to a crane.

Facebook stops incurably ill man streaming death,"Alain Cocq, 57, suffers from a rare illness which causes the walls of his arteries to stick together Facebook says it will block a Frenchman suffering from an incurable condition from livestreaming his own death. Alain Cocq, 57, planned to broadcast his final days after starting to refuse food, drink and medicine on Saturday. President Emmanuel Macron had earlier denied his request for euthanasia. Mr Cocq wants the law changed in France to allow terminally ill people to die as they wish. Some groups, including the Catholic Church, oppose euthanasia on moral grounds. What's the difference between assisted suicide and euthanasia? ""The road to deliverance begins and believe me, I am happy,"" Mr Cocq posted on Facebook early on Saturday morning from his bed at home in Dijon, after announcing he had ""finished his last meal"". ""I know the days ahead are going to be difficult but I have made my decision and I am calm,"" he added. Mr Cocq suffers from a degenerative disease, which causes the walls of his arteries to stick together. But Facebook blocked the plan to livestream his death, stating that it did not allow portrayals of suicide. ""Although we respect [Mr Cocq's] decision to want to draw attention to this complex question, following expert advice we have taken measures to prevent the live broadcast on Alain's account,"" a Facebook spokesman told the AFP news agency. ""Our rules do not allow us to show suicide attempts."" Mr Cocq posts from his bed, where he is confined Mr Cocq said Facebook was blocking his broadcasts until 8 September. He called upon his supporters to lobby the social media platform to change its stance. ""It is up to you now,"" he said. In July, Mr Cocq penned a letter to Mr Macron, asking the president to allow him to die ""with dignity,"" describing his ""extremely violent suffering"". Mr Macron said he was ""moved"" by the letter, but could not grant the request as he was ""not situated above the law"". Euthanasia is a controversial topic in France, with many supporting a right to die with dignity, while others - particularly religious conservatives - have opposed calls for its decriminalisation.

Abbott keen to bring 'expertise' to UK trade role,"Tony Abbott said he was ""proud"" to be helping the UK make the most of its ""post-Brexit opportunities"" Tony Abbott has said he is looking forward to contributing his ""expertise"" in global commerce to his new role as a trade adviser to the UK government. The former Australian PM wasappointed to the unpaid role on Friday, despite criticism over his past comments on women, LGBT people and climate change. Mr Abbott, who led Australia from 2013-15,posted on Twitter,externalthat he was ""only too keen"" to help the UK. But Labour said he should have been disqualified from the role. Who is Tony Abbott? UK 'sleepwalking into disaster' over border plans New Zealand 'frustrated' over UK trade talks Mr Abbott will advise the new Board of Trade, set up to help ministers and encourage firms to do more business internationally, but will not be involved in post-Brexit talks between the UK and other countries. His appointment has drawn criticism from opposition parties and equality activists,including Sir Ian McKellen and Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies,external, who said his past comments meant he was not ""fit"" for the role. The former Australian PM opposed same-sex marriage in Australia's 2017 referendum and has been accused of making homophobic and misogynistic comments in the past. He has also described the idea of climate change as ""faddish"", and last year claimed the world was ""in the grip of a climate cult"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he did ""not agree with those sentiments"", but rejected suggestions he was unsuitable for the role. In astatement on Twitter,external, Mr Abbott said: ""A UK-Australia trade deal, maximising the movement of goods, services and people is clearly in the best interests of both our countries. ""It's important for the wider world that Britain make the most of its post-Brexit opportunities and I am proud to be playing a part. ""My government finalised trade deals between Australia and China, Japan and Korea. I'm looking forward to bringing that expertise to bear as Britain works towards mutually-beneficial improvements with its major trading partners."" But Labour shadow trade secretary Emily Thornberry told Radio 4's Today programme Mr Abbott should have been disqualified from the role. She said: ""First is his history of offensive statements towards women, LGBT people, minority groups - the list is so long and so despicable that I think it speaks to his character and his values, and I don't think that's a character we should have representing Britain around the world. ""But secondly, I just don't think that he's the right person to advise Britain on its trade policy. ""He was never involved in detailed trade negotiations. There were many people who did the spade work, and he turned up and signed them. And he thinks that issues like climate change and workers' rights aren't important."" Alexander Downer, a former Australian high commissioner to the UK, rejected suggestions his ally Mr Abbott was a misogynist. He told Today: ""He is not a misogynist, he has appointed many women to positions - he was appointed to this position by a woman. ""I don't think it stacks up, I think it's just party politicking."" Mr Downer added that the ""huge"" trade deals achieved while Mr Abbott was PM had been a ""remarkable achievement"". Other advisers to the Board of Trade will include former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt, ex-Conservative Member of the European Parliament Daniel Hannan and Anne Boden, founder of the online-only bank Starling. Ms Boden tweeted,externalthat she was ""pleased"" to be advising the Board of Trade, and that it was ""important"" to have ""challenging voices"" speaking to ministers. But the financial technology expert added that she supported diversity and ""so did this woman"",linking to a 2012 speech by another former Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, in which she accused Mr Abbott of being a misogynist in the Australian parliament.

It is conducting negotiations with the US, Japan, New Zealand and Australia. The Board of Trade will meet four times a year. The Department for International Trade has stressed that advisers to the board will have ""no direct role in striking trade deals"".

Residents have been asked to only use public transport for essential purposes, which means travel to education, work, and essential matters such as hospital appointments. People have also been told not to mix with other households in any setting indoors or outdoors anywhere, except in their support bubble. In a joint statement, council leader David Greenhalgh and chief executive Tony Oakham said: ""It has been a tough period for individuals, families and businesses but we don't want to throw away all our hard work by allowing the infection rate to rise even higher. ""Now, more than ever, we need everyone in Bolton to play their part. ""Nobody wants these restrictions to remain a moment longer than necessary and we believe these new measures will keep everyone safe and help avoid a full lockdown in Bolton."" Dr Helen Lowey, director of Public Health for Bolton Council, said: ""We are carrying out extra testing including giving out home testing kits, and are carrying out extra site visits to support businesses to be Covid secure, and carrying out enforcement where necessary. ""Evidence from Oldham and Blackburn shows stopping households mixing works."" Bolton's move comes as other parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshiremove out of stricter lockdown measures.

"Arrests at Australia anti-lockdown protestsIn Melbourne, the centre of the outbreak, 300 people marched in defiance of tough restrictions.","This video can not be played There were scuffles between protesters and police at the event Australian police have made dozens of arrests amid anti-lockdown protests attended by hundreds nationwide. In Melbourne, the centre of Australia's outbreak, about 300 people marched in defiance of tough measures that have been in place for a month. Other protests took place in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. On Friday PM Scott Morrison said seven of the country's eight states and territories had agreed to open their internal borders by December. He suggested an eventual travel bubble with New Zealand could boost tourism and help revive the economy. ""In the absence of a vaccine, we may have to live this way for years,"" he warned. Australia 'anti-lockdown' arrest stirs controversy Why is Melbourne seeing more cases during lockdown? Confirmed virus cases in Australia have more than tripled to over 26,000 over the past two months, with deaths rising to 748 from 104 over the same period. In Melbourne protesters chanted ""freedom"" and ""human rights matter"" amid a heavy police presence. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews was also singled out - ""We are in a city where the cure from Daniel Andrews is actually worse than what's happening,"" protester Fiona Kat told AFP. Police said they had made 15 arrests - 14 for breaching lockdown rules and one for assaulting a police officer who received lacerations to the head. They also issued more than 150 fines for lockdown breaches. There were scuffles between police and protesters in Melbourne Mr Andrews condemned the event - ""It is not safe, it is not smart, it is not lawful. In fact, it is absolutely selfish for people to be out there protesting,"" he told reporters. There were smaller rallies elsewhere, including two in Sydney and one in Byron Bay that turned violent, according to local media. Police made 14 arrests, including three people suspected of assaulting police officers. The protests were largely driven by fringe online groups promoting virus-related and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Police had earlier drawn criticism for the arrest of a pregnant woman for promoting the protest online. On Friday officers broke into the home of a former bodybuilder and conspiracy theorist who had also been calling for people to join the event. Victoria has been in a six-week lockdown since July to curb a coronavirus outbreak that has fuelled Australia's second wave. Authorities have imposed stay-at-home rules and a curfew in Melbourne, the state capital. The lockdown has closed many businesses and banned gatherings around the state. Victoria accounts for 75% of Australia's total infections and 90% of all deaths. The state reported 11 deaths on Saturday and more than 70 new infections - down from the peak of 725 new infections on 5 August but more than health officials had hoped for five weeks after the restrictions came in. The protests were largely driven by fringe conspiracy groups online On Sunday Mr Andrews is due to announce some easing of restrictions. It follows calls by Australia's federal government and businesses to that end. The state accounts for about a quarter of the country's economy. However he has urged caution. ""Until you fix the health problem, there can be no economic repair,"" he said. On Saturday there were five new coronavirus infections in New South Wales, one in Queensland and one in South Australia. Mr Morrison said plans to reopen state borders by December would involve coming up with a way of managing virus hotspots. However the geographically largest state, Western Australia, has rejected the plan until the other states have the virus under control. It has not had a local transmission for 129 days and there are no restrictions in place there. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said the long desert border would remain shut to save lives and protect big mining operations. Speaking after a national cabinet meeting on Friday, Mr Morrison said Australia could apply the hotspot approach to New Zealand as well. Meanwhile a former prime minister of the Cook Islands, Joseph Williams, has been confirmed to have died of coronavirus in New Zealand. It is the second death there in two days and brings the country's total to 24.

Trump attacks 'slimeball' reporter in war dead row,"Protesters gathered outside the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia US President Donald Trump has described as a ""slimeball"" a journalist who quoted him as saying dead US soldiers were ""losers"" and ""suckers"". He likened the Atlantic magazine report to unproven accusations made against him of colluding with Russia to win the presidential election of 2016. The damning quotes were corroborated independently by The Associated Press. Veterans' groups are among those condemning Mr Trump, less than two months from the 2020 election. Progressive group VoteVetsposted a video of families whose children had been killed in action.,external""You don't know what it is to sacrifice,"" says one. Paul Rieckhoff of the Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America,tweeted,external: ""Who is really surprised by this?"" A small group of protesters waved placards at the president's motorcade on Saturday near the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. Mr Trump has often staked a claim to strong support among the military, and last year Pew Research Center found that veterans were generally supportive of him as commander-in-chief,with 57% in favour.,externalThree-fifths of the veterans identified as Republican, the research found. According to The Atlantic, when Mr Trump cancelled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery outside Paris in November 2018, 100 years after the end of World War One,he said it was ""filled with losers"",external. Donald Trump did visit the Suresnes American Cemetery during the 2018 trip to France Four sources told the magazine he had rejected the idea of visiting because the rain would dishevel his hair, and he did not believe it important to honour America's war dead. Trump loves the military. Do they love him back? Trump says famed military newspaper will not close During the same trip, the president also allegedly referred to 1,800 US soldiers who died at Belleau Wood as ""suckers"". The battle helped to prevent a German advance on Paris during World War One and is venerated by the US Marine Corps. The Atlantic's reporting was based on anonymous sources but a ""senior Defense Department official with first-hand knowledge of events"" anda ""senior U.S. Marine Corps officer who was told about Trump's comments"" confirmed the cemetery comments,externalto AP. In 2018the White House said the cemetery visit had been cancelled because bad weather had grounded the president's helicopter.This account was backed up in a recent book by President Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump. The US Navy also said it cancelled the trip to the cemeterybecause of rain,externalin response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act from Buzzfeed reporter Jason Leopold. Without referring to Jeffrey Goldberg, the author of the Atlantic report, by name, he tweeted on Saturday: ""You work so hard for the military, from completely rebuilding a depleted mess that was left by OBiden [the previous presidential administration when Joe Biden was vice-president to Barack Obama], to fixing a broken V.A. and fighting for large scale military pay raises, and thena slimeball reporter, maybe working with disgruntled people, makes up such a horrible charge,external.."" ""This reminds me of the Dirty Dossier[the Steele dossier which alleged collusion with Russia], which was pushed hard by John McCain, & then with a thud turned out to be a total fraud. So many other scams also. The Radical Far Left is VICIOUS, they will do or say anything to win. But they won't, we will WIN, & have four great years!"" Mr Trump went on to attack another journalist, Jennifer Griffin of Fox News, normally one of the president's favourite news outlets. Griffin had reported disparaging remarks about the US military allegedly made by Mr Trump,externalon other occasions such as calling soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War ""suckers"". ""Jennifer Griffin should be fired for this kind of reporting,"" Mr Trump tweeted. ""Never even called us for comment. @FoxNews is gone!"" White House officials haveeither denied the remarks allegedly made on the trip to France or stressed the president's respect for the military. Mr Biden, the Democratic challenger in the 3 November election, said his rival was ""unfit"" to lead. ""Mr. President,if you don't respect our troops, you can't lead them,external,"" he tweeted. This video can not be played Joe Biden talked about his late son Beau's military service If elected, he said, he would ""ensure that our American heroes know that I will have their back and honor their sacrifice. Always."" Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, a veteran who lost both legs while serving in Iraq, said President Trump ""liked to use the US military for his own ego"". Khizr Khan, the father of a US soldier killed in Iraqwho criticised Mr Trump during the 2016 Democratic convention, joined Ms Duckworth on the call. He said: ""When Donald Trump calls anyone who places their lives in service of others a loser, we understand Trump's soul."" There have been previous spats and controversies. This video can not be played Trump and the US military: Friends or foe? Mr Trump caused outrage by saying the late Senator John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, was not a ""war hero"" saying: ""I like people who weren't captured."" The president has never served in uniform. He received five deferments from a military draft during the Vietnam War - four for academic reasons and one for bone spurs, a calcium build-up in the heels. Joe Biden received five student draft deferments during the Vietnam War,externalbefore being disqualified from serving in the military because of asthma as a teenager.

Anti-lockdown protest as Scotland Covid cases rise,"Protesters opposed to Covid-19 restrictions gathered in Edinburgh Protesters opposed to Covid-19 restrictions have gathered in Edinburgh as figures showed the highest weekly rise in cases since May. Coronavirus sceptics, vaccine conspiracy theorists and those opposed to mandatory mask-wearing staged a rally at Holyrood. It comes as figures showed almost a thousand people tested positive for the virus this week in Scotland. In the past seven days there were 994 confirmed cases. The figure is almost double the 507 new cases in the week previous. Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch described the protesters as ""deeply irresponsible"". Hundreds of protesters joined the rally outside the Scottish Parliament He said: ""I honestly do not understand it. ""I think it is irresponsible - do they think we're making it up? 194 countries are making up a viral pandemic. ""I would love to have not lived through the last six months, both in my job and what we have had to do to our country and many others. ""I think it is deeply irresponsible."" Hundreds of protesters marched to the parliament building in Edinburgh with flags and placards for the Scotland Against Lockdown protest, organised by the Saving Scotland Facebook group. A post advertising the event said it was ""time to stand up together, and listen to real scientific evidence in regards to the health of the Scottish people."" The group said lockdown was causing ""more harm than the virus"" and that Scots should say ""no to mandatory vaccines and masks. No to secondary lockdowns."" Police Scotland said it had been aware of the demonstration and that officers had provided a ""proportionate response"" and no arrests had been made. In the past 24 hours, the number of cases in Scotland rose by 141. There were no new deaths. The figures showed the biggest rise was in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area where 68 new cases were confirmed. The last time weekly cases exceeded the current total was 17 May, although there have been changes to the Scottish government's reporting of figures since then, including incorporating the results of home testing kits from July. The number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 overall in Scotland now stands at 21,189 and the number of infected patients who have died remains at 2,496. According to the government's latest figures, NHS Lanarkshire saw another 20 cases - an increase on the 16 announced on Friday when itwarned the region was close to having to reintroduce restrictions, similar to those imposed onother parts of western Scotland. NHS Grampian, where the Aberdeen bar cluster was identified last month, has recorded an increase of just two new cases. A total of seven cases have been discovered in Ayrshire and Arran, 14 in the Forth Valley, six in the Highlands, eight in Tayside and 14 by NHS Lothian. A single new case was identified by both NHS Borders and NHS Dumfries and Galloway. The number of tests carried out fell to 15,618 - the lowest total since 24 August. The number of new confirmed cases represents 1.5% of newly tested individuals, say the figures. As of Friday night, two people were in intensive care with coronavirus and a further 251 infected people were in hospital, although that figure includes patients who may not be receiving treatment for the disease.

Climate protesters target newspapersEighty people are arrested in protests targeting printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch.England,"Protesters gathered outside the sites - including Broxbourne in Hertfordshire - owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists have delayed the distribution of several national newspapers after blocking access to three printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch. Protesters targeted Newsprinters presses at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, Knowsley in Merseyside, and near Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the action by demonstrators across the country was ""unacceptable"". Eighty people have been arrested. XR used vehicles along with individual protesters chaining themselves to structures to block roads to the presses The Sun tweeted to report copies of the paper would be delayed arriving at newsagents, adding the blockade was an ""attack on all the free press"".

The presses print the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp titles including the Sun, the Times, the Sun on Sunday, the Sunday Times, and the Scottish Sun. They also print the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, and the London Evening Standard. Demonstrators have accused the papers of failing to report on climate change. XR used vehicles to block roads to the printing plants, while individual protesters chained themselves to structures. Vans were covered with banners with messages including ""Free the truth"" and ""Refugees are welcome here"". Some protesters chained themselves to bamboo structures to block the road outside the building in Hertfordshire Boris Johnson saidon Twitter,external: ""A free press is vital in holding the government and other powerful institutions to account on issues critical for the future of our country, including the fight against climate change. ""It is completely unacceptable to seek to limit the public's access to news in this way."" Shadow Secretary of State for Digital Culture, Media and Sport, Jo Stephens, said: ""People have the right to read the newspapers they want. ""Stopping them from being distributed and printers from doing their jobs is wrong."" And Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted the overnight action by XR was an ""attack on democracy"". Newsprinters also condemned the protests as an ""attack on all of the free press"", which it said had affected workers going about their jobs and others such as newsagents who faced ""financial penalty"". ""Thanks to other industry partners, printing was transferred to other sites,"" it said. A protest near Motherwell passed peacefully with no arrests, police said Telegraph editor Chris Evans earlier emailed staff to say that although the paper was not XR's primary target, it was ""severely affected"". He told them: ""I'm also very concerned - and I hope you are too - by the attack on free speech. ""Whatever your politics you should be worried by this. There are also questions for the police who perhaps placed the right of these few people to protest above the right of the rest of the people to read a free press."" Hertfordshire Police said officers were called to Great Eastern Road near the Broxbourne plant at about 22:00 BST, where they found about 100 protesters who had ""secured themselves to structures and one another"". By 06:00 delivery lorries had still been unable to leave the site to distribute papers. Officers said 50 people had been arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance. Protesters at the Knowsley site had been cleared by about 10:30 BST Chief Constable Charlie Hall said the group's action had been ""an intentionally disruptive and unacceptable protest that had been pre-planned and carefully co-ordinated to create prolonged disruption to local businesses"". Hertfordshire officers arrived ""within five minutes of the initial report"", he said, however, ""the nature of the protest required highly specialist resources and cutting equipment in order to safely remove the protesters from their locations"". Each one had to be individually released from a bamboo structure they had erected, Mr Hall added. Although business had resumed at the site, he said officers would remain there to monitor the area. Merseyside Policetweeted,externalon Saturday morning that officers were at the Knowsley plant. The site had been cleared of protesters by about 10:30 and 30 people had been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass. Police Scotland said in a statement the protest at the Eurocentral plant near Motherwell ""was peaceful and there were no issues"". XR has accused the newspapers and their owners of ""failure to report on the climate and ecological emergency"" and ""polluting national debate"" on dozens of social issues. The Federation of Independent Retailers condemned the demonstrations, saying members left without supplies of papers were having ""to deal with angry customers who are unable to get their daily newspaper"". National president Stuart Reddish said it also meant retailers were unable to get papers to elderly and vulnerable customers. ""Newsagents have played a critical role during Covid-19 in getting newspapers into the hands of readers and this is not helpful at a time when every sale counts,"" he added. Extinction Rebellion accused some of the papers of failing to report on climate change Extinction Rebellion has planned 10 days of action and is calling on the government to do more to act on climate change. In an updated statement following the latest protest, a spokesman said: ""We are in an emergency of unprecedented scale and the papers we have targeted are not reflecting the scale and urgency of what is happening to our planet. ""To any small businesses disrupted by the action this morning we say, 'we're sorry. We hope that our actions seem commensurate with the severity of the crisis we face and that this day of disruption successfully raises the alarm about the greater disruption that is coming'."" On Thursday,more than 300 people were arrestedduring protests in central London. Meanwhile, climate change protesters have been warned they risk large fines if they fail to comply with coronavirus rules banning gatherings of more than 30 people. A procession of activists that set off walking from Brighton a week ago was due to march the final stretch to Parliament later. The Met Police said risk assessments of the march in Westminster ""did not meet the required standard"" and have banned XR from taking a 20ft model boat named after teenage activist Greta Thunberg to the streets of Westminster. At about 14:45 on Saturday a group accompanying the boat posted a video on social media saying members had been ""stopped on the A3 just after Kennington Park, by a lot of police and 14 police vans"". XR protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square in London had been largely dispersed, police said, and a spokeswoman for the Met Police said officers were also in Euston where a protester had locked themselves to a crane.

Bar 'could close' over 'unacceptable' crowd scenes,"This video can not be played Ian Cottrell said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing A popular bar in Cardiff city centre could be closed after a video showed crowds of clubbers appearing to ignore social distancing guidelines. The footage was captured outside the Coyote Ugly bar at about 00:30 BST on Saturday. The nightclub said it adheres to coronavirus rules and turns away large crowds. But Cardiff council said it could close the venue unless there are improvements. ""Our officers will be visiting the premises today to discuss last night's scenes,"" said a Cardiff council official. ""The council intends to use the images obtained from last night with a view to taking action against the venue for breaching Covid-19 health and safety measures, as set out by Welsh Government."" The authority said it was the responsibility of businesses to ensure 2m social distancing was maintained inside and outside venues. ""The safety of visitors to the city centre remains a priority and processes to minimise the spread of the virus must be taken seriously,"" added the council. ""Scenes like this are unacceptable and if immediate improvements are not made then the council could close the premises."" City leaders said they would take action against any venues ""not following the rules"". Social distance plea to avoid new 'harsh lockdown' What are the latest social distancing rules? Minority of young people 'ruining it for majority' The footage,externalwas captured by Ian Cottrell on lower St Mary Street in Cardiff and was posted on social media. He said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing outside the bar. He asked police officers nearby why they were not taking action but Mr Cottrell said he was told it was a matter for the establishment to comply with coronavirus guidelines. Responding to that claim, South Wales Police said officers did engage with staff at the venue on Friday evening, and the venue has also been visited on Saturday ""to try and prevent similar issues this evening and in the future"". ""Our officers work to engage, encourage and explain the legislation imposed by Welsh Government, and enforce where necessary and proportionate,"" said a police spokesman. ""Policing our capital city is a huge undertaking, and videos such as the one posted on social media on Friday night do not capture the true demand placed on our officers, who work tirelessly to keep visitors to the busy area safe."" Coyote Ugly said it is ""very careful"" to comply with all the rules. ""Late in the evening we've had some big groups arrive, mixed households, and we simply turn them away,"" said spokesman Sean McMahon. Public Health Wales have expressed concerns that some 20-30 year-olds are spreading the virus ""There are big placards both inside and out explaining the rules on social distancing. ""They turn up, we know where these groups are coming from but we tell them there's too many and they aren't coming in. There are no exceptions. ""It's a safe venue. We have social distancing throughout.  There's no dancing on the bars, like there used to be. You can see from our CCTV that it's working. ""It's a shame because someone coming past has just snapped this late in the evening."" Large groups of people visited Cardiff Bay as soon as travel restrictions ended last month Public Health Wales (PHW) has expressed concerns that a lack of social distancing among 20-30 year-olds has increased the spread of Covid-19 to other groups of people. Dr Chris Williams said younger people ""really need to think hard about how they are socially distancing"". He said the Coyote Ugly footage showed individuals were not keeping 2m apart. ""We would really urge people, if they're going out and taking advantage of the opening of the night-time economy, they should avoid being on the same tables and being with people from outside their grouped households,"" he told BBC Wales. ""They should do their best to socially distance while they're out."" ""We would make a direct appeal to young people to remember that even if they feel that they would not be badly affected by Covid-19 were they to test positive, should they pass it on to older or more vulnerable family members, friends or colleagues it could be extremely serious, and even fatal,"" a statement said. Thelatest figuresshow eight new cases in Cardiff in the last day. Health Minister Vaughan Gething previously saidstag and hen-dos should be a thing of the pastfollowing a rise in cases in Cardiff. He blamed the spike in the capital on ""indoor contact rather than outdoor contact"" and warned against pub crawls, and against ignoring health advice on socialising.

Anti-lockdown protest as coronavirus cases rise,"Protesters opposed to Covid-19 restrictions gathered in Edinburgh Protesters opposed to Covid-19 restrictions have gathered in Edinburgh as figures showed the highest weekly rise in cases since May. Coronavirus sceptics, vaccine conspiracy theorists and those opposed to mandatory mask-wearing staged a rally at Holyrood. It comes as figures showed almost a thousand people tested positive for the virus this week in Scotland. In the past seven days there were 994 confirmed cases. The figure is almost double the 507 new cases in the week previous. Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch described the protesters as ""deeply irresponsible"". Hundreds of protesters joined the rally outside the Scottish Parliament He said: ""I honestly do not understand it. ""I think it is irresponsible - do they think we're making it up? 194 countries are making up a viral pandemic. ""I would love to have not lived through the last six months, both in my job and what we have had to do to our country and many others. ""I think it is deeply irresponsible."" Hundreds of protesters marched to the parliament building in Edinburgh with flags and placards for the Scotland Against Lockdown protest, organised by the Saving Scotland Facebook group. A post advertising the event said it was ""time to stand up together, and listen to real scientific evidence in regards to the health of the Scottish people."" The group said lockdown was causing ""more harm than the virus"" and that Scots should say ""no to mandatory vaccines and masks. No to secondary lockdowns."" Police Scotland said it had been aware of the demonstration and that officers had provided a ""proportionate response"" and no arrests had been made. In the past 24 hours, the number of cases in Scotland rose by 141. There were no new deaths. The figures showed the biggest rise was in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area where 68 new cases were confirmed. The last time weekly cases exceeded the current total was 17 May, although there have been changes to the Scottish government's reporting of figures since then, including incorporating the results of home testing kits from July. The number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 overall in Scotland now stands at 21,189 and the number of infected patients who have died remains at 2,496. According to the government's latest figures, NHS Lanarkshire saw another 20 cases - an increase on the 16 announced on Friday when itwarned the region was close to having to reintroduce restrictions, similar to those imposed onother parts of western Scotland. NHS Grampian, where the Aberdeen bar cluster was identified last month, has recorded an increase of just two new cases. A total of seven cases have been discovered in Ayrshire and Arran, 14 in the Forth Valley, six in the Highlands, eight in Tayside and 14 by NHS Lothian. A single new case was identified by both NHS Borders and NHS Dumfries and Galloway. The number of tests carried out fell to 15,618 - the lowest total since 24 August. The number of new confirmed cases represents 1.5% of newly tested individuals, say the figures. As of Friday night, two people were in intensive care with coronavirus and a further 251 infected people were in hospital, although that figure includes patients who may not be receiving treatment for the disease.

Police clash with immigration protesters at port,"Police restrained a protester near the harbour Police and anti-immigration protesters have clashed outside the entrance to Dover harbour. At one point, several officers restrained a person on the ground and in total 10 people were arrested. It came as rival protests over migrants reaching the UK in small boats took place in the town. The Kent Anti-Racism Network said it wanted to show ""solidarity"" with refugees, while opposing groups want ""to protect Britain's border"". A message was beamed on to the White Cliffs overnight by humanitarian charity Freedom From Torture. It read: ""Rise above fear. Refugees welcome."" Kent Police increased their presence in Dover Anti-immigration protesters gathered to ""protect the border"" Police concentrated their officers in Market Square and at the railway station, and officers on horseback are also monitoring the situation. A group of about 60 people shouting ""freedom"" moved along Dover seafront, with many wearing Union flag masks and carrying flags. But, addressing a crowd of about 100, Peter Keenan from Kent Refugee Help said when society sees people who are fleeing war and turns them away ""that says something about the state of your society"". He continued: ""We are not those people."" Some protesters showed ""solidarity"" with migrants The protest was in response to migrants crossing the Channel in boats In atweet,external, the Port of Dover had warned there was disruption on the A20 because of the protest and advised the local community to consider alternative routes and travellers to allow plenty of time for their journeys. Protesters blocked the dual carriageway in both directions, leaving traffic at a standstill, with some singing Rule, Britannia! as they marched towards the town. Many wore Union flag face masks and carried banners. Some protesters carried banners and flags There were further clashes with a group of at least 50 police officers by the A20. Officers moved protesters along the road towards the town centre. By about 15:00 BST, all protesters had largely dispersed with the last few pushed towards the train station. At least 5,196 people have crossed the English Channel in about 318 boats in 2020. A sign was beamed on to the cliffs by campaigners Police made ten arrests in total, on suspicion of racially aggravated public order, violent disorder and assaulting an emergency worker. Officers said inquiries were ongoing to identify any further offences. Before the protests, Ch Supt Nigel Brooks said: ""As a force, it is our responsibility to facilitate peaceful protests, however we will not tolerate violence or disorder."" It is thought groups from across the country travelled to Dover. Protesters gathered around the A20 and the harbour Dover MP Natalie Elphicke had urged people to ""stay away"" to prevent a second wave of coronavirus. A Home Office spokeswoman said it had been aware of the protests and had contingency plans in place to minimise any potential disruption. Figures compiled by the BBC show at least 5,196 people crossed the Channel in about 318 boats in 2020.

"Trump panned over reports he mocked US militaryA magazine claims the president called US soldiers killed in action ""losers"", something he denies.","The US president has dismissed the reports as ""fake news"" US President Donald Trump is facing a backlash over reports he mocked American soldiers killed in action as ""losers"" and ""suckers"". The alleged remarks were first reported in the Atlantic magazine,external, and some details were corroborated by the Associated Press and Fox News. But the president and his allies have denied he made the remarks. Veterans' groups were among those who attacked the president over the reports. Progressive group VoteVetsposted a video of families whose children were killed in action.,external""You don't know what it is to sacrifice,"" says one. Paul Rieckhoff of the Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America,tweeted,external: ""Who is really surprised by this?"" Analysts say the comments could prove damaging with the president needing support from military voters as he bids for re-election. According to The Atlantic, Mr Trump cancelled a visit to a US cemetery outside Paris in 2018 because he said it was ""filled with losers"". Four sources told the magazine he rejected the idea of visiting because the rain would dishevel his hair, and he did not believe it important to honour America's war dead. Trump loves the military. Do they love him back? Trump says famed military newspaper will not close During the same trip, the president also allegedly referred to 1,800 US soldiers who died at Belleau Wood as ""suckers"". The battle helped to prevent a German advance on Paris during World War One and is venerated by the US Marine Corps. The Atlantic's reporting was based on anonymous sources but theAssociated Press said it had independently confirmed many of the remarks,external. A Fox News correspondent said she had corroborated some of the remarks. In 2018the White House said the visit was cancelled because bad weather had grounded the president's helicopter.This account was backed up in a recent book by President Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump. The US Navy also said it cancelled the trip to the cemeterybecause of rain,externalin response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act from Buzzfeed reporter Jason Leopold. On top of the comments from veterans, President Trump's challenger in November's presidential election, Joe Biden, responded by saying his rival was ""unfit"" to lead. ""If the article is true - and it appears to be, based on other things he's said - it is absolutely damning. It is a disgrace."" This video can not be played Trump and the US military: Friends or foe? Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, a veteran who lost both legs while serving in Iraq, said President Trump ""liked to use the US military for his own ego"". Khizr Khan, the father of a US soldier killed in Iraqwho criticised Mr Trump during the 2016 Democratic convention, joined Ms Duckworth on the call. He said: ""When Donald Trump calls anyone who places their lives in service of others a loser, we understand Trump's soul."" President Trump has pushed back hard against the reports, calling them ""fake news"". ""To think that I would make statements negative to our military and our fallen heroes when nobody's done what I've done with the budgets, with the military budgets, with getting pay raises for our military,"" he said. ""It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that's a terrible magazine."" Speaking to reporters on Friday, he suggested the source of the story was his former White House chief of staff, John Kelly. Mr Trump said the former US Marine general ""was unable to handle the pressure of this job"". Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Friday morning he was with the president for a good part of the trip to France and never heard him use the words described in the article. Defense Secretary Mark Esper was quoted by Politico as saying Mr Trump had ""the highest respect and admiration for our nation's military members, veterans and families"", though the Pentagon chief did not explicitly deny the story. Another former White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were among those in Mr Trump's orbit who rejected the story as false. The US president has often staked claim to strong support among the military, and Pew Research Center last year found that veterans were generally supportive of him as commander-in-chief,with 57% in favour.,externalThree-fifths of the veterans identified as Republican, the research found. But there have been previous spats and controversies. He caused outrage by saying the late Senator John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, was not a ""war hero"" saying: ""I like people who weren't captured."" President Trump has never served in uniform. He received five deferments from a military draft during the Vietnam War - four for academic reasons and one for bone spurs, a calcium build-up in the heels.

Bar 'could close' over 'unacceptable' crowd scenesOfficials say steps are to be taken as a video appears to show clubbers ignoring Covid guidelines.,"This video can not be played Ian Cottrell said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing A popular bar in Cardiff city centre could be closed after a video showed crowds of clubbers appearing to ignore social distancing guidelines. The footage was captured outside the Coyote Ugly bar at about 00:30 BST on Saturday. The nightclub said it adheres to coronavirus rules and turns away large crowds. But Cardiff council said it could close the venue unless there are improvements. ""Our officers will be visiting the premises today to discuss last night's scenes,"" said a Cardiff council official. ""The council intends to use the images obtained from last night with a view to taking action against the venue for breaching Covid-19 health and safety measures, as set out by Welsh Government."" The authority said it was the responsibility of businesses to ensure 2m social distancing was maintained inside and outside venues. ""The safety of visitors to the city centre remains a priority and processes to minimise the spread of the virus must be taken seriously,"" added the council. ""Scenes like this are unacceptable and if immediate improvements are not made then the council could close the premises."" City leaders said they would take action against any venues ""not following the rules"". Social distance plea to avoid new 'harsh lockdown' What are the latest social distancing rules? Minority of young people 'ruining it for majority' The footage,externalwas captured by Ian Cottrell on lower St Mary Street in Cardiff and was posted on social media. He said he was ""shocked"" at the lack of social distancing outside the bar. He asked police officers nearby why they were not taking action but Mr Cottrell said he was told it was a matter for the establishment to comply with coronavirus guidelines. Responding to that claim, South Wales Police said officers did engage with staff at the venue on Friday evening, and the venue has also been visited on Saturday ""to try and prevent similar issues this evening and in the future"". ""Our officers work to engage, encourage and explain the legislation imposed by Welsh Government, and enforce where necessary and proportionate,"" said a police spokesman. ""Policing our capital city is a huge undertaking, and videos such as the one posted on social media on Friday night do not capture the true demand placed on our officers, who work tirelessly to keep visitors to the busy area safe."" Coyote Ugly said it is ""very careful"" to comply with all the rules. ""Late in the evening we've had some big groups arrive, mixed households, and we simply turn them away,"" said spokesman Sean McMahon. Public Health Wales have expressed concerns that some 20-30 year-olds are spreading the virus ""There are big placards both inside and out explaining the rules on social distancing. ""They turn up, we know where these groups are coming from but we tell them there's too many and they aren't coming in. There are no exceptions. ""It's a safe venue. We have social distancing throughout.  There's no dancing on the bars, like there used to be. You can see from our CCTV that it's working. ""It's a shame because someone coming past has just snapped this late in the evening."" Large groups of people visited Cardiff Bay as soon as travel restrictions ended last month Public Health Wales (PHW) has expressed concerns that a lack of social distancing among 20-30 year-olds has increased the spread of Covid-19 to other groups of people. Dr Chris Williams said younger people ""really need to think hard about how they are socially distancing"". He said the Coyote Ugly footage showed individuals were not keeping 2m apart. ""We would really urge people, if they're going out and taking advantage of the opening of the night-time economy, they should avoid being on the same tables and being with people from outside their grouped households,"" he told BBC Wales. ""They should do their best to socially distance while they're out."" ""We would make a direct appeal to young people to remember that even if they feel that they would not be badly affected by Covid-19 were they to test positive, should they pass it on to older or more vulnerable family members, friends or colleagues it could be extremely serious, and even fatal,"" a statement said.

Visits to care homes in Caerphilly have stoppedto protect residents following the increase in cases. Mr David said the results from tests at the temporary centre ""will guide what happens next and decisions that will be taken after that"". ""The thing I desperately don't want to see is another harsh lockdown...as we had in March,"" he said. ""The only way we are going to avoid doing that is if we get back to that disciplined process that we had and were doing so well at.""

Roadchef shares scandal widow demands actionFormer Roadchef workers and their families have been fighting for their money for 25 years.Wales,"If you have travelled on a motorway in the UK, there's a good chance you stopped at a Roadchef services A widow is calling on the UK government to act to allow thousands of victims of a share scandal to finally receive tax-free compensation. Workers at Roadchef motorway services won a legal battle in 2014 after losing millions when shares in an employee scheme were transferred. It then emerged a further Â£10m had been taken in taxes. In 2018, that cash was returned - but a continuing dispute with tax officials means no full payout has been made. HM Revenue and Customs said it was working to bring the case to a conclusion. ""There's a lot of people who've died and haven't had the money,"" said Eleanor Nicholls, from Llanelli in Carmarthenshire. Her husband Michael was one of the workers who should have benefited. He was one of more than 200 beneficiaries in Wales alone - with over 4,000 across the UK due payouts from the share scheme. He worked for 18 years at the Pont Abraham Roadchef services, where the M4 ends at junction 49. But the former steelworker died in February 2010 from lung cancer aged 68. More than 10 years on, Eleanor is still waiting for the compensation. Michael Nicholls died aged 68 - his wife is still waiting for the share benefit payments he was due Back in 1998, when the scandal was uncovered, the GMB union estimated average payouts from the share scheme should have been about Â£90,000 for eligible workers. Most got about Â£2,300 at the time. ""We both worked tirelessly to put money aside for our children's future,"" said Eleanor, who is now 74, as she reflected on the decade since her husband died. ""I worked in a care home and he did the night shift at Roadchef so there was always someone in the house to look after my elderly mother, who was starting to get dementia. ""Ten years ago, we'd needed a break and managed to get to Spain. ""Michael was taken ill when we were away but I thought it was the hot weather. ""When we came home he went to have a chest X-ray and the doctor called me in and told me 'your husband is a very sick man'. It was two tumours, one on the lung and one on the brain. ""He only lasted six weeks."" There were more hard blows to follow for Eleanor and her family. Whistleblower: 'I was right all along' From staff to owners Who gets the cash when you tip? ""Months later my mother died. All the money we'd saved for our retirement had to go to pay for the two funerals,"" she said. ""The money from Roadchef would have really helped. ""It could have eased the stress and anxiety at wondering if I could afford to stay in the home that myself, Michael and our family had worked so hard for over all these years, and the beautiful memories that we shared there."" Roadchef is the third largest roadside services firm in the UK, operating sites such as Pont Abraham where Michael Nicholls worked In 1986, the managing director of the motorway service chain was Patrick Gee. He wanted to see workers benefit from an employee share scheme - where workers have a share of the ownership - not unlike how retailers such as John Lewis operate. He established what was due to become the UK's very first Employee Share Ownership Plan - where staff could earn shares in the firm based on their length of service. But then the Roadchef head died unexpectedly at the age of just 43. His successor was Timothy Igram Hill, who managed to take control of the employees' shares, making him an estimated Â£27m when he sold the company to Japanese investors in 1998. But the company secretary at the time, Tim Warwick,blew the whistle on his boss, and spent the next quarter of century helping those who had lost out from his home in Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan. Sadly he died suddenly in August in hospital in Cardiff, without seeing the dispute fully resolved. The fight had also been taken up by the trust that that had originally been established to manage the scheme for the workers - and the Roadchef Employees Benefits Trust Limited (REBTL) sued Mr Igram Hill. While there was no suggestion he had acted illegally, in January 2014 the High Court ruled that Mr Ingram Hill had breached his fiduciary duty to Roadchef employees. An out-of-court settlement was reached between him and REBTL in 2015, with hopes the matter was then resolved. But then it emerged Â£10m of the share money had been handed over to HM Revenue and Customs. Another battle ensued. HM Revenue and Customs remains in dispute over compensation Legislation passed in 2003 should have meant employee share schemes like this are tax free. But because the cash assets had already been taken from the original scheme five years earlier, it appeared the Roadchef workers had fallen through a legal gap. Then in 2018, HMRC returned the taxed cash to the trustees. However, a dispute still remains: Should those due to receive compensation be expected to pay tax individually on those payments? No say the beneficiaries, backed by campaigners, trustees and a group of cross-party MPs. Until this matter is finally resolved, the victims of this scandal are still waiting - 25 years after it happened. Still waiting: Eleanor Nicholls wants the dispute to be resolved after 25 years Michael Nicholls' widow Eleanor continues to wait. ""Michael died 10 years ago and I've been fighting all this time to get what's owed,"" she said. ""It's upsetting for me to have this all in my mind and re-do it all again. There's so much pressure on me. I get letters and think 'is this it? Has it finally been sorted out?' ""But all the letters say is 'sorry, sorry'. It's frustrating. I try to put it at the back of my mind, but it's hard. ""Bring it to an end, that's what I'd say to the government. We can't keep going on month after month, year after year like this. ""My husband's not here to see it and he would have just wanted to enjoy ourselves."" She has had the backing of her local MP, Labour Shadow Welsh Secretary Nia Griffith: ""Former Roadchef workers and their families, like Mrs Nicholls, need to get this money that is owed to them as soon as possible. The share fund dispute is ""scandalous"" says Llanelli MP Nia Griffith ""It is scandalous that they have had to wait so long."" The company Roadchef said the share scheme trust established in the 1980s operates independently and it is not involved in the management of REBTL. It stressed it continues to ""support the trustees' efforts to resolve this matter"". A statement on the firm's website added: ""Subsequent delays relating to taxation have been a source of frustration for all concerned, and we hope to see a resolution as soon as possible."" An official for HM Revenue and Customs told BBC Wales: ""Due to taxpayer confidentiality, we cannot comment on the specifics of the case, but are working to bring it to a conclusion.""

Bar closed for 'blatant disregard' of Covid rules,"The premises licence holder failed to co-operate fully, the council said A bar has been ordered to shut for ""blatantly disregarding"" social distancing measures. Wolverhampton City Council said Blossoms in the city centre ""regularly failed to identify and implement adequate control measures"". Capacity levels at the venue in North Street have been ""continually exceeded"", the local authority added. The bar's licence holder also failed to co-operate with the police and the council, officers said. Officers at the council will work with the venue to ""implement a scenario where the premises can safely reopen"". Councillor Steve Evans said: ""The licence holder's actions are causing a serious and imminent threat to public health. ""The closure of the premises is in response to regular and serious breaches of social distancing as well as other inadequate controls resulting in the potential spread of coronavirus."" He said the council was taking a ""zero-tolerance approach to those who flout the rules"". Supt Simon Inglis said: ""We do not make decisions to support such closure action lightly as we recognise the impact on the local economy and the wider community. ""However, it is absolutely clear that the way the venue is currently being run presents a significant risk to public health and preventing further harm has to take priority.""

Trump refuses to condemn Russia over Navalny,"Nato says there is ""proof beyond doubt"" that Mr Navalny was attacked with a nerve agent President Donald Trump has refused to condemn Russia over the poisoning of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, saying he has not seen proof. He said the case was ""tragic"" but urged reporters to focus instead on China, which he said was a bigger threat to the world than Russia. Nato and Germany say there is ""proof beyond doubt"" that Mr Navalny was attacked with a Novichok nerve agent. His team says he was poisoned on the Kremlin's orders. Russia denies this. On Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry suggested that if a Novichok-type nerve agent had indeed been used, it did not necessarily originate in Russia. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? Mr Navalny - an anti-corruption campaigner who has long been the most prominent face of opposition to President Vladimir Putin in Russia - is in a coma in a Berlin hospital having been airlifted there from Siberia, where he fell ill. Speaking at a press event on Friday, he said he had yet to see evidence of poisoning in the case. ""So I don't know exactly what happened. I think it's tragic, it's terrible, it shouldn't happen. We haven't had any proof yet but I will take a look,"" he said. He also stopped short of criticising Mr Putin and said Beijing posed a greater threat. ""It is interesting that everybody's always mentioning Russia and I don't mind you mentioning Russia but I think probably China at this point is a nation that you should be talking about much more so,"" he said. Tests at a military laboratory in Germany show ""beyond doubt"" the presence of a Novichok nerve agent, the German government and Nato say. On Friday Nato called for Russia to disclose its Novichok nerve agent programme to international monitors. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said members were united in condemning the ""horrific"" attack on Mr Navalny. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Trump campaign Russia ties were 'grave threat' Mr Stoltenberg said it required an international response, but gave no further details. The US National Security Council has pledged to ""work with allies and the international community to hold those in Russia accountable"". The brief statement released by the foreign ministry on Saturday noted ""multiple hostile statements made against Russia"" over Mr Navalny's illness. But experts in Western states and Nato had, it said, for years worked on compounds used to make Novichok,externalnerve agents. ""For example, in the USA, over 150 patents were officially issued to developers of technologies for their combat use,"" the foreign ministry said. Under the 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention, Russia and the US committed themselves to eliminating all of their nerve agents and other chemical weapons. TheUS is expected to destroy its final stockpile by the end of 2023,externalwhileRussia officially completed the process in 2017,external However, Western diplomats and intelligence officials allege that the Salisbury attack in 2018 exposed systematic attempts by Russia to cheat on the convention as well as deceive the international community. Salisbury 'shows' Russia stockpiling weapons The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any involvement in Mr Navalny's case. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Germany had not yet shared any findings with Moscow prosecutors and said Russia had ""nothing to hide"". Meanwhile a toxicologist in Omsk - where Mr Navalny was initially treated after the plane he was flying on made an emergency landing - insisted no poison had been found by doctors who examined him there. ""Any external factors could have triggered a sudden deterioration. Even a simple lack of breakfast,"" said Alexander Sabayev, chief toxicologist for the Omsk region. He fell ill last month while on a flight from Siberia to Moscow. The plane made an emergency landing in Omsk and Russian officials were persuaded to allow him to be airlifted to Germany two days later. A nerve agent from the Novichok group identified by Germany in the Navalny case was also used to poison ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. They both survived but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the poison. Britain accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack in Salisbury. As part of a co-ordinated response, 20 countries expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats and spies. Russia denied any involvement.

Portugal quarantine rules come into forceThose travellers arriving in Scotland from Portugal or French Polynesia must now self-isolate.Scotland,"Portugal had previously been removed from the UK's quarantine list on 20 August Travellers arriving in Scotland from Portugal will have to self-isolate for 14 days under new quarantine rules that came into force on Saturday morning. Scotland and Wales haveadded the country to their ""quarantine list"",external- while England and Northern Ireland have not. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was a confusing position but the Scottish government insisted it was acting on scientific advice. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? The rules became effective from 04:00. French Polynesia is also now on Scotland's list of countries requiring quarantine, while self-isolation rules for Greece have been operating since Thursday. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the decision to add Portugal came after coronavirus cases there rose above 20 per 100,000 of the population. Mr Yousaf said: ""We are in the midst of a global pandemic and the situation in many countries can change suddenly. ""Therefore, people should think very hard before committing to non-essential travel abroad. ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases is a significant risk to public health."" The Scottish government was also closely monitoring the situation in Gibraltar, he added. But the move was questioned by UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps who told the BBC the Scottish government had decided to ""jump  the gun"" earlier in the week by adding Greece to its quarantine list without using data from the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC). On Portugal, he said the decision had failed to take into account the increased level of testing. He said the positivity rate - the proportion of positive tests - was  lower than it was when Portugal was added to the travel corridor list. A spokesman for the Scottish government, however, said Mr Shapps made his decision to keep Portugal on the travel corridor list before studying the latest JBC data. Travellers returning to Scotland will be required to self-isolate even if they have flown back to an airport in England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson later downplayed the difference between UK nations when questioned during a visit to the West Midlands. While conceding the devolved administrations sometimes have different approaches, he insisted the UK was ""proceeding as one"".

'Critical moment' as students return to university,"Thousands of students are preparing to return to university after the coronavirus lockdown A leading epidemiologist has warned the country is at a ""critical moment"" in the coronavirus pandemic, as students prepare to return to universities. Dame Anne Johnson, of University College London, told the BBC data showed the highest number of detected infections was in young people. It comes after government scientific advisors said ""significant outbreaks"" linked to universities were likely. Universities have said steps are being taken to minimise risks on campuses. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dame Anne, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at UCL, said: ""We are now seeing the highest number of infections or at least detected infections in younger people aged 20 to 29 and also going up to 45-year-olds."" She added that the data was ""not surprising"", as young people, she said, were more likely to have socialised with friends and family after lockdown restrictions were eased. University return 'could spark Covid avalanche' House party concerns amid rise in Covid cases Tougher Covid measures introduced in Bolton The latestfigures from Public Health England,external(PHE) showed the highest coronavirus case rates were among 15 to 44-year-olds. In the regions with the highest overall rates, and with most local authorities on its local lockdown watchlist, young working adults aged between 20 and 29-years-old were most affected. On Saturday, the UK recorded 1,813 new infections, while 12 more people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. Meanwhile, the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, said in a documentpublished on Friday,externalthere was a ""significant risk"" that higher education ""could amplify local and national transmission"". ""It is highly likely that there will be significant outbreaks associated with higher education, and asymptomatic transmission may make these harder to detect,"" the report added. It comes asBolton is placed under tougher coronavirus measuresto stop the rising infection rate, now the highest in England at 99 cases per 100,000 people per week. People aged 18 to 49 account for 90% of cases. And in Leeds officials are urging young peopleto take responsibility for controlling the spread of coronavirusfollowing an increase in house parties in the city. The city has been added to the lockdown watchlist - along with Middlesbrough, South Tyneside, Corby and Kettering - meaning people there could face tougher restrictions if the number of infections continues to increase. Council leader Judith Blake said there had been an increase in music events, house parties and illegal raves, adding fines of Â£10,000 were being issued, and urged caution at a time when university students were set to return. ""We feel there is a bit of a complacency coming in. What we are seeing is the numbers are changing, and actually more young people are testing positive and they are spread around the city,"" she said. Police and the council in Leeds issued seven fines to organisers of illegal raves last weekend Dame Anne told the Today programme it was ""going to be incredibly important to communicate to young people the risks of transmitting coronavirus"", with particular emphasis on maintaining social distancing. She said it should be highlighted ""that we need to avoid those situations where we have a lot of close contact, keep distanced"". ""When we can't do that wear face coverings, wash hands, and isolate when we're sick,"" she said. Dame Anne also stressed the importance of infection control among vulnerable communities, particularly in care homes and hospitals. SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Concerns have also been raised that students could spread the virus when they travel from their family homes to university campuses. Dr Mike Tildesley, an associate professor at the University of Warwick and expert in infection modelling, told BBC Breakfast that the UK was mostly dealing with ""really local"" outbreaks, but the movement of students across the country could cause a wave of infection, especially as they return to families for Christmas. Universities were trying to minimise the risk on campuses with strategies including online teaching, grouping students together within year groups, and putting in place local testing and tracing policies, he said. He said that small group teaching was still happening in person, but would take place inside large lecture theatres to allow for social distancing. The scientific advisory group Sage has advised universities to consider providing dedicated accommodation facilities to enable students who test positive to quarantine and minimise the risk of an outbreak. Universities have also been urged to work with local authorities in addition to conducting their own test and trace programmes. THE NAKED SCIENTISTS:Where did COVID-19 come from?

CBI in 'ghost towns' warning,"City centres could become ""ghost towns"" if the prime minister does not do more to encourage workers to go back to the office, the head of the CBI says. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said allowing staff to work from home had helped keep firms afloat during the pandemic. But as offices stood empty, thousands of local businesses that relied on the passing trade were suffering, she said. It comes as a BBC study found 50 major UK employers had no plans to return all staff to the office full time. Writing in the Daily Mail,,externalDame Carolyn said the UK's offices were ""vital drivers"" of the economy, supporting thousands of local firms, from dry cleaners to sandwich bars. ""The costs of office closure are becoming clearer by the day. Some of our busiest city centres resemble ghost towns, missing the usual bustle of passing trade. ""This comes at a high price for local businesses, jobs and communities,"" she said. No plan for a return to the office for millions Fujitsu announces permanent work-from-home plan She said getting people back into offices and workplaces should be ""as important"" as the return to school, and directly appealed to Boris Johnson to ""do more to build confidence"". This could include using ""effective test and trace"" systems or a campaign to encourage commuters back on to public transport. In July, the government dropped its formal advice that people should work from home if possible. At the time, Boris Johnson told people to ""start to go back to work now if you can"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Dear customers, I face ruin, please come back' However, an increasing number of employers say that home working - which was initially brought in as a temporary measure in lockdown - could become a more permanent state of affairs. The law firm Linklaters said this week that all of its 5,300 staff could spend up to 50% of their time working remotely from now on. Lloyds Banking Group is reviewing its office space needs and working practices after concluding that most of its 65,000 staff have worked effectively from home during the crisis. Others including NatWest, Fujitsu, Facebook, Twitter and HSBC have also said they plan to allow much more flexible working in future. Experts say it could allow firms to cut their rent and utilities costs, while offering employees a better work-life balance. Dame Carolyn acknowledged home working had worked well for many and was likely to remain ""an option"". But she warned of ""serious downsides"" including a lack of opportunities to train young people and foster better work and productivity in certain types of business. The impact on local businesses has also been stark. Sandwich chain Pret a Manger - which relies on a lunchtime work crowd - said in June it was shutting 30 outlets and cutting 1,000 jobs amid a slump in demand. It has also cut its staff's hours. ""It's time for the UK to bring its workplaces back to life or we will look back with regret at the jobs lost, training missed and communities harmed,"" Dame Carolyn said. Some businesses catering to office workers have stayed afloat by adapting the way they operate. Rich Bool, who works for the mobile coffee franchise Cafe2U in Chippenham told the BBC's Wake Up To Money that when offices closed he had to find new ways of approaching his customers. ""Some of that has been actually going to residential streets, where our normal clients ... are at home, working, and asked me to call and deliver to them"". According to Mr Bool, this attracted curious neighbours, who were also working at home and needed a break from the laptop. ""We almost created the new water cooler moment on the pavement,"" he said. Sam Barber, a partner at Workshop, which offers co-working spaces in the centre of Winchester, says she has seen a significant increase in enquiries from people who no longer want to commute to London. She told Wake Up to Money she sees a role for her company in bringing people back into the city centre. ""If we know that we can get people out of their offices, their bedrooms, wherever it is they're working, and into a flexible working space a couple of days a week ...then they're going to be shopping in local shops, they're going to be going to the local coffee shops.""

Capita to shut over a third of offices,"Capita manages London's congestion charge Outsourcing firm Capita is to close over a third of its offices in the UK permanently, the BBC understands. The firm, which is a major government contractor, is to end its leases on almost 100 workplaces. Business lobby group CBI has warned that the fall in office working is damaging city centre economies. It comes as the government prepares tolaunch an advertising campaign encouraging more people to return to workplaces. The BBC understands that Capita, which manages London's congestion charge, has been looking at various measures to help it simplify its business for some time, such as embracing more flexible working, which is supported by its employees. So far, Capita has decided not to renew leases on 25 offices. 'We're at a moment of real change in the world of work' Coronavirus: Campaign to encourage workers back to offices Warnings of 'ghost towns' if staff do not return to the office A Capita spokesman said: ""We take seriously the responsibilities we have to the communities in which we operate and are mindful of the impact that potential office closures could have on small businesses. ""Capita's 45,000 employees work in offices spread right across towns and cities in the UK - we are committed to that continuing both now and in the long term. ""Following dialogue with our employees it has become very clear that they would like to work in a more flexible way, which will involve increased working from home, but they will still spend a significant amount of their time working from offices that are based in the heart of our local communities."" According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents HR professionals, there was a taboo around flexible working prior to the pandemic - but seeing how employees worked from home during the coronavirus lockdown has opened the eyes of many employers. Flexible working is no longer viewed as being taboo by employers, showing a shift from ""presenteeism"" ""It's the biggest experiment we've ever had in homeworking,"" the CIPD's chief executive Peter Cheesetold the BBCin an interview in July. ""Bosses are starting to shift towards judging output, rather than the number of hours spent in front of the computer."" A recent BBC study found 50 major UK employers had no plans to return all staff to the office full time. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keen to reassure the public that it is safe for more people to return to workplaces, the CIPD is more circumspect about ensuring that employees do not feel pressured to do so. The CIPD wants employers to consider: Is returning to the workplace essential? Is it sufficiently safe to do so? Is it mutually agreed with the worker? ""Working from home has proved to be a great success for many individuals and organisations. Recent CIPD research found that a majority of employers believe that homeworkers are either as productive as other workers, or more productive,"" said Mr Cheese. ""However, it's important that all employers take steps to support their employees' mental health and address concerns they may have while they work from home."" The CIPD says managers should be regularly checking in with their staff, discussing their well-being and wherever possible, ensuring decisions over working from home or returning to the workplace ""are based on individual choice and preference"". But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned this week that the thousands of local businesses relying on the passing trade of office workers are suffering. City centres could become ""ghost towns""if employees do not return to work, stressed CBI boss Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. Both the CBI and the CIPD are in favour of using effective test and trace systems. However, an increasing number of employers say that home working - which was initially brought in as a temporary measure in lockdown - could become a more permanent state of affairs. Lloyds Bank is reviewing its office space needs after concluding its staff worked well from home during lockdown The law firm Linklaters said this week that all of its 5,300 staff could spend up to 50% of their time working remotely from now on. Lloyds Banking Group is reviewing its office space needs and working practices after concluding that most of its 65,000 staff have worked effectively from home during the crisis. Others including NatWest, Fujitsu, Facebook, Twitter and HSBC have also said they plan to allow much more flexible working in future. Experts say it could allow firms to cut their rent and utilities costs, while offering employees a better work-life balance. However, the CIPD doesn't feel that masses of white-collar workers will end up working from home permanently as a cost-cutting measure. Instead, it thinks office spaces will become places where just some staff are based, or that employees work in the office at different times and on different days on a rotation, and that the office space will be used more for face-to-face meetings. âWe're at moment of real change in world of workâ Campaign to encourage workers back to offices Warnings of 'ghost towns' if offices stay empty 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

University return 'could spark Covid avalanche',"Universities in the UK are being urged to scrap plans for face-to-face teaching until Christmas in order to prevent a second wave of coronavirus. Academics' union UCU said more than a million students moving around the country was ""a recipe for disaster"". But university bosses say they have worked hard to plan for a safe return to all aspects of student life. It comes as daily recorded cases of coronavirus in the UK reached 1,715 in 24 hours, the highest since early June. Case numbers began edging up again in the UK in July, after falling in June - but are still much lower than the 5,000 new cases a day there were in April, at the peak of the epidemic. Experts say the increase in testing over recent weeks means more people with the virus are being detected. Students back at uni - but with masks and no bars What if I still don't have the place I want? And other questions Is it time for us to move on from coronavirus? asks our medical editor The UCU's Jo Grady says having tens of thousands of students heading into cities across the UK ""risks doing untold damage to people's health and exacerbating the worst public health crisis of our lifetimes"". She told BBC Breakfast the mass migration of a million students could prompt a ""silent avalanche of infections"". ""There is far more of a risk than perhaps the general public has appreciated,"" she said, adding that universities were not prepared and risked becoming the ""care homes of the second wave"". Manchester will welcome around 100,000 students as the new university term begins, Dr Grady said Dr Grady said Manchester would see 100,000 students arriving, Birmingham 80,000, and Leicester 40,000. ""These are all cities that have had some form of local lockdown and have come out of it or are about to go into one,"" she said. And she warned the higher number of students expected at universities this year would make social distancing harder. Universities UK, which represents campus leaders, says many staff want to return to face-to-face teaching and research ""where it is safe and appropriate to do so"". They are mindful of the benefits of in-person teaching and support for students' well-being and development, its president, Prof Julia Buckingham, said. More students than expected are heading to university this autumn after a U-turn saw many achieve the grades they needed The government says it is ""confident that universities are well prepared for the return of students by taking measures such as introducing social distancing on campus, limiting travel requirement for classes and staggering teaching across extended days to reduce numbers on site"". It said guidance is ""under constant review"" to reflect the latest public health advice such as 2m distancing, or 1m plus with measures such as face coverings. Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said universities were aware students returning to campus might be ""a potential flair point for coronavirus infection"" and were taking that risk ""seriously"". He said universities would have their own rules and guidance, with sanctions ""for students who willingly, knowingly break the rules of engagement"". But he citedveterinary students who had already returned to Nottingham, whom he praised for their ""incredibly good"" behaviour and attitude. ""We have to allow these students to get the education that they have worked hard for - and to enjoy university life as much as is possible at the moment,"" he told BBC News. Prof Carl Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, says it is safe for students to return to universities. He told Breakfast that ""right now it is as safe as it ever has been"" to go back to campuses. But he suggested universities could put back face-to-face teaching until the end of the academic year in spring or summer 2021, when the threat from coronavirus might have reduced. ""Can we do something over the summer, can we put a summer school on?"" he asked, adding: ""We need to maximise that [teaching] experience."" The language used by unions is very strong. There are plenty of infectious disease and public health experts who would not paint the threat in such extreme terms. Whenever we hear about risks of a second wave or a sharp rise in cases we need to consider where we have come from. The initial surge happened because the virus was spreading pretty much undetected for a period. It was certainly more widespread than the UK and other countries realised in February and March. By the time lockdown came there were an estimated 100,000 new infections a day in the UK. Today we have over 1,000 confirmed infections a day, on average. Of course some are going undetected, but it is clear the virus is currently under control. As people circulate more - going back to work, schools and university - the likelihood is infections will rise. But everyday life has completely transformed from what it was in February - there are many reasons why a second surge in infections like the first can, and should, be avoided. Students preparing for the new university term can expect changes on campuses - much like those that have affected other aspects of life since March. Strict cleaning measures, lots of hand sanitiser, one-way systems and capacity limits for places such as the library and coffee shop will be common. Close-knit seminars and office hours with lecturers are unlikely to take place face-to-face as they did before. Veterinary science students at the University of Nottingham returned to their studies in July At the University of Leicester, students and staffwill be screened,externalfor Covid-19 from October using a new form of mass testing developed by the institution's academics. Vice-chancellor Prof Nishan Canagrarajah told the BBC Leicester would regularly test as many as 10,000 students and staff to monitor infections throughout the academic year, alongside NHS Test and Trace. There will also be staggered arrival times to prevent all students returning to the city at once, he said. CHILDREN'S RISK:Study shows it is 'tiny' GETTING ABOUT:Is it safe to use public transport? BACK TO SCHOOL:Does my child have to return? Almost all institutions will be making greater use of online teaching methods for students studying non-practical subjects. Aside from studies, Swansea University said plans to keep students safe included ""bubbles"" among flatmates,meaning a ban on parties or having people over to stay. And nights out will look different, too. The University of Sheffield's student union has implemented an ordering app and table service, making its bars less crowded. In Manchester, a student union is building outdoor ""greenhouses"" for drinkers to book in advance. Nightclubs remain closed due to continued national restrictions.

Speedy return to offices 'not possible',"A senior Bank of England official has cast doubt on the government's drive to get workers back to the office as coronavirus curbs are eased. Alex Brazier, the Bank's executive director for financial stability, said a ""sharp return"" to ""dense office environments"" should not be expected. Social distancing guidelines in the workplace and public transport capacity were two factors holding people back. ""We should expect a more phased return,"" he told a committee of MPs. ""I feel safe coming to work, but I quite understand why many people might not,"" he said in evidence to the Treasury Committee. ""It's not possible to use office space, particularly in central London and dense places like that, with the intensity that we used to use it. No plan for a return to the office for millions Warnings of 'ghost towns' if offices stay empty ""It's not possible to bring lots of people back very suddenly."" Mr Brazier's remarks come after the government launched an ad campaign encouraging people togo back to the workplace. Business leaders have warned of economic damage being done to city centres as people stay away from offices. Last week, head of the CBI Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the prime minister needed to do more to get workers to return, warning of a ""high price for local businesses, jobs and communities"". Some have warned city centres could become ""ghost towns"" However, an increasing number of employers say that home working - which was initially brought in as a temporary measure during lockdown - could become a more permanent state of affairs. The law firm Linklaters, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest, Fujitsu, Capita and Facebook are among those who plan to allow much more flexible working in the future. Meanwhile,50 of the biggest UK employers questioned by the BBCsaid they had no plans to return all staff to the office full-time in the near future. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place. This week, the government launched a campaign asking employers to reassure staff it is safe to return by highlighting measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19. But there was confusion when Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he cared more about how employees performed than where they were working, contradicting other ministers. Campaign to encourage workers back to offices On Wednesday, during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Boris Johnson made several references to the need to get people back to work, saying he and his colleagues were working to get the country and the economy ""back on its feet"". The PM's spokesman recently said: ""The message from the PM is he recognises the importance that returning to work has in stimulating the economy, and that's why we have changed the guidance to give employers more discretion in how employees can work safely.""

"House party concerns amid rise in Covid casesLast weekend seven Â£10,000 fines were handed out to the organisers of illegal raves in Leeds.Leeds & West Yorkshire","Police and the council issued seven fines to organisers of illegal raves last weekend Young people in Leeds are being urged to take responsibility for controlling the spread of coronavirus following an increase in house parties in the city. Leeds was added to the Public Health England areas of concern as Covid rates rose to 32.5 cases per 100,000 people. Council leader Judith Blake said there had been an increase in music events, house parties and illegal raves adding fines of Â£10,000 were being given. She urged caution at a time when university students were set to return. More stories from around Yorkshire The city council said infections were broadly spread across its local communities, suggesting they were linked to social and leisure activities rather than single sites - with increasing numbers among people aged between 18 and 34. Ms Blake said it was premature to talk about a lockdown at this stage but the city was approaching a tipping point and restrictions would be considered. ""Unfortunately we have seen a rise in house parties, but we are working with police,"" Ms Blake said. ""Last weekend we issued, with the police, seven of the Â£10,000 fines for organisers of illegal raves."" The fines are part of newly-introduced legislation aimed at deterring illegal music events. Elsewhere in West Yorkshire, Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale feature on Public Health England's watchlist of areas that have seen infection rates increase. Police issued a photograph of one event was shut down last weekend in Kitson Road, Leeds, following reports that it was in breach of coronavirus restrictions. ""We feel there is a bit of complacency coming in,"" Ms Blake said. ""This virus isn't going to be contained just among younger people. ""The fact is that the social distancing measures have been working, but if we relax and it starts to spread back into the older more vulnerable communities we are going to see increased hospitalisation and all the things we saw at the beginning of the virus."" SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? She said the council had been working with the universities ahead of the return of students later this month. ""We want to really get across that the virus is still with us,"" Ms Blake said.

Schools 'no greater risk' for children and staffTests also found similar levels of antibodies to coronavirus in pupils and teachers in English schools.,"Attending primary school puts children and staff at no greater risk of contracting coronavirus than staying at home, a study of 131 schools suggests. Tests to find out who had already had the virus found similar levels of antibodies in pupils and teachers. But the study, of 12,000 adults and children in England, was carried out in June and early July, when there were very few cases around. Experts say more studies are needed, when all children are attending school. This video can not be played BBC Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what schools are doing to keep pupils safe For the study, pupils and staff were tested during the last six weeks of the summer term when Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children could return to school. Since then, millions of children across the UKhave returned to the classroom,with lessons resuming in England and Wales in the past few days. Schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland reopened last month. Schools now look very different to what students were once used to, with pupils being told to stay in their ""bubble"" groups, follow one-way systems and social distance when necessary. Staggered start times have also been introduced, and hand-washing stations and screens installed. Bubbles vary widely between schools. Some primary schools treat each class as a separate bubble, while secondary schools often have bubbles composed of entire year groups - sometimes of up to 300 children. Children with a new classroom lay-out at a school in Southwark, south London Scientists from Public Health England, who ledthe study,external, found just three people (one child and two staff) tested positive for the virus - 0.02% of those swabbed. There was no evidence that any of these three people passed the virus on to others they lived with or worked with. This reflectsprevious research by PHE showing low numbers of cases and outbreaks in schools,external. A separate sample of 2,100 staff and children, who were tested for antibodies, found 10.6% of pupils and 12.7% of staff had previously had coronavirus. This could suggest that children are as likely as adults to be infected, rather than being less susceptible to the disease. But because so few positive cases in children are detected, it confirms previous research that they are likely to experience mild symptoms, or none at all. The study found children and staff who attended school more frequently were no more likely to test positive for antibodies than those who did not attend school, or went less often. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic EUROPE LOCKDOWN:How is it being lifted? This could indicate that infection levels in schools are simply reflecting virus levels in the communities where people live. However, some groups were more likely to have antibodies - they were non-white, lived in the same house as a healthcare worker and had experienced symptoms. Secondary schools were not included in the study, so no conclusions can be drawn about older children. Dr Shamez Ladhani, consultant epidemiologist, from Public Health England said: ""This is the largest study of its kind in the country and suggests attending preschool and primary school brings no additional risk to either staff or students. ""Although these results are preliminary, they should be very reassuring to parents who may be anxious about their children returning to school."" Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer and consultant paediatrician, from Imperial College London, said it was a ""good quality study"" but ""limited by timing"" as there was very low transmission of coronavirus during the period studied. ""It is essential that studies such as these continue over the next few months, and importantly, are also performed in secondary school and college settings,"" she added. Williamson says A-levels and GCSEs likely to be later next summer Labour calls for delays to next summer's exams Next year's exams will need to be slimmed down, say head teachers Prof Ravindra Gupta, professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, cautioned that schools would now be coping with two to six times more children, which could alter the results. ""There is less ability to socially distance than schools were able to in June. We must not be complacent and falsely reassured. We must ensure adequate monitoring and testing strategies to pick up infections in schools before they spread,"" he said. Regarding the finding that children were often asymptomatic, Prof Gupta said that meant ""children may still continue to attend school if we do not regularly test for the virus in schools"".

Professor who posed as black 'won't teach classes',"George Washington University said Jessica Krug would not teach this semester A US academic who said she lied about being black will not teach classes this semester, George Washington University has confirmed. Jessica Krug, an associate professor whose work focuses on Africa and the African diaspora, admitted in a blog post that she was in fact a ""white Jewish"" woman from Kansas City. The post read: ""I have built my life on a violent anti-black lie."" Her colleagues said they were ""shocked and appalled"" by her admission. In a Medium post published on Thursday,Ms Krug said she had falsely assumed identities ""that I had no right to claim,external: first North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness"". In a statement, George Washington Universitysaid Ms Krug would not teach classes,externaland acknowledged ""many students, faculty, staff and alumni are hurting."" It said it was ""reviewing"" the case. Her employment status at the university is unknown. Ms Krug has not commented. White US professor says she lied about being black Rachel Dolezal: 'I identify as black' Ms Krug's colleagues at GWU's Department of History released a joint statement calling for her to resign from her post or for the university to remove her tenure. ""She hasbetrayed the trust of countless current and former students,external, fellow scholars of Africana Studies, colleagues in our department and throughout the historical discipline, as well as community activists in New York City and beyond,"" the statement said. ""The discipline of history is concerned with truth telling about the past. With her conduct, Dr. Krug has raised questions about the veracity of her own research and teaching."" A student at GWU who wasdue to start Ms Krug's class on Latin American history,externalon Monday told the Washington Post: ""It just breaks my heart that these students came in, very bright-eyed and eager, to learn about Latin heritage and the history. We all placed a lot of trust in her."" Ms Krug's academic work includes the 2018 book ""Fugitive Modernities: Kisama and the Politics of Freedom"", focuses on the politics and culture of African and African diaspora societies. Her case bears strong parallels to race activist Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who claimed to be black. After her parents outed her in 2015, she said she ""identified as black"". This video can not be played ""The idea of race is a lie"" - Rachel Dolezal speaks to Emily Maitlis Ms Krug described her behaviour as ""the very epitome of violence, of thievery and appropriation, of the myriad ways in which non-Black people continue to use and abuse Black identities and cultures."" She added that she had continued the pretence even in her personal relationships. She cited mental health issues and trauma experienced in her early years, although she said this was not an excuse for her actions. According to media reports, Ms Krug also used the name Jessica La Bombalera as an activist.

Russia Covid-19 vaccine 'triggers immune response',"A vaccine created in Russia has shown signs of an immune response, according to a report Russian scientists have published the first report on their coronavirus vaccine, saying early tests showed signs of an immune response. The report published by medical journal The Lancet said every participant developed antibodies to fight the virus and had no serious side effects. Russia licensed the vaccine for local use in August, the first country to do so and before data had been published. Experts say the trials were too small to prove effectiveness and safety. But Moscow has hailed the results as an answer to critics. Some Western experts have raised concerns about the speed of Russia's work, suggesting that researchers might be cutting corners. Last month,President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checksand that one of his own daughters had been given it. Two trials of the vaccine, named Sputnik-V, were conducted between June and July,,externalThe Lancet paper said. Each involved 38 healthy volunteers who were given a dose of the vaccine and then a booster vaccine three weeks later. The participants - aged between 18 and 60 - were monitored for 42 days and all of them developed antibodies within three weeks. Among the most common side effects were headaches and joint pain. The trials were open label and not randomised, meaning there was no placebo and the volunteers were aware they were receiving the vaccine. ""Large, long-term trials including a placebo comparison, and further monitoring are needed to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for preventing Covid-19 infection,"" the report said. Russia rejects mounting Covid-19 vaccine concerns Russia plans mass vaccination for October A third phase of trials will involve 40,000 volunteers from ""different age and risk groups,"" according to the paper. The Russian vaccine uses adapted strains of the adenovirus, a virus that usually causes the common cold, to trigger an immune response. By Philippa Roxby, BBC health reporter ""Encouraging"" and ""so far so good"" are some of the reactions from scientists in the UK - but there is still, clearly, a long way to go. Although the vaccine showed an antibody response in all participants in phase 2, this does not necessarily mean it would protect them from the virus. That still has not been established yet. From these results, we can tell that the vaccine appeared to be safe in healthy people between the age of 18 and 60 for 42 days, because that was how long the study lasted. But what about older people and those with underlying health conditions who are most at risk of Covid-19 - how safe is it for them and over a longer period of time? This can only be answered after much larger, long-term randomised trials where the people taking part do not know if they are receiving the vaccine or a dummy injection. These will also tell scientists how effective the vaccine really is among a much wider population. There have also been calls for openness and transparency. Of the many vaccines currently being trialled around the world, some will work better than others in certain situations and in certain groups of people, perhaps. So knowing exactly how well they work and for whom is paramount - it is unlikely that one vaccine will be suitable for everyone. Kirill Dmitriev, head of a Russian investment fund behind the vaccine, said during a news conference that the report was ""a powerful response to the sceptics who unreasonably criticised the Russian vaccine"". He said that 3,000 people had already been recruited for the next phase of trials. Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said the country would start vaccinations from November or December, with a focus on high-risk groups. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? But experts warned that there was still a long way to go until a vaccine could enter the market. Brendan Wen, Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis at London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Reuters news agency: ""The report is a case of 'so far, so good'"". According to the World Health Organization, there are 176 potential vaccines currently being developed worldwide. Of those, 34 are currently being tested on people. Among those, eight are at stage three, the most advanced.

Newspapers delayed as XR blocks printing presses,"Protesters gathered outside the sites - including Broxbourne in Hertfordshire - owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists have delayed the distribution of several national newspapers after blocking access to three printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch. Protesters targeted Newsprinters presses at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, Knowsley in Merseyside, and near Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the action by demonstrators across the country was ""unacceptable"". Eighty people have been arrested. XR used vehicles along with individual protesters chaining themselves to structures to block roads to the presses The Sun tweeted to report copies of the paper would be delayed arriving at newsagents, adding the blockade was an ""attack on all the free press"".

They also print the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, and the London Evening Standard. Demonstrators have accused the papers of failing to report on climate change. XR used vehicles to block roads to the printing plants, while individual protesters chained themselves to structures. Vans were covered with banners with messages including ""Free the truth"" and ""Refugees are welcome here"". Some protesters chained themselves to bamboo structures to block the road outside the building in Hertfordshire Boris Johnson saidon Twitter,external: ""A free press is vital in holding the government and other powerful institutions to account on issues critical for the future of our country, including the fight against climate change. ""It is completely unacceptable to seek to limit the public's access to news in this way."" Shadow Secretary of State for Digital Culture, Media and Sport, Jo Stephens, said: ""People have the right to read the newspapers they want. ""Stopping them from being distributed and printers from doing their jobs is wrong."" And Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted the overnight action by XR was an ""attack on democracy"". Newsprinters also condemned the protests as an ""attack on all of the free press"", which it said had affected workers going about their jobs and others such as newsagents who faced ""financial penalty"". ""Thanks to other industry partners, printing was transferred to other sites,"" it said. A protest near Motherwell passed peacefully with no arrests, police said Telegraph editor Chris Evans earlier emailed staff to say that although the paper was not XR's primary target, it was ""severely affected"". He told them: ""I'm also very concerned - and I hope you are too - by the attack on free speech. ""Whatever your politics you should be worried by this. There are also questions for the police who perhaps placed the right of these few people to protest above the right of the rest of the people to read a free press."" Hertfordshire Police said officers were called to Great Eastern Road near the Broxbourne plant at about 22:00 BST, where they found about 100 protesters who had ""secured themselves to structures and one another"". By 06:00 delivery lorries had still been unable to leave the site to distribute papers. Officers said 50 people had been arrested on suspicion of causing a public nuisance. Protesters at the Knowsley site had been cleared by about 10:30 BST Chief Constable Charlie Hall said the group's action had been ""an intentionally disruptive and unacceptable protest that had been pre-planned and carefully co-ordinated to create prolonged disruption to local businesses"". Hertfordshire officers arrived ""within five minutes of the initial report"", he said, however, ""the nature of the protest required highly specialist resources and cutting equipment in order to safely remove the protesters from their locations"". Each one had to be individually released from a bamboo structure they had erected, Mr Hall added. Although business had resumed at the site, he said officers would remain there to monitor the area. Merseyside Policetweeted,externalon Saturday morning that officers were at the Knowsley plant. The site had been cleared of protesters by about 10:30 and 30 people had been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass. Police Scotland said in a statement the protest at the Eurocentral plant near Motherwell ""was peaceful and there were no issues"". XR has accused the newspapers and their owners of ""failure to report on the climate and ecological emergency"" and ""polluting national debate"" on dozens of social issues. The Federation of Independent Retailers condemned the demonstrations, saying members left without supplies of papers were having ""to deal with angry customers who are unable to get their daily newspaper"". National president Stuart Reddish said it also meant retailers were unable to get papers to elderly and vulnerable customers. ""Newsagents have played a critical role during Covid-19 in getting newspapers into the hands of readers and this is not helpful at a time when every sale counts,"" he added. Extinction Rebellion accused some of the papers of failing to report on climate change Extinction Rebellion has planned 10 days of action and is calling on the government to do more to act on climate change. In an updated statement following the latest protest, a spokesman said: ""We are in an emergency of unprecedented scale and the papers we have targeted are not reflecting the scale and urgency of what is happening to our planet. ""To any small businesses disrupted by the action this morning we say, 'we're sorry. We hope that our actions seem commensurate with the severity of the crisis we face and that this day of disruption successfully raises the alarm about the greater disruption that is coming'."" On Thursday,more than 300 people were arrestedduring protests in central London. Meanwhile, climate change protesters have been warned they risk large fines if they fail to comply with coronavirus rules banning gatherings of more than 30 people. A procession of activists that set off walking from Brighton a week ago was due to march the final stretch to Parliament later. The Met Police said risk assessments of the march in Westminster ""did not meet the required standard"" and have banned XR from taking a 20ft model boat named after teenage activist Greta Thunberg to the streets of Westminster. At about 14:45 on Saturday a group accompanying the boat posted a video on social media saying members had been ""stopped on the A3 just after Kennington Park, by a lot of police and 14 police vans"". XR protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square in London had been largely dispersed, police said, and a spokeswoman for the Met Police said officers were also in Euston where a protester had locked themselves to a crane.

Trump bans 'anti-American' diversity training,"The president has previously said he does not believe the US has a systemic racism problem US President Donald Trump has ordered federal agencies to stop racial sensitivity training, labelling it ""divisive, anti-American propaganda"". A memo to government agencies says it has come to his attention that millions of dollars of taxpayers' money have funded such ""trainings"". The document says these sessions only foster resentment in the workforce. Mr Trump has previously said he does not believe systemic racism is a problem in the US. The memo comes amid the social justice protests that have swept the nation in recent months. 'They push black people out and replace us with BLM signs' They filmed police brutality - then faced a backlash Friday's two-page document from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought,externalis addressed to the heads of federal executive departments and agencies. ""All agencies are directed to begin to identify all contracts or other agency spending related to any training on 'critical race theory,' 'white privilege,' or any other training or propaganda effort that teaches or suggests either (1) that the United States is an inherently racist or evil country or (2) that any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil,"" it says. This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? The memo says that ""according to press reports, employees across the Executive Branch have been required to attend trainings where they are told that 'virtually all White people contribute to racism' or where they are required to say that they 'benefit from racism'."" Again citing press reports, the text says that some of the training sessions ""have further claimed that there is racism embedded in the belief that America is the land of opportunity or the belief that the most qualified person should receive a job. ""These types of 'trainings' not only run counter to the fundamental beliefs for which our Nation has stood since its inception, but they also engender division and resentment within the Federal workforce."" It was not clear which reports Mr Vought was referring to or what prompted the memo. But such training sessions have been highlighted by the Discovery Institute, a conservative non-profit think tank based in Seattle. This video can not be played One thing Americans find hard to talk about Chris Rufo, one of its research fellows, told Fox News this week that the US Department of Treasury is among federal agencies that have hired such trainers. Mr Rufo says his public records requests show these sessions have included teaching employees that white people uphold America's system of racism, and sending white male executives to mandatory training in which they write letters of apology to minorities. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who will challenge Mr Trump for the White House in November, has vowed to fight systemic racism if elected. ""For generations, Americans who are black, brown, Native American, immigrant, haven't always been fully included in our democracy or our economy,"" the former vice-president said in July.

"Trump panned over reports he mocked US militaryA magazine claims the president called US soldiers killed in action ""losers"", something he denies.US & Canada","The US president has dismissed the reports as ""fake news"" US President Donald Trump is facing a backlash over reports he mocked American soldiers killed in action as ""losers"" and ""suckers"". The alleged remarks were first reported in the Atlantic magazine,external, and some details were corroborated by the Associated Press and Fox News. But the president and his allies have denied he made the remarks. Veterans' groups were among those who attacked the president over the reports. Progressive group VoteVetsposted a video of families whose children were killed in action.,external""You don't know what it is to sacrifice,"" says one. Paul Rieckhoff of the Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America,tweeted,external: ""Who is really surprised by this?"" Analysts say the comments could prove damaging with the president needing support from military voters as he bids for re-election. According to The Atlantic, Mr Trump cancelled a visit to a US cemetery outside Paris in 2018 because he said it was ""filled with losers"". Four sources told the magazine he rejected the idea of visiting because the rain would dishevel his hair, and he did not believe it important to honour America's war dead. Trump loves the military. Do they love him back? Trump says famed military newspaper will not close During the same trip, the president also allegedly referred to 1,800 US soldiers who died at Belleau Wood as ""suckers"". The battle helped to prevent a German advance on Paris during World War One and is venerated by the US Marine Corps. The Atlantic's reporting was based on anonymous sources but theAssociated Press said it had independently confirmed many of the remarks,external. A Fox News correspondent said she had corroborated some of the remarks. In 2018the White House said the visit was cancelled because bad weather had grounded the president's helicopter.This account was backed up in a recent book by President Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump. The US Navy also said it cancelled the trip to the cemeterybecause of rain,externalin response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act from Buzzfeed reporter Jason Leopold. On top of the comments from veterans, President Trump's challenger in November's presidential election, Joe Biden, responded by saying his rival was ""unfit"" to lead. ""If the article is true - and it appears to be, based on other things he's said - it is absolutely damning. It is a disgrace."" This video can not be played Trump and the US military: Friends or foe? Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, a veteran who lost both legs while serving in Iraq, said President Trump ""liked to use the US military for his own ego"". Khizr Khan, the father of a US soldier killed in Iraqwho criticised Mr Trump during the 2016 Democratic convention, joined Ms Duckworth on the call. He said: ""When Donald Trump calls anyone who places their lives in service of others a loser, we understand Trump's soul."" President Trump has pushed back hard against the reports, calling them ""fake news"". ""To think that I would make statements negative to our military and our fallen heroes when nobody's done what I've done with the budgets, with the military budgets, with getting pay raises for our military,"" he said. ""It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that's a terrible magazine."" Speaking to reporters on Friday, he suggested the source of the story was his former White House chief of staff, John Kelly. Mr Trump said the former US Marine general ""was unable to handle the pressure of this job"". Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Friday morning he was with the president for a good part of the trip to France and never heard him use the words described in the article. Defense Secretary Mark Esper was quoted by Politico as saying Mr Trump had ""the highest respect and admiration for our nation's military members, veterans and families"", though the Pentagon chief did not explicitly deny the story. Another former White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were among those in Mr Trump's orbit who rejected the story as false. The US president has often staked claim to strong support among the military, and Pew Research Center last year found that veterans were generally supportive of him as commander-in-chief,with 57% in favour.,externalThree-fifths of the veterans identified as Republican, the research found. But there have been previous spats and controversies. He caused outrage by saying the late Senator John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, was not a ""war hero"" saying: ""I like people who weren't captured."" President Trump has never served in uniform. He received five deferments from a military draft during the Vietnam War - four for academic reasons and one for bone spurs, a calcium build-up in the heels.

"Earth's 'lost species' only the tip of the icebergHundreds of mammals will go extinct if we do not act now to address biodiversity loss, say scientists.","An endangered white-handed gibbon: The right conservation strategies can save the day Scientists have calculated how many mammals might be lost this century, based on fossil evidence of past extinctions. Their predictions suggest at least 550 species will follow in the footsteps of the mammoth and sabre-toothed cat. With every ""lost species"" we lose part of the Earth's natural history, they say. Yet, despite these ""grim"" projections, we can save hundreds of species by stepping up conservation efforts. Thenew research,external, published in the journal Science Advances, suggests that humans are almost entirely responsible for extinctions of mammals in past decades. And rates will escalate in the future if we don't take action now. Despite this ""alarming"" scenario, we could save hundreds if not thousands of species with more targeted and efficient conservation strategies, said Tobias Andermann of the Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre and the University of Gothenburg. In order to achieve this, we must increase our collective awareness about the ""looming escalation of the biodiversity crisis, and take action in combatting this global emergency"". ""Time is pressing,"" he said. ""With every lost species, we irreversibly lose a unique portion of Earth's natural history."" A mammoth skull at auction in New York City: Many more could follow this extinct species' path The scientists compiled a large dataset of fossils, which provided evidence for the timing and scale of recent extinctions. Their computer-based simulations predict large increases in extinction rates by the year 2100, based on the current threat status of species. Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate 'Billions of years of evolutionary history' under threat Nature crisis: Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' According to these models, the extinctions that have occurred in past centuries only represent the tip of the iceberg, compared with the looming extinctions of the next decades. ""Reconstructing our past impacts on biodiversity is essential to understand why some species and ecosystems have been particularly vulnerable to human activities - which can hopefully allow us to develop more effective conservation actions to combat extinction,"" said Prof Samuel Turvey of ZSL (Zoological Society of London). Last year an intergovernmental panel of scientists saidone million animal and plant species were now threatened with extinction.

Jacob Blake makes court appearance from hospital,"This video can not be played Jacob Blake makes court appearance from hospital bed Jacob Blake, the black man whose shooting by police triggered protests, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges filed prior to the incident. Mr Blake, who is in hospital paralysed, is accused of criminal trespass, sexual assault and disorderly conduct based on statements by his former girlfriend. The criminal complaint was filed in July, and is unrelated to the shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on 23 August. A trial over the complaint is set to begin later this year. According to the criminal complaint, Mr Blake is accused ofsexually assaulting a woman in May,external. The woman told officers that Mr Blake, 29, took her car keys and a debit card before fleeing the scene. According to Kenosha County District Attorney's Office, these were the charges Mr Blake was wanted for at the time of the 23 August shooting. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting Two incidents, two different police responses On Friday Mr Blake, was in his hospital bed as he appeared via Zoom to plead not guilty. But a local commissioner decided that there was enough evidence to send the matter to trial. The criminal complaint did not identify Mr Blake's former girlfriend by name. A police officer shot Mr Blake seven times in the back during an arrest as he tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. The Kenosha police union says Mr Blake was carrying a knife; investigators said a knife was later found on the floor of his car. According to ABC News, police were called to the area torespond to a domestic violence report,external. Wisconsin's Attorney-General Josh Kaul said officers had been called to an address after a woman reported that ""her boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises"". While there, they tried to arrest Mr Blake, initially using a Taser.

Cases 'remain unchanged' in England,"The level of coronavirus among the community in England remains ""unchanged"" for the week to 25 August, the Office for National Statistics suggests. Its latest survey of people in households estimates there were around 2,000 new cases of coronavirus per day. This suggests that, despite outbreaks in some local areas, overall case numbers remain stable. The ONS figures,externalgive one of the most accurate pictures of infections levels. They are based on more than 151,000 swab tests collected from people at home, whether they have symptoms or not. But there is always a margin for error in the figures because over the past six weeks of the study very few people have tested positive - just 71 from 68 households. The figures also do not cover what is going on in hospitals or care homes, where infection rates are likely to be different. However, they continue to paint a picture of a stable level of infections among private households in England. How do I get a coronavirus test? Covid testing boss 'very sorry' for shortages As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again 'Upset stomach' in children may be coronavirus The ONS estimates that 27,100 people in the community had the virus during that week from 19 to 25 August. This is similar to the estimate for the previous week and several weeks before that. In Wales, during the week to 25 August, 1,400 people are estimated to have had Covid-19 - also unchanged from previous weeks. A different kind of test - an antibody test, using blood samples - which looks for evidence of people having previously had the infection, has been carried out on 7,000 people as part of the ONS study. Results suggest that around 6% of the population - or one in 17 people - have been infected with the coronavirus in the past. This equates to 2.7 million people in England. The R number for the UK is between 0.9 and 1.1, say the government's scientific advisors, which means the number of people with the virus is staying at a constant level. The reproduction number or R is the average number of people that one infected person passes the virus onto. An R number of 1 means that on average every person who is infected will infect one other person, meaning the total number of infections is stable. This estimate of R is a guide to the general trend rather than a description of what is happening today. The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, said the ONS data showed that the government's approach, using contact tracing and local restrictions, was working and was helping the country ""to safely return to normal"". ""This reassuring news is testament to the hard work of everybody in following social distancing guidelines to protect themselves, their loved ones and the NHS."" Mr Hancock added: ""I would urge everybody to continue to be vigilant - wash your hands, wear a face covering and keep social distance from those outside your household - so we can keep the virus at bay.""

Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said allowing staff to work from home had helped keep firms afloat during the pandemic. But as offices stood empty, thousands of local businesses that relied on the passing trade were suffering, she said. It comes as a BBC study found 50 major UK employers had no plans to return all staff to the office full time. Writing in the Daily Mail,,externalDame Carolyn said the UK's offices were ""vital drivers"" of the economy, supporting thousands of local firms, from dry cleaners to sandwich bars. ""The costs of office closure are becoming clearer by the day. Some of our busiest city centres resemble ghost towns, missing the usual bustle of passing trade. ""This comes at a high price for local businesses, jobs and communities,"" she said. No plan for a return to the office for millions Fujitsu announces permanent work-from-home plan She said getting people back into offices and workplaces should be ""as important"" as the return to school, and directly appealed to Boris Johnson to ""do more to build confidence"". This could include using ""effective test and trace"" systems or a campaign to encourage commuters back on to public transport. In July, the government dropped its formal advice that people should work from home if possible. At the time, Boris Johnson told people to ""start to go back to work now if you can"".

The law firm Linklaters said this week that all of its 5,300 staff could spend up to 50% of their time working remotely from now on. Lloyds Banking Group is reviewing its office space needs and working practices after concluding that most of its 65,000 staff have worked effectively from home during the crisis. Others including NatWest, Fujitsu, Facebook, Twitter and HSBC have also said they plan to allow much more flexible working in future. Experts say it could allow firms to cut their rent and utilities costs, while offering employees a better work-life balance. Dame Carolyn acknowledged home working had worked well for many and was likely to remain ""an option"". But she warned of ""serious downsides"" including a lack of opportunities to train young people and foster better work and productivity in certain types of business. The impact on local businesses has also been stark. Sandwich chain Pret a Manger - which relies on a lunchtime work crowd - said in June it was shutting 30 outlets and cutting 1,000 jobs amid a slump in demand. It has also cut its staff's hours. ""It's time for the UK to bring its workplaces back to life or we will look back with regret at the jobs lost, training missed and communities harmed,"" Dame Carolyn said. Some businesses catering to office workers have stayed afloat by adapting the way they operate. Rich Bool, who works for the mobile coffee franchise Cafe2U in Chippenham told the BBC's Wake Up To Money that when offices closed he had to find new ways of approaching his customers. ""Some of that has been actually going to residential streets, where our normal clients ... are at home, working, and asked me to call and deliver to them"". According to Mr Bool, this attracted curious neighbours, who were also working at home and needed a break from the laptop. ""We almost created the new water cooler moment on the pavement,"" he said. Sam Barber, a partner at Workshop, which offers co-working spaces in the centre of Winchester, says she has seen a significant increase in enquiries from people who no longer want to commute to London. She told Wake Up to Money she sees a role for her company in bringing people back into the city centre. ""If we know that we can get people out of their offices, their bedrooms, wherever it is they're working, and into a flexible working space a couple of days a week ...then they're going to be shopping in local shops, they're going to be going to the local coffee shops.""

Tests boss 'very sorry' for shortages,"Bosses in charge of the coronavirus testing system have apologised after it emerged UK labs were struggling to keep up with demand. Some people are being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. UK labs were described as ""maxed out"" after a rise in demand - 170,000 tests a day are being processed, up from 100,000 in mid June. Baroness Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace in England, said she was ""very sorry"" for the situation. But she also insisted the ""vast majority"" of people could still get appointments nearby. How do I get a coronavirus test? Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number As summer ends, UK must square up to Covid again The booking website is now prioritising high-risk areas, including towns and cities with high infection rates and care homes, for testing. It means there are restricted numbers of home testing kits and fewer booking slots at local testing centres for people in low-risk areas, the government said. Officials said they were working hard to rectify the problem and a new lab facility would be opened in the coming weeks. By Friday no-one should be asked to travel more than 75 miles to get a test. But Prof Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as a ""big disincentive to being tested"" and result in local increases being missed. David was offered a test in Blackburn when he lives in Suffolk David Llewellyntried to book a test on Sunday and was directed to a test centre near Blackburn - 250 miles and the other side of England from his home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. ""I thought I'd entered my home location incorrectly so went through the booking process again, only to get the same location for testing. Needless to say I have subsequently ordered a home testing kit, which despite three automated email reminders to take the test has yet to arrive. I'd do the test if I had it. I think it's ridiculous."" Lucy Evans lives in Pooleon the south coast. She was offered a test 220 miles away in Oldham and Blackburn. She tried again and was offered the Isle of Wight. ""I tried 14 times to get a test nearer and in the end had to get a home test as I ran out of time to get this done within five days. By the time I was tested my symptoms had disappeared."" Lucy tested negative for Covid on Tuesday. Lisa lives in Plymouthand tried to get a test for her 14-year-old son. She was offered a test 688 miles away in Inverness. ""People aren't going to travel all that way for a test are they? You'd just have to make stops along the way and could be spreading it around if you had the virus."" She eventually got a test locally and her son was negative. The government says the network of labs used to process tests has capacity to process 250,000 tests a day at the moment. Currently around 175,000 tests a day are being processed, which the government has said is more per head of population than many countries. But the government said it has faced problems because demand is not smooth - at weekends it drops and on weekdays there can be surges. Over the past month it has meant a backlog has developed, meaning the time taken to turnaround tests has been increasing. To curb demand, the availability of slots at testing centres have been reduced. The government said it has done this to ensure high risk areas, including care homes and towns with high rates of infections, can be prioritised for testing. The most recent data shows test results are now being provided more quickly, with the average turnaround time 24 hours or less for mobile testing units and local testing centres. It also said booking slots open up throughout the day so if people keep trying they should be able to get a more convenient location for a test, or order a home test. A new lab is also being opened near Loughborough at the end of the month that will be able to process 50,000 tests a day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there were some ""operational challenges"", but said the ""vast majority"" of people could get a test close to home. Mr Hancock also set out plans to pilot more rapid, easy-to-use tests. A Â£500m programme is under way to trial a range of different tests, including ones that use saliva (instead of nose and throat swabs) and tests that can be processed quickly, and sometimes on the spot - at the moment swab tests are sent off to labs to be processed. Repeat testing of members of the public will be tried out in Salford in Greater Manchester. Meanwhile, students and school pupils in Southampton will also be tested weekly in another study. The technologies open up the prospect of mass population testing which, if successful, could reduce the need for social distancing. Mr Hancock said: ""Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming and all the challenges that brings."" But he refused to be drawn on a timescale for when this might become available, saying it was essential to see if they worked first. After BBC revelations that some people have been required to drive long distances for virus tests, there has been renewed debate about whether there is sufficient testing capacity. There has apparently been an increase of more than 60% in demand for tests since June - and it appears that laboratories have struggled to keep up in some parts of the country. There's been an apology to those who were told to go 100 miles or more for a test. Officials acknowledge that resources are stretched and have to be targeted at areas with local outbreaks. But they point out that a new ""mega lab"" is set to come on stream in the east Midlands soon. They also argue that trials of new rapid testing techniques will be expanded, which could prove to be game-changers. For now though, the system is stretched, even though the official numbers suggest capacity is running ahead of demand. Questions will continue to be asked about whether the system can cope with challenges ahead, with schools returning and winter approaching.

Speedy return to workplace 'not possible',"A senior Bank of England official has cast doubt on the government's drive to get workers back to the office as coronavirus curbs are eased. Alex Brazier, the Bank's executive director for financial stability, said a ""sharp return"" to ""dense office environments"" should not be expected. Social distancing guidelines in the workplace and public transport capacity were two factors holding people back. ""We should expect a more phased return,"" he told a committee of MPs. ""I feel safe coming to work, but I quite understand why many people might not,"" he said in evidence to the Treasury Committee. ""It's not possible to use office space, particularly in central London and dense places like that, with the intensity that we used to use it. No plan for a return to the office for millions Warnings of 'ghost towns' if offices stay empty ""It's not possible to bring lots of people back very suddenly."" Mr Brazier's remarks come after the government launched an ad campaign encouraging people togo back to the workplace. Business leaders have warned of economic damage being done to city centres as people stay away from offices. Last week, head of the CBI Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the prime minister needed to do more to get workers to return, warning of a ""high price for local businesses, jobs and communities"". Some have warned city centres could become ""ghost towns"" However, an increasing number of employers say that home working - which was initially brought in as a temporary measure during lockdown - could become a more permanent state of affairs. The law firm Linklaters, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest, Fujitsu, Capita and Facebook are among those who plan to allow much more flexible working in the future. Meanwhile,50 of the biggest UK employers questioned by the BBCsaid they had no plans to return all staff to the office full-time in the near future. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place. This week, the government launched a campaign asking employers to reassure staff it is safe to return by highlighting measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19. But there was confusion when Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he cared more about how employees performed than where they were working, contradicting other ministers. Campaign to encourage workers back to offices On Wednesday, during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Boris Johnson made several references to the need to get people back to work, saying he and his colleagues were working to get the country and the economy ""back on its feet"". The PM's spokesman recently said: ""The message from the PM is he recognises the importance that returning to work has in stimulating the economy, and that's why we have changed the guidance to give employers more discretion in how employees can work safely.""

Russia Covid-19 vaccine 'triggers immune response'Scientists say early tests showed that volunteers developed antibodies to fight the virus.Europe,"A vaccine created in Russia has shown signs of an immune response, according to a report Russian scientists have published the first report on their coronavirus vaccine, saying early tests showed signs of an immune response. The report published by medical journal The Lancet said every participant developed antibodies to fight the virus and had no serious side effects. Russia licensed the vaccine for local use in August, the first country to do so and before data had been published. Experts say the trials were too small to prove effectiveness and safety. But Moscow has hailed the results as an answer to critics. Some Western experts have raised concerns about the speed of Russia's work, suggesting that researchers might be cutting corners. Last month,President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checksand that one of his own daughters had been given it. Two trials of the vaccine, named Sputnik-V, were conducted between June and July,,externalThe Lancet paper said. Each involved 38 healthy volunteers who were given a dose of the vaccine and then a booster vaccine three weeks later. The participants - aged between 18 and 60 - were monitored for 42 days and all of them developed antibodies within three weeks. Among the most common side effects were headaches and joint pain. The trials were open label and not randomised, meaning there was no placebo and the volunteers were aware they were receiving the vaccine. ""Large, long-term trials including a placebo comparison, and further monitoring are needed to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for preventing Covid-19 infection,"" the report said. Russia rejects mounting Covid-19 vaccine concerns Russia plans mass vaccination for October A third phase of trials will involve 40,000 volunteers from ""different age and risk groups,"" according to the paper. The Russian vaccine uses adapted strains of the adenovirus, a virus that usually causes the common cold, to trigger an immune response. By Philippa Roxby, BBC health reporter ""Encouraging"" and ""so far so good"" are some of the reactions from scientists in the UK - but there is still, clearly, a long way to go. Although the vaccine showed an antibody response in all participants in phase 2, this does not necessarily mean it would protect them from the virus. That still has not been established yet. From these results, we can tell that the vaccine appeared to be safe in healthy people between the age of 18 and 60 for 42 days, because that was how long the study lasted. But what about older people and those with underlying health conditions who are most at risk of Covid-19 - how safe is it for them and over a longer period of time? This can only be answered after much larger, long-term randomised trials where the people taking part do not know if they are receiving the vaccine or a dummy injection. These will also tell scientists how effective the vaccine really is among a much wider population. There have also been calls for openness and transparency. Of the many vaccines currently being trialled around the world, some will work better than others in certain situations and in certain groups of people, perhaps. So knowing exactly how well they work and for whom is paramount - it is unlikely that one vaccine will be suitable for everyone. Kirill Dmitriev, head of a Russian investment fund behind the vaccine, said during a news conference that the report was ""a powerful response to the sceptics who unreasonably criticised the Russian vaccine"". He said that 3,000 people had already been recruited for the next phase of trials. Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said the country would start vaccinations from November or December, with a focus on high-risk groups. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? But experts warned that there was still a long way to go until a vaccine could enter the market. Brendan Wen, Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis at London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Reuters news agency: ""The report is a case of 'so far, so good'"". According to the World Health Organization, there are 176 potential vaccines currently being developed worldwide. Of those, 34 are currently being tested on people. Among those, eight are at stage three, the most advanced.
