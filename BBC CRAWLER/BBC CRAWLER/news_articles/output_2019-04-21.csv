More female teachers report upskirting,"Gina Martin campaigned after becoming a victim of upskirting at a gig in London in 2017 Schools must do more to protect female teachers following an ""enormous growth"" in the number of reports of upskirting, a teachers' union says. The NASUWT union also says it was aware of cases of upskirting - where pictures are taken without permission under a skirt - involving pupils aged 14, with ""some as young as 11"". The union says head teachers should consider banning mobile phones in school and filling in open stairwells to protect both staff and pupils. On 12 April, upskirting became a criminal offence in England and Wales. This followed a campaign led by Gina Martin, who became a victim of upskirting at a music festival in London in 2017. Offenders now face up to two years in prison for taking a photo or video under someone's clothing. The NASUWT, which is meeting for its annual conference in Belfast over the Easter weekend, says often victims are unaware that the abuse has taken place. ""Talking to members about it, the thing they find the most difficult is that quite often they don't know that this has happened - the video has been out there and then it is drawn to their attention,"" said general secretary Chris Keates. ""Then they think, if I go and report it, is that going to make it worse because it will draw attention to the fact that the video is there."" Upskirting now a crime after campaign Pupil guilty in teacher upskirting case Teachers call for upskirting law change Ms Keates said the union had seen ""an enormous growth in the number of women contacting us"". ""We haven't had a case of upskirting in primary schools - it's been secondary schools. We've had it in all age ranges. We've had some 14-year-olds and we've had some as young as 11."" She said banning mobile phones was the best way to protect staff, as well as pupils. ""Taking the mobile phones off pupils when they come into school is the best way to go because it ensures the health and safety and protection of everybody - pupils and teachers,"" she said. Ms Keates said new school building designs should not include open stairwells, to protect privacy and dignity. ""It's just simple things, like when schools are being rebuilt, putting open stairs up, that kind of thing that people don't think about when they are doing these wonderful designs on buildings - things that can be an invasion of privacy. ""A lot of places now, even just in work places outside schools, are blocking those kind of stairs as well."" Earlier this year, the NASUWT supported two of its members in Northern Ireland who were the victims of upskirting by a pupil. In February, an 18-year-old boy was found guilty of committing acts of outraging public decency, after he took five pictures of two female teachers at Enniskillen Royal Grammar School in 2015 and 2016 when he was 14 and 15. Speaking about the case to union members gathered in Belfast, Ms Keates praised the ""courage and determination"" of the two women, saying they had done a ""great service"" not just for women teachers in Northern Ireland, but for women generally. ""I cannot begin to do justice here to the strength and courage of our members who have shown magnificent resolve at every stage of a long and difficult process. ""Upskirting is a serious assault. Upskirting is a vile and deplorable form of sexual harassment and objectification of women."" She added: ""The NASUWT intends to use this victory as a basis to campaign for the necessary legislation here [in Northern Ireland] for protection not only from upskirting but also from all forms of image abuse.""

Easter Sats classes 'a growing trend',"There is a growing trend of primary schools running Easter holiday revision classes for formal tests, known as Sats, a teachers' union says. The NASUWT union says ""cramming sessions"" are becoming more common in schools ahead of the tests sat in May. It says children should not be in school over the holidays, but should be spending time with their families. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said Sats were tests of the education system in England, ""not our children"". The results of Sats tests taken by 11-year-olds are published each year in primary school league tables, published by the Department for Education. Darren Northcott, the NASUWT's national official for education, said it was the pressure of accountability that was leading schools to open up for Year 6 pupils over the holidays. ""Schools think that this is going to give them an edge in getting the results they need - so that's the driver,"" Mr Northcott said at the union's annual conference in Belfast. ""It seems like an ill-conceived response to this pressure."" He said that while attendance at the Easter booster sessions he was aware of was voluntary, it was not clear what sort of message parents were being sent. Corbyn pledges to scrap primary tests Rising numbers pass primary Sats tests Do Sats really matter - and if so, to whom? ""I think children would be better off in the Easter holidays, absolutely, if they have been set some homework and if that homework is useful and productive, they should be doing that. ""But they should also be doing enjoyable, engaging things in their own time, with their own friends, spending time with their families, which is all a critical part of a healthy childhood."" General secretary Chris Keates said: ""The growing trend of Easter Sats classes in primary schools is a worrying reflection of the high-stakes accountability regime they operate in. ""Children should be spending Easter with their families and friends, not cramming for Sats."" Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Our pupils are the most tested in the world, but there is no evidence that the current high-stakes testing regime improves teaching and learning."" But Mr Hinds said exam stress at primary school level was not inevitable. ""All over the world, schools guide children through tests without them feeling pressurised. ""These are tests of our education system, not our children. ""No-one has ever been asked for their Sats results when they go to a job interview - why? Because they are not public exams."" Last week, Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn announced he would scrap Satsif his party came to power, saying the move would help improve teacher recruitment and retention. Instead, Labour would introduce alternative assessments which would be based on ""the clear principle of understanding the learning needs of every child,"" he said. But Schools Minister Nick Gibb said abolishing Sats would be ""a retrograde step"". He said the move would ""keep parents in the dark"" by preventing from knowing how good their child's school is at teaching maths, reading and writing.

Men arrested over moorland fire,"Fire crews were called in to help from across the region as the blaze spread across moorland Three men have been arrested after a large fire took hold on moorland in West Yorkshire. Firefighters tackled flames covering 25,000 sq m on Ilkley Moor on Saturday, with helicopters making water drops. West Yorkshire Police said the men, aged 19, 23 and 24, remain in custody for questioning while inquiries continue. Bradford Council reiterated a warning for walkers to stay off the moors as crews were damping down. A police spokesperson said a smaller fire took hold on a different section of the moor on Saturday, with investigations under way to see if it is connected to the larger blaze. A wide area of Ilkley Moor, pictured here at 22:15 BST on Saturday, was well alight Beaters, water backpacks, pumps and helicopter water drops have been used to fight the fire West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (WYFRS) said the fire was in the White Wells area of the hillside, with smoke still clearly visible from the spa town below. Water jets, beaters and specialist wildfire units are being used in the aftermath, with police describing the blaze as ""under control"". Martin Langan, WYFRS incident commander, said: ""We've managed to die the flames down but there's a significant amount of smoke blowing into Ilkley."" Mark Hunnebell said he had seen ""countless"" water drops from helicopters on Sunday morning Police closed a section of Hangingstone Road near the Cow and Calf Rocks during the damping down operation. Mark Hunnebell, who has run White Wells Spa Cafe for two decades, said his business was evacuated when the ""fire started to spread towards us"" at 19:00 BST on Saturday. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire He said: ""We've seen some fires here in the past, but I've never seen anything like the scale of this one. ""The helicopters have made countless water drops for most of the morning, they've been backwards and forwards constantly."" The fire took hold in the White Wells area above the spa town of Ilkley Christina Cheney, whose house backs onto the moor near an area known as The Tarn, praised the fire service for keeping residents safe. ""A large swathe of the moor looks quite devastated this morning, we're lucky our homes were all safe in the end,"" she said. ""The same can't be said for so much wildlife."" Allow Twitter content?

Seventy-six pubs 'shutting per month',"Nearly 1,000 UK pubs shut last year, although the rate of closures is slowing, new research claims. About 76 pubs a month ""vanished"" from the communities they served in 2018, as people spent less on going out and pubs faced cost pressures, said property firm Altus Group. But this was down from 138 a month during the previous seven years. Alex Probyn, of Altus Group, said recent cuts to business rates had helped. ""The increase in the thresholds at which businesses, such as pubs, pay business rates coupled with the pubs discount during the last two financial years has helped ease the decline."" According to the firm's research, the number of pubs slumped from more than 54,000 to 43,000 between 2010 and 2017. Industry group the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) says more people are drinking at home to save money, while younger people are consuming less alcohol in general. And pubs have faced a ""triple whammy"" of taxes in the form of high Beer Duty, VAT and business rates. ""Pubs currently pay 2.8% of the business rates bill but only account for 0.5% of total business turnover, which is an overpayment of around Â£500m by the sector each year,"" it says on its website. High business rates are also viewed as contributing to the rising number of retail closures on Britain's high streets. But Altus said government changes to rates were starting to benefit the pubs industry, with the number liable to pay rates at all down by more than 1,500. It added thatnew rates relief, brought in on 1 April by the Chancellor, would help further. ""The new retail discount, which slashed rates bills by a third for high street firms with a rateable value less than Â£51,000, will help independent licensees in small premises,"" said Mr Probyn.

Appeal over 1969 disappearance prompt calls,"April Fabb went missing on 8 April 1969 Police investigating the disappearance of a teenage girl 50 years ago have said a new appeal yielded 18 calls from the public. April Fabb, 13, went missing near her home in Metton, Norfolk, on 8 April 1969. Norfolk Police said the calls that came in after a 50th anniversary appeal were being reviewed, but no new lines of inquiry had yet been identified. April was described by a detective who worked on the case as ""our Lord Lucan"". She had been cycling to her sister's house in a nearby village to deliver a birthday present to her brother-in-law. April's bike was found lying in a field, as pictured in this police reconstruction But an hour after she left home her bike was discovered abandoned in a field. No-one has ever been charged. Half a century after her disappearance, police renewed their appeal for anyone with information to come forward. Cold case manager Andy Guy said: ""I do believe there are still people alive today who may know, or strongly suspect what happened to April, and we would always review and pursue any new credible information that could unlock this mystery.""

Unbanked 'pay Â£500 extra a year' on bills,"People who do not have access to a bank account pay an extra Â£485 a year for everyday bills and services, research from an account provider suggests. More than 1.2 million Britons do not have a bank account, so miss out on discounts reserved for those who pay bills by direct debit, said Pockit. This ramps up the cost of energy bills, broadband and phone contracts, it said. ""For many of us, having a bank account is a basic fact of life,"" said Pockit boss Virraj Jatania. ""Yet the unbanked face a banking poverty premium which can put a real strain on their finances."" UK Finance, which represents the UK banking industry, said banks took their financial inclusion responsibilities ""extremely seriously"". ""The banking industry is committed to ensuring banking is accessible to all. There are over seven million basic bank accounts in the UK, helping customers across the country access vital banking services,"" it said. FCA boss: 'No such thing as free banking' Bank account 'revolution' begins Traditional banks can reject customers applying for accounts if they do not have enough forms of ID, or if their credit rating is poor. But Pockit, which provides basic account services, said this meant many were being penalised. It analysed prices from leading service providers and found: Energy and broadband providers offer discounts to customers if they pay by direct debit - a saving which is not available to those without a bank account. Mobile phone companies offer better deals to those paying via direct debit rather than pay-as-you go customers. Those without accounts have limited options when looking for credit, and often turn to expensive cash-in-hand ""doorstep loans"". In one example, it found two of the UK's three largest broadband providers, BT and Virgin Media, offered a ""super line rental discount"" if you paid by direct debit. But customers without a current account had to pay using methods such as cash transfers, costing them Â£38 more a year on average. On electricity and gas, it analysed Ofgem data and found that those using pre-payment meters paid on average Â£141.57 more each year than those who paid by direct debit.

Record Easter temperatures in three nations,"The fine weather brought queues of people to the summit of Snowdon Three of the UK's nations have recorded their highest ever Easter Sunday temperatures, the Met Office has said. Scotland's peak was 23.4C (74F), in Edinburgh, while that same temperature was also the high point in Wales - coming in Cardiff. Northern Ireland beat a 95-year-old record when the mercury hit 21C at Helen's Bay near Bangor. England's highest temperature was 24.6C at Heathrow airport - just shy of the record of 25.3C. The good weather has brought people in droves to beaches, parks and other outdoor attractions, while people queued to reach the top of Snowdon and Pen y Fan. In Glasgow, hundreds of bikers - many in costume - gathered for the 40th annual charity Easter Egg Run. The previous record in Northern Ireland was set on 20 April 1924 in Armagh, when the temperature reached 19.4C. Wales has had its hottest Easter since 22 April 1984, when it was 21.6C in Brynamman in the Brecon Beacons. But Scotland's record had only stood since 5 April 2015, when 20.7C was recorded at Aboyne in Aberdeenshire. Punters enjoyed the warm weather in Canterbury, Kent Sunbathers headed for Swansea Bay as Wales basked in record Easter Sunday temperatures More than 800 bikers rode through Glasgow to deliver treats to the Royal Hospital for Children The Easter Sunday record in England - and the UK-wide record - is 25.3C (78F), which was set in Solent, Hampshire, in 2011. But on Holy Saturday in 1949, temperatures reached 29.4C (85F) in Camden Square, London. Monday is set to be another hot day, but after that temperatures are likely to fall back to the seasonal average. The Met Office said that while the UK has been enjoying plenty of sunshine, holiday destinations such as Spain are seeing showers, heavy downpours and cooler temperatures of 17C (63F).

Comedian wins Ukrainian presidency,"This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky and his supporters celebrate winning Ukraine's presidential election Ukrainian comedian Volodymyr Zelensky has scored a landslide victory in the country's presidential election. With nearly all ballots counted in the run-off vote, Mr Zelensky had taken more than 73% with incumbent Petro Poroshenko trailing far behind on 24%. ""I will never let you down,"" Mr Zelensky told celebrating supporters. Russia says it wants him to show ""sound judgement"", ""honesty"" and ""pragmatism"" so that relations can improve. Russia backs separatists in eastern Ukraine. The comments came from Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, in a Facebook post,externalon Monday (in Russian). He said he expected Mr Zelensky to ""repeat familiar ideological formulas"" that he used in the election campaign, adding: ""I have no illusions on that score. ""At the same time, there is a chance to improve relations with our country."" Mr Poroshenko, who admitted defeat after the first exit polls were published, has said he will not be leaving politics. He told voters that Mr Zelensky, 41, was too inexperienced to stand up to Russia effectively. Mr Zelensky, a political novice, is best known for starring in a satirical television series Servant of the People, in which his character accidentally becomes Ukrainian president.  73%landslide win on 21 April Comedianbut trained as a lawyer Instagramstar with 4.2m followers Millionairethanks to his production company Kvartal 95 Linkedto oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky through  show on TV channel 1+1 What does a comic president mean?

""I think that we will have personnel changes.  In any case we will continue in the direction of the Minsk [peace] talks and head towards concluding a ceasefire,"" he said. There are sporadic skirmishes and the situation also remains tense around Crimea, annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014. Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev Ukrainians are waking up this morning and discovering that the last few months were not a dream. They really have elected a man who currently stars in a TV series as the president - as the country's next real president. And it wasn't even close. The pressure will now be on Mr Zelensky to demonstrate that he knows what he is doing. Throughout the election campaign, he avoided serious interviews and discussions about policy - preferring instead to post light-hearted videos to social media. He's got about a month before the inauguration. Then the comedian-turned-president will be faced with a complex in-tray that includes a simmering war with Russian-backed rebels in the east. Mr Poroshenko, who has been in power since 2014, said the result of the election ""leaves us with uncertainty [and] unpredictability"". ""I will leave office but I want to firmly stress - I will not quit politics,"" he said.

Mr Zelensky starred in the long-running satirical drama Servant of the People in which his character accidentally becomes Ukraine's president. He plays a teacher who is elected after his expletive-laden rant about corruption goes viral on social media. He ran under a political party with the same name as his show. With no previous political experience, Mr Zelensky's campaign focused on his difference to the other candidates rather than on any concrete policy ideas. Despite this, he won the first round with more than 30% of the vote - almost double what Mr Poroshenko got when he finished in second place with 15.95%. Analysts believe Mr Zelensky's informal style and vow to clean up Ukrainian politics resonated with voters who are disillusioned with the country's path under Mr Poroshenko. Eschewing traditional campaign tactics, Mr Zelensky channelled his on-screen persona by promising to stamp out corruption and loosen the grip of oligarchs on Ukraine. Experts say his supporters, frustrated with establishment politicians and cronyism, have been energised by his charisma and anti-corruption message. His critics, meanwhile, are sceptical about his credentials, with many expressing concern over his close links to the billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky.

Climate protesters 'making a difference',"This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally A teenage climate change activist has told Extinction Rebellion protesters in London they are ""making a difference"". Greta Thunberg, 16, was greeted with chants of ""we love you"" as she took to the stage in front of thousands of people at the rally in Marble Arch. A protest organiser said they planned ""a week of activities"" including a bid to prevent MPs entering Parliament. More than 950 people have been arrested during the climate change protests and 40 people have been charged. Ms Thunberg, a Swedish teenager who is credited with inspiring an international movement to fight climate change, told the crowd ""humanity is standing at a crossroads"" and that protesters ""will never stop fighting for this planet"". Addressing the crowd at about 19:30 BST, she said: ""For way too long the politicians and people in power have got away with not doing anything at all to fight the climate crisis and ecological crisis. ""But we will make sure they will not get away with it any longer."" The Swedish teenager was greeted with loud cheers as she took to the stage As of 19:00 on Sunday, a total of 963 people had been arrested during the climate change protests. The Met Police said 40 people, aged 19 to 77, have been charged for ""various offences including breach of Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police"". Extinction Rebellion said it hoped to negotiate with the Mayor of London and the Met over continuing its demonstrations at Old Palace Yard in Westminster and leaving other sites. Organisers said there would be a ""people's assembly"" at Marble Arch on Monday afternoon to decide what will happen in the coming week. By Dan Coles, BBC News For much of the day there had been several hundred people at Extinction Rebellion's Marble Arch site. But the chance to hear from Greta Thunberg - something of a celebrity in the climate protest world - saw the numbers swell into the thousands. The crowd was bolstered by an influx from the Parliament Square location and their banners filled the air. Greta Thunberg's two-day journey to London by train was eagerly followed on social media and she got a huge cheer as she finally took to the stage. Her speech was short and sweet, but the message was exactly what the crowd wanted to hear: ""Keep going. You are making a difference."" Hundreds of officers from other police forces have been sent to London to help the Met Earlier, Extinction Rebellion member Farhana Yamin said the group had offered to ""pause"" protests and begin ""a new phase of rebellion"" to achieve ""political aims"". She said the move would show the group was an ""organised and a long-term political force to be reckoned with"". Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Greta Thunberg, 16, up for Peace Prize Who is Greta Thunberg? However, another Extinction Rebellion organiser Larch Maxey told the BBC there ""certainly won't be a pause in our activities"". He said: ""On Tuesday we've got a series of strategic points around the city which we will be targeting to cause maximum economic disruption while simultaneously focusing on Parliament and inviting MPs to pause."" Asked if MPs would be able to get into Parliament, he added: ""Not if we are successful, we're going to prevent them getting in so they have time to separate themselves from the politicking and concentrate on what's at stake here."" Cressida Dick said Londoners had experienced ""miserable disruption"" because of the protests Police have been trying to confine the protests to Marble Arch but demonstrators have ignored the threat of arrest and continued to block roads across the capital. Areas around Oxford Circus and Parliament Square have reopened to traffic after officers cleared protesters. On Sunday afternoon, police removed the skate ramp, cooking tents and other infrastructure from the activists' camp on Waterloo Bridge. Some protesters began removing their collection of trees and plants, and officers removed the last activist from the bridge at about 22:00. Officers carry away pieces of wood as they break up the protesters' camp on Waterloo Bridge Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said that during her 36-year career she had never known a single police operation to result in so many arrests. She said she was grateful for the help fromhundreds of police officers drafted in from several forces, including the neighbouring City of London Police. Officers from Kent, Sussex, Essex, Hampshire and Greater Manchester have also been sent. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said ""more than 9,000 officers"" had been responding to the demonstrations and he was ""extremely concerned"" about their impact on tackling issues such as violent crime. Police cleared Oxford Circus of protesters on Saturday after six days of demonstrations This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

Thousands protest in Moroccan capital,"Earlier this month, jail sentences were upheld for political activists Thousands of people have protested in Morocco's capital Rabat, demanding the release of 42 activists who had rallied against corruption and unemployment. Sunday's ""march of the Moroccan people"" was organised by political and civil rights groups, as well as the families of detainees. It comes weeks aftera court upheld prison sentences for the activists, who held protests in 2016 and 2017. Authorities accuse them of threatening the security of the country. Country profile Protesters have been pictured with flags, banners and pictures of the jailed activists, who are members of Hirak Rif - or the ""Rif Movement"". The demonstrations also called for the release of journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui, who is serving a three-year sentence for covering the protests in Morocco's northern Rif region. In June 2018, a court sentenced Nasser Zefzaki, the leader of Hirak Rif, to 20 years in prison. The same term was given to activists Ouassim El Boustati and Samir Ghid, while others were given sentences of up to 15 years. The Hirak Rif organised protests in 2016 and 2017 after the death of a fishmonger in Al-Hoceima, a town in Rif. Fishmonger Mohcine Fikri was crushed to death by a rubbish lorry whilst trying to recover his fish which had been confiscated by local police. The incident prompted a wave of anger and thousands took to the streets, accusing authorities of corruption and an abuse of power.

Queen attends Easter service on 93rd birthday,"The Queen has attended an Easter service at Windsor Castle on the day she celebrates her 93rd birthday. She was presented with flowers and a crowd sang ""Happy Birthday"" as she left St George's Chapel. In an Easter message, Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK ""must stand up for the right of everyone"" to practise their faith in peace. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn compared the experience of Jesus to the challenges facing some refugees today. The Queen was joined for the Easter Sunday service by family members including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex. The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from public duties, and the Duchess of Sussex, who is heavily pregnant, did not attend. But Prince Harry and Meghan posted a joint birthday greeting to the Queen on Instagram, saying: ""Happy Birthday Your Majesty, Ma'am, Granny."" Allow Instagram content?

As the Queen left the chapel, she was presented with two posies - one yellow and one white - by two boys. Gun salutes will also be fired in London to mark her birthday - although she will have to wait a day, as they are never done on a Sunday. The Queen celebrates two birthdays each year - 21 April is her actual birthday and she also has an official one on the second Saturday in June, which is commemorated with the Trooping the Colour parade. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, used his Easter message to say the resurrection of Jesus showed ""injustice and oppression don't have the last word"". ""The risen Jesus is the one who makes our broken lives whole,"" he said. In her Easter message, the prime minister said she will spend her time ""giving thanks in church"", but for many Christians ""such simple acts of faith can bring huge danger"". About 245 million Christians worldwide areestimated to be facing persecution.,external Mrs May, a vicar's daughter and practising Christian, said: ""Churches have been attacked. Christians murdered. Families forced to flee their homes. Hunt orders persecuted Christians review Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? Alarm over China's Church crackdown ""That is why the government has launched a global review into the persecution of Christians. ""We must stand up for the right of everyone, no matter what their religion, to practise their faith in peace."" The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arriving at the 14th Century chapel in Windsor Castle The Duke of Sussex, pictured with Autumn Phillips and Peter Phillips, attended without his pregnant wife The government review, led by the Bishop of Truro, waslaunched in December,externalto look into how much help the UK gives persecuted Christians. In the Labour leader's Easter message, Mr Corbyn said the experiences of Jesus as a refugee were ""still familiar to us today"". He said Jesus was ""a refugee whose parents were forced to flee their home"", who went on to ""know what it was to be ostracised, rejected and tortured"". He added: ""The refugee crisis is a moral test. Jesus taught us to respect refugees."" Mrs May and husband Philip attended a local church for the Easter Sunday service Mr Corbyn also used his message to criticise the government for failing to take in child refugees, as well as Home Secretary Sajid Javid's handling of the Channel migrant crossings over the winter. He said: ""In Britain, we have a proud history of providing a safe refuge to those in need. But this government refuses to meet our legal obligations to child refugees in Europe as required by the Dubs Amendment."" The Dubs amendment, designed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Lord Dubs, was a scheme which aimed to let unaccompanied migrant children into the UK - but it wasnot extended by the government in 2017. The Home Office responded by saying that the UK had provided protection to over 34,500 children since the start of 2010 and the government was ""determined to deliver on its commitment"" to relocating 480 children under the ""Dubs amendment"".

Thai phone 'theft' tattooist back home,"This video can not be played Tattoo artist Chris Dodd, from Poole, spent 10 days in a Thai prison accused of theft A British backpacker who was arrested and put in prison in Thailand for picking up a mobile phone he found on the floor has returned home for Easter. Chris Dodd, a 29-year-old tattoo artist from Poole, spent 10 days in a Thai prison accused of theft. He said he picked up the phone to try to find its owner and in doing so he moved it to a different location, which is considered theft under Thai law. Mr Dodd was released on bail after family and friends raised Â£20,000. Guards shaved off Mr Dodd's dreadlocks when he was arrested but he was allowed to keep them Mr Dodd said he found the phone just as he was about to get into the taxi after arriving at Chiang Mai airport. He looked around to see if he could spot someone who may have dropped it but could not see anyone so he decided to take with him to the hostel to try to trace the owner from there. Soon after arriving at the hostel, Mr Dodd was arrested after police had seen him on CCTV picking it up. He said: ""I was stripped naked, sent in, given a blanket. Then the next thing you know you're being taken into the cells where they house massive amounts of people. ""Nobody spoke English. It was really intimidating. You just have to fight for a space on the floor and you have people's legs all over you."" Chris Dodd had only just arrived in Thailand when he was arrested and put in prison He had faced a five-year prison term if convicted, but the charges against him were eventually waived and he could return home to the UK. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Dodd said his lawyer urged him to leave Thailand immediately after the prosecution dropped the case three days ago. His father Mike Dodd added: ""Over there money talks but, yes, it's [also] having a really good lawyer. [The money raised] enabled us to have a really good lawyer. That was fantastic.""

Sri Lanka under curfew after bomb attacks,"This video can not be played Aftermath of deadly Sri Lanka explosions The death toll in Sri Lanka has soared to 290 after a wave of blasts hit churches and luxury hotels across the country on Sunday. Police said 24 people had been arrested, but it is not yet known who carried out the attacks. About 500 people are injured and at least 35 foreigners are among the dead. The Easter Sunday bombings were the deadliest violence Sri Lanka has witnessed since the end of the country's civil war in 2009. Follow live updates here Who are the victims? Late on Sunday, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said security services had been ""aware of information"" of possible attacks but that the information had not been acted upon. A local Islamist group known as National Thowheed Jamath is believed to be behind the attack, said cabinet spokeman Rajitha Senaratne. A curfew is to be imposed from 20:00 (14:30 GMT) until 04:00 on Tuesday, the government said. The first reports of explosions came at about 08:45 local time with six blasts reported within a small space of time. This video can not be played Sri Lanka attacks: ""My heart shattered when I saw the bodies"" Three churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo's Kochchikade district were targeted during Easter services. Blasts also rocked the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the country's capital. All the attacks were carried out by suicide bombers, officials said. Police then carried out raids on two addresses and there were explosions at both. One was in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and the other was near the Colombo district of Dematagoda in which three officers were killed. In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' Eight Britons killed in Sri Lanka attacks Three churches were targeted during Easter services The air force said an improvised explosive device - a 6ft-long [1.8m] plastic pipe packed with explosives - had been found and disposed of near the airport in the capital, Colombo. Police have not provided a breakdown of how many were killed and wounded at each location. The government has urged people not to speculate about who could be behind the attacks and restricted access to social media in the aftermath of the bombings. No information has been given on the identity of the 24 people arrested. However, the BBC's Azzam Ameen in Colombo says the bombers are thought to be part of a ""radical extremist Islamist group"" according to authorities. Addressing reports that officials had had prior intelligence of forthcoming attacks, Mr Wickremesinghe said: ""We must look into why adequate precautions were not taken. Neither I nor the ministers were kept informed."" A top Sri Lankan official later told the BBC that the government and intelligence services should not be blamed. Hemasari Fernando - who is also chief-of-staff to President Maithripala Sirisena, a political rival of Mr Wickremesinghe - said information received earlier this month was of only one or two possible attacks, and that he never expected anything of the magnitude of Sunday's bombings. The vast majority of those killed are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians who died at Easter church services. The ministry of foreign affairs says it believes 35 foreign nationals are among the dead. They include three of the children of Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, a family spokesman confirmed to the BBC. Mr Povlsen owns the Bestseller clothing chain and holds a majority stake in clothing giant Asos. Other international victims include: At least fiveBritishcitizens - including two with joint US citizenship OnePortuguesecitizen and sixIndiannationals Two engineers fromTurkey, according to Turkish news agency Anadolu TwoChinesenationals, according to the China Daily TwoAustralians, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said One person from theNetherlands One person fromJapan, according to Japanese media citing government sources This video can not be played Archbishop of Colombo: ''A very, very sad day for all of us"" Sunday's attacks were the deadliest in Sri Lanka since the end of the country's civil war in 2009. The war ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, who had fought for 26 years for an independent homeland for the minority ethnic Tamils.

'I thought we left violence behind'VideoVideoAftermath of deadly blasts,"Guards outside St Anthony's Shrine in the Kochchikade area of Colombo, where one of the explosions occurred People caught up in Sri Lanka's deadly Easter Sunday attacks have been telling the BBC what they experienced. Churches and hotels were hit by a series of explosions in Colombo and Negombo on the west coast, and Batticaloa on the east. The blasts came as members of Sri Lanka's peaceful Christian minority prepared to attend church services for Easter Sunday. Dr Emmanuel is a 48-year-old physician. He grew up in Sri Lanka, and now lives in Surrey, UK, with his wife and children. They were in Colombo this week to visit some of their relatives who still live in the city. They were asleep in their room in Colombo's Cinnamon Grand Hotel when one of the bombs went off. ""We were in our bedroom and we heard this huge explosion which rocked our room, I think it was about 8:30,"" he said. ""We were then ushered to the lounge in our hotel, where we were asked to evacuate through the back. This is where we saw casualties being taken away to the hospital, and we saw some of the damage to the hotel."" Among the churches attacked was St Sebastian's in Negombo A staff member commented that she had seen a dismembered body at the site of the explosion, while his friends sent him photos of the churches that had been bombed. The hotel itself, meanwhile, had ""significant damage"" - one of the restaurants had been blown up. ""We were going to go to church today, with my mum and nephew, but all the church services have been cancelled - there aren't going to be any more church services in the country because of what's happened this morning,"" he said. Scores die in Sri Lanka church and hotel attacks Follow the latest reports live ""I spent my first 18 years in Sri Lanka, so I've seen a lot of ethnic strife."" Sri Lanka was ravaged by decades of conflict between the Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups, but has been relatively peaceful since 2009. ""Whereas my kids, my children are 11 and seven, and they've never seen anything like war, and neither has my wife. For them it's quite difficult."" He added: ""It's really sad - I thought Sri Lanka had left all this violence behind us, but now it's sad to see that it's come back again."" Mr Ali lives in Colombo. He first noticed something was wrong when worshippers were ""hastily"" evacuated from a Roman Catholic church near his home. His road, which leads up to the city's main hospital, was also suddenly filled with ambulances. He checked the hashtag #LKA - Lanka - and quickly learned what was going on. Among the horrific footage and images was an appeal from the country's blood centres for people to donate to help the victims. The National Blood Centre in Colombo was filled with people hoping to donate Mr Ali went to the National Blood Centre, and found it thronged with people. ""There were huge crowds and roads congested as people tried to park wherever and enter the blood centre,"" he said. ""Currently they are taking down the name, blood group and contact number of persons who are willing to donate blood, and asking them to return only if a representative of the National Blood Centre contacts them."" People were spilling out of the building, he said, forming ""massive queues leading all the way to the entrance"". People formed long queues leading right up to the door Once inside, there was a strong community spirit. ""Everyone just had one intention, and that was to help victims of the blast, no matter what religion or race they may be. Each person was helping another out in filling [out forms with] the details requested. ""I wonder where this attack came from. God save us."" Kieran Arasaratnam, a professor at Imperial College London Business School, was staying at the Shangri-La hotel, whose second-floor restaurant was gutted in a blast. Mr Arasaratnam, a Sri Lankan who moved to the UK as a refugee 30 years ago, was visiting the country to help launch a social enterprise. He was in his room when he heard a sound like ""thunder"". He told the BBC he started running for his life from the 18th to the ground floor amid desperate scenes. ""Everyone just started to panic, it was total chaos,"" he said. ""I looked to the room on the right and there's blood everywhere. ""Everyone was running and a lot of people just don't know what was going on. People had blood on their shirt and there was someone carrying a girl to the ambulance. The walls and the floor were covered in blood."" The Shangri-La hotel's second-floor restaurant was gutted in a blast The 41-year-old says he might have been caught up in the blast if he had not delayed going to breakfast. He says he left his room at around 08:45 (03:15 GMT), the time when several explosions were reported to have occurred at hotels and churches in different locations. ""Something distracted me so I went back to the room to grab my debit card, opened the curtain and switched off the 'do not disturb' signâ¦ and a big blast went off,"" he said. He says he's currently in an emergency shelter. There, he says, he can ""smell blood everywhere"", with people injured in the blast needing treatment and searching for missing family members. ""It's awful seeing kids carried off covered in blood. I left Sri Lanka 30 years ago as a refugee and never thought I had to see this again."" Simon Whitmarsh, a 55-year-old retired doctor from Wales, is on holiday in Sri Lanka. He was cycling near the city of Batticaloa when he heard a ""big bang"" and saw ""smoke billowing into the sky about half a mile away"". A blast ripped through a church in the city as worshippers were gathering for services. ""Then we saw the ambulances, people crying, and we were told to leave the area,"" he told the BBC. As a former consultant paediatrician, Mr Whitmarsh says he felt compelled to help those affected so volunteered at the local hospital. Sri Lankan security forces secure the area around St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo ""By that stage, they had activated emergency protocols,"" he says. ""The hospital was heavily guarded by the army, who were stopping most people going in. ""All the streets around it were closed. It seemed very well organised. All I did was find someone senior to see if I could help."" He says the nationwide curfew, imposed by Sri Lankan authorities in the wake of the blasts, has completely emptied streets and roads that were bustling only hours ago. ""Now it's curfew, there's nothing. No vehicles, no people walking, nothing,"" he says. ""'Stay indoors' is the message."" He added: ""London people have said they were thinking of going home, but we can't do anything until the curfew finishes.""

"Seventy-six pubs 'shutting per month'But the rate of closure is slowing because of cuts to business rates, new research suggests.","Nearly 1,000 UK pubs shut last year, although the rate of closures is slowing, new research claims. About 76 pubs a month ""vanished"" from the communities they served in 2018, as people spent less on going out and pubs faced cost pressures, said property firm Altus Group. But this was down from 138 a month during the previous seven years. Alex Probyn, of Altus Group, said recent cuts to business rates had helped. ""The increase in the thresholds at which businesses, such as pubs, pay business rates coupled with the pubs discount during the last two financial years has helped ease the decline."" According to the firm's research, the number of pubs slumped from more than 54,000 to 43,000 between 2010 and 2017. Industry group the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) says more people are drinking at home to save money, while younger people are consuming less alcohol in general. And pubs have faced a ""triple whammy"" of taxes in the form of high Beer Duty, VAT and business rates. ""Pubs currently pay 2.8% of the business rates bill but only account for 0.5% of total business turnover, which is an overpayment of around Â£500m by the sector each year,"" it says on its website. High business rates are also viewed as contributing to the rising number of retail closures on Britain's high streets. But Altus said government changes to rates were starting to benefit the pubs industry, with the number liable to pay rates at all down by more than 1,500. It added thatnew rates relief, brought in on 1 April by the Chancellor, would help further. ""The new retail discount, which slashed rates bills by a third for high street firms with a rateable value less than Â£51,000, will help independent licensees in small premises,"" said Mr Probyn.

More than 200 killed in Sri Lanka attacks,"This video can not be played Deadly explosions strike across Sri Lanka At least 207 people have been killed and 450 hurt in explosions at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka, police say. Eight blasts were reported, including at three churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo's Kochchikade district during Easter services. The Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand luxury hotels, all in the capital, were also targeted. A curfew has been put in place ""until further notice"" and social media networks have been temporarily blocked. It remains unclear who carried out the attacks, but reports say 13 people have so far been arrested. Late on Sunday, the country's air force said an improvised explosive device had been found, and disposed of, close to Colombo's main airport. ""A PVC pipe which was six feet in length containing explosives in it was discovered,"" spokesman Gihan Seneviratne told local media. As it happened: Sri Lanka explosions ""I thought we had left all this violence behind us"" In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks It comes as the country's prime minister admitted there may have been prior intelligence about the attacks. Officials says 36 foreign nationals are thought to be among the dead, including 25 yet to be identified. The first reports of explosions came at about 08:45 (03:15 GMT) local time - with six blasts reported close together at churches and luxury hotels. St Sebastian's church in Negombo was severely damaged in one explosion, with dozens killed at the site. Images from inside showed blood on the pews and the building's ceiling shattered. There were also heavy casualties at the site of the first blast in St Anthony's, a hugely popular shrine in Kochchikade, a district of Colombo. Robert Tyler, who has lived in Sri Lanka for six years, told the BBC that at least two of the hotels appeared to have had their restaurants targeted at a busy time for breakfast. Two further explosions were reported as police tried to find those involved. One blast hit near the zoo in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and an eighth was reported near the Colombo district of Dematagoda during a police raid, killing three officers. The government has said most of the attacks are thought to have been carried out by suicide bombers. The streets of Colombo were far quieter than usual as the curfew came in The vast majority of those killed are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals, including dozens who were attending Easter church services. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs saysfive British people - including two with joint US citizenship - are among the dead. The US State Department has said ""several"" Americans have been killed. Three Danish citizens, two Turkish nationals and one person from the Netherlands were also killed, their governments have confirmed. Sri Lankan officials say three Indian nationals and one Portuguese citizen are also among the dead. They say 25 more fatalities at a Colombo mortuary are also thought to be international citizens awaiting identification. Airlines have said people are still able to travel to the airport under the curfew if they produce their boarding pass and identification at checkpoints. Travellers are being advised to arrive at the airport four hours before their scheduled flight time. A bomb goes off as Special Task Force personnel raid a home near Dematagoda in Colombo Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the media on Sunday evening. During the briefing, he referred to allegations that officials had been in possession of intelligence suggesting an impending attack. ""We must look into why adequate precautions were not taken. Neither I nor the Ministers were kept informed,"" he said. ""For now the priority is to apprehend the attackers,"" he added. Pope Francis, in his traditional Urbi et Orbi speech at the Vatican, condemned the attacks as ""such cruel violence"" targeting Christians celebrating Easter. Blast damage at the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said he is ""outraged"" by the attacks, and hopes the perpetrators will be ""swiftly brought to justice"". Cardinal Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm Ranjith, told the BBC: ""It's a very difficult and a very sad situation for all of us because we never expected such a thing to happen and especially on Easter Sunday.""

US President Donald Trump tweeted ""heartfelt condolences"" for the ""horrible terrorist attacks"". This video can not be played Archbishop of Colombo: ''A very, very sad day for all of us"" Sunday's attacks are the deadliest seen in Sri Lanka since the end of the country's civil war in 2009.

Labour 'must back second Brexit vote',"Labour must promise another Brexit referendum to counter the electoral challenge posed by Nigel Farage, the party's deputy leader has said. Writing in the Observer,external, Tom Watson said his party could not ""sit on the fence"" about the biggest issue to face the UK for a generation. But ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage said a new referendum would be ""a total insult"" to five million Labour Leave voters. The UK has been givenan extension to the Brexit processuntil 31 October. This means the UK is likely to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May. Mr Farage launched his new Brexit Party last weekand said it had a list of 70 candidates to fight the May elections. Will Labour push for a public vote? How UK is gearing up for European elections Mr Watson warned that Labour would not defeat Mr Farage ""by being mealy-mouthed and sounding as if we half agree with him"". ""We won't beat him unless we can inspire the millions crying out for a different direction,"" he added. He said a ""confirmatory"" referendum and ""final say"" on any deal was ""the very least"" voters deserved, now they knew more about what Brexit would mean. He added: ""They deserve a Labour Party that offers clarity on this issue, as well as the radical vision for a new political economy achieved by working with our socialist allies inside the EU. ""And, above all, they deserve better than Nigel Farage's promise of a far-right Brexit that would solve nothing."" However, Mr Farage accused Mr Watson of breaking promises to the British people and said he intended to ""wholeheartedly target Labour lies and dishonesty in the weeks ahead"". Talks with the Conservatives aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock have re-opened Labour's divisions over a possible further referendum. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry wrote to cabinet colleaguesto warn that striking a deal with the prime minister that ditched the commitment to a public vote would breach party policy. A survey earlier this year found that 70% of Labour members support another referendum, but nine of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's top team are sceptical or opposed. Nigel Farage described 23 May as the ""first step"" for his party Mr Farage's Brexit Party also poses a threat to the Conservative Party,according to a survey for the Mail on Sunday,external. The Survation poll of 781 Conservative councillors found that 40% were planning to back the Brexit Party at the May European elections. Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide Just over half - 52% - said they would vote for their own party. If Brexiteer Boris Johnson was prime minister this figure would rise to 65%, the survey found. Some 15% said they believed Mr Farage would be the best leader of the Conservative Party - only Mr Johnson was ahead of him, on 19%. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent Nigel Farage relishes the opportunity to put a cat among the pigeons - and once again the two biggest parties are questioning how to deal with his unambiguous pro-Brexit message. Tom Watson's case is that Labour needs to be different. He's not impressed with the idea of ""sounding as if we half agree"" with Mr Farage, urging his party to strengthen its message on another referendum and provide a natural home to those on the other side of the Brexit debate. The problem is that some in the Labour completely disagree. They think it would an historic mistake to ignore Labour voters who backed Leave in 2016 and believe it may actually encourage those voters to side with Mr Farage. The Conservatives are grappling with how to fight the European elections too. Today'spoll in the Mail on Sunday,externalsuggests some Conservative councillors are prepared to turn their back on the party - at least temporarily - and support Mr Farage. That will only feed into fears in the Tory leadership that these elections could be a disaster for the party - and strengthen resolve to try to stop them happening by getting a deal through Parliament. The picture isn't the same everywhere. In Scotland, for example, the pro-referendum SNP appear to be maintaining strong support. But Mr Farage will continue to argue that the main parties have failed to honour the referendum result. And his allies suspect that message will prove a powerful one for Brexit supporters if the European Parliament elections go ahead. Although Theresa May has said she still wants the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible, she is yet to get her withdrawal deal  - which has been rejected three times by MPs - approved by Parliament. Cross-party talks between the government and the Labour Party are continuing, to find a way through the impasse. Labour wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, which would allow tariff-free trade in goods. The government has repeatedly ruled out remaining in the EU's customs union, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. The EU has said the UK must hold elections to the European Parliament in May or leave on 1 June without a deal. June 2017- Labour's general election manifesto accepts referendum result March 2018- Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smithsacked for supporting second referendum on final deal September- Labour agrees if a general election cannot be achieved it ""must support all optionsâ¦ including a public vote"" 18 November- Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says a new referendum is ""an option for the future"" but ""not an option for today"" 28 November- Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says Labour will ""inevitably"" back a second referendum if unable to secure general election 16 January 2019- 71 Labour MPs say they support a public vote 6 February- Mr Corbyn writes a letter to Mrs May outlining five changes with no mention of a ""People's Vote"" 28 February- Labour says it will back a public vote after its proposed Brexit deal is rejected 14 March-Five Labour MPs quit party rolesto oppose a further referendum 27 March- The party backs a confirmatory public vote in Parliament's indicative votes on a way forward for Brexit Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit?

Extinction Rebellion offer to 'pause protests',"This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally A teenage climate change activist has told Extinction Rebellion protesters in London they are ""making a difference"". Greta Thunberg, 16, was greeted with chants of ""we love you"" as she took to the stage in front of thousands of people at the rally in Marble Arch. A protest organiser said they planned ""a week of activities"" including a bid to prevent MPs entering Parliament. More than 950 people have been arrested during the climate change protests and 40 people have been charged. Ms Thunberg, a Swedish teenager who is credited with inspiring an international movement to fight climate change, told the crowd ""humanity is standing at a crossroads"" and that protesters ""will never stop fighting for this planet"". Addressing the crowd at about 19:30 BST, she said: ""For way too long the politicians and people in power have got away with not doing anything at all to fight the climate crisis and ecological crisis. ""But we will make sure they will not get away with it any longer."" The Swedish teenager was greeted with loud cheers as she took to the stage As of 19:00 on Sunday, a total of 963 people had been arrested during the climate change protests. The Met Police said 40 people, aged 19 to 77, have been charged for ""various offences including breach of Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police"". Extinction Rebellion said it hoped to negotiate with the Mayor of London and the Met over continuing its demonstrations at Old Palace Yard in Westminster and leaving other sites. Organisers said there would be a ""people's assembly"" at Marble Arch on Monday afternoon to decide what will happen in the coming week. By Dan Coles, BBC News For much of the day there had been several hundred people at Extinction Rebellion's Marble Arch site. But the chance to hear from Greta Thunberg - something of a celebrity in the climate protest world - saw the numbers swell into the thousands. The crowd was bolstered by an influx from the Parliament Square location and their banners filled the air. Greta Thunberg's two-day journey to London by train was eagerly followed on social media and she got a huge cheer as she finally took to the stage. Her speech was short and sweet, but the message was exactly what the crowd wanted to hear: ""Keep going. You are making a difference."" Hundreds of officers from other police forces have been sent to London to help the Met Earlier, Extinction Rebellion member Farhana Yamin said the group had offered to ""pause"" protests and begin ""a new phase of rebellion"" to achieve ""political aims"". She said the move would show the group was an ""organised and a long-term political force to be reckoned with"". Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Greta Thunberg, 16, up for Peace Prize Who is Greta Thunberg? However, another Extinction Rebellion organiser Larch Maxey told the BBC there ""certainly won't be a pause in our activities"". He said: ""On Tuesday we've got a series of strategic points around the city which we will be targeting to cause maximum economic disruption while simultaneously focusing on Parliament and inviting MPs to pause."" Asked if MPs would be able to get into Parliament, he added: ""Not if we are successful, we're going to prevent them getting in so they have time to separate themselves from the politicking and concentrate on what's at stake here."" Cressida Dick said Londoners had experienced ""miserable disruption"" because of the protests Police have been trying to confine the protests to Marble Arch but demonstrators have ignored the threat of arrest and continued to block roads across the capital. Areas around Oxford Circus and Parliament Square have reopened to traffic after officers cleared protesters. On Sunday afternoon, police removed the skate ramp, cooking tents and other infrastructure from the activists' camp on Waterloo Bridge. Some protesters began removing their collection of trees and plants, and officers removed the last activist from the bridge at about 22:00. Officers carry away pieces of wood as they break up the protesters' camp on Waterloo Bridge Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said that during her 36-year career she had never known a single police operation to result in so many arrests. She said she was grateful for the help fromhundreds of police officers drafted in from several forces, including the neighbouring City of London Police. Officers from Kent, Sussex, Essex, Hampshire and Greater Manchester have also been sent. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said ""more than 9,000 officers"" had been responding to the demonstrations and he was ""extremely concerned"" about their impact on tackling issues such as violent crime.

"Breaking|Breaking newsComedian 'wins Ukrainian presidency'Ukrainian comedian Volodymyr Zelensky elected president with more than 70% support, exit polls suggestEurope","This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky and his supporters celebrate winning Ukraine's presidential election Ukrainian comedian Volodymyr Zelensky has scored a landslide victory in the country's presidential election. With nearly all ballots counted in the run-off vote, Mr Zelensky had taken more than 73% with incumbent Petro Poroshenko trailing far behind on 24%. ""I will never let you down,"" Mr Zelensky told celebrating supporters. Russia says it wants him to show ""sound judgement"", ""honesty"" and ""pragmatism"" so that relations can improve. Russia backs separatists in eastern Ukraine. The comments came from Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, in a Facebook post,externalon Monday (in Russian). He said he expected Mr Zelensky to ""repeat familiar ideological formulas"" that he used in the election campaign, adding: ""I have no illusions on that score. ""At the same time, there is a chance to improve relations with our country."" Mr Poroshenko, who admitted defeat after the first exit polls were published, has said he will not be leaving politics. He told voters that Mr Zelensky, 41, was too inexperienced to stand up to Russia effectively. Mr Zelensky, a political novice, is best known for starring in a satirical television series Servant of the People, in which his character accidentally becomes Ukrainian president.  73%landslide win on 21 April Comedianbut trained as a lawyer Instagramstar with 4.2m followers Millionairethanks to his production company Kvartal 95 Linkedto oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky through  show on TV channel 1+1 What does a comic president mean?

""I think that we will have personnel changes.  In any case we will continue in the direction of the Minsk [peace] talks and head towards concluding a ceasefire,"" he said. There are sporadic skirmishes and the situation also remains tense around Crimea, annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014. Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev Ukrainians are waking up this morning and discovering that the last few months were not a dream. They really have elected a man who currently stars in a TV series as the president - as the country's next real president. And it wasn't even close. The pressure will now be on Mr Zelensky to demonstrate that he knows what he is doing. Throughout the election campaign, he avoided serious interviews and discussions about policy - preferring instead to post light-hearted videos to social media. He's got about a month before the inauguration. Then the comedian-turned-president will be faced with a complex in-tray that includes a simmering war with Russian-backed rebels in the east. Mr Poroshenko, who has been in power since 2014, said the result of the election ""leaves us with uncertainty [and] unpredictability"". ""I will leave office but I want to firmly stress - I will not quit politics,"" he said.

""The new leadership now must understand and realise the hopes of its electors,"" deputy foreign minister Grigory Karasin told the Ria Novosti news agency.

Mr Zelensky starred in the long-running satirical drama Servant of the People in which his character accidentally becomes Ukraine's president. He plays a teacher who is elected after his expletive-laden rant about corruption goes viral on social media. He ran under a political party with the same name as his show. With no previous political experience, Mr Zelensky's campaign focused on his difference to the other candidates rather than on any concrete policy ideas. Despite this, he won the first round with more than 30% of the vote - almost double what Mr Poroshenko got when he finished in second place with 15.95%. Analysts believe Mr Zelensky's informal style and vow to clean up Ukrainian politics resonated with voters who are disillusioned with the country's path under Mr Poroshenko. Eschewing traditional campaign tactics, Mr Zelensky channelled his on-screen persona by promising to stamp out corruption and loosen the grip of oligarchs on Ukraine. Experts say his supporters, frustrated with establishment politicians and cronyism, have been energised by his charisma and anti-corruption message. His critics, meanwhile, are sceptical about his credentials, with many expressing concern over his close links to the billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. They have expressed doubts that he will be able to take on the country's influential oligarchs and stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Easter Sats classes 'a growing trend'The NASUWT teachers' union says primary pupils should be spending time at home with their families.Family & Education,"There is a growing trend of primary schools running Easter holiday revision classes for formal tests, known as Sats, a teachers' union says. The NASUWT union says ""cramming sessions"" are becoming more common in schools ahead of the tests sat in May. It says children should not be in school over the holidays, but should be spending time with their families. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said Sats were tests of the education system in England, ""not our children"". The results of Sats tests taken by 11-year-olds are published each year in primary school league tables, published by the Department for Education. Darren Northcott, the NASUWT's national official for education, said it was the pressure of accountability that was leading schools to open up for Year 6 pupils over the holidays. ""Schools think that this is going to give them an edge in getting the results they need - so that's the driver,"" Mr Northcott said at the union's annual conference in Belfast. ""It seems like an ill-conceived response to this pressure."" He said that while attendance at the Easter booster sessions he was aware of was voluntary, it was not clear what sort of message parents were being sent. Corbyn pledges to scrap primary tests Rising numbers pass primary Sats tests Do Sats really matter - and if so, to whom? ""I think children would be better off in the Easter holidays, absolutely, if they have been set some homework and if that homework is useful and productive, they should be doing that. ""But they should also be doing enjoyable, engaging things in their own time, with their own friends, spending time with their families, which is all a critical part of a healthy childhood."" General secretary Chris Keates said: ""The growing trend of Easter Sats classes in primary schools is a worrying reflection of the high-stakes accountability regime they operate in. ""Children should be spending Easter with their families and friends, not cramming for Sats."" Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Our pupils are the most tested in the world, but there is no evidence that the current high-stakes testing regime improves teaching and learning."" But Mr Hinds said exam stress at primary school level was not inevitable. ""All over the world, schools guide children through tests without them feeling pressurised. ""These are tests of our education system, not our children. ""No-one has ever been asked for their Sats results when they go to a job interview - why? Because they are not public exams."" Last week, Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn announced he would scrap Satsif his party came to power, saying the move would help improve teacher recruitment and retention. Instead, Labour would introduce alternative assessments which would be based on ""the clear principle of understanding the learning needs of every child,"" he said. But Schools Minister Nick Gibb said abolishing Sats would be ""a retrograde step"". He said the move would ""keep parents in the dark"" by preventing from knowing how good their child's school is at teaching maths, reading and writing.

"Are you using the most-hacked password?A list of all-too-predictable choices for breached accounts includes 123456 and ""Liverpool"".Technology","Liverpool FC topped the list of Premier League club names used as passwords Millions of people are using easy-to-guess passwords on sensitive accounts, suggests a study. The analysis by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) found 123456 was the most widely-used password on breached accounts. The study helped to uncover the gaps in cyber-knowledge that could leave people in danger of being exploited. The NCSC said people should string three random but memorable words together to use as a strong password. For its first cyber-survey, the NCSC analysed public databases of breached accounts to see which words, phrases and strings people used. Top of the list was 123456, appearing in more than 23 million passwords. The second-most popular string, 123456789, was not much harder to crack, while others in the top five included ""qwerty"", ""password"" and 1111111. The most common name to be used in passwords was Ashley, followed by Michael, Daniel, Jessica and Charlie. When it comes to Premier League football teams in guessable passwords, Liverpool are champions and Chelsea are second. Blink-182 topped the charts of music acts. People who use well-known words or names for a password put themselves people at risk of being hacked, said Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the NCSC. ""Nobody should protect sensitive data with something that can be guessed, like their first name, local football team or favourite band,"" he said. The NCSC study also quizzed people about their security habits and fears. It found that 42% expected to lose money to online fraud and only 15% said they felt confident that they knew enough to protect themselves online. It found that fewer than half of those questioned used a separate, hard-to-guess password for their main email account. Security expert Troy Hunt, who maintains a database of hacked account data, said picking a good password was the ""single biggest control"" people had over their online security. ""We typically haven't done a very good job of that either as individuals or as the organisations asking us to register with them,"" he said. Letting people know which passwords were widely used should drive users to make better choices, he said. The survey was published ahead of the NCSC's Cyber UK conference that will be held in Glasgow from 24-25 April.

"LiveAttacks on Sri Lanka churches and hotels7 minutes ago7 minutes ago Vigils held in PakistanVigils held in Pakistan27 minutes ago Three Danes, 'several' US citizens among deadThree Danes, 'several' US citizens among deadLive Attacks on Sri Lanka churches and hotels  7 minutes ago","Eight blasts hit locations including churches and hotels across Sri Lanka, leaving at least 290 people dead and 500 injured Congregations were taking part in Easter Sunday services at the churches when the blasts hit The five-star Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the heart of Colombo were targeted A local group named as National Thowheed Jamath are believed to be behind the attack Officials say 24 people have been arrested in connection with the attacks Gareth Evans and Mal Siret The measure is needed on security grounds, officials say, two years after the Easter Sunday attacks. Brothers transform expected win into stunning rout of the opposition, writes Anbarasan Ethirajan. The victory for the Sri Lanka People's Front seals the Rajapaksa brothers' grip on power. Nearly 270 people were killed by a group of suicide bombers on Easter Sunday last year. The brothers, who oversaw the controversial end to Sri Lanka's bitter civil war, are back in power. Anita Nicholson and her two children were among the victims on Easter Sunday. Gotabaya Rajapaksa is declared the winner in a poll that has split the country along ethnic lines. Minorities fearful as controversial ex-defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is elected president. Six months after one of the world's worst recent terror attacks, this town is fighting to recover. Five months after the Easter Sunday bombings, Sri Lanka is desperate for visitors to return. Life for many of Sri Lanka's Muslims has become tougher since April's Easter Sunday bombings. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the former defence chief who crushed the Tamil Tigers, is running for president. He is the allegedly leader of an Islamic State militant cell, federal investigators said. As night falls in Sri Lanka, we are pausing our live coverage of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings. Here's what we know:  Read the latest information on the attacks here. And for more information on the victims, you can read our piece here. US President Donald Trump called Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this morning to express condolences. Mr Wickremesinghe reportedly appreciated the president's concern and updated him on the progress of the investigation into the attacks. Mr Trump also pledged US support to Sri Lanka in bringing the perpetrators to justice, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the fight against global terrorism. The BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan writes from the capital, Colombo: Sri Lankans are yet to come to terms with this wave of
unprecedented bomb attacks. It is believed some Muslim youths were radicalised afterclashes between the majority Sinhala Buddhists and Muslimslast year in the central district of Kandy. There
have been videos on social media showing hardline Islamists and Sinhala
hardliners promoting hatred after that violence. But very few expected such
massive attacks a year later. And why were Christians targeted? They are also a minority in Sri Lanka. The country experienced suicide attacks by Tamil Tiger rebels during the civil war that ended in 2009. But the ruthlessness with which the latest attacks were carried out show that the country's task this time will be challenging. It is a different kind of battle. In the meantime, Sri Lankan Muslims are left nervous and afraid. Kandy in the centre of the country was the focus of clashes last year Anita Nicholson and her children Alex, 14, and Annabel, 11, died in the Shangri-La hotel bombing A British man has confirmed that his wife and two children, aged 14 and 11, were killed in the attacks. ""My family and I wish to confirm that my wife Anita, our son Alex (age 14) and our daughter Annabel (age 11) were killed in the bombing of the restaurant of the Shangri-la Hotel, Colombo on Sunday morning while sitting at our table,"" Ben Nicholson said in a statement. ""Mercifully, all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering."" Mr Nicholson added that he was ""deeply distressed at the loss of my wife and children."" He described Anita as a ""wonderful, perfect loving and inspirational mother"" and his two children as ""amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful"". ""We would ask that the media now respect our privacy and allow us to grieve together,"" the statement said. According to a social media profile, lawyer Anita Nicholson was based in Singapore, working as a managing counsel at mining and metals company Anglo American at the time of her death. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Catherine, haveshared a message for the people of Sri Lanka,external. ""We have been deeply saddened to learn of the devastating attacks in Sri Lanka this Easter Sunday. ""Senseless acts like these in places that people would expect to be at their safest are truly horrifying. ""Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives, to the Christian community, and to the people of Sri Lanka at this tragic time. You are all in our thoughts and prayers."" Anders Holch Povlsen is one of Denmark's richest men Three of the four children of Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen died in the attacks, a spokesman has told the BBC. The family were visiting Sri Lanka over the Easter holiday. The names of the children have not been made public. Mr Holch Povlsen owns the international clothing chain Bestseller.

'I thought we left violence behind',"Guards outside St Anthony's Shrine in the Kochchikade area of Colombo, where one of the explosions occurred People caught up in Sri Lanka's deadly Easter Sunday attacks have been telling the BBC what they experienced. Churches and hotels were hit by a series of explosions in Colombo and Negombo on the west coast, and Batticaloa on the east. The blasts came as members of Sri Lanka's peaceful Christian minority prepared to attend church services for Easter Sunday. Dr Emmanuel is a 48-year-old physician. He grew up in Sri Lanka, and now lives in Surrey, UK, with his wife and children. They were in Colombo this week to visit some of their relatives who still live in the city. They were asleep in their room in Colombo's Cinnamon Grand Hotel when one of the bombs went off. ""We were in our bedroom and we heard this huge explosion which rocked our room, I think it was about 8:30,"" he said. ""We were then ushered to the lounge in our hotel, where we were asked to evacuate through the back. This is where we saw casualties being taken away to the hospital, and we saw some of the damage to the hotel."" Among the churches attacked was St Sebastian's in Negombo A staff member commented that she had seen a dismembered body at the site of the explosion, while his friends sent him photos of the churches that had been bombed. The hotel itself, meanwhile, had ""significant damage"" - one of the restaurants had been blown up. ""We were going to go to church today, with my mum and nephew, but all the church services have been cancelled - there aren't going to be any more church services in the country because of what's happened this morning,"" he said. Scores die in Sri Lanka church and hotel attacks Follow the latest reports live ""I spent my first 18 years in Sri Lanka, so I've seen a lot of ethnic strife."" Sri Lanka was ravaged by decades of conflict between the Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups, but has been relatively peaceful since 2009. ""Whereas my kids, my children are 11 and seven, and they've never seen anything like war, and neither has my wife. For them it's quite difficult."" He added: ""It's really sad - I thought Sri Lanka had left all this violence behind us, but now it's sad to see that it's come back again."" Mr Ali lives in Colombo. He first noticed something was wrong when worshippers were ""hastily"" evacuated from a Roman Catholic church near his home. His road, which leads up to the city's main hospital, was also suddenly filled with ambulances. He checked the hashtag #LKA - Lanka - and quickly learned what was going on. Among the horrific footage and images was an appeal from the country's blood centres for people to donate to help the victims. The National Blood Centre in Colombo was filled with people hoping to donate Mr Ali went to the National Blood Centre, and found it thronged with people. ""There were huge crowds and roads congested as people tried to park wherever and enter the blood centre,"" he said. ""Currently they are taking down the name, blood group and contact number of persons who are willing to donate blood, and asking them to return only if a representative of the National Blood Centre contacts them."" People were spilling out of the building, he said, forming ""massive queues leading all the way to the entrance"". People formed long queues leading right up to the door Once inside, there was a strong community spirit. ""Everyone just had one intention, and that was to help victims of the blast, no matter what religion or race they may be. Each person was helping another out in filling [out forms with] the details requested. ""I wonder where this attack came from. God save us."" Kieran Arasaratnam, a professor at Imperial College London Business School, was staying at the Shangri-La hotel, whose second-floor restaurant was gutted in a blast. Mr Arasaratnam, a Sri Lankan who moved to the UK as a refugee 30 years ago, was visiting the country to help launch a social enterprise. He was in his room when he heard a sound like ""thunder"". He told the BBC he started running for his life from the 18th to the ground floor amid desperate scenes. ""Everyone just started to panic, it was total chaos,"" he said. ""I looked to the room on the right and there's blood everywhere. ""Everyone was running and a lot of people just don't know what was going on. People had blood on their shirt and there was someone carrying a girl to the ambulance. The walls and the floor were covered in blood."" The Shangri-La hotel's second-floor restaurant was gutted in a blast The 41-year-old says he might have been caught up in the blast if he had not delayed going to breakfast. He says he left his room at around 08:45 (03:15 GMT), the time when several explosions were reported to have occurred at hotels and churches in different locations. ""Something distracted me so I went back to the room to grab my debit card, opened the curtain and switched off the 'do not disturb' signâ¦ and a big blast went off,"" he said. He says he's currently in an emergency shelter. There, he says, he can ""smell blood everywhere"", with people injured in the blast needing treatment and searching for missing family members. ""It's awful seeing kids carried off covered in blood. I left Sri Lanka 30 years ago as a refugee and never thought I had to see this again."" Simon Whitmarsh, a 55-year-old retired doctor from Wales, is on holiday in Sri Lanka. He was cycling near the city of Batticaloa when he heard a ""big bang"" and saw ""smoke billowing into the sky about half a mile away"". A blast ripped through a church in the city as worshippers were gathering for services. ""Then we saw the ambulances, people crying, and we were told to leave the area,"" he told the BBC. As a former consultant paediatrician, Mr Whitmarsh says he felt compelled to help those affected so volunteered at the local hospital. Sri Lankan security forces secure the area around St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo ""By that stage, they had activated emergency protocols,"" he says. ""The hospital was heavily guarded by the army, who were stopping most people going in. ""All the streets around it were closed. It seemed very well organised. All I did was find someone senior to see if I could help."" He says the nationwide curfew, imposed by Sri Lankan authorities in the wake of the blasts, has completely emptied streets and roads that were bustling only hours ago. ""Now it's curfew, there's nothing. No vehicles, no people walking, nothing,"" he says. ""'Stay indoors' is the message."" He added: ""London people have said they were thinking of going home, but we can't do anything until the curfew finishes.""

Arrests made in moorland fire probe,"Fire crews were called in to help from across the region as the blaze spread across moorland Three men have been arrested after a large fire took hold on moorland in West Yorkshire. Firefighters tackled flames covering 25,000 sq m on Ilkley Moor on Saturday, with helicopters making water drops. West Yorkshire Police said the men, aged 19, 23 and 24, remain in custody for questioning while inquiries continue. Bradford Council reiterated a warning for walkers to stay off the moors as crews were damping down. A police spokesperson said a smaller fire took hold on a different section of the moor on Saturday, with investigations under way to see if it is connected to the larger blaze. A wide area of Ilkley Moor, pictured here at 22:15 BST on Saturday, was well alight Beaters, water backpacks, pumps and helicopter water drops have been used to fight the fire West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (WYFRS) said the fire was in the White Wells area of the hillside, with smoke still clearly visible from the spa town below. Water jets, beaters and specialist wildfire units are being used in the aftermath, with police describing the blaze as ""under control"". Martin Langan, WYFRS incident commander, said: ""We've managed to die the flames down but there's a significant amount of smoke blowing into Ilkley."" Mark Hunnebell said he had seen ""countless"" water drops from helicopters on Sunday morning Police closed a section of Hangingstone Road near the Cow and Calf Rocks during the damping down operation. Mark Hunnebell, who has run White Wells Spa Cafe for two decades, said his business was evacuated when the ""fire started to spread towards us"" at 19:00 BST on Saturday. Latest news and stories from Yorkshire He said: ""We've seen some fires here in the past, but I've never seen anything like the scale of this one. ""The helicopters have made countless water drops for most of the morning, they've been backwards and forwards constantly."" The fire took hold in the White Wells area above the spa town of Ilkley Christina Cheney, whose house backs onto the moor near an area known as The Tarn, praised the fire service for keeping residents safe. ""A large swathe of the moor looks quite devastated this morning, we're lucky our homes were all safe in the end,"" she said. ""The same can't be said for so much wildlife."" Allow Twitter content?

Girl finds her voice after brain surgeryLeia Armitage was born profoundly deaf but pioneering surgery and therapy has enabled her to hear.Health,"Seven-year-old Leia Armitage lived in total silence for the first two years of her life, but thanks to pioneering brain surgery and years of therapy she has found her voice and can finally tell her parents she loves them. ""We were told you could put a bomb behind her and she wouldn't hear it at all if it went off,"" said Leia's father, Bob, as he recalled finding out their baby daughter had a rare form of profound deafness. Leia, from Dagenham in east London, had no inner ear or hearing nerve, meaning that even standard hearing aids or cochlear implants wouldn't help her. As a result, she was never expected to speak - but despite the risks, her parents fought for her to be one of the first children in the UK to be given an auditory brainstem implant, requiring complex brain surgery when she was two years old. NHS England calls the surgery ""truly life-changing"" and has said it will fund the implant for other deaf children in a similar position. It is estimated that about 15 children a year will be assessed for the procedure and nine will go on to have surgery. Bob says opting for this type of brain surgery was a huge decision for them, but ""we wanted to give Leia the best opportunity in life"". He and his wife Alison hoped that after the surgery at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust she would be able to hear things like cars beeping their horns as she crossed the road - to make her safer in the world. However, in the five years since the surgery, her progress has been much greater than they ever expected. Leia with her parents, Bob and Alison, and brother Jacob It started slowly, with Leia turning her head at the sound of train doors closing shortly after the operation. Gradually, she started to understand the concept of sound while her parents continually repeated words, asking her to mimic the sound. Now, after lots of regular speech and language therapy, she can put full sentences together, attempt to sing along to music and hear voices on the phone. ""We can call her upstairs when we're downstairs and she will hear us,"" Bob explains. But it's at mainstream school, in a classroom with hearing children, where Leia is really flying, thanks to assistants using sign language and giving her plenty of one-to-one time. ""She is picking up more and more and she's not far behind others of her age in most things,"" Bob says. At home, using her voice is what pleases her parents most. ""'I love you Daddy' is probably the best thing I've heard her say,"" Bob says. ""When I'm putting her to bed she now says 'good night Mummy', which is something I never expected to hear,"" Alison says. The cutting-edge surgery involves inserting a device directly into the brain to stimulate the hearing pathways in children born with no cochlea or auditory nerves. The implant is inserted directly into the brain next to the brainstem at the bottom of the brain A microphone and sound processor unit worn on the side of the head then transmits sound to the implant. This electrical stimulation can provide auditory sensations, but it cannot promise to restore normal hearing. However, Prof Dan Jiang, consultant otologist and clinical director of the Hearing Implant Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, said some children can develop a degree of speech. ""The outcomes are variable. Some will do better than others,"" he said. ""They have to adapt to it and younger children do better so we like to insert the implant early if possible."" Children under five are best placed to learn new concepts of sound and respond to intensive therapy, he said. Susan Daniels, chief executive of the National Deaf Children's Society, said: ""Every deaf child is different and for some, technology like auditory brainstem implants can be the right option and can make a huge difference to their lives. ""With the right support, deaf children can achieve just as well as their hearing peers and this investment is another important step towards a society where no deaf child is left behind.""

Further blasts took place in St Sebastian's Church in Negombo, a town approximately 20 miles north of Colombo, and at Zion Church in Batticaloa, on the east coast. Manisha Gunasekera, Sri Lanka's High Commissioner, told the BBC that the large Sri Lankan community in the UK was ""very concerned"". The Queen has offered her condolences to Sri Lanka's president, saying her thoughts and prayers were with all Sri Lankans. She said: ""Prince Philip and I were deeply saddened to learn of the attacks in Sri Lanka yesterday and send our condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives"". St Sebastian's Church in Negombo was severely damaged Kieran Arasaratnam, a professor at Imperial College London, was on his way to the breakfast room in the Shangri-La hotel when he heard the blast. He told the BBC he saw a young child, aged about eight or nine, being carried to an ambulance, and all around him, ""everyone's just running in panic"". ""The military was coming in. It's just total chaos. So I then just literally ran out and then I looked to the room on the right and there's blood everywhere."" Tourist Marisa Keller, from London, was also staying at the Shangri-La but wasn't in the hotel when it was attacked. She said she felt ""lucky to be alive"". ""There were lots of bodies, blood, ambulances, police. Swat teams were sent in. ""One side of the hotel was blocked off. They were letting people back in because of the hot sun,"" she said. One of the explosions hit the Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo Julian Emmanuel and his family, from Surrey, were staying at the Cinnamon Grand when they were woken up by the explosion. ""There were ambulances, fire crews, police sirens,"" he told the BBC. ""I came out of the room to see what's happening, we were ushered downstairs. ""We were told there had been a bomb. Staff said some people were killed. One member of staff told me it was a suicide bomber."" A statue of the Virgin Mary, broken in St Anthony's Shrine The Sri Lankan government said on Monday that the bombings werecarried out with the support of an international network. It has blamed a little-known local jihadist group, National Thowheed Jamath, although no-one has yet admitted carrying out the attacks. Police have arrested 24 people in a series of raids. People caught up in the deadly blasts tell their story Sri Lanka profiled: Find out more about the country Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has condemned the attacks as ""utterly despicable destruction"" during his Easter address at Canterbury Cathedral. Prime Minister Theresa May said the killings were ""truly appalling"" and ""no-one should ever have to practise their faith in fear."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I stand with the victims, their families, the people of Sri Lanka and Christians around the world. We must defeat this hatred with unity, love and respect.""

Prison mobiles traced to exact cellsOfficers are using technology to work out precisely where a phone signal is coming from.UK,"Prison staff are using technology to find and seize phones used illegally by inmates in England and Wales. New detection kits can narrow a phone's location down to a single jail cell, the Ministry of Justice said. Staff get an alert when a phone is detected, which helps them track inmates organising drug smuggling or contacting criminals on the outside. After a six-month trial at one jail, the kits will now be used at four more. The locations are not being revealed. Rise in demand for specialist prison squad New detectors to spot drivers on phones Thousands of criminals to be tracked 24/7 Prison visitors' faces scanned to stop drugs The real-time alerts are shown on a digital heat map which identifies the strength of the signal. The results can be used as evidence in police investigations and can lead to arrests, the MoJ said. Justice Secretary David Gauke said use of the technology was ""vital"" to make prisons places of ""safety and rehabilitation"". ""As criminals look for new ways to smuggle contraband into prisons, it is vital that we stay one step ahead, and this kind of technology will help prevent them operating from their cells,"" he added. At least 15,000 mobile phones or SIM cards wereconfiscated in English and Welsh prisons in 2017- equivalent to one for every six inmates.

Speaking on Saturday, PSNI Det Supt Jason Murphy said police had received ""positive support from the community"" but needed to ""convert this support into tangible evidence"". ""We will continue to work positively and sensitively with the local community to achieve this,"" he said. Det Supt Murphy appealed specifically to people who were in Fanad Drive and Central Drive on Thursday night, the area where Ms McKee was fatally wounded, to come forward with footage of the incident. ""Please come and speak with my detectives and provide us with your mobile phone footage,"" he said. ""We do not need to hold on to your phone, we have necessary equipment that will allow us to download the footage quickly."" Meanwhile, the Catholic bishop of Derry said the community in the nationalist area where Lyra McKee was shot dead needs to be ""liberated"" from dissident republicans. The words ""not in our name - RIP Lyra"" have been added to the famous Free Derry mural in the city's Bogside area. This video can not be played Journalist Lyra McKee, 29,  was shot during rioting in Londonderry Police have blamed dissident republicans for the murder, which happened after violence broke out as officers were carrying out searches for weapons and ammunition. Intelligence had led them to suspect that there could be attacks on police over the Easter period. Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle when she was shot after a masked gunman fired towards police and onlookers. A statement issued by the hard-left republican political party Saoradh on Friday sought to justify the use of violence on Thursday night. Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left in the Creggan estate where she was shot Saoradh, which translates as liberation in Irish, has the support of the dissident republican group the New IRA. Bishop Donal McKeown said the ""small"" group of dissident republicans in Derry is a ""danger to all of us"". He told the BBC's Sunday Sequence that people in the Creggan estate were ""disgusted at what happened"". ""The one liberation they require in that community is liberation from Saoradh,"" he said.

Extinction Rebellion to 'pause protests',"This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally A teenage climate change activist has told Extinction Rebellion protesters in London they are ""making a difference"". Greta Thunberg, 16, was greeted with chants of ""we love you"" as she took to the stage in front of thousands of people at the rally in Marble Arch. A protest organiser said they planned ""a week of activities"" including a bid to prevent MPs entering Parliament. More than 950 people have been arrested during the climate change protests and 40 people have been charged. Ms Thunberg, a Swedish teenager who is credited with inspiring an international movement to fight climate change, told the crowd ""humanity is standing at a crossroads"" and that protesters ""will never stop fighting for this planet"". Addressing the crowd at about 19:30 BST, she said: ""For way too long the politicians and people in power have got away with not doing anything at all to fight the climate crisis and ecological crisis. ""But we will make sure they will not get away with it any longer."" The Swedish teenager was greeted with loud cheers as she took to the stage As of 19:00 on Sunday, a total of 963 people had been arrested during the climate change protests. The Met Police said 40 people, aged 19 to 77, have been charged for ""various offences including breach of Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police"". Extinction Rebellion said it hoped to negotiate with the Mayor of London and the Met over continuing its demonstrations at Old Palace Yard in Westminster and leaving other sites. Organisers said there would be a ""people's assembly"" at Marble Arch on Monday afternoon to decide what will happen in the coming week. By Dan Coles, BBC News For much of the day there had been several hundred people at Extinction Rebellion's Marble Arch site. But the chance to hear from Greta Thunberg - something of a celebrity in the climate protest world - saw the numbers swell into the thousands. The crowd was bolstered by an influx from the Parliament Square location and their banners filled the air. Greta Thunberg's two-day journey to London by train was eagerly followed on social media and she got a huge cheer as she finally took to the stage. Her speech was short and sweet, but the message was exactly what the crowd wanted to hear: ""Keep going. You are making a difference."" Hundreds of officers from other police forces have been sent to London to help the Met Earlier, Extinction Rebellion member Farhana Yamin said the group had offered to ""pause"" protests and begin ""a new phase of rebellion"" to achieve ""political aims"". She said the move would show the group was an ""organised and a long-term political force to be reckoned with"". Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Greta Thunberg, 16, up for Peace Prize Who is Greta Thunberg? However, another Extinction Rebellion organiser Larch Maxey told the BBC there ""certainly won't be a pause in our activities"". He said: ""On Tuesday we've got a series of strategic points around the city which we will be targeting to cause maximum economic disruption while simultaneously focusing on Parliament and inviting MPs to pause."" Asked if MPs would be able to get into Parliament, he added: ""Not if we are successful, we're going to prevent them getting in so they have time to separate themselves from the politicking and concentrate on what's at stake here."" Cressida Dick said Londoners had experienced ""miserable disruption"" because of the protests Police have been trying to confine the protests to Marble Arch but demonstrators have ignored the threat of arrest and continued to block roads across the capital. Areas around Oxford Circus and Parliament Square have reopened to traffic after officers cleared protesters. On Sunday afternoon, police removed the skate ramp, cooking tents and other infrastructure from the activists' camp on Waterloo Bridge. Some protesters began removing their collection of trees and plants, and officers removed the last activist from the bridge at about 22:00. Officers carry away pieces of wood as they break up the protesters' camp on Waterloo Bridge Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said that during her 36-year career she had never known a single police operation to result in so many arrests. She said she was grateful for the help fromhundreds of police officers drafted in from several forces, including the neighbouring City of London Police. Officers from Kent, Sussex, Essex, Hampshire and Greater Manchester have also been sent. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said ""more than 9,000 officers"" had been responding to the demonstrations and he was ""extremely concerned"" about their impact on tackling issues such as violent crime. Police cleared Oxford Circus of protesters on Saturday after six days of demonstrations This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

Can Tories and Labour agree?,"Andrew Fisher (centre) accompanied Mr McDonnell to the talks Cross-party talks are continuing in Whitehall, amid parliamentary deadlock over Theresa May's Brexit deal. So what are the sticking points and can Labour and the Conservatives reach an agreement? Public statements on the talks have tended to be bland, ranging from ""constructive"" and ""serious"" to the slightly more negative: ""We have some way to travel."" Behind the scenes, the prospect of a deal, while difficult, is not impossible. There is a big incentive for both sides to reach agreement: the avoidance of next month's European elections. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Theresa May defends new Brexit delay Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party Prime Minister Theresa May doesn't want to give a platform toparties such as Nigel Farage's new projectwhich could appeal to Brexit-voting Conservatives. And, frankly, some of her own activists would be conflicted over how, or whether, to vote. For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, awkward questions about a second referendum could be ducked if there is no election campaign. So the talks are serious and not just political window dressing, and the fact that Mr Corbyn and Mrs May met on Thursday is significant. Michael Gove is one of the Conservatives taking part in negotiations The Labour leader's policy guru Andrew Fisher joined shadow chancellor John McDonnell for the cross-party talks on Friday. But, as I understand it, significant hurdles remain. Some of the detail of possible changes to the Political Declaration - the blueprint for the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU - is being discussed. But sequencing is a problem. Labour wants to discuss legally binding changes to the document, future-proofing it, where possible, against a change of Conservative leader. Broadly speaking, the government would rather do ""the easy bit"" first - discussing legislation to protect  workers' rights. Resolving this tension is key to a deal. Labour is also keen to secure agreement on a customs union. It is flexible on what it would be called - an ""arrangement"", for example - and Mrs May hinted on Thursday that the two sides were close on this. But they are not yet close enough. The definition of what a customs union/arrangement does is vital to the Labour side. But the main constraints to a deal may come from Mrs May and Mr Corbyn's parties, rather than their negotiators. Many Labour members want another referendum if agreement is reached If there is too much compromise on a customs union, Mrs May risks losing more cabinet ministers. For Mr Corbyn, the pressure from many Labour members is for him to exact a referendum, in return for passing the deal. So far, the prime minister isn't budging on this. One way round this obstacle would be to hold a separate vote in Parliament on a referendum, possibly as an amendment to the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn - who is not an enthusiast for a public vote - believe this would fall. But some of the Labour leader's shadow ministers - including some who are firmly on the Left - are pushing for a referendum, or confirmatory ballot, to be tied explicitly to any Brexit deal. So, getting a deal passed would be totally dependent on approving a public vote at the same time. I am told shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for a ballot to be part of any final package. If, in the end, these difficulties can't be overcome then the hope is that both sides will at least agree a parliamentary process for discussing and voting on options which might finally break the deadlock.

Hundreds of officers sent to help Met,"This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally A teenage climate change activist has told Extinction Rebellion protesters in London they are ""making a difference"". Greta Thunberg, 16, was greeted with chants of ""we love you"" as she took to the stage in front of thousands of people at the rally in Marble Arch. A protest organiser said they planned ""a week of activities"" including a bid to prevent MPs entering Parliament. More than 950 people have been arrested during the climate change protests and 40 people have been charged. Ms Thunberg, a Swedish teenager who is credited with inspiring an international movement to fight climate change, told the crowd ""humanity is standing at a crossroads"" and that protesters ""will never stop fighting for this planet"". Addressing the crowd at about 19:30 BST, she said: ""For way too long the politicians and people in power have got away with not doing anything at all to fight the climate crisis and ecological crisis. ""But we will make sure they will not get away with it any longer."" The Swedish teenager was greeted with loud cheers as she took to the stage As of 19:00 on Sunday, a total of 963 people had been arrested during the climate change protests. The Met Police said 40 people, aged 19 to 77, have been charged for ""various offences including breach of Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police"". Extinction Rebellion said it hoped to negotiate with the Mayor of London and the Met over continuing its demonstrations at Old Palace Yard in Westminster and leaving other sites. Organisers said there would be a ""people's assembly"" at Marble Arch on Monday afternoon to decide what will happen in the coming week. By Dan Coles, BBC News For much of the day there had been several hundred people at Extinction Rebellion's Marble Arch site. But the chance to hear from Greta Thunberg - something of a celebrity in the climate protest world - saw the numbers swell into the thousands. The crowd was bolstered by an influx from the Parliament Square location and their banners filled the air. Greta Thunberg's two-day journey to London by train was eagerly followed on social media and she got a huge cheer as she finally took to the stage. Her speech was short and sweet, but the message was exactly what the crowd wanted to hear: ""Keep going. You are making a difference."" Hundreds of officers from other police forces have been sent to London to help the Met Earlier, Extinction Rebellion member Farhana Yamin said the group had offered to ""pause"" protests and begin ""a new phase of rebellion"" to achieve ""political aims"". She said the move would show the group was an ""organised and a long-term political force to be reckoned with"". Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Greta Thunberg, 16, up for Peace Prize Who is Greta Thunberg? However, another Extinction Rebellion organiser Larch Maxey told the BBC there ""certainly won't be a pause in our activities"". He said: ""On Tuesday we've got a series of strategic points around the city which we will be targeting to cause maximum economic disruption while simultaneously focusing on Parliament and inviting MPs to pause."" Asked if MPs would be able to get into Parliament, he added: ""Not if we are successful, we're going to prevent them getting in so they have time to separate themselves from the politicking and concentrate on what's at stake here."" Cressida Dick said Londoners had experienced ""miserable disruption"" because of the protests Police have been trying to confine the protests to Marble Arch but demonstrators have ignored the threat of arrest and continued to block roads across the capital. Areas around Oxford Circus and Parliament Square have reopened to traffic after officers cleared protesters. On Sunday afternoon, police removed the skate ramp, cooking tents and other infrastructure from the activists' camp on Waterloo Bridge. Some protesters began removing their collection of trees and plants, and officers removed the last activist from the bridge at about 22:00. Officers carry away pieces of wood as they break up the protesters' camp on Waterloo Bridge Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said that during her 36-year career she had never known a single police operation to result in so many arrests. She said she was grateful for the help fromhundreds of police officers drafted in from several forces, including the neighbouring City of London Police. Officers from Kent, Sussex, Essex, Hampshire and Greater Manchester have also been sent. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said ""more than 9,000 officers"" had been responding to the demonstrations and he was ""extremely concerned"" about their impact on tackling issues such as violent crime. Police cleared Oxford Circus of protesters on Saturday after six days of demonstrations This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

""We will continue to work positively and sensitively with the local community to achieve this,"" he said. Det Supt Murphy appealed specifically to people who were in Fanad Drive and Central Drive on Thursday night, the area where Ms McKee was fatally wounded, to come forward with footage of the incident. ""Please come and speak with my detectives and provide us with your mobile phone footage,"" he said. ""We do not need to hold on to your phone, we have necessary equipment that will allow us to download the footage quickly.""

This video can not be played Journalist Lyra McKee, 29,  was shot during rioting in Londonderry Police have blamed dissident republicans for the murder, which happened after violence broke out as officers were carrying out searches for weapons and ammunition. Intelligence had led them to suspect that there could be attacks on police over the Easter period. Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle when she was shot after a masked gunman fired towards police and onlookers. A statement issued by the hard-left republican political party Saoradh on Friday sought to justify the use of violence on Thursday night. Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left in the Creggan estate where she was shot Saoradh, which translates as liberation in Irish, has the support of the dissident republican group the New IRA. Bishop Donal McKeown said the ""small"" group of dissident republicans in Derry is a ""danger to all of us"". He told the BBC's Sunday Sequence that people in the Creggan estate were ""disgusted at what happened"". ""The one liberation they require in that community is liberation from Saoradh,"" he said. ""We don't want to be laboured with a reputation that comes from a small group that represents a small number of people but is actually a danger to all of us.""

"Scores die in Sri Lanka church attacksAt least 160 people are killed and hundreds hurt in eight blasts in churches and hotels, as a curfew is announced.","This video can not be played Deadly explosions strike across Sri Lanka At least 207 people have been killed and 450 hurt in explosions at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka, police say. Eight blasts were reported, including at three churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo's Kochchikade district during Easter services. The Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand luxury hotels, all in the capital, were also targeted. A curfew has been put in place ""until further notice"" and social media networks have been temporarily blocked. It remains unclear who carried out the attacks, but reports say 13 people have so far been arrested. Late on Sunday, the country's air force said an improvised explosive device had been found, and disposed of, close to Colombo's main airport. ""A PVC pipe which was six feet in length containing explosives in it was discovered,"" spokesman Gihan Seneviratne told local media. As it happened: Sri Lanka explosions ""I thought we had left all this violence behind us"" In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks It comes as the country's prime minister admitted there may have been prior intelligence about the attacks. Officials says 36 foreign nationals are thought to be among the dead, including 25 yet to be identified. The first reports of explosions came at about 08:45 (03:15 GMT) local time - with six blasts reported close together at churches and luxury hotels. St Sebastian's church in Negombo was severely damaged in one explosion, with dozens killed at the site. Images from inside showed blood on the pews and the building's ceiling shattered. There were also heavy casualties at the site of the first blast in St Anthony's, a hugely popular shrine in Kochchikade, a district of Colombo. Robert Tyler, who has lived in Sri Lanka for six years, told the BBC that at least two of the hotels appeared to have had their restaurants targeted at a busy time for breakfast. Two further explosions were reported as police tried to find those involved. One blast hit near the zoo in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and an eighth was reported near the Colombo district of Dematagoda during a police raid, killing three officers. The government has said most of the attacks are thought to have been carried out by suicide bombers. The streets of Colombo were far quieter than usual as the curfew came in The vast majority of those killed are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals, including dozens who were attending Easter church services. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs saysfive British people - including two with joint US citizenship - are among the dead. The US State Department has said ""several"" Americans have been killed. Three Danish citizens, two Turkish nationals and one person from the Netherlands were also killed, their governments have confirmed. Sri Lankan officials say three Indian nationals and one Portuguese citizen are also among the dead. They say 25 more fatalities at a Colombo mortuary are also thought to be international citizens awaiting identification. Airlines have said people are still able to travel to the airport under the curfew if they produce their boarding pass and identification at checkpoints. Travellers are being advised to arrive at the airport four hours before their scheduled flight time. A bomb goes off as Special Task Force personnel raid a home near Dematagoda in Colombo Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the media on Sunday evening. During the briefing, he referred to allegations that officials had been in possession of intelligence suggesting an impending attack. ""We must look into why adequate precautions were not taken. Neither I nor the Ministers were kept informed,"" he said. ""For now the priority is to apprehend the attackers,"" he added. Pope Francis, in his traditional Urbi et Orbi speech at the Vatican, condemned the attacks as ""such cruel violence"" targeting Christians celebrating Easter. Blast damage at the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said he is ""outraged"" by the attacks, and hopes the perpetrators will be ""swiftly brought to justice"". Cardinal Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm Ranjith, told the BBC: ""It's a very difficult and a very sad situation for all of us because we never expected such a thing to happen and especially on Easter Sunday."" UK PM Theresa May tweeted condolences, saying the ""acts of violence against churches and hotels in Sri Lanka are truly appalling"". US President Donald Trump tweeted ""heartfelt condolences"" for the ""horrible terrorist attacks"". This video can not be played Archbishop of Colombo: ''A very, very sad day for all of us"" Sunday's attacks are the deadliest seen in Sri Lanka since the end of the country's civil war in 2009. The civil war ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, who had fought for 26 years for an independent homeland for the minority ethnic Tamils. The war is thought to have killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people. The nation has seen some sporadic violence since.In March 2018 a state of emergency was declaredafter members of the majority Buddhist Sinhala community attacked mosques and Muslim-owned properties.

Labour 'must back second Brexit vote'Labour's deputy leader says the move would counter a challenge from Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party.,"Labour must promise another Brexit referendum to counter the electoral challenge posed by Nigel Farage, the party's deputy leader has said. Writing in the Observer,external, Tom Watson said his party could not ""sit on the fence"" about the biggest issue to face the UK for a generation. But ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage said a new referendum would be ""a total insult"" to five million Labour Leave voters. The UK has been givenan extension to the Brexit processuntil 31 October. This means the UK is likely to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May. Mr Farage launched his new Brexit Party last weekand said it had a list of 70 candidates to fight the May elections. Will Labour push for a public vote? How UK is gearing up for European elections Mr Watson warned that Labour would not defeat Mr Farage ""by being mealy-mouthed and sounding as if we half agree with him"". ""We won't beat him unless we can inspire the millions crying out for a different direction,"" he added. He said a ""confirmatory"" referendum and ""final say"" on any deal was ""the very least"" voters deserved, now they knew more about what Brexit would mean. He added: ""They deserve a Labour Party that offers clarity on this issue, as well as the radical vision for a new political economy achieved by working with our socialist allies inside the EU. ""And, above all, they deserve better than Nigel Farage's promise of a far-right Brexit that would solve nothing."" However, Mr Farage accused Mr Watson of breaking promises to the British people and said he intended to ""wholeheartedly target Labour lies and dishonesty in the weeks ahead"". Talks with the Conservatives aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock have re-opened Labour's divisions over a possible further referendum. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry wrote to cabinet colleaguesto warn that striking a deal with the prime minister that ditched the commitment to a public vote would breach party policy. A survey earlier this year found that 70% of Labour members support another referendum, but nine of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's top team are sceptical or opposed. Nigel Farage described 23 May as the ""first step"" for his party Mr Farage's Brexit Party also poses a threat to the Conservative Party,according to a survey for the Mail on Sunday,external. The Survation poll of 781 Conservative councillors found that 40% were planning to back the Brexit Party at the May European elections. Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide Just over half - 52% - said they would vote for their own party. If Brexiteer Boris Johnson was prime minister this figure would rise to 65%, the survey found. Some 15% said they believed Mr Farage would be the best leader of the Conservative Party - only Mr Johnson was ahead of him, on 19%. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent Nigel Farage relishes the opportunity to put a cat among the pigeons - and once again the two biggest parties are questioning how to deal with his unambiguous pro-Brexit message. Tom Watson's case is that Labour needs to be different. He's not impressed with the idea of ""sounding as if we half agree"" with Mr Farage, urging his party to strengthen its message on another referendum and provide a natural home to those on the other side of the Brexit debate. The problem is that some in the Labour completely disagree. They think it would an historic mistake to ignore Labour voters who backed Leave in 2016 and believe it may actually encourage those voters to side with Mr Farage. The Conservatives are grappling with how to fight the European elections too. Today'spoll in the Mail on Sunday,externalsuggests some Conservative councillors are prepared to turn their back on the party - at least temporarily - and support Mr Farage. That will only feed into fears in the Tory leadership that these elections could be a disaster for the party - and strengthen resolve to try to stop them happening by getting a deal through Parliament. The picture isn't the same everywhere. In Scotland, for example, the pro-referendum SNP appear to be maintaining strong support. But Mr Farage will continue to argue that the main parties have failed to honour the referendum result. And his allies suspect that message will prove a powerful one for Brexit supporters if the European Parliament elections go ahead. Although Theresa May has said she still wants the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible, she is yet to get her withdrawal deal  - which has been rejected three times by MPs - approved by Parliament. Cross-party talks between the government and the Labour Party are continuing, to find a way through the impasse. Labour wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, which would allow tariff-free trade in goods. The government has repeatedly ruled out remaining in the EU's customs union, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. The EU has said the UK must hold elections to the European Parliament in May or leave on 1 June without a deal.

Speaking on Saturday, PSNI Det Supt Jason Murphy said police had received ""positive support from the community"" but needed to ""convert this support into tangible evidence"". ""We will continue to work positively and sensitively with the local community to achieve this,"" he said. Det Supt Murphy appealed specifically to people who were in Fanad Drive and Central Drive on Thursday night, the area where Ms McKee was fatally wounded, to come forward with footage of the incident. ""Please come and speak with my detectives and provide us with your mobile phone footage,"" he said. ""We do not need to hold on to your phone, we have necessary equipment that will allow us to download the footage quickly."" Meanwhile, the Catholic bishop of Derry said the community in the nationalist area where Lyra McKee was shot dead needs to be ""liberated"" from dissident republicans. The words ""not in our name - RIP Lyra"" have been added to the famous Free Derry mural in the city's Bogside area. This video can not be played Journalist Lyra McKee, 29,  was shot during rioting in Londonderry Police have blamed dissident republicans for the murder, which happened after violence broke out as officers were carrying out searches for weapons and ammunition. Intelligence had led them to suspect that there could be attacks on police over the Easter period. Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle when she was shot after a masked gunman fired towards police and onlookers. A statement issued by the hard-left republican political party Saoradh on Friday sought to justify the use of violence on Thursday night. Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left in the Creggan estate where she was shot Saoradh, which translates as liberation in Irish, has the support of the dissident republican group the New IRA. Bishop Donal McKeown said the ""small"" group of dissident republicans in Derry is a ""danger to all of us"". He told the BBC's Sunday Sequence that people in the Creggan estate were ""disgusted at what happened"". ""The one liberation they require in that community is liberation from Saoradh,"" he said. ""We don't want to be laboured with a reputation that comes from a small group that represents a small number of people but is actually a danger to all of us."" This video can not be played PSNI released CCTV footage after Lyra McKee's murder Ms McKee's killing came 21 years after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed in Northern Ireland. The 1998 peace deal marked the end in the region of decades of violent conflict - known as the Troubles - involving republicans and loyalists during which about 3,600 people are estimated to have died. The Good Friday Agreementwas the result of intense negotiations involving the UK and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's political parties. Tributes have been paid to Ms McKee from leading figures in the worlds of journalism, politics and beyond.

Crews battle 'intense' moorland blaze,"Fire crews were called in from across the region to help deal with the blaze Firefighters have been working through the night to bring a large moorland blaze under control. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (WYFRS) said several acres of Ilkley Moor caught fire on Saturday after a day of soaring temperatures. The fire involves moorland above White Wells in Ilkley. Bradford Council is warning walkers to keep off the moors. Crews from 10 engines remained at the scene of the blaze overnight to damp down. Originally there were 14 crews at the scene but WYFRS said it had scaled back its response to the blaze. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ""awful scenes"" on the moor were a reminder ""of why we urgently need to tackle climate change"". On Saturday night Martyn Hughes, a watch manager at North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service which is assisting WYFRS, tweeted: ""The intense heat, steep slopes and rough terrain are causing the fire to spread rapidly whilst we try to get near the flames.""

Police still hope to solve 1959 murder,"Carol Ann Stephens, who was abducted and murdered in April 1959 Police say they have not given up hope of solving one of Wales' most notorious murders. Cardiff schoolgirl Carol Ann Stephens was abducted in April 1959, and her body found two weeks later in a remote spot in Carmarthenshire. Despite a huge manhunt and the help of the Metropolitan Police, the six-year-old's killer was never caught. But officers say the case still remains active and they hope someone can provide answers for Carol's family. On Tuesday 7 April, in the Cathays area of Cardiff, Carol told her mother Mavis she was going out to play and left their house in Malefant Street. Her family never saw her alive again. The disappearance would spark one of the biggest police operations in Wales. Over the next few days, thousands of cars were stopped in Cardiff, and police watched ports to see if the abductor was taking Carol out of the country. Malefant Street in Cardiff, where Carol Ann Stephens lived Residents were asked to check garden sheds and farmers were told to search their outbuildings. There was even talk of draining Roath Park Lake as part of the search. The huge search was in vain, however. Exactly two weeks after Carol disappeared - on 21 April - a surveyor working in a narrow river culvert near the village of Horeb, north of Llanelli, came across the little girl's body. She had been suffocated and dumped in the water. Despite the interest in the case - more than 400 people waited outside Llanelli Town Hall to hear the verdict of Carol's initial inquest - police had very little to work with. She had told her friends she had a ""new uncle"" who had been taking her for drives, and she had been seen talking to a man in a car on the day she disappeared, but apart from that, police had many questions to answer. Carol Ann Stephens was abducted from near her home in Cardiff, and her body found in Carmarthenshire Had Carol known her killer? Did the remote location of her body mean it was someone who knew the Horeb area well? Had anyone seen Carol with her abductor on the journey west? Those questions now face Det Ch Insp Mark Lewis, who works in the Major Crime Review team at South Wales Police. Sixty years on from the murder, Carol's case is one of the oldest the force is dealing with. Despite that, Det Ch Insp Lewis hopes the crime can be solved, not least because it still casts a shadow over parts of south Wales. He said: ""We may not be in a position to ever prosecute someone for this case, but the impact on the community in Cathays, the family and friends - some of whom are still alive - and the people of Horeb and Llanelli was very strong and people would still like answers. ""I can tell you there is still a dark cloud hanging over some of those communities. ""There was a lot of trust in those days, children played in the street and people left their doors open. ""For a child to be snatched off the street was a shock in Cardiff, but it was a huge shock for people living in Horeb as well. This was a sleepy little village where people just got on with their lives quite peacefully. ""For a six-year-old child to be taken, murdered and then dumped in the middle of nowhere, that leaves a lasting legacy so it would be fantastic if we could provide answers for those communities."" Postman murder evidence to be reviewed Family 'in limbo' over unsolved murder Child murderer linked to 60s serial killings In 1959, police trying to catch Carol's killer did not have much to go on. Today, Det Ch Insp Lewis and his colleagues face the same challenges - plus the fact many people crucial to the investigation are no longer alive. ""The passage of time is a huge obstacle. Where there are witnesses still alive, recollection of events proves to be difficult,"" he said. ""At that time for crime scene investigators, DNA and, to a certain extent, blood evidence wasn't really something that was being dealt with. ""If that crime scene had been worked today, things would have been different. Recovery of the original case files and exhibits has proved difficult as well. ""But we've had successes with historic cases in the past, as have other forces, so we don't give up hope."" The village of Horeb in Carmarthenshire today Horeb is a small hamlet these days. Back in 1959 it was tiny. Susan Bayliss was 10 at the time of the murder. Her family ran the Waun Wyllt Inn, not far from where Carol's body was found. As the only place in the village with a phone, it became the hub for not just the police but journalists as well. ""When we lived there Horeb was only four or five houses - that was the village. The pub was a typical country pub with one bar, a darts room and a back room,"" she said. ""My main memory of the time of the murder is of the police and journalists from papers like the News of the World being in the pub for about a fortnight. I can remember my mother making sandwiches and cups of tea all day long. ""The murder was the only story there for years afterwards, and still is I imagine."" Susan and her family left Horeb in 1964, but she remembers people suspecting the killer may have been somebody local. ""I know the spot where the body was found, the little culvert. Yes it's by the side of the road but it's concealed by hedges and you wouldn't know the culvert was there unless you were local,"" she said. ""When the police interviewed my mother she was asked about commercial travellers - they'd call them reps these days. Because the pub was a free house you'd often get those people calling in."" Monica Richards, who is now 88 and lived in Felinfoel, Llanelli at the time of the murder, said: ""It was tragic to think of that poor child being dumped in a cold, wet culvert in Horeb. It was such a quiet area and we couldn't believe something like that could happen. ""It was a huge story for the area and in fact the country as a whole. It was the talk of Llanelli for a long, long time."" Hundreds of people attended Carol's funeral as she was laid to rest in Cathays Cemetery on 27 April, but interest in the case has faded over the years and it remains one of Wales' most notoriousunsolved murders,external. Carol's mother Mavis passed away in 2002, not knowing who killed her little girl. The Cathays that Carol and her friends played in would be unrecognisable to her now. The street she grew up on is now home to hundreds of students, and the local shops on Crwys Road have been largely replaced with cafes and other businesses. But while the memory of this horrific crime has faded, Det Ch Insp Lewis still hopes someone will come forward with new information. ""This being the 60th anniversary of Carol's death, it's an apt time for me to appeal to the communities of Cardiff and Horeb, and the wider communities of south Wales, that if anyone has got information as to the identity of the killer, we are still interested,"" he said.

A profile of Sri Lanka,"Lying off the southern tip of India, the tropical island of Sri Lanka has attracted visitors for centuries with its natural beauty. But it has been scarred by a long and bitter civil war arising out of ethnic tensions between the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil minority in the north and east. After some 26 years of violence the conflict ended in May 2009, when government forces seized the last area controlled by Tamil Tiger rebels. But recriminations over abuses by both sides continue. The island fell under Portuguese and Dutch influence after the 16th Century. It gained independence in 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule. In 2022, an economic crisis led to the collapse of Sri Lanka's currency and rising inflation. This has triggered political protests and a humanitarian crisis due to a severe shortage of goods.

With his win, Sri Lanka has for the first time a government headed by a leader with a strong left-wing ideology. No candidate won more than 50% of the total votes in the first round, where Dissanayake got 42.3% while his closest rival, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, got 32.7%. But Dissanayake, who promised voters good governance and tough anti-corruption measures, emerged as winner after the second count, which tallied voters' second and third choice candidates. The election was the first to be held since mass protests unseated the country's leader, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, in 2022 after Sri Lanka suffered its worst economic crisis. To revive the economy, Dissanayake has promised to develop the manufacturing, agriculture and IT sectors. He has also committed to continuing the deal struck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to bail Sri Lanka out of the economic crisis while reducing the impact of its austerity measures on the country's poorest. Sri Lanka's media divide along language and ethnic lines. Separate media outlets cater for Sinhala, Tamil and English speaking audiences. Those in Sinhala have the largest audiences. Privately-owned TVs have larger audiences than state-owned outlets. The printed press is popular. There are more than 20 daily titles, publishing in the three main languages. Many of the major press and broadcasting outlets are state-owned.

As the Queen left the chapel, she was presented with two posies - one yellow and one white - by two boys. Gun salutes will also be fired in London to mark her birthday - although she will have to wait a day, as they are never done on a Sunday. The Queen celebrates two birthdays each year - 21 April is her actual birthday and she also has an official one on the second Saturday in June, which is commemorated with the Trooping the Colour parade. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, used his Easter message to say the resurrection of Jesus showed ""injustice and oppression don't have the last word"". ""The risen Jesus is the one who makes our broken lives whole,"" he said. In her Easter message, the prime minister said she will spend her time ""giving thanks in church"", but for many Christians ""such simple acts of faith can bring huge danger"". About 245 million Christians worldwide areestimated to be facing persecution.,external Mrs May, a vicar's daughter and practising Christian, said: ""Churches have been attacked. Christians murdered. Families forced to flee their homes. Hunt orders persecuted Christians review Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted?

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arriving at the 14th Century chapel in Windsor Castle The Duke of Sussex, pictured with Autumn Phillips and Peter Phillips, attended without his pregnant wife The government review, led by the Bishop of Truro, waslaunched in December,externalto look into how much help the UK gives persecuted Christians. In the Labour leader's Easter message, Mr Corbyn said the experiences of Jesus as a refugee were ""still familiar to us today"". He said Jesus was ""a refugee whose parents were forced to flee their home"", who went on to ""know what it was to be ostracised, rejected and tortured"". He added: ""The refugee crisis is a moral test. Jesus taught us to respect refugees."" Mrs May and husband Philip attended a local church for the Easter Sunday service Mr Corbyn also used his message to criticise the government for failing to take in child refugees, as well as Home Secretary Sajid Javid's handling of the Channel migrant crossings over the winter. He said: ""In Britain, we have a proud history of providing a safe refuge to those in need. But this government refuses to meet our legal obligations to child refugees in Europe as required by the Dubs Amendment."" The Dubs amendment, designed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Lord Dubs, was a scheme which aimed to let unaccompanied migrant children into the UK - but it wasnot extended by the government in 2017. The Home Office responded by saying that the UK had provided protection to over 34,500 children since the start of 2010 and the government was ""determined to deliver on its commitment"" to relocating 480 children under the ""Dubs amendment"".

Bradford Council is warning walkers to keep off the moors. Crews from 10 engines remained at the scene of the blaze overnight to damp down. Originally there were 14 crews at the scene but WYFRS said it had scaled back its response to the blaze. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ""awful scenes"" on the moor were a reminder ""of why we urgently need to tackle climate change"". On Saturday night Martyn Hughes, a watch manager at North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service which is assisting WYFRS, tweeted: ""The intense heat, steep slopes and rough terrain are causing the fire to spread rapidly whilst we try to get near the flames.""

Brothers transform expected win into stunning rout of the opposition, writes Anbarasan Ethirajan. The victory for the Sri Lanka People's Front seals the Rajapaksa brothers' grip on power. Nearly 270 people were killed by a group of suicide bombers on Easter Sunday last year. The brothers, who oversaw the controversial end to Sri Lanka's bitter civil war, are back in power. Anita Nicholson and her two children were among the victims on Easter Sunday. Gotabaya Rajapaksa is declared the winner in a poll that has split the country along ethnic lines. Minorities fearful as controversial ex-defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is elected president. Six months after one of the world's worst recent terror attacks, this town is fighting to recover. Five months after the Easter Sunday bombings, Sri Lanka is desperate for visitors to return. Life for many of Sri Lanka's Muslims has become tougher since April's Easter Sunday bombings. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the former defence chief who crushed the Tamil Tigers, is running for president. He is the allegedly leader of an Islamic State militant cell, federal investigators said. As night falls in Sri Lanka, we are pausing our live coverage of the deadly Easter Sunday bombings. Here's what we know:  Read the latest information on the attacks here. And for more information on the victims, you can read our piece here. US President Donald Trump called Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this morning to express condolences. Mr Wickremesinghe reportedly appreciated the president's concern and updated him on the progress of the investigation into the attacks. Mr Trump also pledged US support to Sri Lanka in bringing the perpetrators to justice, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the fight against global terrorism. The BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan writes from the capital, Colombo: Sri Lankans are yet to come to terms with this wave of
unprecedented bomb attacks. It is believed some Muslim youths were radicalised afterclashes between the majority Sinhala Buddhists and Muslimslast year in the central district of Kandy. There
have been videos on social media showing hardline Islamists and Sinhala
hardliners promoting hatred after that violence. But very few expected such
massive attacks a year later. And why were Christians targeted? They are also a minority in Sri Lanka. The country experienced suicide attacks by Tamil Tiger rebels during the civil war that ended in 2009. But the ruthlessness with which the latest attacks were carried out show that the country's task this time will be challenging. It is a different kind of battle. In the meantime, Sri Lankan Muslims are left nervous and afraid. Kandy in the centre of the country was the focus of clashes last year Anita Nicholson and her children Alex, 14, and Annabel, 11, died in the Shangri-La hotel bombing A British man has confirmed that his wife and two children, aged 14 and 11, were killed in the attacks. ""My family and I wish to confirm that my wife Anita, our son Alex (age 14) and our daughter Annabel (age 11) were killed in the bombing of the restaurant of the Shangri-la Hotel, Colombo on Sunday morning while sitting at our table,"" Ben Nicholson said in a statement. ""Mercifully, all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering."" Mr Nicholson added that he was ""deeply distressed at the loss of my wife and children."" He described Anita as a ""wonderful, perfect loving and inspirational mother"" and his two children as ""amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful"". ""We would ask that the media now respect our privacy and allow us to grieve together,"" the statement said. According to a social media profile, lawyer Anita Nicholson was based in Singapore, working as a managing counsel at mining and metals company Anglo American at the time of her death.

Ukraine chooses between comic and tycoon,"This video can not be played Petro Poroshenko and Volodymyr Zelensky held a long-awaited head-to-head televised debate at Kiev's Olympic stadium Ukrainians are heading to the polls in a run-off election to pick the country's next president. Voters face a stark choice between tycoon Petro Poroshenko, the incumbent president, and television comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, new to politics. The TV celebrity is favourite in the polls, having dominated the first round of voting three weeks ago when 39 candidates were on the ticket. Polling stations opened 08:00 (05:00 GMT) and will close 12 hours later. A court in the capital, Kiev, has rejected a lawsuit calling for Mr Zelensky to be barred from standing. A man had complained that the distribution of free tickets for a presidential debate by Volodymyr Zelensky's candidacy amounted to bribery. What would a comic president mean? Presidential rivals trade barbs in stadium debate The TV box set that may predict the future Both candidates cast their votes in the capital Kiev. Mr Poroshenko said the election was no less important than that of 2014, which followed the ousting of a pro-Russian administration. Mr Poroshenko said he was proud of how the election was organised ""The name of the president to be elected is not important. Of special importance is the strategy and the path that our nation will continue to follow,"" he said. After voting, Mr Zelensky said: ""Today it will be the victory of Ukrainians, the victory of Ukraine, and - I hope - the victory of a fair choice."" On Friday the two candidates appeared at Kiev's Olympic stadium to debate for the first time. The televised event was their first face-off after an unusual campaign where Mr Zelensky has primarily used social media to communicate with the voting public. Mr Zelensky is favourite to win The winner of Sunday's vote will be elected for a five-year term as president. The position holds significant powers over the security, defence and foreign policy of the country. In Ukraine Mr Zelensky, 41, is best known for starring in a political satirical drama called Servant of the People. Ukraine rivals trade taunts and media tricks Comedian v president in rare stadium event In it he plays a teacher who accidentally becomes Ukrainian president after his rant about the nation's politics goes viral on social media. He is now running under a political party with the same name as his show. This video can not be played The comedian who could be president With no previous political experience, his campaign has focused on his difference to others rather than on any concrete policy ideas. Despite this, he won the first round with more than 30% of the vote - almost double what Mr Poroshenko got when he finished in second place with 15.95%. The country prepared on Saturday, during a day of silence when last-minute campaigning is prohibited The incumbent president, who has been in power since 2014, described the result as a ""harsh lesson"". Mr Poroshenko, 53, is a billionaire who made his fortune primarily through his confectionery and TV businesses. He was elected after an uprising overthrew the country's previous, pro-Russian government. Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber those of his rival on Friday The stadium debate between the candidates on Friday was much-anticipated in Ukraine, after the comedian challenged the president to the unconventional event. After his acceptance, there was a public disagreement between the pair over when it would be held. Last week,Mr Poroshenko turned up and debated an empty podiumafter his opponent was absent at the date he suggested. Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev The choice Ukrainians are facing is whether to stick to what they've had for the last five years in Petro Poroshenko or take a leap into the unknown with the comedian candidate, Volodomyr Zelenksy. Mr Zelensky is a well-known entertainer but quite what, if anything, he stands for politically has not become clear during the election campaign. He has however demonstrated that he can act presidential - by playing the part in a TV series. Ukraine is fighting a war against Russian-backed forces in its east and President Poroshenko has repeatedly stressed the need for someone with political experience. Unfortunately for him, all the surveys show that Ukrainians are fed up their politicians who are widely regarded as corrupt and in the pockets of rich oligarchs.

Blasts hit Sri Lanka churches and hotels,"This video can not be played Deadly explosions strike across Sri Lanka At least 207 people have been killed and 450 hurt in explosions at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka, police say. Eight blasts were reported, including at three churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo's Kochchikade district during Easter services. The Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand luxury hotels, all in the capital, were also targeted. A curfew has been put in place ""until further notice"" and social media networks have been temporarily blocked. It remains unclear who carried out the attacks, but reports say 13 people have so far been arrested. Late on Sunday, the country's air force said an improvised explosive device had been found, and disposed of, close to Colombo's main airport. ""A PVC pipe which was six feet in length containing explosives in it was discovered,"" spokesman Gihan Seneviratne told local media. As it happened: Sri Lanka explosions ""I thought we had left all this violence behind us"" In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks It comes as the country's prime minister admitted there may have been prior intelligence about the attacks. Officials says 36 foreign nationals are thought to be among the dead, including 25 yet to be identified. The first reports of explosions came at about 08:45 (03:15 GMT) local time - with six blasts reported close together at churches and luxury hotels. St Sebastian's church in Negombo was severely damaged in one explosion, with dozens killed at the site. Images from inside showed blood on the pews and the building's ceiling shattered. There were also heavy casualties at the site of the first blast in St Anthony's, a hugely popular shrine in Kochchikade, a district of Colombo. Robert Tyler, who has lived in Sri Lanka for six years, told the BBC that at least two of the hotels appeared to have had their restaurants targeted at a busy time for breakfast. Two further explosions were reported as police tried to find those involved. One blast hit near the zoo in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and an eighth was reported near the Colombo district of Dematagoda during a police raid, killing three officers. The government has said most of the attacks are thought to have been carried out by suicide bombers. The streets of Colombo were far quieter than usual as the curfew came in The vast majority of those killed are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals, including dozens who were attending Easter church services. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs saysfive British people - including two with joint US citizenship - are among the dead. The US State Department has said ""several"" Americans have been killed. Three Danish citizens, two Turkish nationals and one person from the Netherlands were also killed, their governments have confirmed. Sri Lankan officials say three Indian nationals and one Portuguese citizen are also among the dead. They say 25 more fatalities at a Colombo mortuary are also thought to be international citizens awaiting identification. Airlines have said people are still able to travel to the airport under the curfew if they produce their boarding pass and identification at checkpoints. Travellers are being advised to arrive at the airport four hours before their scheduled flight time. A bomb goes off as Special Task Force personnel raid a home near Dematagoda in Colombo Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the media on Sunday evening. During the briefing, he referred to allegations that officials had been in possession of intelligence suggesting an impending attack. ""We must look into why adequate precautions were not taken. Neither I nor the Ministers were kept informed,"" he said. ""For now the priority is to apprehend the attackers,"" he added. Pope Francis, in his traditional Urbi et Orbi speech at the Vatican, condemned the attacks as ""such cruel violence"" targeting Christians celebrating Easter. Blast damage at the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said he is ""outraged"" by the attacks, and hopes the perpetrators will be ""swiftly brought to justice"". Cardinal Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm Ranjith, told the BBC: ""It's a very difficult and a very sad situation for all of us because we never expected such a thing to happen and especially on Easter Sunday."" UK PM Theresa May tweeted condolences, saying the ""acts of violence against churches and hotels in Sri Lanka are truly appalling"". US President Donald Trump tweeted ""heartfelt condolences"" for the ""horrible terrorist attacks"". This video can not be played Archbishop of Colombo: ''A very, very sad day for all of us"" Sunday's attacks are the deadliest seen in Sri Lanka since the end of the country's civil war in 2009. The civil war ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, who had fought for 26 years for an independent homeland for the minority ethnic Tamils. The war is thought to have killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people. The nation has seen some sporadic violence since.In March 2018 a state of emergency was declaredafter members of the majority Buddhist Sinhala community attacked mosques and Muslim-owned properties.

Ukraine to choose between comic and tycoon,"This video can not be played Petro Poroshenko and Volodymyr Zelensky held a long-awaited head-to-head televised debate at Kiev's Olympic stadium Ukrainians are heading to the polls in a run-off election to pick the country's next president. Voters face a stark choice between tycoon Petro Poroshenko, the incumbent president, and television comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, new to politics. The TV celebrity is favourite in the polls, having dominated the first round of voting three weeks ago when 39 candidates were on the ticket. Polling stations opened 08:00 (05:00 GMT) and will close 12 hours later. A court in the capital, Kiev, has rejected a lawsuit calling for Mr Zelensky to be barred from standing. A man had complained that the distribution of free tickets for a presidential debate by Volodymyr Zelensky's candidacy amounted to bribery. What would a comic president mean? Presidential rivals trade barbs in stadium debate The TV box set that may predict the future Both candidates cast their votes in the capital Kiev. Mr Poroshenko said the election was no less important than that of 2014, which followed the ousting of a pro-Russian administration. Mr Poroshenko said he was proud of how the election was organised ""The name of the president to be elected is not important. Of special importance is the strategy and the path that our nation will continue to follow,"" he said. After voting, Mr Zelensky said: ""Today it will be the victory of Ukrainians, the victory of Ukraine, and - I hope - the victory of a fair choice."" On Friday the two candidates appeared at Kiev's Olympic stadium to debate for the first time. The televised event was their first face-off after an unusual campaign where Mr Zelensky has primarily used social media to communicate with the voting public. Mr Zelensky is favourite to win The winner of Sunday's vote will be elected for a five-year term as president. The position holds significant powers over the security, defence and foreign policy of the country. In Ukraine Mr Zelensky, 41, is best known for starring in a political satirical drama called Servant of the People. Ukraine rivals trade taunts and media tricks Comedian v president in rare stadium event In it he plays a teacher who accidentally becomes Ukrainian president after his rant about the nation's politics goes viral on social media.

The country prepared on Saturday, during a day of silence when last-minute campaigning is prohibited The incumbent president, who has been in power since 2014, described the result as a ""harsh lesson"". Mr Poroshenko, 53, is a billionaire who made his fortune primarily through his confectionery and TV businesses. He was elected after an uprising overthrew the country's previous, pro-Russian government. Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber those of his rival on Friday The stadium debate between the candidates on Friday was much-anticipated in Ukraine, after the comedian challenged the president to the unconventional event. After his acceptance, there was a public disagreement between the pair over when it would be held. Last week,Mr Poroshenko turned up and debated an empty podiumafter his opponent was absent at the date he suggested. Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev The choice Ukrainians are facing is whether to stick to what they've had for the last five years in Petro Poroshenko or take a leap into the unknown with the comedian candidate, Volodomyr Zelenksy. Mr Zelensky is a well-known entertainer but quite what, if anything, he stands for politically has not become clear during the election campaign. He has however demonstrated that he can act presidential - by playing the part in a TV series. Ukraine is fighting a war against Russian-backed forces in its east and President Poroshenko has repeatedly stressed the need for someone with political experience.

Ukraine country profile,"Ukraine gained independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and has since veered between seeking closer integration with Western Europe and being drawn into the orbit of Russia, which sees its interests as threatened by a Western-leaning Ukraine. Europe's second largest country, Ukraine is a land of wide, fertile agricultural plains, with large pockets of heavy industry in the east. While Ukraine and Russia share common historical origins, the west of the country has closer ties with its European neighbours, particularly Poland, and nationalist sentiment has been strongest there. A significant minority of the population uses Russian as its first language, particularly in the cities and the industrialised east. An uprising against pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 ushered in a series of Western-leaning governments. But Russia used the opportunity to seize the Crimean peninsula and arm insurgent groups to occupy parts of the east, eventually launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

His Servant of the People party went on to win early parliamentary elections in July 2019, giving him control of both the executive and the legislature. In his inaugural address, President Zelensky said ending the Moscow-run insurgency in the east would be his priority, and he went on to rally Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion in 2022. After the start of the invasion, he declared martial law across Ukraine and a general mobilisation of the armed forces. His leadership during the crisis has won him widespread international praise, and he has been described as a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance National media have adopted a united patriotic agenda following the Russian annexation of Crimea and the armed conflict in the east. Ukraine has banned relays of leading Russian TVs; in turn, areas under Russian or separatist control have seen pro-Kyiv outlets silenced. The authorities also block access to some popular Russian websites and social networks. Ukrainians have changed their media consumption since the start of the full-scale war, with social media replacing TV as a top news source for Ukrainians, new TV channels continuing to launch despite the conflict, and the complete loss of popularity of Russian outlets.

Profile of Ukraine candidates,"Rivals Volodymyr Zelensky (L) and Petro Poroshenko have contrasting styles Slick online ads and attention-grabbing antics have spiced up Ukraine's presidential election, now shaped by the frontrunner - popular TV comic Volodymyr Zelensky. Like heavyweight boxers, he and billionaire rival Petro Poroshenko - the incumbent president - have taunted each other over holding a public debate in Ukraine's biggest sports stadium. Mr Zelensky, 41, insisted that they both undergo drug and alcohol tests before such a debate could take place. Mr Poroshenko, 53, was unfazed and agreed. So, in a first for Ukraine, the rival candidates had themselves photographed giving blood samples. The rivals had their blood tested for drugs and alcohol on 5 April But they could not agree when to have the debate. So Mr Poroshenko stole the limelight byturning up at the stadium on 14 April and empty-chairing his rival. Mr Zelensky goes into the 21 April runoff vote with a commanding lead: he got 30.2% on 31 March, almost double Mr Poroshenko's score of 15.9%. So who are they and what do they stand for? Mr Zelensky has reached out to media-savvy younger Ukrainians, tapping into their rejection of corruption and powerful vested interests. His success so far suggests a huge appetite for political change in a country plagued by corruption scandals and widespread poverty. ""You called me for a debate, dreaming that I would run away, duck out, hide. No. I'm not you in 2014,"" he said in a video, mocking Mr Poroshenko's avoidance of a debate in the previous presidential election. This video can not be played Comedian v president in rare stadium event His popular satirical TV series is called Servant of the People, in which he stars as an ordinary teacher who accidentally gets elected president. That is now the name of his political party too. His show is a hit on Channel 1+1, owned by billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, a leading opponent of Mr Poroshenko. But Mr Zelensky insists that he is not a ""toy"" of the oligarch. He has starred in dozens of films and shows since founding a drama company - Studio Kvartal 95 - in 2003. His business earned millions of dollars a year. He hails from Kryvyi Rih, an industrial city in the south, where he studied law but opted for an acting career. He has shunned political rallies, focusing his effort on social media. He has 3.6m followers on Instagram - far more than Mr Poroshenko, who has 255,000. Indeed, he has more Instagram fans than the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the UK combined. Volunteers in their 20s manage his campaign through posts on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. He has asked voters to contribute policy ideas. What would a comic president mean? Ukraine comic leads presidential poll first round  Population:43.9m GDP per capita:$8,800 GDP growth:2.5% Ethnic Ukrainians (est):78% Ethnic Russians (est.):17% Unemployment (est.):9.2% Critics question Mr Zelensky's fitness for office, pointing to his lack of political experience. But he has been politically engaged. He supported the Euromaidan protests that toppled ex-president Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. When the conflict with Russian-backed separatists erupted in the east he helped fund a volunteer battalion fighting the rebels. He has vowed to settle that conflict through direct talks with Russia. ""I am ready to do a deal with the devil so that not one more person dies,"" he said. He does not have very detailed policies, but pledges to ""overhaul the system"" and ""defeat"" corruption. He espouses economic liberalism. He isreported to be considering some high-profile appointments to fight corruption,external, including Marta Borshch, a former US prosecutor, and Laura Kovesi, former head of Romania's anti-corruption agency. Ukraine politicians' huge cash piles exposed The Poroshenko team portrays the election as a choice between their man and the Russian president Mr Poroshenko's main weapon against his rival is experience. In 2014-2015 he steered Ukraine through a critical period, battling the well-armed rebels to a stalemate after suffering early setbacks. His main slogan is ""army, language and faith"" - an appeal to Ukrainian national pride. Language is a sensitive issue: Mr Poroshenko has curbed the influence of Russian-language media, by censoring Russian films and books deemed to be subversive. Andcreating an Orthodox Church of Ukraine, no longer controlled by the Moscow Patriarchate, was a popular move. He also points to Ukraine's closer ties with the EU under his leadership, including visa-free travel for short stays in the EU. Mr Poroshenko (R) is an ally of Patriarch Filaret (C), head of the Kiev Patriarchate Mr Poroshenko has been one of Ukraine's most high-profile tycoons and politicians since the 1990s. He was a key backer of the 2004 Orange Revolution, a pro-Western movement defying Russia. He got rich through his Roshen confectionery business - earning him the nickname ""the chocolate king"" - and a TV channel, 5 Kanal. His net worth is reckoned to be more than $1bn (Â£764m). In a riposte to Mr Zelensky, he warned against turning the big stadium debate into a ""show"". ""There's no room for jokes here,"" he said. ""Being a president and supreme commander is not a game."" His giant campaign posters controversially show him face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin, implying that Mr Zelensky is merely a puppet of Moscow. The slogan on them is: ""21 April. Decisive choice!"" Yet the deadlocked conflict in the east has not figured very prominently in the election. While many praise Mr Poroshenko for resisting Russian pressure, there is much concern that corruption remains deep-rooted.A scandal over defence procurement erupted in February,external, overshadowing the election. Mr Poroshenko has told voters his aim is to make integration with the EU and ""Euro-Atlantic"" allies irreversible, to guarantee ""the irreversibility of our independence, to restore the country's territorial integrity"". Before becoming president he served under previous leaders as foreign minister and trade minister. He grew up in Bendery, a southern city that now lies in Moldova, and graduated in economics before going into business.

The box set that tells the future?,"The likely winner of Sunday's presidential election in Ukraine hasn't run a conventional campaign, so reporters have been looking for clues about the future in a TV drama in which he plays the leading role. There aren't many jobs where you can put your feet up and work your way through a TV box set without feeling the slightest bit guilty. But here in Ukraine, putting in the hours in front of the screen has become one way of trying to understand what has been at times been a baffling election. ""How far through it are you?"" has become a familiar refrain, muttered between journalists on the fringe of campaign events. The required viewing is a political satire called Servant of the People, and getting fully across it takes real commitment. The show - think The West Wing, with jokes - has just entered its third series, and there are nearly 50 episodes. Watching it is one way of trying to get to grips with the meteoric rise of Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian and actor who stars as the Ukrainian president in Servant of the People. He's also a candidate to be the real president of Ukraine and has a political party - also called Servant of the People. Confused? Well the blurring of fiction and fact doesn't seem to bother Ukrainians, in fact it appears to have brought clarity. All the polls suggest that Zelensky - a 41-year-old Monty Python fan - is going to defeat the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, and easily win Sunday's presidential election run-off. Zelensky has effectively run an ""anti-campaign"". He's avoided political rallies and speeches, and instead continued performing slapstick routines with his comedy group. There's been very little in the way of policy or ideas, apart from a promise to be new and different. Serious interviews have been few and far between, and there haven't been many press conferences either. Zelensky performs in Kiev in March with his comedy group, Kvartal 95 So the minutiae of the often farcical episodes of Servant of the People have been elevated, and dissected - sometimes by quite serious publications - for clues as to what might lie ahead in a Zelensky presidency. How much, for example, should we read into the fictional president's showdown with the International Monetary Fund? Some are worried that Zelensky might turn out to be a populist and seek to go back on the IMF's strict conditions for loans. And then there's a sequence where Zelensky's character pulls out machine guns and shoots all of the MPs in parliament. Maybe that's an encouraging sign that he's going to be tough on political corruption? Every time presidential candidate Zelensky has dipped his toe into conventional political campaigning it's not gone well. He's been accused of being lightweight and jokey - which of course is a danger, if you've spent your life, as he has, working as a comedian. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Saturdays at 11:30 So while Petro Poroshenko has made stops across Ukraine and been a regular in TV studios, Zelensky has stayed away. His chosen method of communication has been social media, where he posts a steady stream of upbeat videos - a mix of him working out in the gym, joking with friends, and getting briefed by a team of advisers. ""He'll learn - and be surrounded by the best,"" is the message we're supposed to take away. Zelensky's success so far is due only in part to Zelensky himself. Opinion polls here in Ukraine have for a long time been unanimous about one thing - that people really hate their politicians and political system. A recent survey showed that just 9% of people here have confidence in their government. That's a world low. Petro Poroshenko announces the start of his campaign in February So Zelensky represents, in part, the protest vote. Two fingers being raised against the MPs and leaders who have dominated this country's recent history, and whom many see as corrupt - in the pockets of a handful of rich oligarchs. Poroshenko is finding out that being the candidate of stability and security is not a vote winner if people are fed up with a status quo of economic hardship and a seemingly endless war with Russian-backed forces in the east. It's not hard to see why the telegenic Zelensky is attractive to voters, however light he is on substance. Zelensky shoots a scene on 6 March for a new episode of Servant of the People There is another TV show that has become a must-watch during this campaign. It's an episode of the futuristic dystopian series called Black Mirror. First broadcast in the UK six years ago, it tells the story of a cartoon bear called Waldo, who stands in an election after becoming famous on a TV show for mocking politicians. Zelensky has spent his career joking about politicians, so people have been tempted to draw parallels. It's a comparison aided by the fact that he provided the Ukrainian voiceover of Paddington Bear in the recent hit films. But the voice of Paddington looks set to go one better than Black Mirror's cartoon bear. Waldo ended up coming second. In Ukraine the comedian is set to win. With one eye on the exit, Poroshenko's supporters in parliament are not taking it well. One told me dismissively, ""He doesn't even know where Peru is.""

Cash hoard found at Sudan ex-ruler's homeProsecutors launch an inquiry after cash in several currencies is found at Omar al-Bashir's residenceAfrica,"Omar al-Bashir was deposed by the military after months of protests A large hoard of cash has been found at the home of Sudan's ousted president Omar al-Bashir and he is now being investigated for money laundering, prosecutors say. Security services found euros, dollars and Sudanese pounds totalling more than $130m (Â£100m). The ex-leader was placed under house arrest after months of protests led to his removal. Reports say Mr Bashir is now being held at the Kobar high-security prison. In pictures: A campaign of defiance Why Omar al-Bashir was overthrown Timeline: How Sudan got here A source in Sudan's judiciary told Reuters news agency that suitcases loaded with more than $351,000, â¬6m ($6.7m; Â£5.2m) and five billion Sudanese pounds ($105m) were found at Mr Bashir's home. The source also confirmed Mr Bashir was under investigation, telling Reuters prosecutors would ""question the former president in Kobar prison"". A picture carried by the Netherlands-based media outlet Radio Dabanga shows men in army uniforms standing over what appears to be several sacks full of cash. Allow Twitter content?

The money, which Radio Dabanga says was shown to reporters, was stuffed in bags designed to contain 50kg (110lbs) of grain. On Saturday, Sudan's attorney general said a new committee would be set up to oversee anti-corruption investigations. But despite moves to hold Mr Bashir and others to account, Sudan's army does not appear to have the confidence of protesters demanding civilian rule, BBC Africa correspondent, Alastair Leithead, says. Protesters fear that the military will continue to pull the strings Alastair Leithead, BBC News, Khartoum The mass sit-in continues in the centre of Khartoum, amid a lack of trust that the military council is committed to handing over power to a civilian transitional authority. Each day concessions are announced, but there's little proof that what's been promised has been delivered. There have been no images of the former president in prison, nor any response from the generals over a demand they give up power to a civilian administration. The general public prosecutor's announcement that Mr Bashir is being investigated for money laundering after cash was found at his home is news the demonstrators would like to hear. The Sudanese military toppled Mr Bashir on 11 April but demonstrators, led by The Sudanese Professionals Association, have vowed to stay on the streets until there is a move to civilian rule. Mr Bashir, who ruled Sudan for almost 30 years, is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in the country's western Darfur region. Sudan's military, however, says it will not extradite him and will try him in the country instead. This video can not be played 'Protesters won't move until they get real change' Uganda would consider offering the deposed leader asylum if he applied, the country's Minister for Foreign Affairs Henry Oryem Okello told Reuters. Until this week, Mr Bashir's whereabouts since his removal were unknown. The coup leader at the time, Awad Ibn Auf, said Mr Bashir was being detained in a ""safe place"". He himself stood down soon afterwards, with Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan named as head of the transitional military council. Demonstrators remain camped out at military headquarters in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. Huge crowds braved scorching heat and fatigue for a 14th day on Friday, demanding that the military council hand over the reins of power to a civilian authority. Plans to unveil a civilian body to replace the military council will be announced on Sunday, the SPA said in a statement. Sudan protests: A campaign of defiance Why the protests started Ahmed Rabi, leader of the SPA, told The Associated Press that he and others behind the protest movement met the military council on Saturday. It is the third such meeting between them, with no sign of a breakthrough to end the deadlock. So far, the SPA has been uncompromising in its demands, fearful of a military-led administration stuffed full of Mr Bashir's allies. An SPA spokesman previously told the BBC that the group ""completely rejected"" the transitional military council leading the country, and said protesters seek the dismantling of state intelligence agencies and the ""full dissolution of the deep state"". Demonstrators have vowed to stay on the streets until there is a move to civilian rule Military council has announced a raft of new measures, including the end of censorship and new heads of the security forces. The council has arrested former government members and says it will put in place whatever civilian government and whichever prime minister opposition groups agree. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? But while the council promised not to remove protesters from their sit-in, it has also called on them to stop unauthorised roadblocks and ""let normal life resume"". ""Taking up arms will not be tolerated,"" military council spokesman Maj Gen Shams Ad-din Shanto said last week.

Ukraine to vote in presidential run-off,"This video can not be played Petro Poroshenko and Volodymyr Zelensky held a long-awaited head-to-head televised debate at Kiev's Olympic stadium Ukrainians are heading to the polls in a run-off election to pick the country's next president. Voters face a stark choice between tycoon Petro Poroshenko, the incumbent president, and television comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, new to politics. The TV celebrity is favourite in the polls, having dominated the first round of voting three weeks ago when 39 candidates were on the ticket. Polling stations opened 08:00 (05:00 GMT) and will close 12 hours later. A court in the capital, Kiev, has rejected a lawsuit calling for Mr Zelensky to be barred from standing. A man had complained that the distribution of free tickets for a presidential debate by Volodymyr Zelensky's candidacy amounted to bribery. What would a comic president mean? Presidential rivals trade barbs in stadium debate The TV box set that may predict the future Both candidates cast their votes in the capital Kiev. Mr Poroshenko said the election was no less important than that of 2014, which followed the ousting of a pro-Russian administration. Mr Poroshenko said he was proud of how the election was organised ""The name of the president to be elected is not important. Of special importance is the strategy and the path that our nation will continue to follow,"" he said. After voting, Mr Zelensky said: ""Today it will be the victory of Ukrainians, the victory of Ukraine, and - I hope - the victory of a fair choice."" On Friday the two candidates appeared at Kiev's Olympic stadium to debate for the first time. The televised event was their first face-off after an unusual campaign where Mr Zelensky has primarily used social media to communicate with the voting public. Mr Zelensky is favourite to win The winner of Sunday's vote will be elected for a five-year term as president. The position holds significant powers over the security, defence and foreign policy of the country. In Ukraine Mr Zelensky, 41, is best known for starring in a political satirical drama called Servant of the People. Ukraine rivals trade taunts and media tricks Comedian v president in rare stadium event In it he plays a teacher who accidentally becomes Ukrainian president after his rant about the nation's politics goes viral on social media. He is now running under a political party with the same name as his show. This video can not be played The comedian who could be president With no previous political experience, his campaign has focused on his difference to others rather than on any concrete policy ideas. Despite this, he won the first round with more than 30% of the vote - almost double what Mr Poroshenko got when he finished in second place with 15.95%. The country prepared on Saturday, during a day of silence when last-minute campaigning is prohibited The incumbent president, who has been in power since 2014, described the result as a ""harsh lesson"". Mr Poroshenko, 53, is a billionaire who made his fortune primarily through his confectionery and TV businesses. He was elected after an uprising overthrew the country's previous, pro-Russian government. Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber those of his rival on Friday The stadium debate between the candidates on Friday was much-anticipated in Ukraine, after the comedian challenged the president to the unconventional event. After his acceptance, there was a public disagreement between the pair over when it would be held. Last week,Mr Poroshenko turned up and debated an empty podiumafter his opponent was absent at the date he suggested. Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev The choice Ukrainians are facing is whether to stick to what they've had for the last five years in Petro Poroshenko or take a leap into the unknown with the comedian candidate, Volodomyr Zelenksy. Mr Zelensky is a well-known entertainer but quite what, if anything, he stands for politically has not become clear during the election campaign. He has however demonstrated that he can act presidential - by playing the part in a TV series. Ukraine is fighting a war against Russian-backed forces in its east and President Poroshenko has repeatedly stressed the need for someone with political experience. Unfortunately for him, all the surveys show that Ukrainians are fed up their politicians who are widely regarded as corrupt and in the pockets of rich oligarchs.

Zelensky performs in Kiev in March with his comedy group, Kvartal 95 So the minutiae of the often farcical episodes of Servant of the People have been elevated, and dissected - sometimes by quite serious publications - for clues as to what might lie ahead in a Zelensky presidency. How much, for example, should we read into the fictional president's showdown with the International Monetary Fund? Some are worried that Zelensky might turn out to be a populist and seek to go back on the IMF's strict conditions for loans. And then there's a sequence where Zelensky's character pulls out machine guns and shoots all of the MPs in parliament. Maybe that's an encouraging sign that he's going to be tough on political corruption? Every time presidential candidate Zelensky has dipped his toe into conventional political campaigning it's not gone well. He's been accused of being lightweight and jokey - which of course is a danger, if you've spent your life, as he has, working as a comedian. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Saturdays at 11:30 So while Petro Poroshenko has made stops across Ukraine and been a regular in TV studios, Zelensky has stayed away. His chosen method of communication has been social media, where he posts a steady stream of upbeat videos - a mix of him working out in the gym, joking with friends, and getting briefed by a team of advisers. ""He'll learn - and be surrounded by the best,"" is the message we're supposed to take away. Zelensky's success so far is due only in part to Zelensky himself. Opinion polls here in Ukraine have for a long time been unanimous about one thing - that people really hate their politicians and political system. A recent survey showed that just 9% of people here have confidence in their government. That's a world low. Petro Poroshenko announces the start of his campaign in February So Zelensky represents, in part, the protest vote. Two fingers being raised against the MPs and leaders who have dominated this country's recent history, and whom many see as corrupt - in the pockets of a handful of rich oligarchs. Poroshenko is finding out that being the candidate of stability and security is not a vote winner if people are fed up with a status quo of economic hardship and a seemingly endless war with Russian-backed forces in the east. It's not hard to see why the telegenic Zelensky is attractive to voters, however light he is on substance. Zelensky shoots a scene on 6 March for a new episode of Servant of the People There is another TV show that has become a must-watch during this campaign. It's an episode of the futuristic dystopian series called Black Mirror. First broadcast in the UK six years ago, it tells the story of a cartoon bear called Waldo, who stands in an election after becoming famous on a TV show for mocking politicians. Zelensky has spent his career joking about politicians, so people have been tempted to draw parallels. It's a comparison aided by the fact that he provided the Ukrainian voiceover of Paddington Bear in the recent hit films. But the voice of Paddington looks set to go one better than Black Mirror's cartoon bear. Waldo ended up coming second. In Ukraine the comedian is set to win. With one eye on the exit, Poroshenko's supporters in parliament are not taking it well. One told me dismissively, ""He doesn't even know where Peru is.""

'Sea change' in wake of McKee killingPolice in Londonderry say they are getting unprecedented support as they investigate the journalist's death.Northern Ireland,"Floral tributes to Lyra McKee have been left at the scene of her shooting in Derry The killing of journalist Lyra McKee has led to a ""palpable change"" in community sentiment in support of policing in Northern Ireland, a senior detective has said. Ms McKee, 29, was shot while observing rioting in Londonderry's nationalist Creggan estate on Thursday. Two men, aged 18 and 19, arrestedunder the Terrorism Act were released without charge on Sunday. Det Supt Jason Murphy urged people to come forward with evidence. This video can not be played PSNI released CCTV footage after Lyra McKee's murder Journalist shot dead during Derry rioting Profile: 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' Speaking on Saturday, the detective leading the investigation said there was a sense that what had happened to Ms McKee had marked a ""real sea change"". He also warned that he had a broader concern about a ""new breed of terrorist coming through the ranks"". ""And that is very worrying for me,"" he added. But he said that police officers had felt a ""palpable"" change in the community sentiment towards policing. This video can not be played Journalist Lyra McKee, 29,  was shot during rioting in Londonderry ""Yesterday we realised that the vast majority of communities across the whole of Northern Ireland support policing and support police and they support the peace process,"" added Mr Murray. ""What we saw yesterday was the visible demonstration of that within the Creggan community. ""A community that has been very frightened for a long time and for a large part has been held to ransom by terrorist organisations that claims to represent them."" Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle with other journalists when she was shot on Thursday night. CCTV captured her final moments in the crowd and mobile phone footage showed the suspected gunman. Books of condolence have been opened across Northern Ireland for tributes to Lyra McKee In the video, the masked attacker can be seen leaning from behind cover and appears to fire shots towards police and onlookers. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that the gunman fired shots towards police officers at about 23:00 BST on Thursday. In a Facebook post, the political party Saoradh - a group that police have said is closely aligned to the New IRA - sought to justify violence on the night. They said Ms McKee was killed ""accidentally"" by a ""volunteer"" after the PSNI raided houses in Derry in search for weapons and ammunition. Who are the New IRA? The New IRA was formed in 2012 aftera number of dissident republican organisations said they were unifyingunder one leadership and is believed to be the largest dissident republican organisation. Saoradh, which means liberation in Irish, is a political group that was founded in 2016 and has the support of prisoners from the dissident group referred to as the New IRA. According to its constitution, Saoradh's objective is to ""effect an end to Britain's illegal occupation of the six counties"" and establish a 32-county Irish socialist republic. The party has been highly critical of Sinn FÃ©in in the past, with its chairman describing members as ""false prophets who have been defeated and consumed by the very system they claim to oppose"". Timeline: Dissident republican activity There has been widespread condemnation of the killing. At a vigil in Derry on Friday, Ms McKee's partnerSara Canning described her as a ""tireless advocate and activist""for the LGBT community. Her partner's dreams had been ""snuffed out by a single barbaric act"", said Ms Canning, and she had been left without ""the woman I was planning to grow old with"". Sara Canning said ""we are all poorer for the loss"" of her partner Lyra McKee Ms McKee's killing came 21 years after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed in Northern Ireland. The 1998 peace deal marked the end in the region of decades of violent conflict - known as the Troubles - involving republicans and loyalists during which about 3,600 people are estimated to have died. The Good Friday Agreementwas the result of intense negotiations involving the UK and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's political parties. Figures from across the political divide, including Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster, were among the hundreds of people at a vigil in the Creggan estate on Friday. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley visited Derry on Saturday to sign a book of condolence. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Wife admits killing Ku Klux Klan chiefMalissa Ancona is sentenced to life in jail for shooting her husband, Frank, in Missouri.","Malissa Ancona was sentenced to life after admitting second-degree murder The wife of a Ku Klux Klan leader in the US state of Missouri has admitted shooting him dead two years ago. Malissa Ancona, 47, was sentenced to life after pleading guilty to second-degree murder and other charges. She had initially said her son, Paul Jinkerson, carried out the killing but in court on Friday said this was not the case. He still faces trial. Frank Ancona, a self-styled ""imperial wizard"", was shot dead in a bedroom and his body dumped next to a river. In a deal with prosecutors,Ancona pleaded guilty,externalon Friday at St Francois County Circuit Court to second-degree murder, tampering with evidence and abandonment of a corpse, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

"Met asks for help in climate protestsThe Met, which has requested 200 extra officers, clears Extinction Rebellion from Oxford Circus.London","About 200 extra officers from other police forces are being sent to London The Met Police has requested about 200 extra officers from neighbouring forces to help deal with the Extinction Rebellion protests in central London. Oxford Circus was reopened to traffic on Saturday afternoon after officers cleared demonstrators. Protesters continue to occupy Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square. The Met said 750 people have been arrested and 28 have been charged. Commissioner Cressida Dick said it had caused ""miserable disruption"". ""Every day we have had over 1,000 officers - and now over 1,500 officers - working to police these protests,"" she said. ""It's had an impact not just on the police but also on the public."" Pedestrians and vehicles cross the Oxford Circus junction after police cleared protesters The junction had previously been blocked by a pink boat since Monday At about 17:30 BST, police were able to clear protesters from the centre of Oxford Circus, allowing for traffic to flow through normally. Dozens of officers also carried out arrests on Waterloo Bridge and slowly removed campaigners who had attached themselves to a truck acting as a stage. Ms Dick said the force was still liaising with others and encouraging them to go to Marble Arch to carry out a ""lawful protest"". ""If you don't want to go to Marble Arch, then go home,"" she said. ""I've been walking about there today and I can assure you many people are very fed up."" Arrests in connection with the protest since it began on Monday have topped 750 It is understood the Met made a request to the National Police Coordination Centre (NPoCC) ""late on Thursday"" for help with extra officers from neighbouring regions in the east and south-east of England. Essex Police, Kent Police, Hampshire Constabulary and Sussex Police confirmed they had sent officers to London under national mutual aid protocols. Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Police move in on climate protesters What is climate change? A spokesman for the National Police Chief's Council said ""forces routinely share officers through mutual aid"" in order to deal with large-scale events. He added: ""It is used to ensure an appropriate police presence exists where there is increased demand for it. ""NPoCC works with forces to determine their requirements should the need arise."" Protesters had blocked traffic through Oxford Circus since Monday The Met also quelled rumours that its cells are full. A spokesman said: ""One thing that is unusual about this demonstration is the willingness of those participating to be arrested and also their lack of resistance to the arrests. ""Our custody suites are not full and we are continuing to arrest those who are breaking the law."" He said contingency plans were in place should they become full. In London, there are 41 custody suites - 34 of which are owned by the Met, six by British Transport Police and one in Bishopsgate by City of London Police. Protesters have also occupied Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square Officers on Waterloo Bridge have formed cordons while activists continue to play music and passers-by gather to watch. Members of the public watching have been asked to move on. Earlier, one demonstrator said to the group: ""Holding the space is important and being arrested is not undignified. ""We are here for an important reason, so we should be prepared to be removed for that. Being arrested is a statement."" The Met previously said it has had to cancel officers' leave over the Easter break On Good Friday, police removed a pink boat that had been parked in the middle of Oxford Circus since Monday. Earlier that day, actress Dame Emma Thompson addressed demonstrators from the top of the ship. Extinction Rebellion said nearly 50,000 people had signed up to join the group since the protests started. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

"Kosovo brings back dozens from SyriaMore than 100 Kosovans, including mothers, children and several suspected IS fighters, are flown home.Europe","The group mostly included young children and their mothers Kosovo has brought back 110 of its citizens from Syria, mostly mothers and their children but also several jihadist fighters. The group contained 74 children, 32 women and four men suspected of fighting for the Islamic State group (IS) who were arrested on arrival. They flew back with the help of the US military before police escorted them to an army barracks near Pristina. The issue of repatriations has come to the fore since the collapse of IS. ""An important and sensitive operation was organised in which the government of Kosovo, with the help of the [US], has returned 110 of its citizens from Syria,"" Kosovo's Justice Minister, Abelard Tahiri, said on Saturday. ""We will not stop before bringing every citizen... back to their country and anyone that has committed any crime or was part of these terrorist organisations will face justice,"" he added. Has IS been defeated? Why countries face a dilemma over IS children How do countries deal with IS returnees? Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, is 90% Muslim. More than 300 of its citizens have travelled to Syria since 2012, according to government figures. This number includes 70 men who were killed fighting alongside jihadist groups, Reuters news agency reports. Police say 30 Kosovan fighters, 49 women and 8 children still remain in conflict zones in Syria and Iraq. A map showing the verified origin countries of children who travelled to Iraq or Syria In recent months, a number of women have come forward to say they want to return to their home countries, including the UK, US and France, so they could raise their children in peace. In response, the UK and US have barred two mothers from returning. Shamima Begum, who joined IS in Syria aged 15, begged to return home shortly before giving birth to a son, but the UK government refused to let her back. She did not renounce her allegiance to IS and the government removed her citizenship.There was much sympathy for her plight when her baby died in March. Meanwhile, that same month,France brought back five young childrenof jihadist fighters. The recent repatriations come weeks after some IS militants reportedly fled into the desert from Baghuz - their last stronghold. The area was declared ""freed"" by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on 23 March. Although the declaration marked the last territorial victory over the group's ""caliphate"", experts warn it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology.
