Kinahan gang sanctions 'heavy blow' to activities,"This video can not be played Garda (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris says this is only the ""first phase"" in the work to tackle the Kinahan gang Worldwide financial sanctions targeting the Kinahan crime cartel will deal a ""heavy blow"" to their activities, Ireland's police chief has said. Irish, American and British law enforcement have launched coordinated action against the Irish organised crime group. A reward of up to $5m (Â£3.84m) has also been offered by the US for information on the three most senior members. In total, seven members and three associated businesses are targeted. Daniel Kinahan, 44, has previously been named in the Irish courts as the head of one of Europe's most prominent drug gangs. His father Christopher Snr, 65, and brother Christopher Jnr, 41, were also placed on an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list. US sanctions gang leader with links to Tyson Fury 'Organised crime boss' still working in boxing They are among the seven members of the Kinahan cartel targeted by the OFAC. On Tuesday, US Ambassador to Ireland Claire Cronin said a reward of up to $5m was being offered for information which leads to the financial disruption of the group or the arrest or conviction of Christopher Kinahan Snr, Daniel Kinahan or Christopher Kinahan Jnr. Tyson Fury thanked Daniel Kinahan for organising a fight with then world champion Anthony Joshua in 2021 Daniel Kinahan has previously worked as an advisor to boxer Tyson Fury and is a co-founder of the MTK Global agency, which represents a number of boxing's top fighters, including Fury and Michael Conlan. Mr Kinahan said he cut ties with the company in 2017. While Mr Kinahan claims to no longer be associated with the agency, last yearFury expressly thanked him for organising a high-profile boutwith then world champion Anthony Joshua. Speaking about the sanctions, Garda (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris said this was just the ""first phase"" in the work to tackle the Kinahan gang. He said the enforcement measures would deal a ""heavy blow if not a crippling blow"" to the gang, which the UK's National Crime Agency has said is responsible for dealing drugs and firearms around the world for more than 20 years. ""It is a demonstration of the strength of resolve amongst all of us to put an end to a gang that has caused so much destruction and death here and abroad,"" Commissioner Harris said at a press conference in Dublin on Tuesday. The Garda Commissioner Drew Harris has rightly described today as ""a landmark day"" in the fight against the Kinahans and organised crime. The Kinahan family became household names after their feud - which has claimed at least 18 lives - with the rival Hutch gang. The most notorious incident was the Hutch attack ona boxing weigh-in six years ago. The Kinahans are now based in the United Arab Emirates, which has no extradition with the Republic of Ireland and that may have led them to think they were beyond reach. US ambassador to Ireland Claire Cronin says a reward of up to $5m is being offered for information on the gang But the American action today may have changed that with the three main members of the family's criminal enterprise now subject to the same enforcement measures as Russian oligarchs associated with the Putin regime arising from the war in Ukraine. In recent years, Daniel Kinahan, one of those sanctioned, has sought to launder his reputation by involvement in boxing. On Tuesday, police forces in Ireland and Britain told those associated with him that they can no longer be in any doubt about him and his family's activities. They also said that those sportsmen should now consider their own reputations and those of their sports and its fans. The commissioner said the gang had started life as south inner city Dublin drug dealers, but had grown to become a ""transnational crime cartel involved in a wide range of criminality that is estimated to have generated over â¬1bn for them"". ""All of it leaving countless victims of violence and addiction across the world in their wake,"" he added. For over 20 years the group has been responsible for importing tonnes of drugs and firearms around the world, the National Crime Agency (NCA) says. The NCA says the crime group is linked to over a dozen gangland murders. The US Treasury Department describes the Kinahan cartel as one of the most dangerous in the world, comparable to crime organisations like Italy's Camorra, Mexico's Los Zetas and Japan's Yakuza. According to GardaÃ­ (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris, the gang is estimated to have made over â¬1bn (Â£836,590,000) globally from its activities. Last month, Thomas Kavanagh, who the NCA says ran the group's criminal operations in the UK,was jailed for 21 years alongside Gary Vickery and Daniel Canning, who were sentenced to 20 years and 19 and a half years respectively. The NCA says evidence shows they were responsible for cocaine imports estimated to be up to Â£23.4m, and cannabis imports worth about Â£6.4m. The US Department of the Treasury said that as a result of the action being taken against the named people and businesses, ""all property and interests in property of the designated individuals or entities that are in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons must be blocked and reported to"" the OFAC. The group is suspected of involvement in a feud with a rival Dublin gang that has resulted in 18 people being murdered. Daniel Kinahan's lawyertold BBC Panorama last yearhe has no criminal record or convictions and the allegations about him being a crime boss are false and have no evidential basis.

Manhunt under way after Brooklyn subway shooting,"This video can not be played Footage shows panicked crowds on NYC subway Seventeen people have been injured in a shooting during the morning rush hour at a New York City subway station. The unidentified attacker detonated a smoke bomb and opened fire at Brooklyn's 36th Street station at 08:30 local time (12:30 GMT). Images from the scene showed bloodied passengers lying on the floor of the smoke-filled station. Officials are appealing for information about the gunman, who fled the scene and is still at large. ""An individual donned a gas mask, he then opened fire striking multiple people on the subway and on the platform."" New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said. The attacker then fled wearing what Ms Sewell said was a green construction-type vest and a grey sweatshirt. ""This is not being investigated as an act of terrorism at this time,"" she added. Police have since tracked down a rental van they had been searching for in connection with the attack, according to the Associated Press, but the suspect wasn't there. Ten of those who are being treated for injuries were shot, while others suffered smoke inhalation as well as injuries sustained during the initial panic. Five people are in a critical but stable condition. None of the injured are believed to be in a life-threatening condition, police said. Officers are still working to establish a motive for the attack. WARNING: Graphic image below ""My subway door opened into calamity. It was smoke and blood and people screaming,"" eyewitness Sam Carcamo told the Associated Press. He added that a billow of smoke poured out of the train once its doors opened. Images shared on social media showed injured people inside the smoke-filled station Another witness, identified only as Claire, told the New York Post that she had ""lost count"" of the number of shots that were fired. The woman said she saw the suspect dropping ""some kind of cylinder that sparked at the top"" - initially believing him to be a subway worker because of the vest she said he was wearing. New York's fire department told the BBC it originally received a call about smoke inside the station. But officials arrived to find multiple people shot and injured. Initial police investigations into what happened may have been hampered by a failure in the station's surveillance system. ""At that particular station there appeared to be some form of malfunction with the camera system,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams later said. Responding to the attack, President Joe Biden expressed gratitude to ""all the first responders who jumped into action, including civilians who didn't hesitate to help their fellow passengers."" US cities have seen a troubling rise in gun violence incidents over the past two years. ""This insanity that is seizing our city has to stop,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said after the attack. ""We say no more. No more mass shootings. No more disrupting lives."" Are you in the area? Please share your experiences by emailing:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Jody Keenan was 'kindest, most beautiful person'","A prayer ceremony was held in St Paul's Bessbrook on Monday morning A woman who died on a street in Newry as ambulances took more than 45 minutes to arrive was ""the kindest, most beautiful person"", her boss has said. Jody Keenan was a ""fantastic classroom assistant"" who had worked at St Paul's High School in Bessbrook for 10 years, according to principal Jarlath Burns. The PSNI has been in contact with the police ombudsman over her death. PSNI officers were with the 39-year-old on more than one occasion before she died and before an ambulance arrived. No decision has yet been reached on whether a police ombudsman investigation into the case will follow. A spokesman for the ombudsman said: ""The Police Ombudsman has been notified of this incident by the PSNI and preliminary inquiries are under way. ""The ombudsman cannot comment further at this stage."" Ms Keenan's death is not being treated as suspicious - it is understood that she became seriously ill during a night out in Newry city centre. She was socialising with friends when she collapsed on Trevor Hill in the early hours of Sunday. The NIAS said it received a call about Ms Keenan at 03:15 BST on Sunday but no ambulances were immediately available at the time due to a shortage of crews. Two ambulances were eventually sent to the scene, one from Belfast, County Antrim, and one from Banbridge, County Down. However, the first crew did not arrive at Trevor Hill until 04:03 BST - 48 minutes after NIAS said it got the first 999 call about the emergency. By that stage, she had died, despite efforts to resuscitate her, including by Ms Keenan's mother who attempted to give her CPR. ""The Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (OPONI) has been advised about this incident and are currently assessing the matter, given police were with Jody shortly before her death,"" said the PSNI's district commander in Newry, Supt Norman Haslett. ""We are currently assisting OPONI with their assessment and our thoughts remain firmly at this time with Jody's family, friends, colleagues and all those affected by this tragic incident."" TheNorthern Ireland Ambulance Service has apologisedto the family and is carrying out its own investigation. Jarlath Burns said Jody Keenan was a much-loved classroom assistant Ms Keenan's sudden death has left staff and pupils at the school where she worked ""numbed"", according to Mr Burns. ""We are in shock and very saddened by her loss,"" Mr Burns told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. A County Down man has said there are big questions to be asked about the health service after waiting over three hours for an ambulance on Saturday night. Michael Shiels, who lives in Kilkeel, said he found his mother unresponsive at her home and that, when she came round, she was showing signs of a stroke with slurred speech and limited movement. Mr Shiels told BBC's Evening Extra programme that he was told the ambulance service was ""under significant pressure"" but that a call would be put out for a crew. ""We were looking for all the signs for a stroke and the signs were there, but we also knew time was critical in a stroke,"" he added. When he called the ambulance service again after almost an hour, the operator told Mr Shiels crews were yet to be dispatched as they were ""tied up at hospitals"". Mr Shiels told the operator he was worried he would be ""ringing an undertaker"" if his mother's condition worsened. ""I don't know what's worse than a 76-year-old lying on the floor of a bathroom unable to move and unable to fully speak."" The ambulance arrived three-and-a-half hours after the first initial call was made. Crews told Mr Shiels they had travelled from Strabane, County Tyrone - about 90 miles away. ""In 2022 there's no way that should be allowed to happen to a 76-year-old woman, it shouldn't be allowed to happen anyone,"" he added. When contacted about the case, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) said no one was available for interview that that it had nothing to add to the statements it had issued over the past week explaining the current difficulties in the service. You can listen to the full interview onBBC Evening Extra on BBC Sounds. A prayer ceremony was held in St Paul's on Monday during which Ms Keenan's former colleagues and students shared their memories of the popular classroom assistant. ""We talked about Jody who was just the kindest most beautiful person you could even meet,"" Mr Burns said. ""She was loved by staff and pupils and parents alike."" Before taking a job at the high school, Ms Keenan previously worked at Rathore Special School in Newry. ""She was always committed to making a difference to children who had experience barriers to learning,"" Mr Burns said. ""She went way beyond the call of duty."" He told the programme that Ms Keenan had experienced health complications in recent years. ""She had a tumour removed from her spine last May and she suffered from hydrocephalus which is a build-up of fluid on the brain, which would have meant that she had to wear a shunt and I know she had been having difficulties with that in recent times,"" he said. ""Even when Jody was in hospital, getting the tumour removed from her spine, she was staying in contact with her pupils."" Ms Keenan's funeral is due to take place in Newry on Wednesday.

In a statement on Monday, the NIAS said it ""would like to apologise sincerely and offer our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the patient"". ""We recognise how difficult a time this will be for the family and we will be seeking to engage with them directly in the coming days,"" its spokesman added. The NIAS also confirmed on Monday that it will be carrying out a Serious Incident Review into what happened. Aserious adverse incidentis defined as any event or circumstance that led or could have led to serious unintended or unexpected harm, loss or damage to patients. Dr Alexander Davey, a doctor who has worked in ICU and emergency departments across the UK, said something radical needed to be done to prevent such incidents happening again. He said ambulance waiting times outside hospital emergency departments had reduced operational capacity and there was still a lot of Covid-19 absence in hospitals. ""We're now in a phase of critical burn-out in staff,"" Dr Davey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I've personally been in situations where I've been wanting to transfer patients between hospitals for life and limb-threatening procedures and there have been no ambulance available. ""You're left there with a patient needing your care and there's no resource available to help you get the patient to that care."" Dr Alexander Davey warned that such problems were ""becoming more frequent"" in Northern Ireland He added: ""I can fully empathise with both families and the teams involved in these incidents as to how frustrating and disempowering and desperate these situations are. ""Sometimes, as in this sad case, there's nothing to be done to respond in time."" Dr Davey, who has 15 years' experience in medicine, said the current crisis in emergency care would have happened long ago, were it not for the ""regular heroic efforts of colleagues moving heaven and earth"". ""You go through the stages of anger, despair, frustration... these problems are becoming more frequent,"" he said. ""But for the huge effort of my colleagues across the board coming in on a daily basis, spinning more than as many plates as they could possibly spin every shift and staying longer and doing everything they possibly can.... if it weren't for my colleagues we probably would have passed this crisis years ago. ""We may recognise this current crisis as the critical point as we look back.""

Warning travel problems could continue into summer,"Worker shortages mean airports and ports are facing a ""very difficult summer"", a border staff union has said. Lucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union, warned that Border Force was ""catastrophically under-staffed"" and that it took nearly a year to fully train new officers. Meanwhile, one aviation recruitment expert said it would take at least 12 months for shortages to settle down. Some travellers have seen long queues and cancellations over Easter. The travel industry cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but as demand for flights has returned, it has struggled to recruit, carry out security checks and train new staff quickly enough. ""For the first time in living memory, Border Force is no longer attracting enough candidates to fill the vacancies that they've got,"" Ms Moreton told the BBC. ""Combined with the fact it takes nearly a year to fully train a Border Force officer, we're going into not just this summer but this weekend catastrophically under-staffed, with people beginning to travel again."" What's causing flight disruption this Easter? Airport warns of queues as travel delays continue While she said it was right that no corners were cut with training and security clearances, Ms Moreton said more resources would help. She said cash incentives were being offered for working shifts at London's Heathrow Airport, while staff from Scotland and Northern Ireland were also being brought down to provide cover. However, she added: ""This is a very expensive proposition that resourcing it properly in the first place would have avoided."" The Aviation Recruitment Network, which is working with airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Manchester, said it currently had more than 300 live vacancies - a record for this time of year. Kully Sandhu, the organisation's managing director, told the BBC he believed it would take at least 12 months for recruitment problems to be resolved. ""Brexit has not helped with the issues we're facing at the moment because we had a natural attraction of individuals from the European market who would apply for vacancies within UK airports,"" he told the BBC. ""We no longer have that talent pool to recruit from and we are relying on individuals within the UK."" Heathrow has said security checks and training mean it can take three to six months before new recruits can start working. It is aiming to have 1,000 new security officers recruited and in their posts by the summer. On Monday, Heathrow admitted resources were ""stretched"",as it revealed March was its busiest month since the start of the pandemic. The airport warned of ""congestion in check-in areas at peak times"" and said it was ""working closely with airlines and ground handlers to make sure this increase in demand can be met while keeping passengers safe"". The Home Office also said travellers may face longer waits than usual over the Easter period due to high passenger numbers. ""Border Force's number one priority is to maintain a secure border, and we will not compromise on this. We are mobilising additional staff to help minimise queuing times for passengers and will continue to deploy our staff flexibly to manage this demand,"" a statement said. Last week, Ken O'Toole, the deputy chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said staff shortages meant long queues at security could continue for four to six weeks. Meanwhile, airlines have been hit by Covid-related absences, with EasyJet and British Airways cancelling flights as a result. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the company had seen absence rates of 20% in some cases. But he said delays in processing security checks for new airline crew were also contributing to flight cancellations. Mr Lundgren said the airline was waiting for the Department for Transport to give permission for around 100 new members of staff to start work. However, the company said it had flown 94% of its planned schedule in the past seven days, with around 1,500 flights a day - four times higher than this time last year. It added that cancellations had been made as early as possible to enable the majority of customers to rebook onto flights departing the same day. EasyJet said it was seeing strong demand, with summer bookings over the past six weeks above pre-pandemic levels. Have you changed your travel plans due to warnings of disruption?

Biggest squeeze for public sector pay in 20 years,"Public sector pay for jobs such as NHS workers, teachers and civil servants fell further behind price rises in the three months to February, figures show. While wages rose for public sector workers, price rises outpaced them meaning a 3% drop in spending power, the biggest fall in 20 years. In contrast, an average private sector employee's wage bought 0.5% less. The latest inflation figures show the cost of living is rising at its fastest pace for 30 years. ""Basic pay is now falling noticeably in real terms,"" said Darren Morgan fromthe Office for National Statistics,externaldescribing the fall in spending power. The most recent figures show that inflation reached 6.2% in February and new data, due out on Wednesday, is expected to show a further rise in March. Tom Southern, a recruitment consultant from Macclesfield, says he and family are having to make cutbacks because of the rising cost of living. The 30-year-old says he recently moved jobs to get a better salary, but it still does not go far enough. ""We're not massively uncomfortable, we have a house and two cars. But it's the little cutbacks you have to make, it starts to add up."" The father of three says it costs Â£1.80 a litre to put diesel in the family car and their energy bill has gone from Â£69 to Â£268 a month. Their weekly shop at Aldi is up from Â£50-60 to Â£80-90. Tom and his partner, who is a midwife, also have loans to pay, childcare costs, and are getting married this month which is another bill to pay. ""I don't see myself as unfortunate, it's other people I feel sorry for,"" he says. ""I don't see how single parents or people on a low wage can make ends meet."" The ONS said the unemployment rate fell to 3.8% from 3.9% last month. Capital Economics said the fall in unemployment was mainly due to people taking themselves out of the workforce by retiring or by looking after family or long-term sick. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the number of people classed as inactive rose by 76,000 in the three month period. At the start of the week, the annualrise in benefits and the state pension came into force. The increase was 3.1%. Now official figures show the average wage is going up by 4%. In normal times, that sounds like a decent rise in income, but these are not normal times. Households are watching most things get more expensive. Prices are rising at over 6% a year and accelerating, outstripping the uplift in benefits and pay. Remember, the target rate for price increases in the economy, as measured by inflation, is 2%. That leaves policymakers with a headache. Either people continue to get worse off, increasing poverty and putting added strain on individuals and the welfare system. Or workers get big pay rises, which bosses can only pay for by putting up prices again - creating what is called an inflationary spiral. Targeted support for those in the most need is another option. Ultimately, it may be that everyone feels some short-term financial pain in the hope, and belief, that those prices rises slow to the 2% target as soon as possible. The number of job vacancies reached a fresh high of 1.29 million between January and March - a rise of 492,400 roles compared with the pre-pandemic first three months of 2020. The ONS said the highest rate of vacancies was in construction, which rose by 18.7% in the first three months of the year. Sectors such as hotels and food services, including restaurants, and entertainment saw job openings increase by 13.1%. However, there was a fall in demand for people in the gas and electricity sectors where vacancy rates dropped by 14%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures ""show the continued strength of our jobs market"", adding that the government was ""helping to cushion the impacts of global price rises through over Â£22bn of support for the cost of living this financial year"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the data shows that ""Conservative choices are leaving real wages squeezed and people worse off"". ""At a time like this, Rishi Sunak could have chosen a one-off windfall tax on huge oil and gas company profits to cut household energy bills by up to Â£600. ""Instead, he's decided to make Britain the only major economy to land working people with higher taxes in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis,"" he said. Molly Scott Cato, Green Party finance and economy spokesperson, said: ""Rather than a cost of living crisis we should see the perilous situation facing working people as a wages crisis. ""A Green government would introduce taxes on the wealthy and on pollution to fund decent pay rises so that all public service workers get a pay rise that at least matches the cost of living and begins to restore earnings lost over the last decade.""

Zika may be one mutation away from a new outbreak,"The virus has been linked to cases of microcephaly A new outbreak of Zika virus is quite possible, warn researchers, with a single mutation potentially enough to trigger an explosive spread. The disease caused a global medical emergency in 2016, with thousands of babies born brain-damaged after their mums became infected while pregnant. US scientists say the world should be on the lookout for new mutations. Lab work, described in the journalCell Reports,external, suggests the virus could easily shift, creating new variants. Recent infection studies suggest those variants may prove effective at transmitting the virus, even in countries which have built up immunity from previous outbreaks of Zika, say the team from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Experts said the findings, although theoretical, were interesting - and a reminder that viruses other than Covid could pose a threat. Zika is spread by bites from infected Aedes mosquitoes. The insects are found throughout the Americas - except for Canada and Chile, where it is too cold for them to survive - and across Asia. While for most people Zika is a mild illness, with no lasting effects, it can have catastrophic consequences for babies in the womb. If a mother contracts the virus during pregnancy, it can harm the developing baby, causing microcephaly (unusually small head) and damaged brain tissue. Zika is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito which is most active during the day Although the virus is mostly spread by mosquitoes, it can also be sexually transmitted Few people die from Zika and only one in five people infected is thought to develop symptoms These can include fever, a rash and joint pain Since there is no treatment, the only option is to reduce the risk of being bitten Scientists have begun work on a Zika vaccine to help protect pregnant woman The researchers recreated what happens when Zika passes back and forth between mosquitoes and humans, using cells and living mice in their experiments. When Zika passed between mosquito cells and mice in the laboratory, small genetic changes occurred. This meant it was relatively easy for Zika to mutate in a way that allowed the virus to thrive and spread, even in animals that had some previous immunity from a similar mosquito-borne infection called dengue. Lead investigator Prof Sujan Shresta said: ""The Zika variant that we identified had evolved to the point where the cross-protective immunity afforded by prior dengue infection was no longer effective in mice. ""Unfortunately for us, if this variant becomes prevalent, we may have the same issues in real life."" Prof Jonathan Ball, an expert in viruses at the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: ""We've heard so much lately about the rapid evolution and emergence of coronavirus variants, but this is a timely reminder that shapeshifting is a common feature shared by so many viruses. ""This work shows just how rapidly a single letter change in the genome sequence of a virus can arise, and the stark impact it can have on the disease capability of a virus. But viruses that share these changes haven't often been seen in outbreaks and, as the authors point out, these intriguing insights require more thorough investigation."" Dr Clare Taylor, from the Society for Applied Microbiology, said: ""Although these findings were seen in laboratory experiments and therefore have limitations, it does show that there is potential for variants of concern to arise during the normal Zika transmission cycle and reminds us that monitoring is important to follow viruses as they evolve."" She said it might be possible to predict which variants could cause significant issues in the future and intervene early. Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said past infection with Zika might still offer some protection against new variants - as has been seen with Covid.

Online marketplace hosting stolen data shut down,"An online forum providing criminals with stolen personal data has been taken down, in a global operation which saw its founder arrested. Found on the open web rather than the darknet, RaidForums hosted sensitive financial information and ""served as a major online marketplace for hackers"". Its founder and chief administrator Diego Santos Coelho, 21, from Portugal, was arrested in the UK on 31 January. The US Department for Justice said he remains in custody pending extradition. Separately the National Crime Agency (NCA) reported police had arrested another suspected founder of the site - a 21 year-old from Croydon - at his home in March. He has since been released, under investigation, but at the time of his arrest officers seized Â£5,000 in cash, thousands of US dollars and activated a freeze on crypto assets worth more than half a million dollars. RaidForums launched in 2015 and gained prominence in criminal circles by offering access to high-profile database leaks, which could be used to enable crimes such as fraud. According to the threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, the site contained more than 530,000 registered members and was a powerful tool among low to mid-level cyber-criminals. The compromised data, which hackers bought and sold, included information stolen from UK companies, some of which related to credit cards, bank accounts, usernames and passwords. Investigators found that the forum was operating a membership scheme, where users of the site paid up to 10 euros for access to chatrooms which allowed the exchange of photographs and data linked to cyber-crime. They suspected that administrators of the website, based in the UK, were helping to manage its membership, as well as laundering payments to the site through a separate - seemingly legitimate - online business. Police from the UK, US, Germany, Sweden, Portugal and Romania were all involved in the dismantling of the online platform. Under Operation Tourniquet, the international partners took action to close RaidForums and carried out a number of linked arrests. Allow Twitter content?

""The takedown of this online market for the resale of hacked or stolen data disrupts one of the major ways cyber-criminals profit from the large-scale theft of sensitive personal and financial information,"" said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite. ""This is another example of how working with our international law enforcement partners has resulted in the shutdown of a criminal marketplace and the arrest of its administrator."" The FBI's Steven M D'Antuono said: ""The seizure of the RaidForums website, which facilitated the sale of stolen data from millions of people throughout the world, and the charges against the marketplace's administrator, are a testament to the strength of the FBI's international partnerships."" ""Cyber-crime transcends borders, which is why the FBI is committed to working with our partners to bring cyber-criminals to justice - no matter where in the world they live or behind what device they try to hide."" Special agent Jason Kane, from the US Secret Service, said: ""This global investigation signifies the remarkable dedication of the US Secret Service and highlights our partnerships with our foreign law enforcement counterparts essential to disrupting sophisticated networks of cyber-criminals.""

How will we know if Russia has used chemical weapons?,"Britain has reacted with concern at unconfirmed reports of an alleged chemical attack in the besieged city of Mariupol. The alarm was raised by some of the last Ukrainian soldiers still holding out against the Russian assault there. They are from the Azov Battalion, a small but controversial element of Ukraine's National Guard due to their far right tendencies. They claim that after a Russian drone flew over, there was a cloud of smoke and three of their members experienced breathing difficulties. These could be symptoms consistent with a chemical or poison gas attack but this will be hard to prove. Reported chemical attack deeply concerning The global watchdog for chemical weapons - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - would usually be called in to assess any evidence. But that will be challenging in Mariupol, for obvious reasons. The former British Army officer Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a chemical weapons expert, cautioned that even if uncontaminated samples could be collected from the scene they would need to be taken to another country for analysis. This, he said, would take some time. Western governments are also able to examine satellite imagery and other intelligence for any signs that chemical weapons units or vehicles were nearby, he said. But that won't give any hard and fast answers any time soon. Britain's Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the incident needed proper investigation. He said that if Russia were found to have used banned chemical weapons then ""nothing was ruled out"" in terms of Nato's response. So what does that mean exactly? Ministers won't be drawn on the details. Even if it could be proved to be a chemical attack, Nato would still be extremely reluctant to become directly involved in the fighting inside Ukraine's borders. At most it would probably lead to yet more sanctions on Russia and a further stepping up of military hardware exports to Ukraine. Chemical weapons are any kind of munitions that carry toxins or chemical substances that attack the body's system. There are different categories of chemical weapons. Choking agents like phosgene attack the lungs and respiratory system, causing victims to drown in their lungs' secretions. There are blister agents, like mustard gas, which burn the skin and blind people. Then there is the most lethal category of all: nerve agents, which interfere with the brain's messages to the body's muscles. A tiny drop of these can be fatal. Less than 0.5mg of VX nerve agent, for example, is enough to kill an adult. Russia, when it was part of the Soviet Union, controlled a massive biological weapons programme All of these so-called chemical agents can be used in warfare in artillery shells, bombs and missiles. However, all are strictly prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997 which was signed by the vast majority of nations, including Russia. Chemical weapons were used in World War One, in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and more recently by the Syrian government against rebel forces. Russia says it destroyed the last of its chemical weapons stocks in 2017, but since then there have been at least two chemical attacks blamed on Moscow. The first was the Salisbury attack of March 2018. A former KGB officer and defector, Sergei Skripal, was poisoned along with his daughter by the nerve agent Novichok. Russia denied responsibility and came up with over 20 different explanations for who else could have done it. However, investigators concluded it was the work of two officers from Russia's GRU military intelligence. To show their disgust, countries around the world expelled a total of 128 Russian spies and diplomats. Then, in August 2020, the prominent Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny was also poisoned with Novichok and narrowly escaped death. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was almost killed with by a chemical weapons attack Some military analysts fear that if the coming Russian assault in the Donbas fails to achieve its objectives then, in desperation, President Putin could authorise the use of chemical weapons on stubborn defenders. If Russia were to use weapons like poison gas in this war, it would be seen as crossing a major red line, most probably prompting calls for the West to take action. Chemical weapons played a decisive role in the Syrian government's campaign to suppress resistance in rebel-held cities, killing and incapacitating fighters and civilians alike. The Syrian air force, which reportedly carried out dozens of these attacks, was supported and protected by the Russian air force. The general in charge of Russia's war effort there, Aleksandr Dvornikov, has now been appointed to run Moscow's war against Ukraine. The unpleasant truth about chemical weapons is that if you have a protracted war, where the attacking military are trying to break the will of defending forces, then these weapons are one hideously effective way to achieve that. They not only permeate into cellars and bunkers, they can result in an agonising death and hence are also a psychological weapon of terror.

As ever, you can find full stories and analysis on our politics page -here. Goodnight. That's it from us on this subject for today. Events took a dramatic turn just after lunchtime, when it was confirmed that the prime minister and chancellor had breached Covid regulations. Here's what we learned: The event:  The apologies:  The reaction: Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Can lawmakers get away with being lawbreakers? The PM faced the cameras again today to apologise for breaking lockdown laws, while insisting it did not occur to him at the time that he was doing anything wrong. ""But, of course,"" he added, ""the police have found otherwise and I fully respect the outcome of their investigation."" He tried to sound contrite, saying people had a right to expect better from their prime minister. But he made it clear he will not be resigning, telling reporters he intended to ""get on with the job"". Will this be enough to save his skin? Read more from Chris here. More senior Conservative MPs are tweeting their backing for Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak a few hours after the fines for breaching lockdown rules were announced. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says,external: ""It was right for the police to take breaches in No10 seriously and for the PM to apologise.

He and the Chancellor are leading our country through huge challenges & they continue to have my full support."" Transport secretary Grant Shapps says,externalas he was unable to visit his dad in hospital for four months in 2020 he shares the anger felt about the fines. But he adds: ""I also recognise PM has apologised, accepted responsibility & reformed No10. Now, as he leads the West's response to Putin's evil war he has my full support."" AndDowning Street chief of staff Steve Barclay says,external: ""The Prime Minister has apologised to the public and brought about the changes in No10 that he promised. 

Both the PM and the Chancellor have my full support as we continue to focus on the priorities of the British people."" A woman who lost her mother to Covid-19 says the issuing of a fine to Boris Johnson shows he has broken Covid laws and is unfit to lead the country. Jackie Green, from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, says the prime minister is ""completely untrustworthy and devoid of any integrity"". Green, whose mother died in December 2020 on the same day as one of the alleged Downing Street parties, adds Johnson should ""do the decent thing for once"" and resign. Watch what she has to say below: This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak has issued an ""unreserved apology"" after confirming he received a lockdown fine for attending the Downing Street gathering on 19 June 2020. He says: ""I understand that for figures in public office the rules must be applied stringently in order to maintain public confidence. I respect the decision that has been made and have paid the fine. ""I know people sacrificed a great deal during Covid and they will find this situation upsetting. I deeply regret the frustration and anger caused and I am sorry. ""Like the prime minister, I am focused on delivering for the British people at this challenging time.""  Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner says the absence of any statement from Rishi Sunak about his fine for breaching his own government's lockdown regulations is ""bizarre"". Highlighting the criticism Sunak has faced over his wife's non-domiciled tax status, she tells the PA news agency: ""After a week of torrid headlines for the chancellor, you would think he might have something to say to the British public."" She repeats Labour's call for him to resign, saying he broke the law while ""people made huge sacrifices and followed the rules"". The short answer is, we don't know. But we can give you a longer answer by telling you what we've heard from a barrister who has thrown out some ballpark figures. Speaking to the BBC, Adam Wagner says: ""If you organise a gathering for over 30 people in a public place or in a private dwelling you can be on the hook for Â£10,000. ""If you attend one of those gatherings it can be Â£850."" He says the more likely amount in the prime minister and chancellor's case is a fine between Â£60 and Â£200. However, an individual can get more than one fine - and the amount doubles for each fixed-penalty notice received. So if Johnson was issued with six fines he could be asked to pay over Â£10,000, Wagner says. Boris Johnson's fine is over a party held at No 10 to celebrate his 56th birthday on 19 June 2020, when indoor gatherings of more than two people were banned. ""There was a brief gathering in the Cabinet Room shortly after 2pm, lasting less than 10 minutes, during which people I worked with passed on their good wishes,"" he said this evening. Three months before that birthday, in the early days of the pandemic, the PM was sent a letter by a girl named Josephine who wanted to let him know she was postponing her seventh birthday party and ""staying at home because you asked us to"". Johnson wrote back to Josephine saying: ""We have all got to do our bit to protect the NHS and save lives and that is exactly what you are doing, so well done."" The prime minister tweeted both letters at the time, adding: ""Josephine sets a great example to us all by postponing her birthday party until we have sent coronavirus packing.""

A flurry of cabinet ministers have posted on Twitter in support of the prime minister and chancellor in the last half hour, about five hours after their fines for breaching lockdown rules were first made public. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says,externalJohnson has ""apologised and taken responsibility for what happened in Downing Street"", while he and the chancellor are ""delivering for Britain on many fronts including the international security crisis we face"". Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, says,externalJohnson and Sunak ""made the right calls on the big issues"", adding: ""Lessons have been learnt and now our focus must be on the huge global challenges we all face."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey says,externalit is important for the country that the PM and chancellor ""get on with the job the country elected them to do"". Members of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Group, pictured at the national memorial wall A group of families bereaved in the pandemic have justshared a letter they sent,externalBoris Johnson earlier today, when it emerged he had been issued with a fine. It says they all obeyed rules that meant they couldn't hold the hands of loved ones as they passed away or comfort each other, because they wanted to protect others from the same pain. ""You on the other hand did not. You broke those laws intended to keep us safe. You trampled on the sacrifices we and all the British public made,"" the letter from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group says. ""You have paid a fine. Our loved ones paid with their lives."" The group asks if a new variant emerges that requires fresh public health measures, will Johnson have the ""moral authority"" to impose them? It calls on the PM to ""go now"". The chancellor's deputy, Chief Secretary of the Treasury Simon Clarke, is the latest minister to speak out in ""full support"" of his boss and the prime minister after their fines for lockdown breaches. ""Their efforts during the pandemic have ensured the UK is now free of restrictions and avoided economic catastrophe. ""I for one am grateful to them for everything they have done for our country,"" he said. He said the PM has apologised and accepted the police decision, and has instituted a ""comprehensive programme of reform in No 10"", so it was time to ""get on with the job of governing"". Scottish Secretary Alister Jack also backed the PM, saying he ""remains the right person to lead this country"". So far, we've still heard no response about the fines from the chancellor, who has been under pressure for weeks after questions about his wife's business links to Russia and tax affairs. This video can not be played If you're just catching up, here's a video clip of Boris Johnson's statement about breaching his own lockdown rules. As we've already reported, he confirms he has paid his fine and says he is sorry. Danny Shaw, a former BBC home affairs correspondent who is now a commentor on crime and policing, points outthe fixed penalty notices appear to be issued by the police in chronological order,external. He notes one of the first batch of people to receive notice of a fine was former government ethics chief Helen McNamara, reportedly for attending a leaving do on 18 June 2020. Boris Johnson has been fined for his birthday party on 19 June 2020, we've learned today. Shaw says the 30 fixed penalty referrals announced today correspond with the number of people who reportedly attended the birthday party. ""There are 10 other gatherings under police investigation. Fifty other people were sent questionnaires. Fines will keep on coming - for weeks,"" he concludes. When stories first started emerging about parties in Downing Street, Boris Johnson insisted all guidance was followed. After reading his statement, he is asked if he lied. The prime minister says he said what he did in ""completely good faith"". ""It didn't occur to me that I was in breach of the rules."" ""I now humbly accept that I was."" Asked if he will now resign, Boris Johnson repeats his apology and his desire to ""get on with the job"". On the subject of further fines, he says he takes ""full responsibility for everything"" but adds that Downing Street is 15,000 square feet and has hundreds of officials working there. ""I couldn't be everywhere at once,"" he says. He adds that operations in Downing Street have since been ""radically transformed"". In his statement, which he read out to reporters, Boris Johnson confirms he has paid the fine issued to him by the Metropolitan Police - but does not say how much it was. He says it was given to him because, on 19 June 2020, colleagues had gathered to wish him a happy birthday. According to ITV News, up to 30 people attended and were served cake. At the time, gatherings of more than two people inside were banned by law. An exception was allowed if the gathering ""was reasonably necessary"" for work purposes. But because the PM has been fined, it is clear the police have not deemed the gathering as necessary. Boris Johnson continues: ""I understand the anger many will feel that I myself fell short when it came to observing the very rules which the government I lead had introduced to protect the public. ""I accept in all sincerity that people had the right to
expect better."" He says he now feels a sense of duty ""to deliver on the priorities of
the British people"" which he says includes ""ensuring Putin fails in Ukraine and easing the
burden on families caused by higher energy prices"". ""I will take forward that task with due humility."" Boris Johnson has now given a statement. He says: ""Today I've received a fixed penalty notice from the Metropolitan police relating to a Downing Street Event on 19 June 2020. ""Let me say immediately, I have paid the fine and want to offer a full apology."" Going through the events of that day, he says: ""There was a brief gathering in the Cabinet Room shortly after 2pm, lasting less than 10 minutes, during which people I worked with passed on their good wishes. ""At that time it did not occur to me this might have been a breach of the rules. ""The police have found otherwise and I fully respect the outcome of their investigation."" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries defends the prime minister, calling Boris Johnson's lockdown birthday party a ""brief gathering"". Dorries tweets that the PM ""has been clear"" about events on 19 June 2020 and already offered a full apology. She says: ""It was a brief gathering in the Cabinet Room, less than 10 minutes during a busy working day."" Defending his position as prime minister, she adds: ""PM is at his best when delivering on the priorities of the British people which he will continue to do."" Dorries, a loyal supporter of Johnson, is believed to be the first cabinet minister to publicly comment on the fines. Â© 2025 BBC.

Local officials in New York held a news conference on the Brooklyn subway shooting incident a short while ago. Here is what they told us:  Officials are expected to provide another update later on Tuesday. Images continue to emerge of the aftermath of the shooting incident in Brooklyn. A massive police presence remains, with cars and emergency response vehicles blocking 4th Avenue. Small crowds of local residents are also waiting outside police cordons. Police are expected to hold a news conference soon. Harry LowReporting from Brooklyn There was major interest for more detail on what happened earlier today in a Brooklyn subway station, as local and state officials gave a brief update on the situation. I saw at least one photographer's lens smash in the scramble to get prime position for the news conference.  The news conference in Brooklyn has just ended, with an update expected later in the day as the investigation continues. NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said that while the motive remains unclear, she is ""not ruling anything out"". Sewell added that the investigation is ongoing and remains in its very early stages. A total of 16 people were injured in the incident in Brooklyn, according to New York City fire commissioner Laura Kavanagh. Ten of the injured are suffering from gunshot wounds. Five of the injured are in a critical but stable condition at local hospitals. The injuries range from smoke inhalation to shrapnel wounds, Kavanagh said. The suspect remains on the loose and may be dangerous, New York Governor Kathy Hochul says. She warned New Yorkers to stay vigilant. ""Ordinary New Yorkers woke up in anticipation of a relatively normal day,"" she said. ""That sense of tranquility and normal was brutally disrupted."" Governor Hochul also said she will devote ""the full resources of our state"" to fighting crime in the city. ""This insanity that is seizing our city has to stop,"" she told reporters at the NYPD news conference. ""We say no more. No more mass shootings. No more disrupting lives."" The incident in Brooklyn is not being investigated as an act of terrorism, NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell has says. Sewell said that the suspect opened a canister in the subway before opening fire with a firearm. She confirmed he believed to be about 5'5, wearing a green construction-type vest and a grey sweat shirt. Sewell urged the public to come forward with any information or video evidence. The NYPD and city and state officials have just begun a press conference to update the public on the incident at a Brooklyn subway station. CBS New York reports that victims of the Tuesday morning shooting have been taken to at least three hospitals in Brooklyn. Eight people are being treated at NYU Langone, five are at the Maimonides Medical Center and three others are at New York Presbyterian. New York's fire department has confirmed at least 16 people have been hurt in Tuesday's incident. That includes at least eight people who were shot. Some of the victims are being treated for smoke inhalation. This video can not be played Video recorded by Eamon Loingsigh. Emergency services rush to the scene of a shooting in Brooklyn subway station. Sirens are heard as the vehicles speed up the street in the Sunset Park neighbourhood. Harry LowReporting from Brooklyn Erik Frankel runs a nearby business selling footwear to police officers. He says it's hard to grasp the ""historical context of just how bad this [area] used to be"". His father would wear  a bullet proof vest to work, he said. ""Right now, this is probably the safest block on Brooklyn with the amount of police here,"" he says. The city has just activated its Unified Victim Identification System. If somebody you know might have been involved in the incident, you can call 311 for more information. If you reside in the US but outside New York City, you can call 212-639-9675. A spokesperson for the New York State Education Department says students at several local schools are currently sheltering in place. The shooting took place in the Sunset Park neighbourhood of the city's Brooklyn borough. The search for a suspected gunman is ongoing. There is a huge police presence at the scene around 36th Street station. The shooting occurred during the morning rush hour. Commuters and locals are standing by, watching as officials secure the scene and transport the injured. New York Police are set to hold a news conference to provide more details on the incident and subsequent investigation. Eyewitness reports have begun to trickle in from people who were at the train station where the incident took place. One witness, identified only as Claire, was quoted by the New York Post as saying that she ""lost count"" of the amount of shots fired. She added that the suspect - who was reportedly wearing an orange vest and gas mask - dropped ""some kind of cylinder that sparked at the top"".

US sanctions gang leader with links to Tyson Fury,"Daniel Kinahan leaving court in Spain in 2010 US officials have announced sanctions against several top members of the Irish Kinahan organised crime group. Among the seven individuals sanctioned by the US Treasury is Daniel Kinahan, who has previously worked as an advisor to boxer Tyson Fury. Treasury officials said Mr Kinahan ""is believed to run the day-to-day operations of the organisation"". The Kinahan cartel emerged in Dublin in the 1990s and the US says it is one of the world's largest crime groups. The gang, which the Treasury Department says now uses Dubai as a ""hub"" for its illegal activities, operates in Ireland, the UK, Spain and the United Arab Emirates, with interests in the drug trade and money laundering, according to the Treasury. US Under-Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said the gang ""smuggles deadly narcotics, including cocaine, to Europe, and is a threat to the entire licit economy through its role in international money laundering"". Speaking at a news conference in Dublin, Drew Harris, the Commissioner of Ireland's police force hailed the sanctions and warned senior gang members couldn't ""hide from justice forever"". The sanctions will target Mr Kinahan, who has previously been named by the Irish High Court as the controller and manager of the gang, his father Christopher Snr - a convicted drug trafficker and alleged founder of the gang, and his brother Christopher Jnr, who the notice accused of working with the gang to ""transport and sell narcotics in the United Kingdom"". The US Drug Enforcement Agency has also offered rewards of up to $5m (Â£3.8m) for information leading to the arrest of any of the three Kinahans. All those sanctioned will see their US credit and debit cards blocked and any money they hold in US banks frozen. They will also see access to their property restricted. The Kinahan cartel emerged during Ireland's ""Celtic Tiger"" period, an era of high economic growth from the 1990s to 2007. Irish media has reported that it holds a virtual monopoly on the import of Peruvian cocaine to Europe, and controls around a third of the total trade of the drug on the continent. Since 2016, the group has been involved in a bloody war with the rival Hutch gang in Dublin and Spain, resulting in at least 18 deaths. The notice issued by the Treasury department referred to the Kinahan gang as a ""murderous organization"". Daniel Kinahan has also become a well-known figure in boxing circles. He is a co-founder of the MTK Global agency, which represents a number of boxing's top fighters, including Tyson Fury and Michael Conlan. Mr Kinahan says he cut ties with the company in 2017. Tyson Fury worked with Daniel Kinahan for several years and last year thanked him for organising a fight with Anthony Joshua While Mr Kinahan claims he is no longer associated with the agency, last year Fury expressly thanked him for organising a high-profile bout with then world champion Anthony Joshua. Just weeks ago Fury was photographed in Dubai with Mr Kinahan. Scotland's world boxing champion, Josh Taylor, is also one of the boxers represented by MTK Global. Taylor once described Mr Kinahan as a ""great advisor"" who is doing great things for the sport of boxing. The BBC has contacted Josh Taylor and his team for comment. Despite Mr Kinahan's well known links to the drug trade, boxing chiefs have defended his involvement with the sport. Last month World Boxing Council President Mauricio SulaimÃ¡n offered his ""full backing"" to the Irishman's continued involvement after a meeting in Dubai. The Assistant Commissioner of Ireland's Police Force John O'Driscoll condemned Mr Kinahan's standing in the sport, telling reporters at a news conference in Dublin that his influence was ""destroying or attempting to destroy a sport that is so important to inner city communities"". After aBBC investigation revealed his continued presencein the sport last year, Mr Kinahan insisted that allegations ofcriminality are part of a ""campaign"" against him.

New York subway shooting leaves several injured,"This video can not be played Footage shows panicked crowds on NYC subway Seventeen people have been injured in a shooting during the morning rush hour at a New York City subway station. The unidentified attacker detonated a smoke bomb and opened fire at Brooklyn's 36th Street station at 08:30 local time (12:30 GMT). Images from the scene showed bloodied passengers lying on the floor of the smoke-filled station. Officials are appealing for information about the gunman, who fled the scene and is still at large. ""An individual donned a gas mask, he then opened fire striking multiple people on the subway and on the platform."" New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said. The attacker then fled wearing what Ms Sewell said was a green construction-type vest and a grey sweatshirt. ""This is not being investigated as an act of terrorism at this time,"" she added. Police have since tracked down a rental van they had been searching for in connection with the attack, according to the Associated Press, but the suspect wasn't there. Ten of those who are being treated for injuries were shot, while others suffered smoke inhalation as well as injuries sustained during the initial panic. Five people are in a critical but stable condition. None of the injured are believed to be in a life-threatening condition, police said. Officers are still working to establish a motive for the attack. WARNING: Graphic image below ""My subway door opened into calamity. It was smoke and blood and people screaming,"" eyewitness Sam Carcamo told the Associated Press. He added that a billow of smoke poured out of the train once its doors opened. Images shared on social media showed injured people inside the smoke-filled station Another witness, identified only as Claire, told the New York Post that she had ""lost count"" of the number of shots that were fired. The woman said she saw the suspect dropping ""some kind of cylinder that sparked at the top"" - initially believing him to be a subway worker because of the vest she said he was wearing. New York's fire department told the BBC it originally received a call about smoke inside the station. But officials arrived to find multiple people shot and injured. Initial police investigations into what happened may have been hampered by a failure in the station's surveillance system. ""At that particular station there appeared to be some form of malfunction with the camera system,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams later said. Responding to the attack, President Joe Biden expressed gratitude to ""all the first responders who jumped into action, including civilians who didn't hesitate to help their fellow passengers."" US cities have seen a troubling rise in gun violence incidents over the past two years. ""This insanity that is seizing our city has to stop,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said after the attack.

Kinahan gang sanctions 'heavy blow' to activitiesThe Republic of Ireland's police chief says it is the first phase of work to tackle the crime cartel.Europe,"This video can not be played Garda (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris says this is only the ""first phase"" in the work to tackle the Kinahan gang Worldwide financial sanctions targeting the Kinahan crime cartel will deal a ""heavy blow"" to their activities, Ireland's police chief has said. Irish, American and British law enforcement have launched coordinated action against the Irish organised crime group. A reward of up to $5m (Â£3.84m) has also been offered by the US for information on the three most senior members. In total, seven members and three associated businesses are targeted. Daniel Kinahan, 44, has previously been named in the Irish courts as the head of one of Europe's most prominent drug gangs. His father Christopher Snr, 65, and brother Christopher Jnr, 41, were also placed on an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list. US sanctions gang leader with links to Tyson Fury 'Organised crime boss' still working in boxing They are among the seven members of the Kinahan cartel targeted by the OFAC. On Tuesday, US Ambassador to Ireland Claire Cronin said a reward of up to $5m was being offered for information which leads to the financial disruption of the group or the arrest or conviction of Christopher Kinahan Snr, Daniel Kinahan or Christopher Kinahan Jnr. Tyson Fury thanked Daniel Kinahan for organising a fight with then world champion Anthony Joshua in 2021 Daniel Kinahan has previously worked as an advisor to boxer Tyson Fury and is a co-founder of the MTK Global agency, which represents a number of boxing's top fighters, including Fury and Michael Conlan. Mr Kinahan said he cut ties with the company in 2017. While Mr Kinahan claims to no longer be associated with the agency, last yearFury expressly thanked him for organising a high-profile boutwith then world champion Anthony Joshua. Speaking about the sanctions, Garda (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris said this was just the ""first phase"" in the work to tackle the Kinahan gang. He said the enforcement measures would deal a ""heavy blow if not a crippling blow"" to the gang, which the UK's National Crime Agency has said is responsible for dealing drugs and firearms around the world for more than 20 years. ""It is a demonstration of the strength of resolve amongst all of us to put an end to a gang that has caused so much destruction and death here and abroad,"" Commissioner Harris said at a press conference in Dublin on Tuesday. The Garda Commissioner Drew Harris has rightly described today as ""a landmark day"" in the fight against the Kinahans and organised crime. The Kinahan family became household names after their feud - which has claimed at least 18 lives - with the rival Hutch gang. The most notorious incident was the Hutch attack ona boxing weigh-in six years ago. The Kinahans are now based in the United Arab Emirates, which has no extradition with the Republic of Ireland and that may have led them to think they were beyond reach. US ambassador to Ireland Claire Cronin says a reward of up to $5m is being offered for information on the gang But the American action today may have changed that with the three main members of the family's criminal enterprise now subject to the same enforcement measures as Russian oligarchs associated with the Putin regime arising from the war in Ukraine. In recent years, Daniel Kinahan, one of those sanctioned, has sought to launder his reputation by involvement in boxing. On Tuesday, police forces in Ireland and Britain told those associated with him that they can no longer be in any doubt about him and his family's activities. They also said that those sportsmen should now consider their own reputations and those of their sports and its fans. The commissioner said the gang had started life as south inner city Dublin drug dealers, but had grown to become a ""transnational crime cartel involved in a wide range of criminality that is estimated to have generated over â¬1bn for them"". ""All of it leaving countless victims of violence and addiction across the world in their wake,"" he added. For over 20 years the group has been responsible for importing tonnes of drugs and firearms around the world, the National Crime Agency (NCA) says. The NCA says the crime group is linked to over a dozen gangland murders. The US Treasury Department describes the Kinahan cartel as one of the most dangerous in the world, comparable to crime organisations like Italy's Camorra, Mexico's Los Zetas and Japan's Yakuza. According to GardaÃ­ (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris, the gang is estimated to have made over â¬1bn (Â£836,590,000) globally from its activities. Last month, Thomas Kavanagh, who the NCA says ran the group's criminal operations in the UK,was jailed for 21 years alongside Gary Vickery and Daniel Canning, who were sentenced to 20 years and 19 and a half years respectively. The NCA says evidence shows they were responsible for cocaine imports estimated to be up to Â£23.4m, and cannabis imports worth about Â£6.4m. The US Department of the Treasury said that as a result of the action being taken against the named people and businesses, ""all property and interests in property of the designated individuals or entities that are in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons must be blocked and reported to"" the OFAC. The group is suspected of involvement in a feud with a rival Dublin gang that has resulted in 18 people being murdered. Daniel Kinahan's lawyertold BBC Panorama last yearhe has no criminal record or convictions and the allegations about him being a crime boss are false and have no evidential basis.

NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said that while the motive remains unclear, she is ""not ruling anything out"". Sewell added that the investigation is ongoing and remains in its very early stages. A total of 16 people were injured in the incident in Brooklyn, according to New York City fire commissioner Laura Kavanagh. Ten of the injured are suffering from gunshot wounds. Five of the injured are in a critical but stable condition at local hospitals. The injuries range from smoke inhalation to shrapnel wounds, Kavanagh said. The suspect remains on the loose and may be dangerous, New York Governor Kathy Hochul says. She warned New Yorkers to stay vigilant. ""Ordinary New Yorkers woke up in anticipation of a relatively normal day,"" she said. ""That sense of tranquility and normal was brutally disrupted."" Governor Hochul also said she will devote ""the full resources of our state"" to fighting crime in the city. ""This insanity that is seizing our city has to stop,"" she told reporters at the NYPD news conference. ""We say no more. No more mass shootings. No more disrupting lives."" The incident in Brooklyn is not being investigated as an act of terrorism, NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell has says. Sewell said that the suspect opened a canister in the subway before opening fire with a firearm. She confirmed he believed to be about 5'5, wearing a green construction-type vest and a grey sweat shirt. Sewell urged the public to come forward with any information or video evidence. The NYPD and city and state officials have just begun a press conference to update the public on the incident at a Brooklyn subway station. CBS New York reports that victims of the Tuesday morning shooting have been taken to at least three hospitals in Brooklyn. Eight people are being treated at NYU Langone, five are at the Maimonides Medical Center and three others are at New York Presbyterian. New York's fire department has confirmed at least 16 people have been hurt in Tuesday's incident. That includes at least eight people who were shot. Some of the victims are being treated for smoke inhalation. This video can not be played Video recorded by Eamon Loingsigh. Emergency services rush to the scene of a shooting in Brooklyn subway station. Sirens are heard as the vehicles speed up the street in the Sunset Park neighbourhood. Harry LowReporting from Brooklyn Erik Frankel runs a nearby business selling footwear to police officers. He says it's hard to grasp the ""historical context of just how bad this [area] used to be"". His father would wear  a bullet proof vest to work, he said. ""Right now, this is probably the safest block on Brooklyn with the amount of police here,"" he says. The city has just activated its Unified Victim Identification System. If somebody you know might have been involved in the incident, you can call 311 for more information. If you reside in the US but outside New York City, you can call 212-639-9675. A spokesperson for the New York State Education Department says students at several local schools are currently sheltering in place. The shooting took place in the Sunset Park neighbourhood of the city's Brooklyn borough. The search for a suspected gunman is ongoing. There is a huge police presence at the scene around 36th Street station. The shooting occurred during the morning rush hour. Commuters and locals are standing by, watching as officials secure the scene and transport the injured. New York Police are set to hold a news conference to provide more details on the incident and subsequent investigation. Eyewitness reports have begun to trickle in from people who were at the train station where the incident took place. One witness, identified only as Claire, was quoted by the New York Post as saying that she ""lost count"" of the amount of shots fired. She added that the suspect - who was reportedly wearing an orange vest and gas mask - dropped ""some kind of cylinder that sparked at the top"". Another witness, Sam Carcamo, told the AP news agency that his subway door ""opened into calamity"" at the station. ""It was smoke and blood and people screaming,"" he said, adding that he saw large amounts of smoke billowing from the train once the door opened. A local man, Danny Mastrogiorgio, told the AP that he had just dropped his son off at school when he saw wounded passengers running up the station staircase. At least two had leg injuries. ""It was insane,"" he said. Harry LowReporting from Brooklyn There are four police  helicopters overhead monitoring the situation.

Biggest squeeze for public sector pay in 20 yearsThe spending power of an average public sector salary has seen its biggest drop on record.,"Public sector pay for jobs such as NHS workers, teachers and civil servants fell further behind price rises in the three months to February, figures show. While wages rose for public sector workers, price rises outpaced them meaning a 3% drop in spending power, the biggest fall in 20 years. In contrast, an average private sector employee's wage bought 0.5% less. The latest inflation figures show the cost of living is rising at its fastest pace for 30 years. ""Basic pay is now falling noticeably in real terms,"" said Darren Morgan fromthe Office for National Statistics,externaldescribing the fall in spending power. The most recent figures show that inflation reached 6.2% in February and new data, due out on Wednesday, is expected to show a further rise in March. Tom Southern, a recruitment consultant from Macclesfield, says he and family are having to make cutbacks because of the rising cost of living. The 30-year-old says he recently moved jobs to get a better salary, but it still does not go far enough. ""We're not massively uncomfortable, we have a house and two cars. But it's the little cutbacks you have to make, it starts to add up."" The father of three says it costs Â£1.80 a litre to put diesel in the family car and their energy bill has gone from Â£69 to Â£268 a month. Their weekly shop at Aldi is up from Â£50-60 to Â£80-90. Tom and his partner, who is a midwife, also have loans to pay, childcare costs, and are getting married this month which is another bill to pay. ""I don't see myself as unfortunate, it's other people I feel sorry for,"" he says. ""I don't see how single parents or people on a low wage can make ends meet."" The ONS said the unemployment rate fell to 3.8% from 3.9% last month. Capital Economics said the fall in unemployment was mainly due to people taking themselves out of the workforce by retiring or by looking after family or long-term sick. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the number of people classed as inactive rose by 76,000 in the three month period. At the start of the week, the annualrise in benefits and the state pension came into force. The increase was 3.1%. Now official figures show the average wage is going up by 4%. In normal times, that sounds like a decent rise in income, but these are not normal times. Households are watching most things get more expensive. Prices are rising at over 6% a year and accelerating, outstripping the uplift in benefits and pay. Remember, the target rate for price increases in the economy, as measured by inflation, is 2%. That leaves policymakers with a headache. Either people continue to get worse off, increasing poverty and putting added strain on individuals and the welfare system. Or workers get big pay rises, which bosses can only pay for by putting up prices again - creating what is called an inflationary spiral. Targeted support for those in the most need is another option. Ultimately, it may be that everyone feels some short-term financial pain in the hope, and belief, that those prices rises slow to the 2% target as soon as possible. The number of job vacancies reached a fresh high of 1.29 million between January and March - a rise of 492,400 roles compared with the pre-pandemic first three months of 2020. The ONS said the highest rate of vacancies was in construction, which rose by 18.7% in the first three months of the year. Sectors such as hotels and food services, including restaurants, and entertainment saw job openings increase by 13.1%. However, there was a fall in demand for people in the gas and electricity sectors where vacancy rates dropped by 14%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures ""show the continued strength of our jobs market"", adding that the government was ""helping to cushion the impacts of global price rises through over Â£22bn of support for the cost of living this financial year"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the data shows that ""Conservative choices are leaving real wages squeezed and people worse off"". ""At a time like this, Rishi Sunak could have chosen a one-off windfall tax on huge oil and gas company profits to cut household energy bills by up to Â£600. ""Instead, he's decided to make Britain the only major economy to land working people with higher taxes in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis,"" he said. Molly Scott Cato, Green Party finance and economy spokesperson, said: ""Rather than a cost of living crisis we should see the perilous situation facing working people as a wages crisis. ""A Green government would introduce taxes on the wealthy and on pollution to fund decent pay rises so that all public service workers get a pay rise that at least matches the cost of living and begins to restore earnings lost over the last decade.""

Local officials in New York held a news conference on the Brooklyn subway shooting incident a short while ago. Here is what they told us:  Officials are expected to provide another update later on Tuesday. Images continue to emerge of the aftermath of the shooting incident in Brooklyn. A massive police presence remains, with cars and emergency response vehicles blocking 4th Avenue. Small crowds of local residents are also waiting outside police cordons. Police are expected to hold a news conference soon.

Several people shot in New York City subwayPolice are hunting a gunman in an orange construction vest and a gas mask - as undetonated explosives are found.,"This video can not be played Footage shows panicked crowds on NYC subway Seventeen people have been injured in a shooting during the morning rush hour at a New York City subway station. The unidentified attacker detonated a smoke bomb and opened fire at Brooklyn's 36th Street station at 08:30 local time (12:30 GMT). Images from the scene showed bloodied passengers lying on the floor of the smoke-filled station. Officials are appealing for information about the gunman, who fled the scene and is still at large. ""An individual donned a gas mask, he then opened fire striking multiple people on the subway and on the platform."" New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said. The attacker then fled wearing what Ms Sewell said was a green construction-type vest and a grey sweatshirt. ""This is not being investigated as an act of terrorism at this time,"" she added. Police have since tracked down a rental van they had been searching for in connection with the attack, according to the Associated Press, but the suspect wasn't there. Ten of those who are being treated for injuries were shot, while others suffered smoke inhalation as well as injuries sustained during the initial panic. Five people are in a critical but stable condition. None of the injured are believed to be in a life-threatening condition, police said. Officers are still working to establish a motive for the attack. WARNING: Graphic image below ""My subway door opened into calamity. It was smoke and blood and people screaming,"" eyewitness Sam Carcamo told the Associated Press. He added that a billow of smoke poured out of the train once its doors opened. Images shared on social media showed injured people inside the smoke-filled station Another witness, identified only as Claire, told the New York Post that she had ""lost count"" of the number of shots that were fired. The woman said she saw the suspect dropping ""some kind of cylinder that sparked at the top"" - initially believing him to be a subway worker because of the vest she said he was wearing. New York's fire department told the BBC it originally received a call about smoke inside the station. But officials arrived to find multiple people shot and injured. Initial police investigations into what happened may have been hampered by a failure in the station's surveillance system. ""At that particular station there appeared to be some form of malfunction with the camera system,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams later said. Responding to the attack, President Joe Biden expressed gratitude to ""all the first responders who jumped into action, including civilians who didn't hesitate to help their fellow passengers."" US cities have seen a troubling rise in gun violence incidents over the past two years. ""This insanity that is seizing our city has to stop,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said after the attack.

Pressure builds on Donbas as new Russian assault looms,"The US has announced an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine President Biden says the support will include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected ""wider assault"" in the east This comes after Ukraine's President Zelensky made another impassioned plea for heavy weaponry Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor Karim Khan says Ukraine is ""a crime scene"" He made the comments on a visit to the town of Bucha, where images of streets strewn with bodies shocked the world And a report from the OSCE says Russia carried out international human rights violations in Ukraine Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons, we are moving our live coverage. Please join usat the new webpage here. The Moskva, pictured in 2008 Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand. The statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship. ""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."" It did not specify the cause of the fire. But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board. The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to ""go to hell"", before they were ultimately taken prisoner. Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw
from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW,
Marie-Luise Wolff, has said. There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the
Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the
Russian side. It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders,but Kyiv had told him he was not
welcome due to his close ties with Russiaand his support for
the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to
Germany. ""We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from
Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an
ambitious timetable,"" Wolff said. Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy
supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022
growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in
Ukraine. In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever. ""Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever,"" he says. Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: ""All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. ""To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. ""Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."" He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: ""The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."" Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US military aid  'Crime scene' call  Mariupol latest  This is Nathan Williams and Gareth Evans in London handing over to our colleagues Jude Sheerin in Washington DC and Max Matza in Seattle. The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory. ""We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory,"" the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing. ""If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,"" it added. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month. As we reported earlier, war crimes prosecutors have been visiting the site of civilian killings in Bucha. Images of the town's streets strewn with bodies shocked the world earlier this month, and local officials say hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves. ""We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed,"" the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told reporters earlier. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,â Khan later wrote on Twitter. He also described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"". Khan has been pictured visiting the site of a mass burial in Bucha. A Ukrainian soldier mans a Howitzer for drills in Kharkiv in June 2021 The $800m worth of US weaponry pledged by President Biden on Wednesday to Ukraine includes artillery and radar systems that may require ""additional training"" for Ukrainian troops. ""The systems that will probably require some additional training for Ukrainian forces are the howitzers (and) ... the counter artillery radar,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The radar system, he said, is ""not a very difficult system to operate, but it's not one that they have in their inventory"". Howitzers are a type of relatively short-barrelled cannon, used to lob shells into enemy lines. According to the US Defense Department, the shipment will include 18 Howitzers along with 40,000 artillery rounds. It will also include hundreds of missiles and Switchblade drones - also known as kamikaze drones due to the way they can be flown into their target. The US is also sending 11 helicopters, hundreds of armoured vehicles, anti-personnel mines, body armour and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials. The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" he said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrisonrefused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to ""go to hell"". Earlier on Wednesday a fire was reported on the ship. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel. He said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Presidents Zelensky held talks with the presidents of Poland and the Baltic states The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become the latest world leaders to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. They also visited the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch said the aim of the trip was to show support to President Zelensky and the defenders of Ukraine ""in a decisive moment"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was ""hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-Century Europe"". The four presidents also met Ukrainan Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal during a visit to Borodyanka President Biden made the announcement after a phone call with President Zelensky The US is to send an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call between Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden. Biden said the support would include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected âwider assaultâ in the east of Ukraine. The package also includes helicopters and what Biden called ânew capabilitiesâ such as artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers. Senior US defence officials say the total military aid provided by the US now stands at more than $3bn. Biden has said the weaponry supplied so far has helped ensure the failure of Russiaâs initial war aims. But he added it was not the time to rest, saying: âI assured President Zelenskyy that the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people."" It is ""at least plausible"" to consider whether genocide could be an issue in relation to the war in Ukraine, according to a legal expert. As we have been reporting,US President Joe Biden has said there was evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops in Ukraine. This was the first time he used the word genocide - defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Philippe Sands QC said to prove ""genocidal intent"" was ""very difficult"" in court. But speaking on BBC Radio 4, the lawyer and University College London professor said: ""I understand why both President Zelensky and President Biden are now using this word, because this is wrongdoing on a scale that is so great that I think it is at least plausible to raise the genocide issue.â We have reports of more people being killed in Ukraine's north-eastern region of Kharkiv. At
least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in the past 24 hours, according to Kharkiv's governor Oleh Synegubov. He has also said thatUkrainian troops have shot down two Russian planesthat attacked the region. Kharkiv - which sits near the border - has been under attack since the start of the war. But unlike regions further to the west, which have seen Russian troops move away in recent days, it is still in the firing line. This is because of its position on the edge of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the area Russia hopes to take in its next offensive. The UN chief said there was more to be done to guarantee the safety of Ukrainian evacuees A potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appears unlikely at this stage, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said. He told reporters this afternoon: ""At the present moment a global ceasefire in Ukraine doesn't
seem possible."" Instead, he said the UN was focusing its efforts on supporting evacuees and boosting humanitarian aid. Guterres said the UN had made proposals to Russia to
""bring the parties together... to manage"" humanitarian access and the evacuation of civilians, but had not yet received a response from Moscow. ""There are lots of things that can be done in order to
guarantee evacuation of civilians,"" he said. Donetsk Regional Police have shared footage of the moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. This video can not be played War in Ukraine: The moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have just spoken by phone. They discussed additional defensive and
financial aid for Ukraine as well as tightening sanctions and alleged Russian
war crimes, Zelensky wrote on Twitter. It comes after the Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to repel Russian aggression. In an online English-language address, he said Ukraine needed heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech foreign
ministry says its diplomats have returned to the embassy in Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The
ministry tweeted a photo of three diplomats raising the Czech flag in front of
the building. In a statement,
the ministry said it was one of the many steps the country was taking to show its
support for Ukraine. It would always stand with Ukraine, it
said. The Czech
Republic has been one of the more muscular supporters of Ukraine as it defends
itself from Russian aggression. It was the first Nato or EU country to send tanks
to the country, while a crowd-funding effort organised by the Ukrainian Embassy
and the Czech Defence Ministry to buy weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces
has approached 1bn Czech koruna, (Â£34m, 41m euros).  Russia has shifted the focus of its invasion to eastern Ukraine after withdrawing forces from Kyiv and the north. And in recent days, Ukrainian officials have warned that it is preparing to launch a new offensive in the east targeting the Donbas region. This has led analysts to examine Russian military activity around eastern Ukraine more closely. These satellite images from Maxar show Russian military vehicles assembling just 8km (5 miles) from the border. Territory in the region has been seized back from Russian troops More than 100 civilians have been killed in the north-eastern Sumy region -
according to its military chief. Dmytro Zhyvytsky said many corpses were discovered with their
hands tied. Some showed signs of torture or gunshot wounds to the head. He alleged that invading Russian soldiers had ""fired on
everyone"", including the elderly and children. Many people from the city were missing or had been
captured, he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these claims. The discoveries in Sumy appear reminiscent of atrocities
uncovered in Bucha. Russia has repeatedly denied committing any war crimes
there. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court earlier
labelled Ukraine a ""crime scene"" after visiting Bucha. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Local officials in New York held a news conference on the Brooklyn subway shooting incident a short while ago. Here is what they told us:  Officials are expected to provide another update later on Tuesday. Images continue to emerge of the aftermath of the shooting incident in Brooklyn. A massive police presence remains, with cars and emergency response vehicles blocking 4th Avenue. Small crowds of local residents are also waiting outside police cordons. Police are expected to hold a news conference soon. Harry LowReporting from Brooklyn There was major interest for more detail on what happened earlier today in a Brooklyn subway station, as local and state officials gave a brief update on the situation. I saw at least one photographer's lens smash in the scramble to get prime position for the news conference.  The news conference in Brooklyn has just ended, with an update expected later in the day as the investigation continues. NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said that while the motive remains unclear, she is ""not ruling anything out"". Sewell added that the investigation is ongoing and remains in its very early stages. A total of 16 people were injured in the incident in Brooklyn, according to New York City fire commissioner Laura Kavanagh. Ten of the injured are suffering from gunshot wounds. Five of the injured are in a critical but stable condition at local hospitals. The injuries range from smoke inhalation to shrapnel wounds, Kavanagh said. The suspect remains on the loose and may be dangerous, New York Governor Kathy Hochul says. She warned New Yorkers to stay vigilant. ""Ordinary New Yorkers woke up in anticipation of a relatively normal day,"" she said. ""That sense of tranquility and normal was brutally disrupted."" Governor Hochul also said she will devote ""the full resources of our state"" to fighting crime in the city. ""This insanity that is seizing our city has to stop,"" she told reporters at the NYPD news conference. ""We say no more. No more mass shootings. No more disrupting lives."" The incident in Brooklyn is not being investigated as an act of terrorism, NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell has says. Sewell said that the suspect opened a canister in the subway before opening fire with a firearm. She confirmed he believed to be about 5'5, wearing a green construction-type vest and a grey sweat shirt. Sewell urged the public to come forward with any information or video evidence. The NYPD and city and state officials have just begun a press conference to update the public on the incident at a Brooklyn subway station. CBS New York reports that victims of the Tuesday morning shooting have been taken to at least three hospitals in Brooklyn. Eight people are being treated at NYU Langone, five are at the Maimonides Medical Center and three others are at New York Presbyterian. New York's fire department has confirmed at least 16 people have been hurt in Tuesday's incident. That includes at least eight people who were shot. Some of the victims are being treated for smoke inhalation. This video can not be played Video recorded by Eamon Loingsigh. Emergency services rush to the scene of a shooting in Brooklyn subway station. Sirens are heard as the vehicles speed up the street in the Sunset Park neighbourhood. Harry LowReporting from Brooklyn Erik Frankel runs a nearby business selling footwear to police officers. He says it's hard to grasp the ""historical context of just how bad this [area] used to be"". His father would wear  a bullet proof vest to work, he said. ""Right now, this is probably the safest block on Brooklyn with the amount of police here,"" he says. The city has just activated its Unified Victim Identification System. If somebody you know might have been involved in the incident, you can call 311 for more information. If you reside in the US but outside New York City, you can call 212-639-9675. A spokesperson for the New York State Education Department says students at several local schools are currently sheltering in place. The shooting took place in the Sunset Park neighbourhood of the city's Brooklyn borough. The search for a suspected gunman is ongoing. There is a huge police presence at the scene around 36th Street station. The shooting occurred during the morning rush hour. Commuters and locals are standing by, watching as officials secure the scene and transport the injured. New York Police are set to hold a news conference to provide more details on the incident and subsequent investigation. Eyewitness reports have begun to trickle in from people who were at the train station where the incident took place. One witness, identified only as Claire, was quoted by the New York Post as saying that she ""lost count"" of the amount of shots fired. She added that the suspect - who was reportedly wearing an orange vest and gas mask - dropped ""some kind of cylinder that sparked at the top"". Another witness, Sam Carcamo, told the AP news agency that his subway door ""opened into calamity"" at the station. ""It was smoke and blood and people screaming,"" he said, adding that he saw large amounts of smoke billowing from the train once the door opened. A local man, Danny Mastrogiorgio, told the AP that he had just dropped his son off at school when he saw wounded passengers running up the station staircase. At least two had leg injuries. ""It was insane,"" he said. Harry LowReporting from Brooklyn There are four police  helicopters overhead monitoring the situation. What was a rainy morning has broken out into a sunny midday - although that's of little comfort  to those caught up in this. Â© 2025 BBC.

Multiple people shot in New York City subwayPolice are hunting a gunman in orange construction vest and gas mask - as undetonated explosives are found.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Footage shows panicked crowds on NYC subway Seventeen people have been injured in a shooting during the morning rush hour at a New York City subway station. The unidentified attacker detonated a smoke bomb and opened fire at Brooklyn's 36th Street station at 08:30 local time (12:30 GMT). Images from the scene showed bloodied passengers lying on the floor of the smoke-filled station. Officials are appealing for information about the gunman, who fled the scene and is still at large. ""An individual donned a gas mask, he then opened fire striking multiple people on the subway and on the platform."" New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said. The attacker then fled wearing what Ms Sewell said was a green construction-type vest and a grey sweatshirt. ""This is not being investigated as an act of terrorism at this time,"" she added. Police have since tracked down a rental van they had been searching for in connection with the attack, according to the Associated Press, but the suspect wasn't there. Ten of those who are being treated for injuries were shot, while others suffered smoke inhalation as well as injuries sustained during the initial panic. Five people are in a critical but stable condition. None of the injured are believed to be in a life-threatening condition, police said. Officers are still working to establish a motive for the attack. WARNING: Graphic image below ""My subway door opened into calamity.

The woman said she saw the suspect dropping ""some kind of cylinder that sparked at the top"" - initially believing him to be a subway worker because of the vest she said he was wearing. New York's fire department told the BBC it originally received a call about smoke inside the station. But officials arrived to find multiple people shot and injured. Initial police investigations into what happened may have been hampered by a failure in the station's surveillance system. ""At that particular station there appeared to be some form of malfunction with the camera system,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams later said. Responding to the attack, President Joe Biden expressed gratitude to ""all the first responders who jumped into action, including civilians who didn't hesitate to help their fellow passengers.""

The Moskva, pictured in 2008 Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand. The statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship. ""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."" It did not specify the cause of the fire. But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board. The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to ""go to hell"", before they were ultimately taken prisoner. Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw
from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW,
Marie-Luise Wolff, has said. There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the
Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the
Russian side. It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders,but Kyiv had told him he was not
welcome due to his close ties with Russiaand his support for
the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to
Germany. ""We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from
Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an
ambitious timetable,"" Wolff said. Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy
supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022
growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in
Ukraine. In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever. ""Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever,"" he says. Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: ""All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. ""To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. ""Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."" He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: ""The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."" Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US military aid  'Crime scene' call  Mariupol latest  This is Nathan Williams and Gareth Evans in London handing over to our colleagues Jude Sheerin in Washington DC and Max Matza in Seattle. The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory. ""We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory,"" the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing. ""If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,"" it added. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month. As we reported earlier, war crimes prosecutors have been visiting the site of civilian killings in Bucha. Images of the town's streets strewn with bodies shocked the world earlier this month, and local officials say hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves. ""We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed,"" the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told reporters earlier. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,â Khan later wrote on Twitter. He also described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"". Khan has been pictured visiting the site of a mass burial in Bucha. A Ukrainian soldier mans a Howitzer for drills in Kharkiv in June 2021 The $800m worth of US weaponry pledged by President Biden on Wednesday to Ukraine includes artillery and radar systems that may require ""additional training"" for Ukrainian troops. ""The systems that will probably require some additional training for Ukrainian forces are the howitzers (and) ... the counter artillery radar,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The radar system, he said, is ""not a very difficult system to operate, but it's not one that they have in their inventory"". Howitzers are a type of relatively short-barrelled cannon, used to lob shells into enemy lines. According to the US Defense Department, the shipment will include 18 Howitzers along with 40,000 artillery rounds. It will also include hundreds of missiles and Switchblade drones - also known as kamikaze drones due to the way they can be flown into their target. The US is also sending 11 helicopters, hundreds of armoured vehicles, anti-personnel mines, body armour and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials. The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" he said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrisonrefused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to ""go to hell"". Earlier on Wednesday a fire was reported on the ship. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel. He said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Presidents Zelensky held talks with the presidents of Poland and the Baltic states The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become the latest world leaders to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. They also visited the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch said the aim of the trip was to show support to President Zelensky and the defenders of Ukraine ""in a decisive moment"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was ""hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-Century Europe"". The four presidents also met Ukrainan Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal during a visit to Borodyanka President Biden made the announcement after a phone call with President Zelensky The US is to send an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call between Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden. Biden said the support would include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected âwider assaultâ in the east of Ukraine. The package also includes helicopters and what Biden called ânew capabilitiesâ such as artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers. Senior US defence officials say the total military aid provided by the US now stands at more than $3bn. Biden has said the weaponry supplied so far has helped ensure the failure of Russiaâs initial war aims. But he added it was not the time to rest, saying: âI assured President Zelenskyy that the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people."" It is ""at least plausible"" to consider whether genocide could be an issue in relation to the war in Ukraine, according to a legal expert. As we have been reporting,US President Joe Biden has said there was evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops in Ukraine. This was the first time he used the word genocide - defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Philippe Sands QC said to prove ""genocidal intent"" was ""very difficult"" in court. But speaking on BBC Radio 4, the lawyer and University College London professor said: ""I understand why both President Zelensky and President Biden are now using this word, because this is wrongdoing on a scale that is so great that I think it is at least plausible to raise the genocide issue.â We have reports of more people being killed in Ukraine's north-eastern region of Kharkiv. At
least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in the past 24 hours, according to Kharkiv's governor Oleh Synegubov. He has also said thatUkrainian troops have shot down two Russian planesthat attacked the region. Kharkiv - which sits near the border - has been under attack since the start of the war. But unlike regions further to the west, which have seen Russian troops move away in recent days, it is still in the firing line. This is because of its position on the edge of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the area Russia hopes to take in its next offensive. The UN chief said there was more to be done to guarantee the safety of Ukrainian evacuees A potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appears unlikely at this stage, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said. He told reporters this afternoon: ""At the present moment a global ceasefire in Ukraine doesn't
seem possible."" Instead, he said the UN was focusing its efforts on supporting evacuees and boosting humanitarian aid. Guterres said the UN had made proposals to Russia to
""bring the parties together... to manage"" humanitarian access and the evacuation of civilians, but had not yet received a response from Moscow. ""There are lots of things that can be done in order to
guarantee evacuation of civilians,"" he said. Donetsk Regional Police have shared footage of the moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. This video can not be played War in Ukraine: The moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have just spoken by phone. They discussed additional defensive and
financial aid for Ukraine as well as tightening sanctions and alleged Russian
war crimes, Zelensky wrote on Twitter. It comes after the Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to repel Russian aggression. In an online English-language address, he said Ukraine needed heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech foreign
ministry says its diplomats have returned to the embassy in Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The
ministry tweeted a photo of three diplomats raising the Czech flag in front of
the building. In a statement,
the ministry said it was one of the many steps the country was taking to show its
support for Ukraine. It would always stand with Ukraine, it
said. The Czech
Republic has been one of the more muscular supporters of Ukraine as it defends
itself from Russian aggression. It was the first Nato or EU country to send tanks
to the country, while a crowd-funding effort organised by the Ukrainian Embassy
and the Czech Defence Ministry to buy weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces
has approached 1bn Czech koruna, (Â£34m, 41m euros).  Russia has shifted the focus of its invasion to eastern Ukraine after withdrawing forces from Kyiv and the north. And in recent days, Ukrainian officials have warned that it is preparing to launch a new offensive in the east targeting the Donbas region. This has led analysts to examine Russian military activity around eastern Ukraine more closely. These satellite images from Maxar show Russian military vehicles assembling just 8km (5 miles) from the border. Territory in the region has been seized back from Russian troops More than 100 civilians have been killed in the north-eastern Sumy region -
according to its military chief. Dmytro Zhyvytsky said many corpses were discovered with their
hands tied. Some showed signs of torture or gunshot wounds to the head. He alleged that invading Russian soldiers had ""fired on
everyone"", including the elderly and children. Many people from the city were missing or had been
captured, he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these claims. The discoveries in Sumy appear reminiscent of atrocities
uncovered in Bucha. Russia has repeatedly denied committing any war crimes
there. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court earlier
labelled Ukraine a ""crime scene"" after visiting Bucha. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Local officials in New York held a news conference on the Brooklyn subway shooting incident a short while ago. Here is what they told us:  Officials are expected to provide another update later on Tuesday. Images continue to emerge of the aftermath of the shooting incident in Brooklyn. A massive police presence remains, with cars and emergency response vehicles blocking 4th Avenue. Small crowds of local residents are also waiting outside police cordons. Police are expected to hold a news conference soon. Harry LowReporting from Brooklyn There was major interest for more detail on what happened earlier today in a Brooklyn subway station, as local and state officials gave a brief update on the situation. I saw at least one photographer's lens smash in the scramble to get prime position for the news conference.  The news conference in Brooklyn has just ended, with an update expected later in the day as the investigation continues. NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said that while the motive remains unclear, she is ""not ruling anything out"". Sewell added that the investigation is ongoing and remains in its very early stages. A total of 16 people were injured in the incident in Brooklyn, according to New York City fire commissioner Laura Kavanagh. Ten of the injured are suffering from gunshot wounds. Five of the injured are in a critical but stable condition at local hospitals. The injuries range from smoke inhalation to shrapnel wounds, Kavanagh said. The suspect remains on the loose and may be dangerous, New York Governor Kathy Hochul says. She warned New Yorkers to stay vigilant. ""Ordinary New Yorkers woke up in anticipation of a relatively normal day,"" she said. ""That sense of tranquility and normal was brutally disrupted."" Governor Hochul also said she will devote ""the full resources of our state"" to fighting crime in the city. ""This insanity that is seizing our city has to stop,"" she told reporters at the NYPD news conference. ""We say no more. No more mass shootings. No more disrupting lives."" The incident in Brooklyn is not being investigated as an act of terrorism, NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell has says. Sewell said that the suspect opened a canister in the subway before opening fire with a firearm. She confirmed he believed to be about 5'5, wearing a green construction-type vest and a grey sweat shirt. Sewell urged the public to come forward with any information or video evidence. The NYPD and city and state officials have just begun a press conference to update the public on the incident at a Brooklyn subway station. CBS New York reports that victims of the Tuesday morning shooting have been taken to at least three hospitals in Brooklyn. Eight people are being treated at NYU Langone, five are at the Maimonides Medical Center and three others are at New York Presbyterian.

As ever, you can find full stories and analysis on our politics page -here. Goodnight. That's it from us on this subject for today. Events took a dramatic turn just after lunchtime, when it was confirmed that the prime minister and chancellor had breached Covid regulations. Here's what we learned: The event:  The apologies:  The reaction: Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Can lawmakers get away with being lawbreakers? The PM faced the cameras again today to apologise for breaking lockdown laws, while insisting it did not occur to him at the time that he was doing anything wrong. ""But, of course,"" he added, ""the police have found otherwise and I fully respect the outcome of their investigation."" He tried to sound contrite, saying people had a right to expect better from their prime minister. But he made it clear he will not be resigning, telling reporters he intended to ""get on with the job"". Will this be enough to save his skin? Read more from Chris here. More senior Conservative MPs are tweeting their backing for Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak a few hours after the fines for breaching lockdown rules were announced. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says,external: ""It was right for the police to take breaches in No10 seriously and for the PM to apologise.

He and the Chancellor are leading our country through huge challenges & they continue to have my full support."" Transport secretary Grant Shapps says,externalas he was unable to visit his dad in hospital for four months in 2020 he shares the anger felt about the fines. But he adds: ""I also recognise PM has apologised, accepted responsibility & reformed No10. Now, as he leads the West's response to Putin's evil war he has my full support."" AndDowning Street chief of staff Steve Barclay says,external: ""The Prime Minister has apologised to the public and brought about the changes in No10 that he promised. 

Both the PM and the Chancellor have my full support as we continue to focus on the priorities of the British people."" A woman who lost her mother to Covid-19 says the issuing of a fine to Boris Johnson shows he has broken Covid laws and is unfit to lead the country. Jackie Green, from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, says the prime minister is ""completely untrustworthy and devoid of any integrity"". Green, whose mother died in December 2020 on the same day as one of the alleged Downing Street parties, adds Johnson should ""do the decent thing for once"" and resign. Watch what she has to say below: This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak has issued an ""unreserved apology"" after confirming he received a lockdown fine for attending the Downing Street gathering on 19 June 2020. He says: ""I understand that for figures in public office the rules must be applied stringently in order to maintain public confidence. I respect the decision that has been made and have paid the fine. ""I know people sacrificed a great deal during Covid and they will find this situation upsetting. I deeply regret the frustration and anger caused and I am sorry. ""Like the prime minister, I am focused on delivering for the British people at this challenging time.""  Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner says the absence of any statement from Rishi Sunak about his fine for breaching his own government's lockdown regulations is ""bizarre"". Highlighting the criticism Sunak has faced over his wife's non-domiciled tax status, she tells the PA news agency: ""After a week of torrid headlines for the chancellor, you would think he might have something to say to the British public."" She repeats Labour's call for him to resign, saying he broke the law while ""people made huge sacrifices and followed the rules"". The short answer is, we don't know. But we can give you a longer answer by telling you what we've heard from a barrister who has thrown out some ballpark figures. Speaking to the BBC, Adam Wagner says: ""If you organise a gathering for over 30 people in a public place or in a private dwelling you can be on the hook for Â£10,000. ""If you attend one of those gatherings it can be Â£850."" He says the more likely amount in the prime minister and chancellor's case is a fine between Â£60 and Â£200. However, an individual can get more than one fine - and the amount doubles for each fixed-penalty notice received. So if Johnson was issued with six fines he could be asked to pay over Â£10,000, Wagner says. Boris Johnson's fine is over a party held at No 10 to celebrate his 56th birthday on 19 June 2020, when indoor gatherings of more than two people were banned. ""There was a brief gathering in the Cabinet Room shortly after 2pm, lasting less than 10 minutes, during which people I worked with passed on their good wishes,"" he said this evening. Three months before that birthday, in the early days of the pandemic, the PM was sent a letter by a girl named Josephine who wanted to let him know she was postponing her seventh birthday party and ""staying at home because you asked us to"". Johnson wrote back to Josephine saying: ""We have all got to do our bit to protect the NHS and save lives and that is exactly what you are doing, so well done."" The prime minister tweeted both letters at the time, adding: ""Josephine sets a great example to us all by postponing her birthday party until we have sent coronavirus packing.""

A flurry of cabinet ministers have posted on Twitter in support of the prime minister and chancellor in the last half hour, about five hours after their fines for breaching lockdown rules were first made public. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says,externalJohnson has ""apologised and taken responsibility for what happened in Downing Street"", while he and the chancellor are ""delivering for Britain on many fronts including the international security crisis we face"". Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, says,externalJohnson and Sunak ""made the right calls on the big issues"", adding: ""Lessons have been learnt and now our focus must be on the huge global challenges we all face."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey says,externalit is important for the country that the PM and chancellor ""get on with the job the country elected them to do"". Members of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Group, pictured at the national memorial wall A group of families bereaved in the pandemic have justshared a letter they sent,externalBoris Johnson earlier today, when it emerged he had been issued with a fine. It says they all obeyed rules that meant they couldn't hold the hands of loved ones as they passed away or comfort each other, because they wanted to protect others from the same pain. ""You on the other hand did not. You broke those laws intended to keep us safe. You trampled on the sacrifices we and all the British public made,"" the letter from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group says. ""You have paid a fine. Our loved ones paid with their lives."" The group asks if a new variant emerges that requires fresh public health measures, will Johnson have the ""moral authority"" to impose them? It calls on the PM to ""go now"". The chancellor's deputy, Chief Secretary of the Treasury Simon Clarke, is the latest minister to speak out in ""full support"" of his boss and the prime minister after their fines for lockdown breaches. ""Their efforts during the pandemic have ensured the UK is now free of restrictions and avoided economic catastrophe. ""I for one am grateful to them for everything they have done for our country,"" he said. He said the PM has apologised and accepted the police decision, and has instituted a ""comprehensive programme of reform in No 10"", so it was time to ""get on with the job of governing"". Scottish Secretary Alister Jack also backed the PM, saying he ""remains the right person to lead this country"". So far, we've still heard no response about the fines from the chancellor, who has been under pressure for weeks after questions about his wife's business links to Russia and tax affairs. This video can not be played If you're just catching up, here's a video clip of Boris Johnson's statement about breaching his own lockdown rules. As we've already reported, he confirms he has paid his fine and says he is sorry. Danny Shaw, a former BBC home affairs correspondent who is now a commentor on crime and policing, points outthe fixed penalty notices appear to be issued by the police in chronological order,external. He notes one of the first batch of people to receive notice of a fine was former government ethics chief Helen McNamara, reportedly for attending a leaving do on 18 June 2020. Boris Johnson has been fined for his birthday party on 19 June 2020, we've learned today. Shaw says the 30 fixed penalty referrals announced today correspond with the number of people who reportedly attended the birthday party. ""There are 10 other gatherings under police investigation. Fifty other people were sent questionnaires. Fines will keep on coming - for weeks,"" he concludes. When stories first started emerging about parties in Downing Street, Boris Johnson insisted all guidance was followed. After reading his statement, he is asked if he lied. The prime minister says he said what he did in ""completely good faith"". ""It didn't occur to me that I was in breach of the rules."" ""I now humbly accept that I was."" Asked if he will now resign, Boris Johnson repeats his apology and his desire to ""get on with the job"". On the subject of further fines, he says he takes ""full responsibility for everything"" but adds that Downing Street is 15,000 square feet and has hundreds of officials working there. ""I couldn't be everywhere at once,"" he says. He adds that operations in Downing Street have since been ""radically transformed"". In his statement, which he read out to reporters, Boris Johnson confirms he has paid the fine issued to him by the Metropolitan Police - but does not say how much it was. He says it was given to him because, on 19 June 2020, colleagues had gathered to wish him a happy birthday. According to ITV News, up to 30 people attended and were served cake. At the time, gatherings of more than two people inside were banned by law. An exception was allowed if the gathering ""was reasonably necessary"" for work purposes. But because the PM has been fined, it is clear the police have not deemed the gathering as necessary. Boris Johnson continues: ""I understand the anger many will feel that I myself fell short when it came to observing the very rules which the government I lead had introduced to protect the public. ""I accept in all sincerity that people had the right to
expect better."" He says he now feels a sense of duty ""to deliver on the priorities of
the British people"" which he says includes ""ensuring Putin fails in Ukraine and easing the
burden on families caused by higher energy prices"". ""I will take forward that task with due humility."" Boris Johnson has now given a statement. He says: ""Today I've received a fixed penalty notice from the Metropolitan police relating to a Downing Street Event on 19 June 2020. ""Let me say immediately, I have paid the fine and want to offer a full apology."" Going through the events of that day, he says: ""There was a brief gathering in the Cabinet Room shortly after 2pm, lasting less than 10 minutes, during which people I worked with passed on their good wishes. ""At that time it did not occur to me this might have been a breach of the rules. ""The police have found otherwise and I fully respect the outcome of their investigation."" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries defends the prime minister, calling Boris Johnson's lockdown birthday party a ""brief gathering"". Dorries tweets that the PM ""has been clear"" about events on 19 June 2020 and already offered a full apology. She says: ""It was a brief gathering in the Cabinet Room, less than 10 minutes during a busy working day."" Defending his position as prime minister, she adds: ""PM is at his best when delivering on the priorities of the British people which he will continue to do."" Dorries, a loyal supporter of Johnson, is believed to be the first cabinet minister to publicly comment on the fines. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hidden wealth of one of Putinâs 'inner circle' revealedWhy desperate mother wrote details on toddler's backVideoVideoOur parents wouldnât leave Bucha, then Russia moved inWhy is Russia losing so many tanks in Ukraine?","Leaked documents seen by BBC News show how a sanctioned oligarch from Putin's ""inner circle"" hid his wealth. They reveal how a Swiss tattoo artist was falsely named as owner of a company that transferred over $300m (Â£230m) to firms linked to Suleiman Kerimov. They also show how $700m of transactions - and the secret ownership of luxury properties - went undetected. The investigation exposes failures of the banking system and the obstacles impeding Western sanctions. As part of the Pandora Papers Russia project, an investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the BBC has discovered evidence that: Transactions worth $700m linked to Suleiman Kerimov and his closest business associates were reported as suspicious by banks between 2010 and 2015 Swiss accountant Alexander Studhalter posed as owner of properties actually owned by Mr Kerimov Mr Kerimov was the secret owner of properties on the French Riviera and in London, including the most expensive terraced property ever sold in the UK Tom Keatinge, director of theCentre for Financial Crime and Security Studies,externalat the defence think tank RUSI, said the oligarchs Western countries are trying to sanction have many of these shell companies. ""That just shows you how big a challenge we are going to have  in genuinely enforcing the sanctions against oligarchs - beyond just seizing their yachts and houses in Belgravia."" Suleiman Kerimov appeared in February with a dozen other billionaires alongside President Putin, as Russian tanks crossed into Ukraine. He has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 ""for being an official of the government of the Russian Federation"" having served as a member of both the lower and upper houses of parliament. He was sanctioned by the UK government on 15 March this year, as well as by the EU, which said he was ""a member of the inner circle of oligarchs"" close to Putin. Suleiman Kerimov (Left), and Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, 2019 Mr Kerimov rose from humble origins as a Soviet era economist to become one of Russia's richest and best-connected oligarchs. He made his fortune buying up energy assets and major stakes in Russian banks after the fall of the Soviet Union. He reportedly made $21bn investing in the giant gas company Gazprom - and Sberbank, the biggest state bank. In November 2006, he almost died from injuries sustained in an accident in southern France. He skidded off Nice's Promenade des Anglais in a $650,000 Ferrari Enzo, which burst into flames. Mr Kerimov and his female passenger were pulled from the wreckage. Wreck of Kerimov's Ferrari Our investigation of Mr Kerimov exposes the failure of the international banking system to identify who was behind hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions which banks identified as suspect. Mr Kerimov is among more than 4,000 Russians whose names appear in data obtained by the ICIJ and examined as part of Pandora Papers Russia - a new investigation by ICIJ and global partners to shed light on covert financial transactions linked to the oligarchs and others close to the Kremlin in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A simple guide to the Pandora Papers Corporate records show how fake owners were used to heighten secrecy and that banks did not know exactly who was behind big US dollar transactions. That throws into doubt the ability of governments to identify and seize the assets of those they are targeting in the aftermath of the invasion. ""We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,"" US President Joe Biden pledged in his annual State of the Union speech. The US has announced a major intergovernmental programme to identify oligarch assets. But that won't be easy, as the Kerimov case highlights. Experts say Western countries have a lot of work to do because, for years, they have taken a lax approach to the fight against dirty money and failed to hold banks to account. ""They are going to have to play a lot of catch-up if they want to follow through with this,"" said Julia Friedlander, a former US Treasury Department sanctions adviser now with the Atlantic Council think tank. These are the key new findings relating to Suleiman Kerimov. A secret French court document - seen by the BBC - reveals how the oligarch is alleged to have hidden his wealth behind one of his closest associates. Mr Kerimov was arrested in November 2017 in France on suspicion of laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. The case against him related to the purchase of a string of luxury properties in the French Riviera between 2006 and 2010. Suleiman Kerimov outside the appeal court of Aix-en-Provence, France, 2017 It focused on Villa Hier in Cap d'Antibes, a luxurious property once used as a filming location for the 1988 film Dirty, Rotten Scoundrels. It had been sold to a Swiss company called Swiru Holding AG in 2008 for â¬35m (Â£29.3m) - but investigators discovered hidden payments showing tax had been evaded on the real purchase price of â¬127m. Villa Hier in Antibes, France Alexander Studhalter, a Swiss accountant and businessman was also arrested. He claimed to be the owner of Swiru Holding and of four villas, but French investigators believed they were really owned by the Russian oligarch. They believed Mr Studhalter was a false beneficial owner, or straw man, for Mr Kerimov - but criminal cases against both men were halted, with indictments against them being cancelled by a French appeal court. In 2020, Swiru Holding accepted its involvement in evading the tax and was fined â¬1.4m and made to pay another â¬10.3m to settle the case. Mr Kerimov's lawyer put out a statement saying that the French courts had ""officially dismissed the allegations made by the former Nice Prosecutor against Suleiman Kerimov of having carried out money-laundering operations."" Mr Studhalter maintains he was ""never the straw man for my Russian friend"". But according to the leaked French court document, seen by the BBC, this is not true. At a secret hearing in June 2018, judges laid out evidence collected by the investigating magistrate, which concluded: ""the effective and exclusive beneficiary of the villas is Mr Kerimov and his family."" The evidence included records from three banks - including documents apparently signed by Mr Studhalter, Mr Kerimov and his nephew Nariman Gadzhiev - stating that Mr Kerimov and his nephew were the true owners of Swiru Holding. In response, the court recorded, Mr Studhalter claimed the ""documents held by the bank and signed by Suleyman Kerimov or Nariman Gadzhievâ¦ were forgeries"". In response to questions from the BBC and ICIJ partners, Mr Studhalter claimed the same bank employee had forged documents at two banks, but said he didn't know why. Mr Studhalter also said: ""I was the sole beneficial owner of Swiru Holding AG from its foundation until I sold the company in 2019, as confirmed by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration and a court in France."" Mr Kerimov's French lawyers said: ""After several years of investigation, no charges were brought against our client."" Mr Studhalter says the four villas in France have now been sold. Official records in France show the ultimate beneficial owner of the companies that own them is Mr Kerimov's daughter. France was not the only country where Mr Kerimov used Swiru Holding to conduct secret financial transactions. Our investigation has discovered that - at the same time the Russian billionaire was buying up properties in the south of France - he was building another secret property empire in London. One Cornwall Terrace is a luxury four-storey mansion at the end of a row of terraced houses overlooking Regent's Park in London. The home is connected to half an acre of landscaped grounds, with a grand double staircase leading on to an imposing courtyard. One Cornwall Terrace, London It hit the headlines in 2013 when its sale for a reported Â£80m made it one of the most expensive terraced properties ever sold in the UK. In October last year, documents from the Pandora Papers financial leak revealed it was one of two adjacent properties purchased by the ruling family of Qatar. Pandora Papers: Qatar ruling family avoided Â£18.5m tax on London super-mansion But the documents show it was bought for Â£21m in 2005 by an offshore company owned by Swiru Holding, the same company that bank documents in France showed was owned by Mr Kerimov. Following the successful launch of Mr Kerimov's company Polyus Gold - Russia's largest producer of gold - on the London stock exchange in 2007, One Cornwall Terrace benefitted from a lavish restoration. The work carried out between 2008 to 2013 was a bonanza for London's architects, interior designers, and landscape gardeners. The renovation cost Â£30m, according to architects working on the project and included the addition of a ""state-of-art swimming pool and spa to the basement"", while the garden renovation was ""inspired by Piazza dell'Anfiteatro in Lucca, Italy"". But, while references were made to a ""a private Russian client"", Mr Kerimov's ownership of the property was hidden behind layers of offshore secrecy. The financial activities of the company secretly owned by Mr Kerimov were not limited to the property market. Documents from the Pandora Papers show Swiru Holding at the centre of a web of companies involved in transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars linked to the oligarch. In one case, leaked corporate records reveal a nominee shareholder - someone who owns shares for the benefit of another person - was falsely named as the true owner of a company involved in over $300m of money transfers. Renato Coppo is a tattoo artist in the picturesque Swiss city of Lucerne with a love of ""Asian art"" and ""many years of professional experience in the field of tattooing"". His studio is in the same city as the offices of the accountant and businessman Alexander Studhalter. Tattoo artist Renato Coppo According to documents dated 2016 - one signed by Mr Studhalter - Mr Coppo was also the beneficial owner of Fletcher Ventures, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, but administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The tattoo artist's company Fletcher Ventures was involved in huge transactions. In 2013, the company transferred $100m to a firm called LT Trading Ltd. It was one of a number of transactions by Fletcher Ventures that set off alarm bells at US bank BNY Mellon. The bank filed a suspicious activity report with the US Treasury, which traced Fletcher Ventures to Switzerland. Renato Coppo was not identified and the bank could not identify exactly where the money was going. The bank's ""internet research"" traced LT Trading to a UK address. Bank officials noted the UK company specialised ""in the sale of fruits and vegetables"". It was ""suspicious"" they concluded ""because it appears to be inconsistent with the purported line of business of LT Trading Limited"". In fact, the bank had identified a firm of the same name in the wrong country. Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers show LT Trading had no connection to the British produce company of the same name. The beneficial owner of LT Trading named in corporate records was Mr Kerimov's nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Like Fletcher Ventures, the company was administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The transaction was just one in a series of wire transfers carried out from 2010 to 2015 totalling $700m reported to US authorities as suspicious and where bank officials failed to identify links to the Russian oligarch. The filings were found in a cache of secret reports obtained by the ICIJ for the FinCEN Files investigation in 2020. FinCEN Files: All you need to know about the documents leak Leaked records also show that in 2013, Fletcher Ventures sent $202m to LLC Gilia in Moscow, a company with links to a Kerimov investment company. Bank officials were unable to identify who was behind the Russian firm. BNY Mellon says it is forbidden to comment on its secret intelligence filings but that it fully complies with relevant laws and regulations. When approached last year about Fletcher Ventures and his company's multi-million dollar transactions Mr Coppo refused to answer questions and referred journalists working with the BBC and ICIJ to Mr Studhalter. Despite signing a document saying Mr Coppo was the beneficial owner, Mr Studhalter said he had signed it by mistake and produced other records stating that he, not Mr Coppo, was the true owner of Fletcher Ventures. Mr Coppo did not respond to our questions. Fletcher Ventures is not the only company for which Mr Studhalter disputes the paperwork. A leaked document shows Fren Global Corp extended loans worth around $3bn to a company linked to Mr Kerimov and his family that owned shares in Polyus Gold. According to documents signed by Mr Studhalter, he was the beneficial owner of Fren Global Corp. But Mr Studhalter says he sold Fren Global Corp in 2014 ""as a shell company without assets"" to Nariman Gadzhiev, Kerimov's nephew. When asked about the matter, Studhalter claimed not to recognise what he described as a ""distorted electronic signature"" on the document he was shown. Other assets attributed to Swiru Holding and believed to have been owned by Mr Kerimov include a custom-built Boeing 737 and a super-yacht, last valued at $150m. Mr Studhalter says he, not Mr Kerimov was the real owner. Mr Kerimov did not respond to requests to comment apart from in relation to the French investigation. Mr Gadzhiev did not respond to the letter sent him by the BBC. On 8 April, theEU imposed sanctions,externalon Mr Kerimov's son Said Kerimov, who has stood down from the board of Polyus Gold.The revelation that his daughter now owns the French villas may make the properties the target of sanctions in France. And in a statement last week, the French prosecutor in Nice responsible for the cases for which Mr Kerimov and Mr Studhalter were formally indicted, drew our attention ""to the fact that the procedure remains in progress"". In other words it is still an open case. Additional reporting by Will Dahlgreen and Anthony Reuben LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine WAR CRIMES:Are atrocities part of a strategy?

Biggest squeeze for public sector pay in 20 yearsThe spending power of an average public sector salary has seen its biggest drop on record.Business,"Public sector pay for jobs such as NHS workers, teachers and civil servants fell further behind price rises in the three months to February, figures show. While wages rose for public sector workers, price rises outpaced them meaning a 3% drop in spending power, the biggest fall in 20 years. In contrast, an average private sector employee's wage bought 0.5% less. The latest inflation figures show the cost of living is rising at its fastest pace for 30 years. ""Basic pay is now falling noticeably in real terms,"" said Darren Morgan fromthe Office for National Statistics,externaldescribing the fall in spending power. The most recent figures show that inflation reached 6.2% in February and new data, due out on Wednesday, is expected to show a further rise in March. Tom Southern, a recruitment consultant from Macclesfield, says he and family are having to make cutbacks because of the rising cost of living. The 30-year-old says he recently moved jobs to get a better salary, but it still does not go far enough. ""We're not massively uncomfortable, we have a house and two cars. But it's the little cutbacks you have to make, it starts to add up."" The father of three says it costs Â£1.80 a litre to put diesel in the family car and their energy bill has gone from Â£69 to Â£268 a month. Their weekly shop at Aldi is up from Â£50-60 to Â£80-90. Tom and his partner, who is a midwife, also have loans to pay, childcare costs, and are getting married this month which is another bill to pay. ""I don't see myself as unfortunate, it's other people I feel sorry for,"" he says. ""I don't see how single parents or people on a low wage can make ends meet."" The ONS said the unemployment rate fell to 3.8% from 3.9% last month. Capital Economics said the fall in unemployment was mainly due to people taking themselves out of the workforce by retiring or by looking after family or long-term sick. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the number of people classed as inactive rose by 76,000 in the three month period. At the start of the week, the annualrise in benefits and the state pension came into force. The increase was 3.1%. Now official figures show the average wage is going up by 4%. In normal times, that sounds like a decent rise in income, but these are not normal times. Households are watching most things get more expensive. Prices are rising at over 6% a year and accelerating, outstripping the uplift in benefits and pay. Remember, the target rate for price increases in the economy, as measured by inflation, is 2%. That leaves policymakers with a headache. Either people continue to get worse off, increasing poverty and putting added strain on individuals and the welfare system. Or workers get big pay rises, which bosses can only pay for by putting up prices again - creating what is called an inflationary spiral. Targeted support for those in the most need is another option. Ultimately, it may be that everyone feels some short-term financial pain in the hope, and belief, that those prices rises slow to the 2% target as soon as possible. The number of job vacancies reached a fresh high of 1.29 million between January and March - a rise of 492,400 roles compared with the pre-pandemic first three months of 2020. The ONS said the highest rate of vacancies was in construction, which rose by 18.7% in the first three months of the year. Sectors such as hotels and food services, including restaurants, and entertainment saw job openings increase by 13.1%. However, there was a fall in demand for people in the gas and electricity sectors where vacancy rates dropped by 14%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures ""show the continued strength of our jobs market"", adding that the government was ""helping to cushion the impacts of global price rises through over Â£22bn of support for the cost of living this financial year"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the data shows that ""Conservative choices are leaving real wages squeezed and people worse off"". ""At a time like this, Rishi Sunak could have chosen a one-off windfall tax on huge oil and gas company profits to cut household energy bills by up to Â£600. ""Instead, he's decided to make Britain the only major economy to land working people with higher taxes in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis,"" he said. Molly Scott Cato, Green Party finance and economy spokesperson, said: ""Rather than a cost of living crisis we should see the perilous situation facing working people as a wages crisis. ""A Green government would introduce taxes on the wealthy and on pollution to fund decent pay rises so that all public service workers get a pay rise that at least matches the cost of living and begins to restore earnings lost over the last decade.""

"Warning travel problems could continue into summerBorder force is ""chronically under-staffed"" and it will take time to train new officers, a union says.Business","Worker shortages mean airports and ports are facing a ""very difficult summer"", a border staff union has said. Lucy Moreton, from the Immigration Services Union, warned that Border Force was ""catastrophically under-staffed"" and that it took nearly a year to fully train new officers. Meanwhile, one aviation recruitment expert said it would take at least 12 months for shortages to settle down. Some travellers have seen long queues and cancellations over Easter. The travel industry cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but as demand for flights has returned, it has struggled to recruit, carry out security checks and train new staff quickly enough. ""For the first time in living memory, Border Force is no longer attracting enough candidates to fill the vacancies that they've got,"" Ms Moreton told the BBC. ""Combined with the fact it takes nearly a year to fully train a Border Force officer, we're going into not just this summer but this weekend catastrophically under-staffed, with people beginning to travel again."" What's causing flight disruption this Easter? Airport warns of queues as travel delays continue While she said it was right that no corners were cut with training and security clearances, Ms Moreton said more resources would help. She said cash incentives were being offered for working shifts at London's Heathrow Airport, while staff from Scotland and Northern Ireland were also being brought down to provide cover. However, she added: ""This is a very expensive proposition that resourcing it properly in the first place would have avoided."" The Aviation Recruitment Network, which is working with airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Manchester, said it currently had more than 300 live vacancies - a record for this time of year. Kully Sandhu, the organisation's managing director, told the BBC he believed it would take at least 12 months for recruitment problems to be resolved. ""Brexit has not helped with the issues we're facing at the moment because we had a natural attraction of individuals from the European market who would apply for vacancies within UK airports,"" he told the BBC. ""We no longer have that talent pool to recruit from and we are relying on individuals within the UK."" Heathrow has said security checks and training mean it can take three to six months before new recruits can start working. It is aiming to have 1,000 new security officers recruited and in their posts by the summer. On Monday, Heathrow admitted resources were ""stretched"",as it revealed March was its busiest month since the start of the pandemic. The airport warned of ""congestion in check-in areas at peak times"" and said it was ""working closely with airlines and ground handlers to make sure this increase in demand can be met while keeping passengers safe"". The Home Office also said travellers may face longer waits than usual over the Easter period due to high passenger numbers. ""Border Force's number one priority is to maintain a secure border, and we will not compromise on this. We are mobilising additional staff to help minimise queuing times for passengers and will continue to deploy our staff flexibly to manage this demand,"" a statement said. Last week, Ken O'Toole, the deputy chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said staff shortages meant long queues at security could continue for four to six weeks. Meanwhile, airlines have been hit by Covid-related absences, with EasyJet and British Airways cancelling flights as a result. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the company had seen absence rates of 20% in some cases. But he said delays in processing security checks for new airline crew were also contributing to flight cancellations. Mr Lundgren said the airline was waiting for the Department for Transport to give permission for around 100 new members of staff to start work. However, the company said it had flown 94% of its planned schedule in the past seven days, with around 1,500 flights a day - four times higher than this time last year. It added that cancellations had been made as early as possible to enable the majority of customers to rebook onto flights departing the same day. EasyJet said it was seeing strong demand, with summer bookings over the past six weeks above pre-pandemic levels. Have you changed your travel plans due to warnings of disruption?

"Kinahan gang sanctions 'heavy blow' to activitiesThe Republic of Ireland's police chief says it is the ""first phase"" of work to tackle the crime cartel.Europe","This video can not be played Garda (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris says this is only the ""first phase"" in the work to tackle the Kinahan gang Worldwide financial sanctions targeting the Kinahan crime cartel will deal a ""heavy blow"" to their activities, Ireland's police chief has said. Irish, American and British law enforcement have launched coordinated action against the Irish organised crime group. A reward of up to $5m (Â£3.84m) has also been offered by the US for information on the three most senior members. In total, seven members and three associated businesses are targeted. Daniel Kinahan, 44, has previously been named in the Irish courts as the head of one of Europe's most prominent drug gangs. His father Christopher Snr, 65, and brother Christopher Jnr, 41, were also placed on an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list. US sanctions gang leader with links to Tyson Fury 'Organised crime boss' still working in boxing They are among the seven members of the Kinahan cartel targeted by the OFAC. On Tuesday, US Ambassador to Ireland Claire Cronin said a reward of up to $5m was being offered for information which leads to the financial disruption of the group or the arrest or conviction of Christopher Kinahan Snr, Daniel Kinahan or Christopher Kinahan Jnr. Tyson Fury thanked Daniel Kinahan for organising a fight with then world champion Anthony Joshua in 2021 Daniel Kinahan has previously worked as an advisor to boxer Tyson Fury and is a co-founder of the MTK Global agency, which represents a number of boxing's top fighters, including Fury and Michael Conlan. Mr Kinahan said he cut ties with the company in 2017. While Mr Kinahan claims to no longer be associated with the agency, last yearFury expressly thanked him for organising a high-profile boutwith then world champion Anthony Joshua. Speaking about the sanctions, Garda (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris said this was just the ""first phase"" in the work to tackle the Kinahan gang. He said the enforcement measures would deal a ""heavy blow if not a crippling blow"" to the gang, which the UK's National Crime Agency has said is responsible for dealing drugs and firearms around the world for more than 20 years. ""It is a demonstration of the strength of resolve amongst all of us to put an end to a gang that has caused so much destruction and death here and abroad,"" Commissioner Harris said at a press conference in Dublin on Tuesday. The Garda Commissioner Drew Harris has rightly described today as ""a landmark day"" in the fight against the Kinahans and organised crime. The Kinahan family became household names after their feud - which has claimed at least 18 lives - with the rival Hutch gang. The most notorious incident was the Hutch attack ona boxing weigh-in six years ago. The Kinahans are now based in the United Arab Emirates, which has no extradition with the Republic of Ireland and that may have led them to think they were beyond reach. US ambassador to Ireland Claire Cronin says a reward of up to $5m is being offered for information on the gang But the American action today may have changed that with the three main members of the family's criminal enterprise now subject to the same enforcement measures as Russian oligarchs associated with the Putin regime arising from the war in Ukraine. In recent years, Daniel Kinahan, one of those sanctioned, has sought to launder his reputation by involvement in boxing. On Tuesday, police forces in Ireland and Britain told those associated with him that they can no longer be in any doubt about him and his family's activities. They also said that those sportsmen should now consider their own reputations and those of their sports and its fans. The commissioner said the gang had started life as south inner city Dublin drug dealers, but had grown to become a ""transnational crime cartel involved in a wide range of criminality that is estimated to have generated over â¬1bn for them"". ""All of it leaving countless victims of violence and addiction across the world in their wake,"" he added. For over 20 years the group has been responsible for importing tonnes of drugs and firearms around the world, the National Crime Agency (NCA) says. The NCA says the crime group is linked to over a dozen gangland murders. The US Treasury Department describes the Kinahan cartel as one of the most dangerous in the world, comparable to crime organisations like Italy's Camorra, Mexico's Los Zetas and Japan's Yakuza. According to GardaÃ­ (Irish police) Commissioner Drew Harris, the gang is estimated to have made over â¬1bn (Â£836,590,000) globally from its activities. Last month, Thomas Kavanagh, who the NCA says ran the group's criminal operations in the UK,was jailed for 21 years alongside Gary Vickery and Daniel Canning, who were sentenced to 20 years and 19 and a half years respectively. The NCA says evidence shows they were responsible for cocaine imports estimated to be up to Â£23.4m, and cannabis imports worth about Â£6.4m. The US Department of the Treasury said that as a result of the action being taken against the named people and businesses, ""all property and interests in property of the designated individuals or entities that are in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons must be blocked and reported to"" the OFAC. The group is suspected of involvement in a feud with a rival Dublin gang that has resulted in 18 people being murdered. Daniel Kinahan's lawyertold BBC Panorama last yearhe has no criminal record or convictions and the allegations about him being a crime boss are false and have no evidential basis.

New drugs to fight superbugs available soon on NHSA deal is being struck to make them freely available to patients in England at an affordable cost.HealthComments,"Two new medications which fight drug-resistant superbugs could soon become available to NHS patients in England. Drugs' watchdog NICE says cefiderocol and ceftazidime with avibactam offer value for money and will save lives. These 'last line of defence' drugs will tackle severe infections which cannot be cleared by other treatments. Under the deal, a fixed annual fee will be paid to manufacturers to cover their development costs, rather than individual payments for each dose. The subscription-style payment model is part of the government's strategy to incentivise companies to make essential drugs such as these, alongside the so-called blockbuster drugs which typically make huge profits for pharmaceutical giants. Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue which threatens to set modern medicine back to the pre-antibiotic era. Without effective drugs to address superbugs, routine surgery - such as hip replacements - will become too dangerous to perform, for example. Some of the bacteria and other micro-organisms behind common, treatable diseases - including tuberculosis and gonorrhoea - have acquired the ability to dodge medicines. Hard-to-treat infections alreadykill more than a million people per year globally, researchers estimate. The two new drugs, approved in draft guidelines from NICE, will help patients with risky urinary tract infections, pneumonia and sepsis. NHS commercial medicines director Blake Dark said: ""This is an important step in our world-leading approach to incentivise innovation in antimicrobial drugs and the battle against drug-resistant infections. ""The NHS will now use its commercial power to secure deals that will enable NHS patients to benefit from these treatments, delivering on its Long Term Plan commitment and paving the way for a pipeline of future treatment options."" Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest health threats facing the world and I'm incredibly proud that the UK's world-leading innovations are helping to develop two antibiotics which will save many lives. ""NHS patients with severe resistance to other drugs could soon access these medicines, giving them a much greater chance of survival.

Public sector staff hit as price rises outpace pay,"Public sector pay for jobs such as NHS workers, teachers and civil servants fell further behind price rises in the three months to February, figures show. While wages rose for public sector workers, price rises outpaced them meaning a 3% drop in spending power, the biggest fall in 20 years. In contrast, an average private sector employee's wage bought 0.5% less. The latest inflation figures show the cost of living is rising at its fastest pace for 30 years. ""Basic pay is now falling noticeably in real terms,"" said Darren Morgan fromthe Office for National Statistics,externaldescribing the fall in spending power. The most recent figures show that inflation reached 6.2% in February and new data, due out on Wednesday, is expected to show a further rise in March. Tom Southern, a recruitment consultant from Macclesfield, says he and family are having to make cutbacks because of the rising cost of living. The 30-year-old says he recently moved jobs to get a better salary, but it still does not go far enough. ""We're not massively uncomfortable, we have a house and two cars. But it's the little cutbacks you have to make, it starts to add up."" The father of three says it costs Â£1.80 a litre to put diesel in the family car and their energy bill has gone from Â£69 to Â£268 a month. Their weekly shop at Aldi is up from Â£50-60 to Â£80-90. Tom and his partner, who is a midwife, also have loans to pay, childcare costs, and are getting married this month which is another bill to pay. ""I don't see myself as unfortunate, it's other people I feel sorry for,"" he says. ""I don't see how single parents or people on a low wage can make ends meet."" The ONS said the unemployment rate fell to 3.8% from 3.9% last month. Capital Economics said the fall in unemployment was mainly due to people taking themselves out of the workforce by retiring or by looking after family or long-term sick. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the number of people classed as inactive rose by 76,000 in the three month period. At the start of the week, the annualrise in benefits and the state pension came into force. The increase was 3.1%. Now official figures show the average wage is going up by 4%. In normal times, that sounds like a decent rise in income, but these are not normal times. Households are watching most things get more expensive. Prices are rising at over 6% a year and accelerating, outstripping the uplift in benefits and pay. Remember, the target rate for price increases in the economy, as measured by inflation, is 2%. That leaves policymakers with a headache. Either people continue to get worse off, increasing poverty and putting added strain on individuals and the welfare system. Or workers get big pay rises, which bosses can only pay for by putting up prices again - creating what is called an inflationary spiral. Targeted support for those in the most need is another option. Ultimately, it may be that everyone feels some short-term financial pain in the hope, and belief, that those prices rises slow to the 2% target as soon as possible. The number of job vacancies reached a fresh high of 1.29 million between January and March - a rise of 492,400 roles compared with the pre-pandemic first three months of 2020. The ONS said the highest rate of vacancies was in construction, which rose by 18.7% in the first three months of the year. Sectors such as hotels and food services, including restaurants, and entertainment saw job openings increase by 13.1%. However, there was a fall in demand for people in the gas and electricity sectors where vacancy rates dropped by 14%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures ""show the continued strength of our jobs market"", adding that the government was ""helping to cushion the impacts of global price rises through over Â£22bn of support for the cost of living this financial year"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the data shows that ""Conservative choices are leaving real wages squeezed and people worse off"". ""At a time like this, Rishi Sunak could have chosen a one-off windfall tax on huge oil and gas company profits to cut household energy bills by up to Â£600. ""Instead, he's decided to make Britain the only major economy to land working people with higher taxes in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis,"" he said. Molly Scott Cato, Green Party finance and economy spokesperson, said: ""Rather than a cost of living crisis we should see the perilous situation facing working people as a wages crisis. ""A Green government would introduce taxes on the wealthy and on pollution to fund decent pay rises so that all public service workers get a pay rise that at least matches the cost of living and begins to restore earnings lost over the last decade.""

The Moskva, pictured in 2008 Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand. The statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship. ""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."" It did not specify the cause of the fire. But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board. The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to ""go to hell"", before they were ultimately taken prisoner. Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw
from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW,
Marie-Luise Wolff, has said. There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the
Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the
Russian side. It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders,but Kyiv had told him he was not
welcome due to his close ties with Russiaand his support for
the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to
Germany. ""We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from
Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an
ambitious timetable,"" Wolff said. Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy
supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022
growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in
Ukraine. In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever. ""Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever,"" he says. Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: ""All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. ""To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. ""Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."" He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: ""The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."" Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine.

The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory. ""We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory,"" the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing. ""If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,"" it added. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month. As we reported earlier, war crimes prosecutors have been visiting the site of civilian killings in Bucha. Images of the town's streets strewn with bodies shocked the world earlier this month, and local officials say hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves. ""We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed,"" the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told reporters earlier. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,â Khan later wrote on Twitter. He also described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"". Khan has been pictured visiting the site of a mass burial in Bucha. A Ukrainian soldier mans a Howitzer for drills in Kharkiv in June 2021 The $800m worth of US weaponry pledged by President Biden on Wednesday to Ukraine includes artillery and radar systems that may require ""additional training"" for Ukrainian troops. ""The systems that will probably require some additional training for Ukrainian forces are the howitzers (and) ... the counter artillery radar,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The radar system, he said, is ""not a very difficult system to operate, but it's not one that they have in their inventory"". Howitzers are a type of relatively short-barrelled cannon, used to lob shells into enemy lines. According to the US Defense Department, the shipment will include 18 Howitzers along with 40,000 artillery rounds. It will also include hundreds of missiles and Switchblade drones - also known as kamikaze drones due to the way they can be flown into their target. The US is also sending 11 helicopters, hundreds of armoured vehicles, anti-personnel mines, body armour and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials. The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" he said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrisonrefused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to ""go to hell"". Earlier on Wednesday a fire was reported on the ship. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel. He said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Presidents Zelensky held talks with the presidents of Poland and the Baltic states The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become the latest world leaders to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. They also visited the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch said the aim of the trip was to show support to President Zelensky and the defenders of Ukraine ""in a decisive moment"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was ""hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-Century Europe"". The four presidents also met Ukrainan Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal during a visit to Borodyanka President Biden made the announcement after a phone call with President Zelensky The US is to send an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call between Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden. Biden said the support would include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected âwider assaultâ in the east of Ukraine. The package also includes helicopters and what Biden called ânew capabilitiesâ such as artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers. Senior US defence officials say the total military aid provided by the US now stands at more than $3bn. Biden has said the weaponry supplied so far has helped ensure the failure of Russiaâs initial war aims. But he added it was not the time to rest, saying: âI assured President Zelenskyy that the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people."" It is ""at least plausible"" to consider whether genocide could be an issue in relation to the war in Ukraine, according to a legal expert. As we have been reporting,US President Joe Biden has said there was evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops in Ukraine. This was the first time he used the word genocide - defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Philippe Sands QC said to prove ""genocidal intent"" was ""very difficult"" in court. But speaking on BBC Radio 4, the lawyer and University College London professor said: ""I understand why both President Zelensky and President Biden are now using this word, because this is wrongdoing on a scale that is so great that I think it is at least plausible to raise the genocide issue.â We have reports of more people being killed in Ukraine's north-eastern region of Kharkiv. At
least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in the past 24 hours, according to Kharkiv's governor Oleh Synegubov. He has also said thatUkrainian troops have shot down two Russian planesthat attacked the region. Kharkiv - which sits near the border - has been under attack since the start of the war. But unlike regions further to the west, which have seen Russian troops move away in recent days, it is still in the firing line. This is because of its position on the edge of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the area Russia hopes to take in its next offensive. The UN chief said there was more to be done to guarantee the safety of Ukrainian evacuees A potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appears unlikely at this stage, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said. He told reporters this afternoon: ""At the present moment a global ceasefire in Ukraine doesn't
seem possible."" Instead, he said the UN was focusing its efforts on supporting evacuees and boosting humanitarian aid. Guterres said the UN had made proposals to Russia to
""bring the parties together... to manage"" humanitarian access and the evacuation of civilians, but had not yet received a response from Moscow. ""There are lots of things that can be done in order to
guarantee evacuation of civilians,"" he said. Donetsk Regional Police have shared footage of the moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. This video can not be played War in Ukraine: The moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have just spoken by phone. They discussed additional defensive and
financial aid for Ukraine as well as tightening sanctions and alleged Russian
war crimes, Zelensky wrote on Twitter. It comes after the Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to repel Russian aggression. In an online English-language address, he said Ukraine needed heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech foreign
ministry says its diplomats have returned to the embassy in Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The
ministry tweeted a photo of three diplomats raising the Czech flag in front of
the building. In a statement,
the ministry said it was one of the many steps the country was taking to show its
support for Ukraine. It would always stand with Ukraine, it
said. The Czech
Republic has been one of the more muscular supporters of Ukraine as it defends
itself from Russian aggression. It was the first Nato or EU country to send tanks
to the country, while a crowd-funding effort organised by the Ukrainian Embassy
and the Czech Defence Ministry to buy weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces
has approached 1bn Czech koruna, (Â£34m, 41m euros).  Russia has shifted the focus of its invasion to eastern Ukraine after withdrawing forces from Kyiv and the north. And in recent days, Ukrainian officials have warned that it is preparing to launch a new offensive in the east targeting the Donbas region. This has led analysts to examine Russian military activity around eastern Ukraine more closely. These satellite images from Maxar show Russian military vehicles assembling just 8km (5 miles) from the border. Territory in the region has been seized back from Russian troops More than 100 civilians have been killed in the north-eastern Sumy region -
according to its military chief. Dmytro Zhyvytsky said many corpses were discovered with their
hands tied. Some showed signs of torture or gunshot wounds to the head. He alleged that invading Russian soldiers had ""fired on
everyone"", including the elderly and children. Many people from the city were missing or had been
captured, he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these claims. The discoveries in Sumy appear reminiscent of atrocities
uncovered in Bucha. Russia has repeatedly denied committing any war crimes
there. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court earlier
labelled Ukraine a ""crime scene"" after visiting Bucha. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Shop sales slow as people rein in spending,"Sales in shops have slowed as household budgets come under pressure from the rising cost of living, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has said. Its figures show sales growth for March rose by 3.1%, the smallest increase so far this year and down from a 6.7% rise in February. It comes as millions are having to deal with higher energy bills and taxes. The BRC said pressure on people's finances and the war in Ukraine had ""shaken consumer confidence"". Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said customers faced ""an enormous challenge this year"" around their finances, which was ""likely to be reflected in retail spend in the future"". Online fashion giant Asos said on Tuesday that its sales forecasts for the next few months carried greater uncertainty than usual as it was still unclear how the rising financial pressures on consumers would affect their spending. Small business owners told the BBC they had seen a recent dip in sales compared to previous months at a time when they were also having to grapple with higher operating costs. Lucy Rushton (front) says she is worried about the rising costs of running her business Lucy Rushton, owner and founder of the Cheshire Gift Company, said she believed a lot of people were starting to be more prudent with their spending. ""Going into Easter, sales have definitely been lower than they were last year,"" she said. Ms Rushton, who started her business online and stored products in her garage before moving to a warehouse, told the BBC the company's social media presence had helped with sales from loyal customers. But she added: ""I would be lying if I was not worried looking to the next year."" Ms Rushton said she and her staff wear thermals to avoid putting the heating on in the company's warehouse due to high energy costs. ""It is cold in the warehouse [but] I would rather keep my staff in jobs,"" she said. She said higher shipping and packaging costs were having the biggest impact on her profits, but her team had ""adapted"" and found new ways to get the best value for money without having to pass on big price increases to customers. With inflation rising at its fastest rate for 30 years, people in the UK are facing increased pressure from living costs. Fuel, energy and food prices have seen some of the biggest increases. The rate at which prices rise has been forecast to reach 8.7% in the final three months of 2022, which means households may be forced to cut back. Bev Logan: It's understandable that people have to be careful but it's a worry for many small businesses Bev Logan, who set up her online women's sportswear business Badass Mother Runners during the first Covid lockdown, said sales had been strong until they ""nosedived"" in April.

Don Williams, retail partner at KPMG, said the slower rate of sales in March suggested ""clouds on the horizon as household budgets come under pressure from rising costs, an increasing tax burden and competition from holidays"". ""Additionally, retailers are facing their own battle with rising costs and inflation, and are walking a tightrope between absorbing rising costs themselves or passing these on to consumers,"" he added.

Food sales for the month fell year-on-year and online sales for non-food items also decreased by 29%, compared with growth of 64.7% the year before. Susan Barratt, chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, said food and drink sales figures faced tough comparisons to last year, when some lockdown restrictions started to ease.

Warning signs before asylum seeker hotel stabbings,"Asylum seekers had been moved into the Park Inn in response to the coronavirus pandemic An asylum seeker who stabbed six people in a Glasgow hotel had contacted the Home Office and other organisations more than 70 times before the attack. Badreddin Abdalla Adam was among hundreds of asylum seekers moved into city hotels at the start of lockdown. An internal Home Office evaluation said contact with the Home Office and two contractors, Mears and Migrant Help, ""should have acted as a warning"". The Home Office said significant changes had now been made. Adam was shot by police and died in the incident in the Park Inn hotel in June 2020. Man shot dead by police after Glasgow stabbings Call for inquiry into asylum-seeker accommodation Stabbings scene 'something I will never forget' Glasgow stabbings: What we know In March 2020, the Home Office contractor Mears moved hundreds of asylum seekers from apartments into Glasgow hotels. The company said there was a shortage of accommodation caused by the Covid pandemic and it wanted to minimise travel for staff, as well as ensuring asylum seekers could access welfare services. Badreddin Abdalla Adam was shot by police after carrying out multiple stabbings On 26 June 2020, Badreddin Abdalla Adam - a Sudanese asylum seeker - stabbed six people in the Park Inn hotel, including three other asylum seekers, a police officer and two members of hotel staff. He had contacted the Home Office, Mears, and Migrant Help 72 times about his health and accommodation in the period leading up to the attack. The Home Office review, leaked to the BBC, also found Adam had complained to staff in the hotel and was in touch with the Home Office about an assisted voluntary return to his home country. It said the inquiries individually, and cumulatively, were ""not indicative of any elevated risk"" - but the number of times he was in contact ""should have acted as a warning"" and there was ""no joined-up view"". The review made several recommendations, including developing a system to identify patterns of contact which may cause concern, and ensuring hotel staff are given mental health awareness and de-escalation training. The review said the rationale for moving asylum seekers, who had not been classed as vulnerable, into hotels appeared sound. But it said the combined impact of previous trauma, being accommodated long-term in hotels, and the restrictions had ""a significant impact"" on their well-being. The stabbings led to a major police operation in Glasgow city centre Thousands of asylum seekers are still living in hotels across the UK, including several cities in Scotland. Refugees for Justice has been campaigning for an independent public inquiry into the Park Inn stabbings since 2020. The organisation's Dylan Fotoohi described the Home Office review as a ""shameful cover-up attempt."" He added: ""Lessons have not been learned, there has been no meaningful investigation, the biased evaluation report by the Home Office has been kept hidden, and they have now expanded the exact same practice that led to these tragedies in Glasgow to other cities in Scotland. This is utterly unacceptable."" Home secretary pledges overhaul of asylum seeker rules Can the UK government's asylum plan work? A Home Office spokesman said: ""Due to the pandemic, the Home Office had to use an unprecedented number of hotels for asylum seekers, including in Glasgow. ""The use of hotels is unacceptable and we are working hard to find appropriate accommodation for asylum seekers, but local authorities must do all they can to help house people permanently. ""Since this horrific incident we have undertaken a number of significant changes to keep asylum seekers safe, including how we, our contractors and charities spot vulnerable individuals and provide them with wraparound support and appropriate accommodation. ""The Home Office has completed the majority of recommendations in the review which found that hotels in Glasgow were of a good standard, clean and well maintained. ""Our new plan for immigration, which is going through Parliament now, will fix the broken asylum system, enabling us to grant protection to those entitled to it and to remove those with no right to be here more quickly.""

Pay growth fails to keep pace with cost of living,"Public sector pay for jobs such as NHS workers, teachers and civil servants fell further behind price rises in the three months to February, figures show. While wages rose for public sector workers, price rises outpaced them meaning a 3% drop in spending power, the biggest fall in 20 years. In contrast, an average private sector employee's wage bought 0.5% less. The latest inflation figures show the cost of living is rising at its fastest pace for 30 years. ""Basic pay is now falling noticeably in real terms,"" said Darren Morgan fromthe Office for National Statistics,externaldescribing the fall in spending power. The most recent figures show that inflation reached 6.2% in February and new data, due out on Wednesday, is expected to show a further rise in March. Tom Southern, a recruitment consultant from Macclesfield, says he and family are having to make cutbacks because of the rising cost of living. The 30-year-old says he recently moved jobs to get a better salary, but it still does not go far enough. ""We're not massively uncomfortable, we have a house and two cars. But it's the little cutbacks you have to make, it starts to add up."" The father of three says it costs Â£1.80 a litre to put diesel in the family car and their energy bill has gone from Â£69 to Â£268 a month. Their weekly shop at Aldi is up from Â£50-60 to Â£80-90. Tom and his partner, who is a midwife, also have loans to pay, childcare costs, and are getting married this month which is another bill to pay. ""I don't see myself as unfortunate, it's other people I feel sorry for,"" he says. ""I don't see how single parents or people on a low wage can make ends meet."" The ONS said the unemployment rate fell to 3.8% from 3.9% last month. Capital Economics said the fall in unemployment was mainly due to people taking themselves out of the workforce by retiring or by looking after family or long-term sick. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the number of people classed as inactive rose by 76,000 in the three month period. At the start of the week, the annualrise in benefits and the state pension came into force. The increase was 3.1%. Now official figures show the average wage is going up by 4%. In normal times, that sounds like a decent rise in income, but these are not normal times. Households are watching most things get more expensive. Prices are rising at over 6% a year and accelerating, outstripping the uplift in benefits and pay. Remember, the target rate for price increases in the economy, as measured by inflation, is 2%. That leaves policymakers with a headache. Either people continue to get worse off, increasing poverty and putting added strain on individuals and the welfare system. Or workers get big pay rises, which bosses can only pay for by putting up prices again - creating what is called an inflationary spiral. Targeted support for those in the most need is another option. Ultimately, it may be that everyone feels some short-term financial pain in the hope, and belief, that those prices rises slow to the 2% target as soon as possible. The number of job vacancies reached a fresh high of 1.29 million between January and March - a rise of 492,400 roles compared with the pre-pandemic first three months of 2020. The ONS said the highest rate of vacancies was in construction, which rose by 18.7% in the first three months of the year. Sectors such as hotels and food services, including restaurants, and entertainment saw job openings increase by 13.1%. However, there was a fall in demand for people in the gas and electricity sectors where vacancy rates dropped by 14%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures ""show the continued strength of our jobs market"", adding that the government was ""helping to cushion the impacts of global price rises through over Â£22bn of support for the cost of living this financial year"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said the data shows that ""Conservative choices are leaving real wages squeezed and people worse off"". ""At a time like this, Rishi Sunak could have chosen a one-off windfall tax on huge oil and gas company profits to cut household energy bills by up to Â£600. ""Instead, he's decided to make Britain the only major economy to land working people with higher taxes in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis,"" he said. Molly Scott Cato, Green Party finance and economy spokesperson, said: ""Rather than a cost of living crisis we should see the perilous situation facing working people as a wages crisis. ""A Green government would introduce taxes on the wealthy and on pollution to fund decent pay rises so that all public service workers get a pay rise that at least matches the cost of living and begins to restore earnings lost over the last decade.""

At least 25 killed in Philippines tropical storm,"Tropical storm Megi is the first to lash the Philippines since a major typhoon last December At least 25 people have died so far in landslides and floods in the Philippines after Tropical Storm Megi swept the nation. On Tuesday, rescue crews were still battling to retrieve people stranded on the eastern and southern coasts. Megi - known locally as Agaton - hit the archipelago on Sunday with winds of up to 65km (40 miles) per hour. It was the first such storm of the year - the Philippines typically sees an average of 20 each year. More than 13,000 people fled to higher-ground shelters as the storm lashed the east coast. Heavy rain and winds knocked out power supply, flooded homes and fields and caused mudslides in villages. Images shared by authorities and locals online showed rescuers wading through muddy swamps and using rafts on fast-flowing rivers to try and reach isolated areas of submerged homes. In the town of Abuyog, in Leyte, the floods cut roads off and inundated homes and buildings One of the worst affected areas was the province of Leyte, where 22 bodies had been retrieved after being buried under a landslide, local authorities in Baybay city said on Monday. ""I was crying because I know the people buried there and I was also scared because there were mountains behind our house,"" one Leyte resident told news agency AFP. The national disaster agency also confirmed that at least three people had died in the Davao region in the south. The storm's conditions were due to ease Tuesday. It comes about four months after Super Typhoon Rai devastated many of the nation's south-east islands in December - killing at least 375 people and affecting about 500,000 people. It was the worst storm to hit the Philippines that year and experts said it had grown stronger far quicker than anticipated. Scientists say human-caused climate change has led to a greater intensity and power in tropical storms. The Philippines has experienced some of its most deadly storms since 2006. It's been ranked as one of the nations most vulnerable to climate disasters due to its geography.

The Moskva, pictured in 2008 Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand. The statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship. ""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."" It did not specify the cause of the fire. But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board. The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to ""go to hell"", before they were ultimately taken prisoner. Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw
from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW,
Marie-Luise Wolff, has said. There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the
Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the
Russian side. It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders,but Kyiv had told him he was not
welcome due to his close ties with Russiaand his support for
the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to
Germany. ""We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from
Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an
ambitious timetable,"" Wolff said. Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy
supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022
growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in
Ukraine. In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever. ""Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever,"" he says. Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: ""All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. ""To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. ""Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."" He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: ""The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."" Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine.

The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory. ""We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory,"" the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing. ""If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,"" it added. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month. As we reported earlier, war crimes prosecutors have been visiting the site of civilian killings in Bucha. Images of the town's streets strewn with bodies shocked the world earlier this month, and local officials say hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves. ""We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed,"" the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told reporters earlier. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,â Khan later wrote on Twitter. He also described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"". Khan has been pictured visiting the site of a mass burial in Bucha. A Ukrainian soldier mans a Howitzer for drills in Kharkiv in June 2021 The $800m worth of US weaponry pledged by President Biden on Wednesday to Ukraine includes artillery and radar systems that may require ""additional training"" for Ukrainian troops. ""The systems that will probably require some additional training for Ukrainian forces are the howitzers (and) ... the counter artillery radar,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The radar system, he said, is ""not a very difficult system to operate, but it's not one that they have in their inventory"". Howitzers are a type of relatively short-barrelled cannon, used to lob shells into enemy lines. According to the US Defense Department, the shipment will include 18 Howitzers along with 40,000 artillery rounds. It will also include hundreds of missiles and Switchblade drones - also known as kamikaze drones due to the way they can be flown into their target. The US is also sending 11 helicopters, hundreds of armoured vehicles, anti-personnel mines, body armour and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials. The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" he said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrisonrefused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to ""go to hell"". Earlier on Wednesday a fire was reported on the ship. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel. He said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Presidents Zelensky held talks with the presidents of Poland and the Baltic states The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become the latest world leaders to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. They also visited the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch said the aim of the trip was to show support to President Zelensky and the defenders of Ukraine ""in a decisive moment"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was ""hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-Century Europe"". The four presidents also met Ukrainan Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal during a visit to Borodyanka President Biden made the announcement after a phone call with President Zelensky The US is to send an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call between Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden. Biden said the support would include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected âwider assaultâ in the east of Ukraine. The package also includes helicopters and what Biden called ânew capabilitiesâ such as artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers. Senior US defence officials say the total military aid provided by the US now stands at more than $3bn. Biden has said the weaponry supplied so far has helped ensure the failure of Russiaâs initial war aims. But he added it was not the time to rest, saying: âI assured President Zelenskyy that the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people."" It is ""at least plausible"" to consider whether genocide could be an issue in relation to the war in Ukraine, according to a legal expert. As we have been reporting,US President Joe Biden has said there was evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops in Ukraine. This was the first time he used the word genocide - defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Philippe Sands QC said to prove ""genocidal intent"" was ""very difficult"" in court. But speaking on BBC Radio 4, the lawyer and University College London professor said: ""I understand why both President Zelensky and President Biden are now using this word, because this is wrongdoing on a scale that is so great that I think it is at least plausible to raise the genocide issue.â We have reports of more people being killed in Ukraine's north-eastern region of Kharkiv. At
least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in the past 24 hours, according to Kharkiv's governor Oleh Synegubov. He has also said thatUkrainian troops have shot down two Russian planesthat attacked the region. Kharkiv - which sits near the border - has been under attack since the start of the war. But unlike regions further to the west, which have seen Russian troops move away in recent days, it is still in the firing line. This is because of its position on the edge of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the area Russia hopes to take in its next offensive. The UN chief said there was more to be done to guarantee the safety of Ukrainian evacuees A potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appears unlikely at this stage, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said. He told reporters this afternoon: ""At the present moment a global ceasefire in Ukraine doesn't
seem possible."" Instead, he said the UN was focusing its efforts on supporting evacuees and boosting humanitarian aid. Guterres said the UN had made proposals to Russia to
""bring the parties together... to manage"" humanitarian access and the evacuation of civilians, but had not yet received a response from Moscow. ""There are lots of things that can be done in order to
guarantee evacuation of civilians,"" he said. Donetsk Regional Police have shared footage of the moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. This video can not be played War in Ukraine: The moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have just spoken by phone. They discussed additional defensive and
financial aid for Ukraine as well as tightening sanctions and alleged Russian
war crimes, Zelensky wrote on Twitter. It comes after the Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to repel Russian aggression. In an online English-language address, he said Ukraine needed heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech foreign
ministry says its diplomats have returned to the embassy in Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The
ministry tweeted a photo of three diplomats raising the Czech flag in front of
the building. In a statement,
the ministry said it was one of the many steps the country was taking to show its
support for Ukraine. It would always stand with Ukraine, it
said. The Czech
Republic has been one of the more muscular supporters of Ukraine as it defends
itself from Russian aggression. It was the first Nato or EU country to send tanks
to the country, while a crowd-funding effort organised by the Ukrainian Embassy
and the Czech Defence Ministry to buy weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces
has approached 1bn Czech koruna, (Â£34m, 41m euros).  Russia has shifted the focus of its invasion to eastern Ukraine after withdrawing forces from Kyiv and the north. And in recent days, Ukrainian officials have warned that it is preparing to launch a new offensive in the east targeting the Donbas region. This has led analysts to examine Russian military activity around eastern Ukraine more closely. These satellite images from Maxar show Russian military vehicles assembling just 8km (5 miles) from the border. Territory in the region has been seized back from Russian troops More than 100 civilians have been killed in the north-eastern Sumy region -
according to its military chief. Dmytro Zhyvytsky said many corpses were discovered with their
hands tied. Some showed signs of torture or gunshot wounds to the head. He alleged that invading Russian soldiers had ""fired on
everyone"", including the elderly and children. Many people from the city were missing or had been
captured, he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these claims. The discoveries in Sumy appear reminiscent of atrocities
uncovered in Bucha. Russia has repeatedly denied committing any war crimes
there. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court earlier
labelled Ukraine a ""crime scene"" after visiting Bucha. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
