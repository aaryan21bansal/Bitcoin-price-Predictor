The island where people eat puffins,"The seabirds' cute appearance is a big lure for tourists. But for inhabitants of a remote corner of Iceland, the taste of puffin is a reminder of home, writes Ros Jones. You need a strong stomach to take the boat to the Arctic island of Grimsey. When you board the ferry at Dalvik on Iceland's northern shore, staff make sure to point out the huge stack of sick bags, and they don't say ""just in case"". Instead, rather grimly, you are told: ""You really will need one. It'll happen, don't be embarrassed."" After three hours on very, very choppy waters, you long for land. The island is tiny - just 5km (3.1 miles) long and 2km wide - just two square miles. It has no trees - it's far too windy for them to grow here. There is one tiny school for the younger children - currently it has just five students. Grimsey also boasts one shop, a few dozen houses, a swimming pool, lighthouse and 80 residents. The sky, though, is vast - pale washes of white, blue and grey. People visit mostly for the sea birds - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them. Maybe millions. Fulmars, kittiwakes, razorbills, terns and guillemots, but the stars of the show are the puffins. They poke their heads - sporting comical, outsize orange beaks - above the black cliff edges before darting off, in a sudden swarm, to dive for fish below. I was lucky to see them. In mid-August they disappear to spend the winter at sea. Ragnhildur, Gagga for short, who met me off the boat and showed me around, said that the migration happens almost overnight - one morning you wake up and they've gone. Gagga has spent all her married life on Grimsey. Her husband, like nearly all the men here, is a fisherman. The industry is the reason why this Arctic outpost has survived. Cod are plentiful and there's good money to be made. ""The boats often don't need to go out very far,"" she said. ""You can sometimes see them from the shore."" Gagga grew up on a farm on Iceland's mainland - she told me that, with a wide grin, when I asked if she had found the isolation of Grimsey life hard when she'd first arrived. No, she laughed. She had long been used to her own company: ""Have you spent a winter on a farm in Iceland?"" But Grimsey, in summer at least, is no longer quite the isolated place it once was. Gagga was certainly kept very busy. She apologised as soon as she met me.  ""I can show you around later,"" she said. ""But first I have to meet some visitors at the airstrip."" Small planes land here nearly every day and walking round the island, you see a steady stream of tourists exploring the cliff paths. Cruise ships stop here now too. Sitting in one of two harbour cafes, eating waffles, I watched as a long, winding queue of well-maintained and carefully groomed elderly Americans snaked out of the door and round the corner. They were waiting in line for the one available toilet while they tapped away on their smartphones. On Grimsey, connecting to the internet is a piece of cake, but other essential services are in short supply. The tour guides here are all women. They have carved out second incomes for themselves while their partners fish. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Saturdays at 11:30 BST Gagga's daughter, 17-year-old Aslaug, will most likely follow in her mother's footsteps. She showed me round while her mother went to the airstrip. Aslaug goes to school on the mainland in Akureyri and during term time she lives in a flat there with her younger brother. Her parents take the ferry every fortnight to visit. Gagga told me that she rings them every morning, to check they are up and ready for school. ""They always are,"" she said. ""They know how to look after themselves. But I call them anyway, it's what mothers do."" I had expected Aslaug to say that she did not intend to return to Grimsey when she leaves school. But not at all. Her English was practically perfect and she had travel plans already in place for next year. She would visit London, for sure, and her older brother, a commercial pilot, was tempting her with New York. That morning he had sent her a photo of Times Square. ""But I will live here,"" she said. ""Everything I want is on Grimsey."" She listed its assets - black sand beaches, eider ducks, basalt columns, a tight community, her parents. And, oh, of course, the puffins. But she wasn't interested, as I was, in looking at them. ""Puffin is my very favourite food,"" she grinned. Islanders regularly catch the birds, sitting on the cliff edges with huge nets and scooping the puffins up as they dive into the sea. That morning Aslaug had been out with her father and had netted 200. ""I will freeze most of them and take them back to Akureyri next term,"" she told me. ""When I eat them, they'll remind me of home."" Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

Germany's other vote: Airport row divides Berliners,"Tegel is one of four Berlin airports: one is shut, two are set to close and the fourth is not yet open If you want to get a row going at a Berlin dinner party, just mention Tegel airport. ""We had to change the topic in the end,"" one friend said, after a cordial chat with neighbours over the garden fence threatened to get nasty. That's because the question of what to do with Tegel, western Berlin's Cold War-era airport, is tearing the city in two. As voters across Germany go to the polls on Sunday to choose a new parliament, Berliners will also vote in a non-binding referendum on whether to close the airport. Polls are fluctuating wildly, but indicate that a slim majority wants to keep Tegel open. It's divisive because your views on Tegel reveal your values - the sort of person you are, or would like to be. And it's become a hot political issue. Royal seal of approval? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children used Tegel airport in July Fans of Tegel argue that its central location makes it ideal for business travellers. All metal space-ship windows and swooping concrete ramps, the retro main terminal is a provincial West Berlin dream of a jet-set future. Taxis can drive up to the individual departure gates, each with its own security check. It's very nice for travellers short of time, but expensive to staff; architects in the 1970s were clearly optimistic about the economy. Why airport saga shows German efficiency is a myth Supporters say Tegel would be a signal that Berlin, traditionally Germany's economic laggard, is open for business. Voters for the free-market liberal FDP and Angela Merkel's centre-right CDU often want to keep Tegel. Open or closed? Berlin holds a non-binding referendum on Tegel's future Left-wingers and Green Party supporters, however, tend to want it closed. There are fears that an airport in the city centre has serious environmental and safety risks. Certainly the noise pollution annoys local residents. And closing Tegel, the left-wing Senate argues, would allow funds and airlines to be devoted to a new airport, Berlin Brandenburg, generally referred to as BER. Tegel's terminal and runways could then be used for housing, offices and outdoor leisure activities. White elephant? The main hall of the BER airport in May this year The problem is that many Berliners have lost faith in the Senate's ability to make good on promises when it comes to airports. The only thing that everyone can agree on is that it's a mess. Berlin airport 'whistleblower poisoned' Berlin's embattled mayor quits over airport Air Berlin flights hit by 'ill' pilots BER was supposed to open in 2011. Today it is billions of euros over budget, and there is still no fixed start date. During that time, numbers of visitors to Berlin have grown so much that the new, not-yet-open airport is already too small. The Tempelhof terminal was redesigned in the 1930s as a symbol of Nazi power 1923 - Tempelhof designated as an airport 1936 - Construction starts on Tempelhof terminal, designed by Nazi-era architect Ernst Sagebiel 1960 - Commercial airlines start flying from Tegel, originally an Allied military airbase 1974 - Tegel's main terminal inaugurated 2006 - Construction starts on BER terminal 2008 - Tempelhof closes after referendum 2011 - Initial opening date for BER airport In the meantime Tegel is creaking. It was originally designed for fewer than three million travellers a year. In 2016 more than 20 million people used Tegel. Berlin's other airport SchÃ¶nefeld, next to BER, is just as overwhelmed. Those dinner-party discussions inevitably involve tales of chaos in overcrowded corridors, collapsed transport links and confused-looking tourists - clearly puzzled as to why the capital of Europe's richest country has such shabby airports. Berlin's airport chaos is starting to have a wider impact on the city's economy. In August, local carrier Air Berlin filed for insolvency, and is still flying thanks only to a government loan. Air Berlin's difficulties have meant big queues at Tegel airport this month The airline has struggled for years to compete, squeezed between low-cost carriers at one end of the market and Germany's biggest airline Lufthansa at the other. But the delays at BER, which was supposed to become the airline's new hub, have contributed to its problems. New life for Tempelhof A decade and a half ago it was all very different. Berlin had three airports, including 1920s Tempelhof, one of the world's oldest and the site of theBerlin Airlift. Walking from the bombastic Nazi-era terminal across the misty tarmac of Tempelhof, it was always hard not to feel like an extra in the closing scene of Casablanca. There were no crowds, no queues and no rows about air transport. But there were also no jobs, no tourists and no money. Berlin's present squeeze is a result of its attractiveness and economic success. Tempelhof was closed in 2008. Tempelhof's open spaces are now loved by Berliners, including these dance festival participants Today the Nazi-era terminal houses refugees and the crumbling runways are used by cyclists, skateboarders and picnickers. Berliners love the space. But after an earlier referendum to build housing around the edge was botched by the Senate, there is still no long-term plan for the site. So Berlin has in fact four airports: two scheduled to be closed, one already closed, and one not yet open. What the city will end up with remains unclear. So while the rest of the world watches Sunday's vote to see who is Germany's next chancellor, some Berliners are more interested in what happens to Tegel.

Art mystery: The famed painters who vanished into obscurity,"Elwin Hawthorne, Phyllis Bray, John Cooper, Brynhild Parker: Four members of the East London group of artists started by Cooper, an inspirational teacher Two exhibitions open this month devoted to a group of working class artists from the East End of London who became art world celebrities in the late 1920s and 1930s - only to be forgotten after World War Two. They were known as the East London Group, and among their ranks were humble office clerks, a navvy, a window cleaner, a shop assistant, a printer, a basket-weaver and an errand boy. Now they're being rediscovered, with one exhibition devoted to their work in Southampton, and another, curated by the children's author Michael Rosen and radio producer Emma-Louise Williams, on their home turf of Bow in East London. Elwin Hawthorne was able to depict the North Foreland Lighthouse for Shell once he and the Steggle brothers began to travel around the country Though they had no formal art school training, the paintings they produced were highly sophisticated. Encouraged by an inspirational teacher, John Cooper, at evening classes in Mile End and Bow, they painted what they saw around them in London's industrial, poverty-stricken East End, finding the extraordinary in the everyday. For the most part, their subjects were smog-shrouded scenes of canals, railway bridges, terraced houses and scrubby back gardens. There's no traffic in their pictures, and very few people, giving them an eerie, slightly surreal quality. And their paintings are a valuable record of a world long since vanished thanks to the wartime Blitz and post-war redevelopment. Harold Steggles with the car bought thanks to the brothers' success Harold Steggles (left) worked as a solicitor's clerk, his brother Walter worked for a shipping firm For eight years in the 1930s they staged an annual exhibition at one of London's most prestigious commercial art galleries, Alex Reid & Lefevre in Mayfair.  Wealthy art collectors bought the group's paintings and critics raved about them. David Buckman, who has written a book about the group, says they received enormous press coverage in leading newspapers like The Times and the Daily Mail. ""They were well received, and received as equals,"" he says, pointing out that two of the group were invited to exhibit paintings at the 1936 Venice Biennale alongside many of Britain's leading artists. The Southampton show has been curated by Alan Waltham, whose interest in the group was sparked because two of its members were his wife's uncles. Hawthorne's Demolition of Bow Brewery immortalises a world now disappeared Cecil Osborne's Sunday Morning Harold Steggles worked as a solicitor's clerk; his brother Walter worked for a shipping firm.  Each day they commuted into the City from Romford and later Chadwell Heath, returned to have their tea and then, three evenings a week, travelled back into the East End for Cooper's classes. Albert Turpin had multiple jobs from fireman to mayor but sketched whenever he could Their sister Dilly, Waltham's mother-in-law and now aged a frail 100, remembers they had a ""studio"" - one room in the family home - and sometimes let their little sister watch them at work. Had she wanted to paint too? I asked her.  ""Me? No! I couldn't paint a daffodil!"" she says. The brothers' success meant they were able to buy a car (a Ford built at nearby Dagenham) and with their friend Elwin Hawthorne and his wife Lilian, who were fellow members of the group, they broadened their range by travelling round the country to paint. Grove Hall Park, Bow by Harold Steggles All three men contributed images to Shell's famous series of posters depicting English scenes - Cookham in Berkshire in Walter's case, Bungay in Suffolk in Harold's, while Hawthorne's picture was of North Foreland lighthouse in Kent. Another leading member of the group was Albert Turpin, window cleaner, wartime fireman and war artist, firebrand socialist, Labour councillor and post-war Mayor of Bethnal Green. His work is at the centre of the second exhibition at Bow's Nunnery Gallery. Michael Rosen says the group's work is fascinating because of their insistence on painting what they saw in unfashionable places. ""Why paint shabbiness?  It's perverse.  But that's what makes their work interesting and really rather wonderful."" Walter Steggles's painting of Canvey Island Turpin's daughter, Joan Barker, who was adopted by Turpin and his wife Sally aged two at the end of the war, recalls a man who was forever sketching: his family, his fellow councillors and the streets around him.  After the war he made a point of sketching buildings due for demolition, and their replacements as they went up. Barker has her father's pre-war scrapbook, full of newspaper clippings about Councillor ""Dick"" Turpin and his run-ins with the law as he fought Oswald Mosley's fascist agitators.  And she has his post-war sketchbooks and several of his paintings. Elwin Hawthorne's Cumberland Market: Once a major hay market, it became an attractive area for artists But sadly much of his work has vanished.  After her father's death in 1964, her mother decided to clear out the shed at the family's Bethnal Green flat.  Most of her father's paintings from the 1920s, 30s and 40s were burnt. But it's not just Turpin's work that has disappeared. Waltham, who runs a Twitter feed devoted to promoting the group, says more than 700 East London Group paintings were exhibited in the 1930s.  He has been able positively to locate just 113 of them. Some may have been destroyed.  But many others may be hanging unrecognised on walls or sitting in attics up and down the country, still waiting to be rediscovered. From Mile End to Mayfair at Southampton City Art Gallery runs until January.  The Working Artist at the Nunnery Gallery in Bow, East London opens on 29 September.

What should be the 51st 'thing that made the modern economy'?,"Over the past year, we've been exploring50 key things that have contributed to the development of the modern economy, including inventions such asthe diesel engine,the battery,the shipping container,Google,antibioticsandthe Billy bookcase. But what did we miss? What should be the 51st thing that made the modern economy? We've received hundreds of suggestions, which we've whittled down to a shortlist of six. You can vote for your favourite, and the winner will feature ina special programme and podcaston 28 October 2017. The first option of our six traces its history to 1960, in Minnesota in the US. Dorothea Parry was ironing when her husband, Forrest, came home from work at the computer giant IBM. How was his day? Well, he had a problem. IBM had worked out how to encode information on magnetic strips. They wanted to fix the strips to plastic cards. But he couldn't work out how. Dorothea could. She ironed them on. Behavioural economists say we spend differently on plastic compared with cash The addition of the magnetic stripe was a huge boost for credit cards, which were just a few years old and struggling for acceptance. Merchants shown a Diners Club or American Express card had to phone the bank. IBM's magnetic strip paved the way for a far less cumbersome approach. The new credit cards were pushed aggressively. And people soon found that having a ""flexible friend"" could make us drop our financial guard: behavioural economists tell us that spending on plastic is psychologically much easier than spending cash. The price of convenience has been ballooning household debt. But it's hard to imagine the modern economy without them. Our second suggestion also requires heat to manufacture, but a household iron won't do the job. You need temperatures of 1,700C to make glass. Who first did that is lost to history, but they probably lived in Egypt, Syria or Mesopotamia, about 5,500 years ago. Did they look at sand and have an unlikely brainwave: ""I wonder what would happen if we melted it?"" Or did they discover glass by accident, perhaps while smelting bronze? Who knows? But it's safe to bet that the early glassmakers could never have predicted how it would shape the economy. And if you choose glass as the 51st thing, my challenge will be choosing how to tell its story. Glass touchscreen technology has driven the development of smartphones and tablets Perhaps you're reading this on a touchscreen device, accessing the internet via fibre-optic cables. Is that the story of glass? Or I could focus, so to speak, on the lens - how the telescope and microscope changed our knowledge of the world. Spectacles, windows, or fibreglass could each fill an episode of their own. One of the real challenges when choosing my list of 50 was that so many inventions overlap, one bright idea later enabling another. The story of clocks, for example, concluded by observing that GPS wouldn't work without extremely accurate timekeeping. But many of you felt that GPS deserves a story of its own, and that's our third possibility. GPS technology has revolutionised transportation If you've got a smartphone, it probably has a GPS receiver. There are 31 satellites flying around the Earth right now, constantly transmitting their position and the time. If your phone can pick up signals from at least four of them, it can do some clever maths to work out where it is, and plot its position for you on a map. Like many of our 50 things, GPS has military origins: the US Department of Defense developed it to win the Cold War. Now, in turn, GPS is enabling bright ideas that will make the economy of the future - new business models that connect buyers and sellers, and new technologies such as self-driving vehicles, robots and drones. The fourth item on our shortlist begins with an old story about a flood. It's not the Judaeo-Christian tale of Noah's Ark, but the Chinese story of Emperor Yu, the founder of China's first dynasty 4,000 years ago. Noah floated on the waters, but Emperor Yu tamed them, recruiting an army of labourers - along with a dragon and a giant turtle - to assist in setting up irrigation and drainage. The traditional irrigation system used in Bali's Jatiluwih rice fields has Unesco world heritage status Great Yu changed China, and irrigation continues to shape our economy, from California, where arguments rage over the most valuable use of scarce water, to Bali, where the intricacy of the water-management system has astonished visiting experts. The only woman to receive a Nobel Memorial Prize in economics, Lin Ostrom, spent much of her life studying irrigation systems. Ostrom was fascinated by how humans cooperate to manage common resources. There are few more important questions than that - and few better case studies than how we decide who gets how much water, as it trickles - often crossing borders - from the hills down to the sea. Paperwas one of our 50 things. Should we add the pencil to the list? It does have a special place in the history of economic thought. In 1958, the libertarian economist Leonard Read published an essay calledI, Pencil,external, in which an ordinary pencil explained the miracle of its existence. The humble pencil can demonstrate the sophistication of the modern globalised economy The pencil boasted cedar from Oregon which had been milled in California, graphite from Sri Lanka, a brass ferule, a rubber made from Italian pumice and Indonesian rape-seed oil, and more besides. Leonard Read's point was that in a modern economy, behind even the humblest of objects was a tale of international supply chains, complex manufacturing, capital investment and science. No one person can make a pencil from scratch, yet the miracle of market forces makes pencils available for pennies. The pencil is a small enough player on the global scale - but a perfect way to understand the sophistication of the modern economy. Time for one more idea, plucked from a list of hundreds. But where did we store that list? On a spreadsheet, of course. Or perhaps I should say, 'On a digital spreadsheet' - because pencil-and-paper spreadsheets used to be ubiquitous. The accountants of the 1970s would fill out row upon row of cost and revenue assumptions. A single change might require hours - or even days - with a calculator, a pencil and a rubber. Spreadsheets transformed accountancy and made extremely sophisticated analysis possible The first electronic spreadsheet, VisiCalc, came in 1979. It was the brainchild of Dan Bricklin - a computer-savvy student at Harvard Business School. He fantasised about creating a spreadsheet that would recalculate itself. His software revolutionised finance. Wall Street and the City of London started trading financial products that could hardly be said to exist - let alone be comprehended - without a spreadsheet. It reshaped accountancy, destroying the jobs of clerks who had pored over paper spreadsheets. But it created new jobs for analysts, exploring one scenario after another. We increasingly understand the world around us through numbers, and the digital spreadsheet deserves much of the credit for that.

What's the right thing to say to someone with cancer?,"A young woman who was diagnosed with cancer was dismayed by the lack of greeting cards that expressed how she truly felt - but now she's on a mission to help others find the right words in times of crisis. Emily McDowell was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2001, when she was only 24. While she was enduring the months of treatments that would eventually lead to remission, she noticed that friends and acquaintances often didn't know what to say - and that the greeting card industry wasn't helping. ""The sympathy cards were reallyâ¦ interesting,"" says McDowell, who lives in Los Angeles. ""There wasn't much out there that spoke to the situation I was in."" The cards she received fell into a few categories. There were the ""get well soon"" cards that seemed like they made more sense for someone recovering from a broken leg than someone newly diagnosed with cancer. ""It felt almost like a challenge - like, 'um, okayâ¦ I'll try!'"" McDowell said. Emily McDowell says classic greeting cards are ""just not helpful"" Then there were the cards that skewed religious or philosophical. These adages - ""it's all in God's plan"" or ""everything happens for a reason"" also seemed to strike the wrong note. ""In the moment, it's almost insulting to hear,"" McDowell said. ""How is this the plan? Maybe with time and perspective the person can come to that conclusion on their own - but it's just not helpful to hear in a time of crisis."" McDowell realised that while the cards she received were clearly sent with the best intentions, they didn't really help the sender express how he or she was feeling in a genuine way. She filed that information away while she pursued a successful career in advertising. But when she left the industry, she resurrected her idea of creating greeting cards that she felt reflected the messy reality of life. The first cards she created were general greeting cards - and the first to go truly viral was an ""awkward dating"" Valentine: ""I know we're not, like, together or anything but it feels weird not to say anything so I got you this cardâ¦"" McDowell's latest project hits closer to home. ""Empathy cards"" are designed to provide an emotionally frank counterbalance to the aspirational - and often sugarcoated - sentiments she saw expressed in mainstream greeting cards while she was ill. ""A lot of cards represent the relationships we wish we had,"" McDowell said, adding that the big greeting card companies might feel it is too much of a risk to produce ""alternative"" cards that were anything but upbeat. ""It's a traditional medium that didn't necessarily evolve psychologically with the way our culture did, and now it's playing catch-up."" McDowell says she hopes her line of cards provide a springboard for genuine connection and conversation when a friend or loved one is going through a crisis. ""A lot of the time when you are sick or grieving, people stop treating you like the friend they've had for years. They suddenly start treating you differently - like you're defined by your illness, or your grief. ""I wanted to help people feel like 'this is a card I could laugh with my friend overâ¦ it addresses my illness, but doesn't tiptoe around it."" In addition to her cards, McDowell's recently released a book, No Good Card for This, written with the help of compassion expert Kelsey Crowe to help people be empathetic when a loved one is going through a difficult time. She may have made her life's work out of knowing what to say in a time of crisis, but McDowell says simply being honest with a person going through a hard time is always the best thing. Writing an appropriate message can be difficult ""It's totally fine to say, 'I'm shocked, I'm upset, I don't know what to say except I love you and I'm here for you.'"" Even if the words come out awkwardly or aren't well-received, McDowell says it's a lot better than saying nothing at all. ""The worst thing you can do is not to say anything - even if you just don't know what to say, that person is going to interpret your silence as not caring. ""The longer the time goes by, the worse you'll feel about itâ¦ and eventually you'll run into that person six months later at a grocery store and it'll be horrible. It's just not a good enough reason to put that kind of pain on yourself and someone else."" As for her own story, McDowell says that cancer taught her lessons that were unwelcome at the time, but have proved valuable in the years since. ""I will never say having cancer was such a gift, because having cancer sucks. But one of the things that going through a crisis does - it enables you to deepen your relationships. ""It makes you less afraid of talking about hard things. And the perspective I got - that really helped me figure out how to help people."" McDowell says she's been touched by the stories from both givers and receivers of the empathy cards - anecdotes about relationships revived and healed because of them. She told the story of a woman who approached her while she was promoting No Good Card for This. The woman's husband had died a few months back, and her two children were struggling, and the wall full of cards from friends and family weren't exactly helping. One day she got home from work and all the cards had been taken down - except for one. ""One of the children said, 'This one gets it - but all the other ones don't. The one that was left was one of our cards',"" McDowell recalled. ""It doesn't get more meaningful than that.""

'I can feel my body turning to stone',"Jay Virdee says her life is a daily struggle because of scleroderma Former school teacher Jay Virdee has been diagnosed with a rare and incurable degenerative disease which is slowly turning her skin rock hard. The condition has encroached on every aspect of her life, and doctors have told her it could ultimately kill her. ""My body is effectively turning itself into stone,"" says Ms Virdee. ""I sometimes feel like I'm snapping when I reach out for things. ""The pain shooting up my arm is always a reminder of what is happening to me."" Scleroderma makes the 37-year-old's skin and joints feel stiff and it is also attacking her lungs, which are becoming harder and harder. Doctors say this will only get worse. Her life is a daily struggle, never knowing how much she will be able to move, whether a trip to the shops will be possible or even how comfortable breathing will be. On the surface she appears healthy. The damage to her skin can be hidden beneath her clothes and the worst effects of the disease are internal. She has had to convince sceptics she really is ill. A disabled parking badge in the car window and a heaving medicine cabinet are among the few visible clues of the suffering she endures. The systemic form of scleroderma causes white calcium lumps to form under the skin Plans to have children and dreams of a future happy family life have been abandoned, replaced with vague hopes of being able to cope and clinging to the unlikely prospect of a miracle medical breakthrough. And worst of all, Ms Virdee says, her skin will one day be so taut she will be physically unable to smile, her facial expressions forever trapped in the statue of her body. But it has not always been this way. In 2010 she was a teacher, head of a secondary school's IT department in Slough and living an active, fun-filled life. She enjoyed nothing more than going on holiday, and in that year she went on a trip to the Greek islands with her best friend Caroline. It was Caroline who was the first person to notice discolouration and bruising on her skin. Ms Virdee dismissed the unusual markings on her skin and constant tiredness as the results of living a hectic and busy lifestyle. She had no idea her body had turned on itself - and it was another six months after her Greek holiday before she sought help from a GP. And so began three years of tests and consultations with various specialists before she received a formal diagnosis. In the meantime she had struggled to cope at work. Gripping her pen, typing and speaking for long periods were proving significant challenges. Former school teacher Ms Virdee says she was devastated to leave her ""dream job"" She recalls the distress of her condition worsening despite trying in earnest to carry on working and to retain a semblance of normality. The agony in her joints, constant fatigue, her hands feeling ""frozen"" and frequent pins and needles could no longer be ignored. ""After about 18 months, I hit rock bottom,"" she says. ""I remember the turning-point moment. I was driving to school one morning and just had to pull over, broke down in tears and called my GP. ""That was when the doctor and I had to have a very frank discussion about what was happening."" She told the school she was in too much pain to come in any more. Her career, one she had dreamed of and worked towards for most of her life, was over. This was all set to a backdrop of nobody really understanding what the problem was. An incurable disease which sees the immune system attack healthy tissue in the body, with hardening of the skin often one of the first noticeable symptoms It generates excess collagen which can affect joints, tendons and internal organs and results in scarring The milder form of the condition often starts with Raynaud's phenomenon - a circulation problem where fingers and toes turn white in the cold - and causes localised areas of skin to become hardened The form of scleroderma Ms Virdee suffers from is called systemic sclerosis and affects internal organs, particularly the lungs The name comes from the Greek wordsscleroandderma, which translate ashardandskinrespectively In total scleroderma affects 12,000 people in the UK to greatly varying degrees It is four times more common in females than males Scientists and doctors have not been able to establish what triggers the condition Source: Scleroderma & Raynaud's UK Some of her friends became suspicious. They would see her out and about, seemingly going about her business as usual, but at the same time absent from her job. ""It is an invisible illness,"" she says. ""I can feel it and I know it's there but I look normal. In fact I can look like I am very well."" She had to invite friends to feel the skin on her arm, which feels like it is covering a panel of metal, to convince them something was really wrong. Her hardened lungs have led to reduced breathing capacity, which results in not enough oxygen reaching her vital organs, causing fatigue. The same problem has impacted on her vocal chords, resulting in a need for speech therapy. Her joints have become harder. She finds it difficult to walk and sometimes has to use a stick. Chest infections are a regular problem. Ms Virdee was on a holiday in the Greek islands when her friend Caroline noticed some of her symptoms This has all meant sacrificing more than just work. ""I've had to make a decision not to enter into a relationship recently,"" she admits. ""I am very much aware of my functional ability. I have a fear of having a child and leaving them in this world. But I offset that with the fact I've taught nearly 20,000 children. ""Could I manage a child in this condition on a daily basis? It's unfair. As a woman, it's a huge devastation to say I will possibly have to forgo that one part of my life I really hoped I would have. ""There's nothing more devastating than knowing your legacy is going to come to an end at some stage."" The only charity in the country providing specific supports to sufferers, Scleroderma and Raynaud's UK (SRUK), says some people are frightened to touch patients. Amy Baker, the charity's head of engagement, said this came from a lack of understanding about the nature of the disease, which is not contagious or transferable from person to person. Scleroderma causes skin to harden, causing lesions and discolouration ""Our research shows that just 1% of people would be able to identify the symptoms of scleroderma,"" she says, ""with 24% saying they would be frightened to touch someone living with the condition."" ""We are inspired by individuals like Jay who, in the face of adversity, use these experiences to increase awareness and understanding of the condition."" Ms Virdee's doctors have not given her a prognosis, but have warned the severity of the problems in her lungs could prove fatal with little notice and reduce her life expectancy. Dr Richard Russell, a respiratory consultant at the Bridge Clinic in Maidenhead, says Ms Virdee's breathing has to be closely monitored. ""In many ways Jay's symptoms are fairly typical,"" he says. ""The lethargy is debilitating and severely limits how much energy is available for a day. ""The symptoms may be subtle and slow in onset. They may even just be a cough which does not go away. This may be accompanied by an increase in breathlessness which may be only noticed when the patient exercises,"" Ms Virdee fears the condition will one day mean she will be unable to smile Dr Russell explains steroids can be used to reduce inflammation and inhalers to help breathing. Ultimately, however, there is no known cure. Ms Virdee says she has had several moments of realisation about the impact scleroderma will have on her life, such as at a recent dental appointment where she struggled to keep her mouth open. This has led to her fearing the increasing rigidity in her face will eventually mean the permanent loss of her smile. ""I always had a really wide smile,"" says Ms Virdee. ""I loved smiling. ""It was always the first thing I did entering the classroom - it reassures, it opens up conversation... if I smile now I feel like everything is OK."" Although she concedes the chances are remote, she still dreams of one day returning to the classroom, of reclaiming some of the life she loved but took for granted. Whatever medical developments there are, however, Ms Virdee is resigned to a future full of difficult and sometimes heartbreaking moments. ""But whilst I still can, I'm going to smile as much as possible.""

Five injured in east London 'acid attack',"This video can not be played Footage of police and other emergency services around Stratford has been shared on social media Six people have been injured in Stratford, east London, in a reported acid attack. Police were called to Stratford Centre, opposite Westfield, just before 20:00 BST, following an ""altercation"" between two groups of males where a noxious substance was thrown. Ambulance crews treated six males at the scene for their injuries, and three of them were taken to hospital. A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. Those reported injured were believed to be in a number of different locations, sparking initial fears that people had been sprayed at random. However, the Met Police said those injured were connected to the initial attack. Ch Supt Ade Adelekan said: ""I would like to be very clear concerning this incident. ""What initially may have been perceived as a number of random attacks has, on closer inspection, been found to be one incident involving two groups of males."" No-one suffered life-threatening or life-changing injuries. Witnesses at the scene said an argument had broken out among a group of people. A man who gave his name as Hossen, an assistant manager at Burger King, said a victim had run into the fast food chain to ""wash acid off his face"". One man said a victim ran into a Burger King to ""wash acid off his face"" The 28-year-old added: ""There were cuts around his eyes and he was trying to chuck water into them."" Tahseen Taj lives in one of the buildings just opposite the shopping centre and was disturbed by the noise. ""I could hear a lot of ambulances and police from around 20:45, but also there's a West Ham match today; I thought it must be a football brawl,"" she said. ""But after some time it just increased and increased, and there were a lot of fire brigades and ambulances and police, and it was quite chaotic to be honest. ""I was quite worried.""

Trump under pressure over NFL comments,"This video can not be played Warriors head coach Steve Kerr: Trump comments 'awful' US President Donald Trump is facing growing condemnation from the sports world after his criticism of players. On Friday, Mr Trump said the National Football League (NFL) should fire players who protest during the US anthem. Top football players have attacked Mr Trump in response. The sport's boss called his comments ""divisive"". Hours before Sunday's games, Mr Trumpurged fans to boycott games,externalas a way of making change ""take place fast"". Warning: This article contains language some readers may find offensive. This video can not be played Mr Trump attacked protesting players at a rally in Alabama At a rally on Friday night, Mr Trump said NFL players who protested during the playing of the national anthem should be fired by their team. He was referring to a controversial string of protests started by player Colin Kaepernick last year when he sat or kneeled during the anthem to highlight the treatment of black Americans. ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired,"" he told a cheering crowd. Kaepernick led the San Francisco 49ers to the 2013 Super Bowl, but his status in the team has declined since, and he lost his starting place last year. No team has offered him a job as a quarterback - and his supporters say he is being pushed out because of his political action. But others say his status as a ""free agent"" is down to his performance on the field. What have sports stars said to Trump? How the fans see it NFL commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement saying ""divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect"".

Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter, Alabama Donald Trump spoke for nearly an hour and a half at his rally in Alabama on Friday. The audience of 10,000 was enthusiastic, but one of his biggest applause lines - outside of swipes at North Korea and Hillary Clinton - was when the president took aim at any ""son of a bitch"" in the NFL who protests during the national anthem. The crowd went wild - and the president kept going, lamenting recent rule changes, in response to evidence of devastating brain injuries to players, that seek to punish the most ferocious hits in the game. On Saturday morning the president took to Twitter to fire off line after line attacking the NFL - and athletes in any sport who may have taken issue with his earlier comments. This is a fight Mr Trump relishes. He knows his base will flock to him when he questions the patriotism of wealthy athletes. Lines about tax cuts and healthcare reform on Friday night were duds. No-one cared much when he spoke of striking deals with Democrats. The president knows his audience. And he knows how to change the subject.

US bombers stage N Korea show of force,"A large mass anti-US rally was held in Pyongyang on Saturday US bombers have flown close to North Korea's east coast to demonstrate the military options available to defeat any threat, the Pentagon has said. It said the flight was the farthest north of the demilitarised zone between the Koreas that any US fighter jet or bomber had flown in the 21st Century. Tensions have risen recently over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. At the UN, North Korea's foreign minister said US President Donald Trump was on a ""suicide mission"". Ri Yong-ho'scomments,externalto the General Assembly mimicked Mr Trump's remarks at the UN on Tuesday, when he called North Korean leader Kim Jong-un a ""rocket man on a suicide mission"". Mr Ri added that ""insults"" by Mr Trump - who was, he said, ""mentally deranged and full of megalomania"" - were an ""irreversible mistake making it inevitable"" that North Korean rockets would hit the US mainland. Mr Trump, the foreign minister said, would ""pay dearly"" for his speech, in which he also said he would ""totally destroy"" North Korea if the US was forced to defend itself or its allies. The US president responded to the speech on Twitter by saying Mr Ri and Mr Kim ""won't be around much longer,external"" if they continue their rhetoric. What weapons does North Korea have? How a Pacific nuclear test might happen This video can not be played Trump is making the US an 'inevitable target' Shortly before his address, the Pentagon announced that the show of force underscored ""the seriousness"" with which the US took North Korea's ""reckless"" behaviour, calling the country's weapons programme a ""grave threat"". ""This mission is a demonstration of US resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat,""it said in a statement.,external ""We are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the US homeland and our allies."" US Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers from Guam, escorted by Air Force F-15C Eagle fighters from Okinawa, Japan, flew in international airspace, the Pentagon added. The flight follows a week of heated rhetoric between the leaders of both countries - after Mr Trump's comments, Mr Kim called him ""mentally deranged"" and ""a dotard"". Mr Ri did not comment on the Pentagon's announcement. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' North Korea has refused to stop its missile and nuclear tests, despite successive rounds of UN sanctions. Its leaders say nuclear capabilities are its only deterrent against an outside world seeking to destroy it. After the North's latest and most powerful nuclear test earlier this month, the UN Security Council approved new sanctions on the country. But speaking at the UN, Mr Ri repeated that the restrictions would not make the country stop its nuclear development. Kim's 'dotard' insult explained How do you defend against Pyongyang? This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? Meanwhile,a shallow magnitude 3.4 tremorwas detected near North Korea's nuclear test site on Saturday morning, but experts believe it was a natural earthquake. The quake was recorded at a depth of 0km in North Hamgyong province, home to the Punggye-ri site, South Korea's meteorological agency said. The US Geological Survey also said it occurred in the nuclear test area, but added that its seismologists assessed it as having a depth of 5km. South Korea said no specific sound waves generated by artificial earthquakes were detected. China's Earthquake Administration said the quake was not a nuclear explosion and had the characteristics of a natural tremor. The agency had initially said it was a ""suspected explosion"". What did North Korea's nuclear tests achieve? How advanced is Pyongyang's nuclear programme? Analysts from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), the UN-backed monitoring group, said the quake was ""unlikely man-made"". CTBTO executive secretaryLassina Zerbo tweeted,externalthat the quake had occurred ""about 50km from prior tests"". ""The most probable hypothesis currently is that it is the consequence of the previous event... which could still have further repercussions,"" Mr Zerbo told the AFP news agency, referring to North Korea's massive nuclear test on 3 September. North Korea - which has recently carried out a series of nuclear tests - has so far made no comment. In a separate development, Chinamoved to limit the North Korea's oil supplyand stop buying textiles from the country, in line with the latest UN sanctions. China is North Korea's most important trading partner, and one of its only sources of hard currency. The ban on textiles - Pyongyang's second-biggest export - is expected to cost the country more than $700m (Â£530m) a year. This video can not be played Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? Clothing has often partially been made in North Korea but finished in China, allowing a Made in China label to be legally sewn onto the clothing, BBC World Service Asia-Pacific Editor Celia Hatton says. China also said its restrictions on refined petroleum products would apply from 1 October, and on liquefied natural gas immediately. Under a UN resolution, China will still be able to export a maximum of two million barrels of refined petroleum to North Korea annually, beginning next year. North Korea is estimated to have imported 6,000 barrels of refined petroleum daily from China in 2016 - the equivalent of nearly 2.2 million in total for the entire year.

Thousands of motorists were caught in long queues on the motorway and surrounding roads. Police said a bomb disposal team had been at the scene of the closure between junctions nine and 11 at Winchester. The motorway was closed in both directions from about 04:00 BST, but fully reopened at about 15:30. Hampshire Constabulary said officers were working with fire crews and the Ministry of Defence's Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team to establish what the material on the road was. It has not yet given any further details. Bomb disposal experts were called to the scene Motorists have taken to social media to share pictures of the scene Motorists trapped by the initial motorway closure were able to leave the M3 by 07:00, said Highways England.

Cabinet 'all-out war' over Brexit,"The Sunday papers are dominated by Brexit following Theresa May's speech in Florence on Friday. The Sunday Telegraph claims that the ""fragile"" cabinet truce over the prime minister's transition plan has begun to ""fracture"",external, after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson set out a series of red lines on Brexit - including a demand for the UK not to adopt any new EU rules and regulations during any transition period. The Mail on Sunday goes further,external, arguing that the cabinet split over Brexit has ""erupted into a bitter all-out war"" between Mr Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond. In what it describes as an ""unprecedented clash"" between the great offices of state, the Mail says allies of Mr Hammond have crudely dismissed a claim by supporters of Mr Johnson that Mrs May's speech ""thwarted"" the chancellor's bid to lock the UK into a five-year transition period. With the headline ""I saved Brexit"", theSunday Express says Mr Johnson is claiming credit for Mrs May's speech,external, after he took on Remainers in the cabinet by arguing for a two-year transition period. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox argues that Florence will be added to the roll-call of cities forever associated with the history of the EU - such as Rome, Maastricht and Lisbon - but this time as ""a symbol of a new, more open and future-orientated relationship"". ""We have laid our cards on the table"", he says, ""now is the time for the EU to reveal its hand."" According to former Conservative cabinet minister John Redwood. ""we will only know whether the speech was successful when we see and hear considered responses of the EU and its member states"". Writing in theSunday Express,external, he warns that if Mrs May has failed to persuade them to come to the table in a more positive frame of mind, ""we will be leaving with no deal"". The lead story in the Sunday Times claims to reveal plans by four cabinet ministers to replace Theresa May,externalin the wake of June's general election. Boris Johnson, Philip Hammond, David Davis and Amber Rudd are all said to have been ""embroiled in leadership plots"" after the Conservatives lost their majority in Parliament. More than 30 Labour MPs have written an open letter to the Observer,external, calling on Jeremy Corbyn to commit to ""full and permanent membership"" of the EU single market. The signatories, who also include MEPs, peers and trade union leaders, say Labour needs to offer a clear alternative to the Conservatives over Brexit. Writing in the paper - ahead of Labour's annual conference in Brighton - Mr Corbyn argues it was evident in Florence that the government is ""no clearer"" about our long-term relationship with the EU. Labour, he claims, ""are now the political mainstream"" and ""a government in waiting.""

""We will be working with our colleagues from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, Blackpool Council and utility companies to establish that."" He advised members of the public to stay away from site, which ""remains dangerous"". ""The building will need to be assessed for structural damage and deemed safe before we are able to go inside,"" he said. Residents described the scene as ""absolute carnage"" Neighbouring resident William Burrows said the blast sounded like a loud ""whoosh"", adding: ""Everything just came crumbling in... next door came down like a pack of cards."" Another neighbour, Paul Marks, said: ""There was water, dust and rubble everywhere. It was absolute carnage."" A spokesman from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said: ""After speaking to local residents we knew there were two people inside.

""One had to be lifted down from the first floor on the ladder on a longboard."" Most of the damage was at the back of the property The spokesman said the blast had caused ""significant damage"" to one property. ""It's a row of terraced properties and this one house or block of flats, the front of the house is missing and around the back, part of the property has caved in,"" he said.

How Uber decision will affect young women,"The news that Uberhas lost its licence from Transport for Londonon public safety and security grounds has left some young women wondering how that will affect not just their wallets but their freedom to choose where they travel and when. It decidednot to issue Uber with a new private hire licence,externalafter concluding that the ride-hailing app firm was not fit and proper to hold one. It has concerns about how Uber goes about its background checks on drivers and reports serious offences. Concerns about how Uber deals with alleged attacks have also been raised by the Metropolitan Police Service, following cases such asa driver who was jailedfor assaulting a woman. Uber, meanwhile, says its drivers have to pass the same safety checks as black cab and mini cab drivers. The company has changed the way people stay out and travel home - allowing them to book a cab at the touch of an app. And many women say they are reassured by some of its features. such as the ability for customers and their friends and family to track the journey and the driver; the door-to-door service that keeps people from waiting on the road; and knowing who is collecting them. What does the ruling mean? Seven things Londoners will miss if Uber goes Now what next for Uberisation? Uber has some 3.5 million registered users in London, and many people prefer the service to the alternatives on offer. ""I'm so annoyed,"" says 26-year-old marketing manager Lisette Henry of the licence loss. ""London nightlife is one of the best in the world and I think it's going to restrict a lot of people having access to that."" She uses the app every week and says she depends on it for late-night journeys from the airport after work trips. ""As someone that's not loaded, and a young woman in London, I actually feel really uncomfortable getting the night bus or even the night Tube. Lisette Henry says she cannot afford black cabs ""The area I live in isn't serviced by the night Tube; A night bus would really be the only option I could afford. ""Night Tubes are great but you still have just as many problems with drunk and disorderly people as you do on night buses. (This change is) going to restrict me and I'm not going to go out as much. ""I feel more comfortable because everything is tracked, I know who's picking me up, I know who they are, I know what their contact number is."" Charlie Edmunds says Uber gives her more freedom Charlie Edmunds says a door-to-door service is better than standing late at night at bus stops. ""Being a woman comes with an additional burden of keeping yourself safe,"" she says. Having a cab at the press of a button, she feels, reduces the burden not only of staying secure, but also of being judged if something bad did occur. But she does have reservations about the company, which has faced criticism over vetting drivers, and says it needs to get its house in order. Allow Twitter content?

""I'm lucky I live in zone two, otherwise finding a cab to zone three and beyond can be really hard as many won't take you."" Tara Patel, a chartered accountant, 38, says. She remembers ""plenty"" of occasions when she has been working or out late and there are no black cabs around. And the tracking on Uber that lets her family see her whereabouts ""gives me a greater feeling of security"", she says. Tara Patel says the tracking feature makes her feel secure But Uber has its detractors, and their complaints range from safety issues, as cited in TfL's licence decision, to cost and reliability. Lisa Wilson says she thought the app was a ""great concept"" until one night a driver took an unrecognisable route to her house and she jumped out at traffic lights, ""fearing the worst"". ""I was the middle of nowhere,"" she says. ""Never would I use them nor would I let my daughter who is 18."" Maya Lorford's concern stems from how the service's prices can rise as demand peaks. She felt stung after the estimate for a cab home after a babysitting job tripled from a morning check to an evening booking. Maya Lorford said she had experienced ""outrageous"" price rises with Uber ""The estimation for a taxi ride from my babysitting to my house was Â£6-8,"" she says. ""When I checked back at around 23:30 that evening, the price had risen to Â£20-Â£24. ""I understand raising prices a little at peak times but by 300% is outrageous."" Rachel says she has been ""let down every time I've used the app"", be that on waiting time, or price. ""I've never had a good experience with it and that's before all theimpact on black cabs, theroad networkandconditions for drivers,"" she says. ""Good riddance!"" Uber's licence is due to run until 30 September, but it has 21 days to appeal against TfL's decision on Friday and it will be able to operate while any appeals are ongoing. In the meantime, its users admit it is ""not perfect by a long shot"", as Charlie puts it, but the hope is Uber will rethink how it checks drivers. She is not the only woman anxiously awaiting the outcome.

'Direct anger at Uber' says London mayor,"Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London London Mayor Sadiq Khan says anger from customers and drivers over Uber losing its licence should be directed at the company. More than 500,000 people have signed a petition, started by Uber, to urge Transport for London (TfL) to reverse its decision not to renew the licence. TFL said Uber could not hold a private hire operator licence on the grounds of ""public safety and security"". The ride-hailing app firm said it would appeal against TfL's decision. The petition says: ""If this decision stands, it will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive millions of Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport."" TfL's concerns include Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences. What does London's Uber ban mean? Seven things people will miss if Uber goes Your views: Uber London loses licence Women's safety fears over Uber licence Uber's licence is due to expire on 30 September. It has 21 days to appeal and can continue to operate while any appeals are ongoing. Reacting to the petition reaching more than 500,000 signatures, Mr Khan said: ""I know that Uber has become a popular service for many Londoners - but it would be wrong for TfL to licence Uber if there was any way this could pose a threat to Londoners' safety or security. ""As mayor of London I welcome innovative new companies that help Londoners by providing a better and more affordable service - but providing an innovative service is not an excuse for not following the rules."" This video can not be played Drivers and passengers react to news that Uber's licence in London will be revoked Fred Jones, Uber's UK head of cities, said the mayor and TfL had ""caved to pressure from a small number of individuals and groups that want to protect the status quo and reduce consumer choice and competition from London"". He said the company had operated in London for five-and-a-half years, during which it was audited by TfL. ""The last time they audited us to check we were playing by the rules, they found that there were zero errors in our processes. ""This was one of the strange things around the TfL notice yesterday is they are the ones who do all of the checks and license the drivers."" He said when a driver signed up to the app, Uber made sure they had all the correct paperwork from TfL and that Uber did not carry out background checks itself. In a message to staff, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""It's worth examining how we got here. The truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation. ""It really matters what people think of us."" Kajal Odedra, UK director at Change.org, said it was ""the fastest growing petition we've seen in the UK this year"". ""The speed with which this grew shows how powerful online campaigning can be."" She said the petition showed how quickly the voices of citizens could become part of the debate between governments and corporations. Petitioner Glenn Gathercole, from London, said he added his signature because: ""Uber provides a much-needed alternative to minicabs and black cabs. It is more efficient, safer and economical than the alternatives."" Brighton: Local MP Caroline Lucas said Uber's business model was ""irresponsible to the core"" and that it needed to improve passenger safety so that it could get its licence back Bristol: The city council says it would ""keep an eye on the outcome"" of the dispute with TfL Cambridge: The council will ""look closely"" when it comes to renew Uber's current licence which will expire in December,reports Cambridge News,external Manchester: Uber Britania - a separate company to Uber London - is licensed until 2021 Nottingham: Uber has a licence until 2020, and the council has ""no intention"" to review it any earlier Woking: The borough council says it follows different licensing practices to TfL and has brought in a new strict criminal convictions policy And Twitter user @Gabbysalaza_said,externalshe was ""annoyed"" at the decision as Uber allowed her to get out of ""uncomfy"" situations if out at night. Others have said that the ruling was within the company's control. In 2015, hundreds of black cab drivers held a protest against Uber ""Uber knew the rules. TFL asked them to comply with the rules. Uber refused. What is TFL supposed to do?"" said political commentatorOwen Jones,external. Danielle Louiseâwrote on Twitter,external: ""Londoners are literally more outraged at the loss of Uber than the fact women are being sexually assaulted in fake taxis."" Conservative MP and minister for London Greg Hands said, while the company must address safety concerns, Mr Khan was threatening to leave users ""stranded"" and put thousands out of work. Uber has said the move ""would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said TfL was there to ""protect all of us and I think they are doing the right thing"". Analysis: From BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones Throughout its short, tempestuous life, Uber has clashed with regulators around the world - and more often than not it has come out on top. Its tactic has often been to arrive in a city, break a few rules, and then apologise when it's rapped over the knuckles. Some regulators have backed down, others have run the company out of town. In London, despite protests from angry taxi drivers, the company has had a relatively easy ride until now. But a wave of bad publicity about its corporate culture, its lax attitude to checks on its drivers and its treatment of this freelance army seems to have spurred TfL into action. Make no mistake, Uber will use every legal avenue to fight this ban. It will argue that consumers, in the shape of the millions of mainly young Londoners who rely on its service, will be seriously let down if it can no longer operate. But the courts will have to balance that with the serious concerns about public safety raised by TfL. Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London. Wes Streeting, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Taxis, says the blame lies with Uber for not following the rules. ""You cannot have a situation where, however big the customer base or however big the driver base, an operator that's providing a service like this in a city like ours can simply flout rules and regulations and on things as serious as criminal records checks for their own drivers, and this goes to the heart of passenger safety.""

Ten places to find your old Â£1 coins,"The round Â£1 coin will soon be gone, losing its status as legal tender. In practice, shops will start to refuse to accept these coins from 16 October. They have been used alongside the new 12-sided Â£1 coin since March - a period called co-circulation. Now, there is not long left to spend, bank, exchange or donate old pounds coins but, first, you have to find them. The Treasury and Royal Mint estimate that around 500 million round pounds are still out there somewhere. New Â£1 coin's 'hidden' security feature Royal Mint admits faulty Â£1 coins are in circulation Video: Where the new Â£1 coin is made This video can not be played A brief history of decimal coins Those old, round Â£1 coins might be lurking somewhere around the house. Chris Bird, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Sussex, says one way to find them is to visualise a situation when you had a handful of loose change. ""We can use our memory to imagine situations when we would use them and where we would leave them,"" he says. ""That is what the memory is for. We use our memory to make decisions in the now and in the future."" He says that a fairly recent discovery reveals that we use the same part of our brain to remember the past as we do to imagine ourselves in a certain situation. So the same mechanism in the brain's memory system allows us not only to travel back, but also to consider the present or the future. The other way to find those old coins, according to Mr Bird, is simply to check all of the places that you know are where you commonly keep change. So here is a handy list of 10 places to look: Sometimes the most obvious is the last place you look. Shops can give the round Â£1 coins as change until 16 October, so they could be popped into a wallet or purse in a rush. The Royal Mint has been encouraging shops to bag the round pounds separately so, when they are banked, they are taken out of circulation. The most clichÃ©d answer to the question of where to find loose change. Honestly, when was the last time you found coins down there? But when was the last time you looked? It is probably worth checking in the next few days, along with armchairs, and beds. Even if you do not find any money, you may come across the remote control for the DVD player. You have finished your Friday night big shop and you are about to carry your groceries to the bus or car, but first you lock up the supermarket trolley and your Â£1 coin pops out of the mechanism. Into the bag for life it goes. Perhaps it is still there? If the bag really is for life, then it might be sitting in the back of the cupboard under the stairs. Most supermarket trolleys have now been altered to accept the new 12-sided Â£1 coin, but there was a delay at Tesco when the new coin was launched in March. It is only used on special occasions, so it might be at the back of the wardrobe or hanging on a peg behind a few coats. The chances are that there is still a bit of cash in there, maybe some change from the bar or the taxi home. If you go out a lot, you will have found the cash already. If you have young children, then the last big night was probably months ago. While you are still at the back of the wardrobe, why not check the pockets of your winter coats. It is unlikely that they have been worn since the new 12-sided Â£1 coin entered circulation on 28 March, and they might not be worn again before 16 October. The old Â£1 coins cannot be spent in the shops after that date, but they can continue to be deposited into an account at most High Street banks and the Post Office for the foreseeable future. Any top drawer around the house seems a natural place to throw some loose change - even if it has socks in it. It might also be the chance to declutter. Is the only reason that the top drawer is always overflowing while the bottom is fine simply because we are too lazy to bend down? Children's financial habits are formed by the age of seven, according to the government-backed Money Advice Service. So if your children are super savers, then there could be quite a few Â£1 coins in their piggy banks. Junior savings accounts can generally be opened with as little as Â£1, to keep that savings habit going. It may be a chance for the youngsters to spend the fruits of their savings labours before there is a scene in the toy shop when the cashier refuses an old, lovingly saved Â£1 coin. It is worth remembering too that tooth fairies should no longer use old, round Â£1 coins from 16 October. Many homes will have a charity pot of some kind, ranging from those big glass bottles to a cardboard shoe box. The UK Treasury and the Royal Mint have joined forces with the BBC's Children in Need appeal to ask anyone who finds some old Â£1 coins to donate them to the charity. ""We are encouraging everyone who can, to promise their round pounds to Pudsey,"" says Andrew Jones, exchequer secretary to the Treasury. There are probably many more coins in vehicle glove compartments than gloves. A recent survey by the AA motoring organisation suggested drivers have been avoiding parking spots that require payment by phone as cash remained a more popular way to pay. Many drivers keep coins in the glove compartment for parking fares, and in that little well by the gear stick that is designed to hold cups. Attendance at the gym or sports centre may have waned a little since the subscription was bought with good intentions in the new year. The gym bag may actually have been unopened throughout the summer. In which case, the Â£1 coins for the locker may be old round ones, rather than new 12-sided ones. Dig them out, pop them in the bank, and save them ready for January's subscription renewal, when the good intentions start all over again. Thickness: 2.8mm  - thinner than old coin Weight: 8.75g - lighter than old coin Diameter: 23.4mm - larger than old coin Number to enter circulation: 1.5 billion - about 23 per person.

Five hurt after substance 'sprayed',"This video can not be played Footage of police and other emergency services around Stratford has been shared on social media Six people have been injured in Stratford, east London, in a reported acid attack. Police were called to Stratford Centre, opposite Westfield, just before 20:00 BST, following an ""altercation"" between two groups of males where a noxious substance was thrown. Ambulance crews treated six males at the scene for their injuries, and three of them were taken to hospital. A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.

Three hurt in guest house 'gas explosion',"Two people were taken to hospital and two were treated at the scene in Charles Street A 72-year-old woman remains in a serious condition after a suspected gas explosion at a Blackpool guest house, police have said. The woman and a 29-year-old man were rescued from the rubble after the blast in Charles Street just before 18:00 BST on Saturday. His condition is not thought to be serious. Four others were treated at the scene for minor injuries. An investigation is under way into the cause of the blast. Neighbouring residents have since returned home after they were evacuated and all roads have reopened, police said. A woman and a man were trapped under the rubble Emergency services rescued a man from the first floor Ch Insp Ian Cooper, from Lancashire Police, said: ""We are happy that everyone is accounted for and we have moved from a safety and recovery operation into the investigation phase to understand what the cause was. ""We will be working with our colleagues from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, Blackpool Council and utility companies to establish that."" He advised members of the public to stay away from site, which ""remains dangerous"". ""The building will need to be assessed for structural damage and deemed safe before we are able to go inside,"" he said. Residents described the scene as ""absolute carnage"" Neighbouring resident William Burrows said the blast sounded like a loud ""whoosh"", adding: ""Everything just came crumbling in... next door came down like a pack of cards."" Another neighbour, Paul Marks, said: ""There was water, dust and rubble everywhere. It was absolute carnage."" A spokesman from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said: ""After speaking to local residents we knew there were two people inside. ""One of them was on the phone to our control room saying they were inside, and we could see another casualty. ""They were physically trapped. ""One had to be lifted down from the first floor on the ladder on a longboard."" Most of the damage was at the back of the property The spokesman said the blast had caused ""significant damage"" to one property. ""It's a row of terraced properties and this one house or block of flats, the front of the house is missing and around the back, part of the property has caved in,"" he said.

Student left in cave for three days,"Lukas Cavar says he licked moisture from the cave walls to survive A US student spent almost three days trapped inside a cave after he was left behind on a university field trip. Lukas Cavar, 19, was visiting the Sullivan Cave in southern Indiana with the Indiana University Caving Club on Sunday. He was separated from the rest of the group who then left without him, locking the gated entrance. ""I was very confused and pretty scared,"" he told theIndiana Daily Student.,external ""It took me a little while to wrangle my emotions and sort of approach things analytically, sensibly, to come up with a game plan to survive"", he said. He told the student newspaper that he licked moisture off cave walls to stay hydrated and wrote goodbye messages to his family on his mobile phone. Despite shouting for help, he was not rescued until late on Tuesday night when the president of the Caving Club realised he was missing and returned to the cave. In a post on Facebook, Mr Cavar said: ""Just wanted to let everyone know that I'm safe and sound! Just got rescued about 30 minutes ago. Boy, it's good to be back on the surface!"". The Caving Club said there had been a ""failure of leadership"". They said: ""We have a series of rigorous protocols in place that are supposed to prevent situations like this, but they are only effective if followed. We had a failure in our leadership to closely follow all these safety procedures.""

Iran tests missile in defiance of Trump,"This video can not be played State TV broadcast footage of the missile test at an undisclosed location Iran says it has successfully tested a new medium-range missile, in defiance of US President Donald Trump. The launch of the Khoramshahr missile, which has a range of 2,000 km (1,242 miles), was shown on state TV. It is unclear when the test took place. On Friday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would increase its military power ""as a deterrent"". US President Donald Trump criticised the launch, saying the missile was capable of hitting its ally Israel. The Khoramshahr missile was first displayed at a military parade on Friday in Tehran. It is capable of carrying multiple warheads, Iranian media report. Iran votes to boost its missile defence What will happen to the Iran nuclear deal? Key messages from Donald Trump's UN speech Iran's Defence Minister, Gen Amir Hatami, outlined the missile's ""unique specifications"". ""The ability to evade the enemy's air defence line and to be guided from the moment of launch until the target is hit turns Khoramshahr into a tactical missile,"" he said. Iran would ""not seek permission from any country for producing various kinds of missile"", he added. By Kasra Naji, Special Correspondent, BBC Persian By test-firing a new missile, Iran is sending another signal of defiance taken straight from the North Korean textbook. The missile test is arguably a borderline case as far as the UN Security Council is concerned. A resolution calls on Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The test comes ahead of two significant dates in the US: The Trump administration is due to announce the details of its strategy vis-Ã -vis Iran around the end of September On 15 October, Mr Trump will have to certify to Congress that Iran is compliant with the nuclear deal it reached with world powers in 2015. If Mr Trump refuses to certify compliance, Congress will have 60 days to re-impose sanctions on Iran Iran's test is a message to the US that it is determined to defend itself in any way it sees fit but it could also ultimately work against Iran as world public opinion will compare it to North Korea. Missile tests in Iran are said to require the approval of Mr Rouhani, and now it seems he has been pushed into a corner with the hardliners in Iran who see the North Korean path as the best response to Mr Trump's rhetoric and his disdain for the nuclear deal. Rouhani warns US against 'political suicide' Iran could restart nuclear programme 'within hours' The US announced fresh sanctions on Iran in July over its ballistic missile programme and what it said was Iran's support for terror organisations. It also imposed sanctions on Iran after a ballistic missile test in January. It says such launches violate the spirit of the 2015 agreement between Iran and six world powers to limit its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump criticised Iran and accused it, without elaborating, of co-operating with the North Korean regime. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Rouhani responded by referring to a ""rogue newcomer to international politics"" and deplored the US leader's ""ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric"". He said his country would ""not be the first"" to violate the deal, which Mr Trump has threatened to pull out of despite other signatories and international monitors saying Iran has stuck by its terms.

North Korea's quake 'not nuclear test',"News of the earthquake was broadcast in Seoul, South Korea A shallow magnitude 3.4 tremor has been detected near North Korea's nuclear test site, but experts believe it was a natural earthquake. South Korea said the specific soundwaves of man-made quakes were not recorded, while China said the tremor's features were of a natural quake. International nuclear test monitors expressed a similar view. North Korea - which has recently carried out a series of nuclear tests - has so far made no comments. Pyongyang's latest massive nuclear test on 3 September was widely condemned at the UN, triggering more international sanctions against North Korea. Decoding Kim's nuclear Pacific threat North Korea: Does this mean war? The size of Saturday's tremor was smaller than the earthquakes registered as a result of all of North Korea's six nuclear tests. After the last test, which North Korea said was a hydrogen bomb, initial reports from the US Geological Survey (USGS) put the tremor at magnitude 5.6 with a depth of 10km (six miles) - but this was later upgraded to magnitude 6.3 at 0km. Saturday's quake was recorded at a depth of 0km in North Hamgyong province, home to thePunggye-ri nuclear site, South Korea's meteorological agency said. The USGS also said it occurred in the nuclear test area - but added that its seismologists assessed it as having a depth of 5km. South Korea said no specific soundwaves generated by artificial earthquakes were detected. China's Earthquake Administration said the quake was not a nuclear explosion and had the characteristics of a natural tremor. The administrations had initially said it was a ""suspected explosion"" Analysts from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), the UN-backed monitoring group, said the quake was ""unlikely man-made"". CTBTO executive secretary Lassina Zerbo tweeted,externalthat the quake occurred ""about 50km from prior tests"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Trump rails against Obamacare rebels,"President Trump said Republicans who oppose the new plan ""don't have the guts to vote for it"" US President Donald Trump has hit out at Republicans who are refusing to back the latest effort to repeal Obama-era healthcare legislation. Speaking in Alabama, he said senators from his party who opposed the repeal lacked ""the guts to vote for it."" Senator John McCain dealt the Trump administration's efforts a potentially fatal blow when he said he could not vote for it ""in good conscience"". President Trump said his criticism was ""unexpected"" and ""terrible"". ""They gave me a list of 10 people that were absolute no's,"" he said. ""John McCain was not on the list so that was a totally unexpected thing, terrible, honestly terrible."" ""We're going to do it eventually,"" he added. Republicans need 50 votes in the 100-seat Senate, which they control 52-48, to succeed. With Democrats united in opposition, the vote is now on a knife edge. Why is Obamacare so controversial? Obamacare v Republican plan compared Where Trump went wrong on healthcare Mr McCain's objection could doom conservatives' seven-year campaign to erase former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. It is the second time Mr McCain has thwarted his party leadership on the issue. It was wrong, he said, to pass such far-reaching legislation without input from the Democrats, and said the bill demanded extensive hearings, debate and amendment. This video can not be played Mr McCain's ""no"" vote in July scuppered the last Republican bid to repeal Obamacare ""That is the only way we might achieve bipartisan consensus on lasting reform,"" he wrote, ""without which a policy that affects one-fifth of our economy and every single American family will be subject to reversal with every change of administration and congressional majority."" Of other Republican senators: Rand Paul, is also against the latest repeal bill Susan Collins said she was ""leaning against the bill"" because she was worried the legislation did not do enough to protect patients with pre-existing conditions Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran are undecided Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter As several Republican senators explained - ones who were firm ""yesses"" - the main attraction for the plan was that it was the only plan on the table. Now it appears Republicans will have to go back to the drawing board. Although the end of September is the deadline for passing a bill with a simple majority in the Senate for this federal budget, there's no reason the party couldn't start the wheels turning for another vote next year - or, conceivably, simply change the rules, as Donald Trump has suggested. None of that will alter the simple dynamic that made itself clear over the course of the past months, however. The Republican Party, despite campaigning ferociously for Obamacare repeal for nearly seven years, could never agree on how to turn those promises into reality without sending the healthcare industry into a tailspin. Read more from Anthony Follow@awzurcher,external The Republican leadership had evidently hoped Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the bill's authors, might be able to persuade his close friend Mr McCain to back the measure. Undeterred, Mr Graham vowed: ""We press on."" US Vice-President Mike Pence said the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill was the ""last best chance"" to repeal Obamacare. President Trump has been phoning lawmakers and state governors in a bid to tilt the scales in favour of the bill but several Republican governors this week also criticised the process as rushed. And 16 major medical groups issued a joint statement against the Republican legislation. This video can not be played 'Trump not thinking about the little people' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was planning to bring the legislation to a vote next week but it is unclear now if that will go ahead. Republicans are still reeling from the collapse in July of their efforts to secure Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal Obamacare. US health groups condemn Republican plan A dramatic late-night ""no"" vote from Mr McCain - just days after he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour - sank that bill, too. According toanalysis,externalby the non-partisan Brookings Institution, if the Graham-Cassidy bill were to pass, 32 million fewer Americans would have health insurance by 2027. Allow Twitter content?

The new bill would give states money in block grants to run their own healthcare programmes. But critics say that when left to the states, the money going into the Medicaid programme for people on low incomes would diminish.

Colin Firth becomes Italian citizen,"British actor Colin Firth has become an Italian citizen, the country's authorities have confirmed. His wife - film producer Livia Giuggioli - is Italian, making the Oscar-winning Bridget Jones star eligible for citizenship there. The 56-year-old now has dual citizenship and can therefore keep his British passport. Firth said he had applied for an Italian passport because of ""the uncertainty around"". The actor said that he has been connected to Italy ""for more than two decades now"". ""I was married there and had two children born in Rome,"" he added. He said that his wife was applying for a British passport also, and both his children have dual citizenship. He added: ""We never really thought much about our different passports. ""But now, with some of the uncertainty around, we thought it sensible that we should all get the same."" Colin Firth has been married to Italian Livia Giuggioli since 1997 The Italian interior ministry, which confirmed Firth had been granted a passport, said: ""The very famous actor, who won an Oscar for the film The King's Speech, is married to a citizen from our country and has often declared his love for our land."" Firth, who won best actor at the 2011 Oscars for his portrayal of King George in The King's Speech, has been married since 1997. He added: ""I will always be extremely British (you only have to look at or listen to me). ""Britain is our home and we love it here."" He said that he will continue to base his career out of the UK, but added: ""Anyone will tell you when you marry an Italian you don't just marry one person; you marry a family and perhaps an entire country. ""Like almost everybody I have a passionate love of Italy and joining my wife and kids in being dual citizens will be a huge privilege.""

Tremor detected near N Korea test site,"News of the earthquake was broadcast in Seoul, South Korea A shallow magnitude 3.4 tremor has been detected near North Korea's nuclear test site, but experts believe it was a natural earthquake.

Strictly Come Dancing stars in quotes,"The Reverend Richard Coles and Good Morning Britain's Charlotte Hawkins are raring to go After two weeks of rehearsals, this year's Strictly Come Dancing stars are preparing to return to the dance floor this weekend for the first live show of the series. Here's what they had to say when we caught up with them earlier this month. ""There's a dog collar being pimped apparently, we're quite excited about that."" ""I was preaching quite a fierce sermon recently and a piece of glitter fell out of my hair."" ""I'm going to need a miracle. It's 'let us spray' at the moment."" ""I'm going to have to launch myself across a dancefloor, which I haven't done since Ibiza in 1990. And it wasn't pretty then, believe me."" ""I'm very happy to volunteer to dance with Aljaz anywhere, any place, any time."" ""I jumped at the chance [to do Strictly]. It was a no-brainer for me. It's afterwards when people go 'it's really full on, it's going to be scary.'"" ""You've just got to throw yourself into it and love every minute."" On Good Morning Britain co-host Piers Morgan: ""He's very excited. Piers said we're going to have fun with this - but that sounded more of a threat."" ""I'm looking forward to the ones [where] you've got a bit of performance and attitude - it's amazing to have that opportunity where you give it some."" On being one of this year's favourites to win: ""I don't know how they work out the odds because they haven't seen us dance!"" Burke will dance with Gorka Marquez on the show ""I am very nervous - it makes me want to throw up because my anxiety shoots through the roof when I think about live shows. I know this is a really funny thing to say coming from someone who won a TV show nine years ago but I hate cameras."" ""The moment that I found out that I was going to take part in Strictly, I cancelled everything. I cancelled my album, my single, recording, everything. My mum always said to me, 'be great at one thing, and the rest will follow.'"" ""Because I was a nun for a year [for Sister Act: The Musical] wearing flat shoes, I've been trying to wear heels a lot more just to try and give my ankles a bit more strength."" On how far she'll go in the contest: ""I want to get as far as my body and my partner can take!"" Langsford has been partnered with Anton Du Beke ""Everything has this Strictly excitement about it, which is very glamorous - things you don't get to do every day."" Asked if she would wear skimpy outfits: ""I'll only be getting my kit off privately in the spray tan booth."" On the show's costumes: ""It's amazing, they gave me a waist - I hadn't seen that waist for a long time."" On keeping her appearance in the show a secret: ""I quite enjoyed the whole rumour mill. Contrary to popular belief, I've not been asked to do Strictly before - because not in a million years would I have turned it down."" What her husband Eamonn Holmes said (with tongue in cheek) when asked about the ""Strictly curse"": ""One man's curse could be another man's blessing."" EastEnders star Ghadami is paired with new professional dancer Nadiya Bychkova ""There's always something to look forward to [on Strictly]. It seems like a non-stop rollercoaster where you're looking to the next thing."" On the outfits: ""We've tried the skimpy, rhinestone-laden clothes and frankly they're very comfortable and fun to wear."" Asked if he would be showing off his chest: ""If the dance calls for it, maybe later on in the competitionâ¦ if it's standard in week three, four or five we'll do it."" On how his on-screen mum reacted to him being on the show: ""Bonnie Langford couldn't help herself. As soon as she found out, she threw herself at me and we had a little dance."" ""We're all going to look back in years to come and say 'we were part of that'."" Professional dancer AJ Pritchard looked chuffed to be paired up with Mollie King On whether being pop stars gives her and Aston Merrygold an advantage: ""I think we're used to being disciplined to a certain degree. But there's an expectation that people have and I think, Aston and I, we feel we're both terrified, it's a whole new world for both of us."" ""We don't want to look like complete wallies. There's so much for us to learn."" ""Obviously we're lucky that we have performance experience but it's a whole new world of dance, which is just madness."" On the sparkly outfits: ""You go into a fitting and it's the most sequinned glittery dress you've ever seen, and they go to you: 'Obviously it's not glittery enough so we'll be adding more'. And you're like, 'what?'"" On the chances of winning: ""Everybody who's taking part, obviously it's their dream to lift the glitterball trophy - but I just want to learn as many dances as possible, that's my aim. And get a few spray tans."" Aston was hoping for a short partner so was relieved when he was teamed with Janette Manrara ""I'm actually just excited to try a whole new form of performance. You forget it's a competition."" ""You want to see everyone pull through."" On preparing to be a new dad: ""I'm trying to get the daddy stuff done in the morning and the rehearsals in the afternoons."" On training to get in shape for the skimpy outfits: ""I'm not as nimble as I used to be. There's a lot of glitter - I've been Strictly-fied."" ""I personally would just love to get to the final, to do all the weeks and learn everything on the way and learn all the different styles. But it doesn't feel like a competition."" McGee, pictured with Tess Daly and Giovanni Pernice, is the widow of magician Paul Daniels On doing ballet dancing in the past: ""Strictly has changed over the years. At the beginning it really was that you didn't have any training. Lots of people have done it now who have. I did train as a ballet dancer over 30 years ago. But it's like if you were at school and really good at high jump, and 35 years later you're asked to enter a competition and you've got to do long jump."" On late husband Paul Daniels, who previously took part in the show: ""He would love it. He always wanted me to do it. He'd be smiling down on me, that's for sure."" Susan Calman has a poster of her dance partner Kevin Clifton in her kitchen On having a moment with professional Gorka: ""When I walked into the dressing rooms, one of the male dancers, I'm not going to say who - Gorka - had his top off. And I've actively avoided any contact with the male species for my entire life. And I went.... 'he's beautiful!'"" ""I went home and my wife was like, 'how's it going?' And there aren't words to process what's happening."" On her fellow contestants: ""We're all in the same boat - we're all going to learn how to dance."" Karen Clifton said she was pleased to be partnered with chef Simon Rimmer - because he'll bring good food to rehearsals ""I feel I've made 14 new friends, whatever else happens. I know more about Joe and Davood than I do about people I've known 10 years."" ""It's like a holiday romance. The minute you meet each other, you have to bond quickly because you're all in the same terrifying situation."" ""There's two WhatsApp groups. There's the official one which everyone involved in Strictly gets to see. Then there's the private one we have with the dancers which they don't get to see, which is the proper fun one."" On his family's reaction to him taking part: ""My wife rolled her eyes and shook her head."" McFadden looked both excited and nervous when he was paired with Katya Jones On the whole Strictly experience: ""We're all thrown together and going through this crazy thing together."" On appearing in Holby at the same time as Strictly: ""They've assured me they're going to give me some light storylines. It's filmed across the road - I always wanted to see what goes on over here and now I can."" ""We're all getting rhinestone envy a bit. Jonnie had one the other day that was all different colours - it was really nice - and we had plain ones."" Atkinson and Aljaz Skorjanec are possibly the tallest couple in the contest ""It sounds really cheesy but we're in a nice bubble and we're all in it together. It's all good."" ""My worst fear is - you know when you run up the stairs after you dance? Falling off the stairs - that for me is more nerve-wracking. You're going to be wobbly and out of breath."" ""My family have all been saying 'You've done so well, it's amazingâ¦ but it would be good if you could do Strictly.' So they're all going to come down. Everything's happened at the right time."" Akudolu and Pasha Kovalev are wasting no time ""Forgetting the dance is the biggest fear. And falling down the stairs - but if we fall, we just pose and get up again."" On advice from previous contestants: ""I know Tameka [Empson] who did it last year - she said 'enjoy it, enjoy it, enjoy it.' She would have loved to go further and said 'I'm going to live it through you.'"" ""I'm dreading the waltz - it just hurts your legs! I've never done anything like that, and holding your arms up like that for a while, your back musclesâ¦"" ""I think our personalities change the minute we've got our make-up on, and the hair and the dresses. I become Aretha - that's my nickname."" Peacock and Oti Mabuse were all smiles after being paired up ""It's a whirlwind at the moment - I'm just trying to enjoy it as much as possible. And then you sit at home and you get really nervous that you're actually doing it."" On seeing Davood at a costume fitting: ""I got to stare at this lovely man's derriere in a pair of tight Latin trousers - there's not many better sights."" On whether being an athlete will be an advantage: ""Athletics is quite a high-impact sport. It's going to be very different but that's what I'm really looking forward to. I'm not sure it's an advantage because it's so far removed."" On advice on training from former contestant Greg Rutherford: ""I had a text from Greg saying - 'they'll say it's 12 hours, it's more like 40.'"" Conley gave the thumbs up to his partner Amy Dowden ""It's so special. It's the biggest show on national television and the level of professionalism from everyone is second to none. And we get very posh cars picking us up - my car had a massage chair. I've never been in a car so posh!"" ""I'm very excited - genuinely excited. I love the show, my family have, so you do feel you know it.  But you work so hard all week for one-and-a-half minutes live to the nation and worry that something silly might go wrong. You just want to do your best."" On working with judge Craig Revel Horwood in the past: ""I was really worried about working with Craig - it was on a show about Neil Diamond. But he was a pussycat. I'm sure he won't be on this! He's so knowledgeable - that man knows his stuff. He's known as the 'evil one' but what he says is very constructive and it's good to take that on board."" On only getting two tickets for friends and family per show: ""I'm selling mine on eBay - 10 grand each. I want to stay in the show so I could make 20 grand a week.""

Bosnia's war-ravaged Olympic track comes back to life,"This video can not be played Take a ride down the track with some of the team rebuilding it A summer luge may look like a plastic tray on wheels. But at full speed it hurtles around the concrete banking of Sarajevo's Olympic bobsleigh track with the roar of a Star Wars TIE fighter swooping in for the kill. There are no barriers to prevent encroachment on the track, but standing clear is essential. Flat out, the flimsy vehicle careers down the course at almost 140km/h (87mph). There is an undeniable irony about a Winter Olympic luge track that comes to life in the summer but has to close when the temperatures drop. A cursory inspection of the course reveals why high-speed action on ice is currently impossible. The structure of the luge track has seen better days, but the site at Mount Trebevic is still a draw for visitors The lighting stanchions that once illuminated night-time racing are twisted and denuded of their bulbs; the track's refrigeration pipes have been ripped out; and, at the top of the course, the start houses are in ruins. All a legacy of the ruinous conflict in the 1990s, when Mount Trebevic became a strategic asset for Bosnian Serb forces. Bosnia's young students challenge ethnically divided classes Bosnian mural honours David Bowie Bosnia-Herzegovina country profile ""During the war, this was the frontline,"" says Senad Omamovic, the president of the Bosnian Luge Federation and the driving force behind the unlikely revival of the track. Part of the track lies in ruins, cordoned off from lugers keen to practise Senad Omamovic is trying to restore Bosnia's luge track to its former glory Senad watched the 1984 Games as a frustrated spectator, then became an international luger for the rest of the decade. The war of the 1990s brought his sporting career to a shuddering halt - and left his home track shattered. But still he insists there is no course that can compare with Sarajevo. ""For me, for sure, this is the best track in the world. Before the war we had three World Cup races here every year, in bob, luge and skeleton. Many athletes and colleagues from other countries say it's really nice - safe, technical and fast. Really, really fast."" Now he is working to bring fast times back to Sarajevo. Sporting a t-shirt with the slogan ""Sarajevo is still alive"", Senad pitches in with the repair work on the track. The lower half of the course is now fit for use in the summer - and attracting a new generation of Bosnian lugers. Mirza Nikolaev (R) and his team-mate Hamza have spent the summer practising on the old track 16-year-old Mirza Nikolaev asked his parents to take him to the track after catching an item on the local TV news programme. He quickly established himself as a member of Bosnia's junior luge team. ""I fell in love with the sport instantly. Senad introduced me to it and I loved it. I wanted to do it a hundred times a day,"" he says. For Mirza and his team-mates, practice on the Sarajevo track makes winter competition around Europe possible. ""If I hadn't practised here, it would have been a disaster on ice,"" he says. ""It helps a lot that we have our own track; only nine countries have one."" Speed there may be, but glamour is in short supply. The tattered skinsuits that Mirza and his team-mate Hamza use betray both the dangers of the sport - and the lack of funding. And if they want to keep practising, they have to get their hands dirty. Hamza is also on Bosnia's junior luge team ""We help to rebuild the track,"" says Mirza. ""Every year we come after the winter is over and everything has gone rotten, everything has cracked after the snow and rain. Every single thing that we previously fixed is broken again. So we have to keep fixing it every year."" Even in its reduced state, the track is quite spectacular. Multi-coloured graffiti covers its banks as they sweep down the forested slopes of Mount Trebevic. Thrill-seeking mountain-bikers record their runs on helmet-mounted cameras, and foreign tourists come to gawp as if they were exploring a Cambodian temple half-consumed by jungle. Local guides make a decent living from bringing guests up Trebevic and allowing them to amble on to the unrestored top half of the course. The site needs constant attention and much of the structure needs replacing ""Where else in the world can you come and walk down a bobsleigh track?"" asks Asim, as he directs a small group of young tourists towards the concrete. But despite the income to be made, he would prefer to see the track restored to its former glory - with winter racing. ""I would jump out of joy to see this going again. How many cities in Europe boast a bobsleigh track and can train their people there? You could rent this; other people would come here - the city could earn money from this."" Senad shares this vision and believes he is winning the battle to bring the Sarajevo track back to Olympic standard. ""Lots of people from outside want to invest to rebuild the track,"" he says. ""Now many countries come here for training - Slovakia, Poland, Slovenia. And this year they want to come from Sweden and Norway. This is great for us."" Sarajevo is hosting the next Winter European Youth Olympic Festival in 2019 - 35 years on from its moment in the international sporting spotlight. Restoring the track in time might seem an impossible dream, but Bosnia's young lugers believe it can be done. Can Serb mayor ease Bosnia's Srebrenica pain?

Could FC Barcelona be kicked out of La Liga?,"All FC Barcelona's fans are passionate about football... and many are passionate about Catalan independence FC Barcelona has been anything but a neutral bystander on the question of Catalan independence in recent years. It has firmly nailed its colours to the mast of the movement planning a referendum on the issue on 1 October - a referendum declared illegal by the central government in Madrid. But its position has raised more pressing questions as the situation has become more heated, with militarised Civil Guard police dispatched to arrest pro-secessionist officials and seize referendum materials. Wouldn't an independent Catalonia deprive Spain's La Liga of one of its most prestigious clubs? And what about the fans of the world-famous El ClÃ¡sico grudge matches between BarÃ§a and arch-rival Real Madrid, a series in which the latter is tantalisingly just ahead on 95 victories to 91? Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Those in charge at FC Barcelona insist they are not politicians; the club neither has an position on voting Yes for independence, nor in which league it would compete in the hypothetical situation of Catalonia seceding from Spain. The club has allowed pro-independence rallies to take place in its Camp Nou stadium But in 2014 FC Barcelona joined the National Pact on the Right to Decide, a platform comprising political parties and civil society organisations in favour of a referendum on independence for Catalonia. On Wednesday, as the Civil Guard were arresting Catalan government officials, the club released perhaps itsmost blatantly political statement ever,external, saying it was defending ""democracy, freedom of speech, and self-determination"". Whatever happens over the next few weeks and months, FC Barcelona seems to believe that it will always be able to choose which league it plays in. Even if Catalans opted to leave Spain, BarÃ§a believes that Spain will never want to stop watching El ClÃ¡sico. Guardiola stars at Catalan protest rally ""We will stay in the same league as Espanyol,"" said FC Barcelona's vice-president, Carles VillarubÃ­, earlier this month in reference to the Catalan capital's second club, whose fans are considered to be pro-Spanish. But Javier Tebas, the president of Spain's Professional Football League, which organises La Liga, struck back: ""Barcelona cannot choose where it plays if there is an independence process in Catalonia."" FC Barcelona has won 24 La Liga titles, including the inaugural tournament in 1929. It has also won 29 Copa del Rey national cups, more than any other club. There have been 235 official games between Barcelona and Real Madrid, stretching back to a Copa del Rey match in 1916. Real have won 95, BarÃ§a 91 and 46 have ended in draws. A well-placed source inside the club has told the BBC that there will be no official statements on what remains purely a ""hypothetical scenario"". But, the source added: ""If the situation of Catalan independence arose, the club would have to take into account the opinion of its members before making such an important decision. ""Secondly, and with all due respect, we believe we are one of the leading brands in world football and any league would be eager to have us, including Spain's."" Gabriel RufiÃ¡n, a member of Spain's Congress for the Catalan Republican Left party, said that BarÃ§a's continued presence in the Spanish league would be no more incongruous than Monaco playing in the French league. Few people seem willing to contemplate a Catalan national league dominated by one of the world's biggest clubs. The idea of Lionel Messi taking on semi-professional Catalan defenders each Sunday does not bear thinking about. ""I cannot imagine the Spanish Liga without Barcelona,"" said Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. ""I just can't see it as a fan of football and of sport in general."" Guardiola stars at Catalan protest rally Catalonia's quarrel with Spain explained Spain steps up raids to halt Catalan vote Madrid court fines Catalan officials At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

The UK slaves 'living in the dark',"Maria and Kim say they were paid nothing for their work One woman clutches a tissue. Then, a simple question: ""What happened to you?"" That's when the tears come. ""My employer is not good for meâ¦"" Maria has barely got her first words out when the emotion overwhelms her. She continues her tale, weeping, sniffing. You can barely make out what she is saying. But you do not need words to understand. She was born in the Philippines and left the country to take up a job as a domestic worker for a woman in the Gulf. In April this year, she moved to Britain. Maria got a visa and came in legally. Since arriving, she has been exploited - sometimes, barely fed. She is expected to work round the clock. She has not been paid for five months. Maria escaped from her employer just the week before she gave this interview. Her fear is raw. Kim escaped a similar situation some time ago. Yet even for her, the memory of the way she was treated by the people who employed her as a maid is still painful. There are tens of thousands in slave-like conditions in the UK, says the anti-slavery commissioner ""This family, they think you are rubbish. One time they tell me, 'All you Filipina are slaves.'"" Like Maria, Kim is not her real name - we are protecting both women as they have recently managed to escape. They are being helped by a charity - Justice for Domestic Workers. The people Kim worked for flew here in a private jet to live in a mansion. She has not been paid a penny. It is estimated there are 40 million people living and working in slave-like conditions globally. Even in the UK - which the country's anti-slavery commissioner, Kevin Hyland, says is ""streets ahead"" of other countries - it is thought there are tens of thousands. The British government has made tackling slavery a priority. At Britain's borders there are more officers trained to spot people-trafficking. From the control centre behind the one-way glass at Heathrow airport, they are keeping a close eye on who is coming in, their documents, any signs of distress. Officials watch at Heathrow airport for signs of potential trafficked people But how do you spot modern-day slaves - when often even they will not know the kind of treatment they are about to receive once they arrive? Training helps - so does a bit of luck. Amanda Reid, the national operational lead for safeguarding and modern slavery in the Border Force, remembers one such moment. ""The roving officer at the gates spotted a young lady carrying a really rather large Disney toy and happened to say, 'What's that for?' and she didn't have an immediate answer. ""Very soon after that we then saw another [young lady carrying a really rather large Disney toy]. ""And this was really an indication something wasn't right. ""Her story unravelled, and it was clear she was heading for exploitation."" Immigration officials say the toy was being used by criminal gangs as a ""marker"". The toys were meant to identify the victims of trafficking to the people meeting them in arrival halls In the first three months of this year, more then 200 potential victims have been identified at the British border. But the efforts go far beyond one national boundary. This is a $150bn (Â£110bn) a year industry. And in source countries around the world Britain has officers working with local officials to help victims, and to educate people about the dangers of falling into the traffickers' trap. Modern slavery and trafficking 'in every UK town and city' Five charged with slavery offences Slavery checks not fit for purpose at UK firms, report says That is the kind of international approach Justine Currell wants to see happen more. She helped draft the Modern Slavery Act at the Home Office. Now, she is the executive director of Unseen - a charity helping victims of slavery. People ""either come here for a better life"", she says, or they are ""duped or coerced or deceived into thinking that there is a job for them in the UK"". ""Many of these people are then in debt bondage,"" she says. ""Their travel has been paid for, the work that they thought they were going into has been paid for, they then need to pay their exploiter back."" Victims can get help through the National Referral Mechanism, the government-funded support service. But many of the foreign-born victims, who do not have the right paperwork to stay here, do not trust the system and fear it exists to send them back to their country of origin. Victims struggle to be believed, says anti-slavery commissioner Kevin Hyland The anti-slavery commissioner says this part of the system needs reform. Mr Hyland says it focuses too much on the immigration status of the victims, rather than the crime itself. ""There is no other crime where someone has to jump through hoops to be believed,"" he says. The Home Office says a review of the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) has taken place. It expects to announce some changes later this year. That may come too late for Kim, Maria, and another woman also recently freed from slavery in the UK. Patricia made the decision some time ago not to apply to the NRM, and has now joined the ranks of the perhaps one million people in the UK living here without permission. ""It's like living in the dark,"" she says. ""I'm living scared every time I'm in the train, in the bus. I'm thinking I will be caught and sent to the Philippines."" Why stay, then? ""It's financial - I can support my family, my daughter and also my siblings, some of my nephews and nieces so they can go to school."" She adds, trembling: ""Even if my situation is like this, I stay here because I can help them."" So she remains vulnerable, and in the shadows.

Women's safety fears over Uber licence loss,"The news that Uberhas lost its licence from Transport for Londonon public safety and security grounds has left some young women wondering how that will affect not just their wallets but their freedom to choose where they travel and when. It decidednot to issue Uber with a new private hire licence,externalafter concluding that the ride-hailing app firm was not fit and proper to hold one. It has concerns about how Uber goes about its background checks on drivers and reports serious offences. Concerns about how Uber deals with alleged attacks have also been raised by the Metropolitan Police Service, following cases such asa driver who was jailedfor assaulting a woman. Uber, meanwhile, says its drivers have to pass the same safety checks as black cab and mini cab drivers. The company has changed the way people stay out and travel home - allowing them to book a cab at the touch of an app. And many women say they are reassured by some of its features. such as the ability for customers and their friends and family to track the journey and the driver; the door-to-door service that keeps people from waiting on the road; and knowing who is collecting them. What does the ruling mean? Seven things Londoners will miss if Uber goes Now what next for Uberisation? Uber has some 3.5 million registered users in London, and many people prefer the service to the alternatives on offer. ""I'm so annoyed,"" says 26-year-old marketing manager Lisette Henry of the licence loss. ""London nightlife is one of the best in the world and I think it's going to restrict a lot of people having access to that."" She uses the app every week and says she depends on it for late-night journeys from the airport after work trips. ""As someone that's not loaded, and a young woman in London, I actually feel really uncomfortable getting the night bus or even the night Tube. Lisette Henry says she cannot afford black cabs ""The area I live in isn't serviced by the night Tube; A night bus would really be the only option I could afford. ""Night Tubes are great but you still have just as many problems with drunk and disorderly people as you do on night buses. (This change is) going to restrict me and I'm not going to go out as much. ""I feel more comfortable because everything is tracked, I know who's picking me up, I know who they are, I know what their contact number is."" Charlie Edmunds says Uber gives her more freedom Charlie Edmunds says a door-to-door service is better than standing late at night at bus stops. ""Being a woman comes with an additional burden of keeping yourself safe,"" she says. Having a cab at the press of a button, she feels, reduces the burden not only of staying secure, but also of being judged if something bad did occur. But she does have reservations about the company, which has faced criticism over vetting drivers, and says it needs to get its house in order. Allow Twitter content?

""I'm lucky I live in zone two, otherwise finding a cab to zone three and beyond can be really hard as many won't take you."" Tara Patel, a chartered accountant, 38, says. She remembers ""plenty"" of occasions when she has been working or out late and there are no black cabs around. And the tracking on Uber that lets her family see her whereabouts ""gives me a greater feeling of security"", she says. Tara Patel says the tracking feature makes her feel secure But Uber has its detractors, and their complaints range from safety issues, as cited in TfL's licence decision, to cost and reliability. Lisa Wilson says she thought the app was a ""great concept"" until one night a driver took an unrecognisable route to her house and she jumped out at traffic lights, ""fearing the worst"". ""I was the middle of nowhere,"" she says. ""Never would I use them nor would I let my daughter who is 18."" Maya Lorford's concern stems from how the service's prices can rise as demand peaks. She felt stung after the estimate for a cab home after a babysitting job tripled from a morning check to an evening booking. Maya Lorford said she had experienced ""outrageous"" price rises with Uber ""The estimation for a taxi ride from my babysitting to my house was Â£6-8,"" she says. ""When I checked back at around 23:30 that evening, the price had risen to Â£20-Â£24. ""I understand raising prices a little at peak times but by 300% is outrageous."" Rachel says she has been ""let down every time I've used the app"", be that on waiting time, or price. ""I've never had a good experience with it and that's before all theimpact on black cabs, theroad networkandconditions for drivers,"" she says. ""Good riddance!"" Uber's licence is due to run until 30 September, but it has 21 days to appeal against TfL's decision on Friday and it will be able to operate while any appeals are ongoing. In the meantime, its users admit it is ""not perfect by a long shot"", as Charlie puts it, but the hope is Uber will rethink how it checks drivers. She is not the only woman anxiously awaiting the outcome.

Hundreds of thousands sign Uber petition,"Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London London Mayor Sadiq Khan says anger from customers and drivers over Uber losing its licence should be directed at the company. More than 500,000 people have signed a petition, started by Uber, to urge Transport for London (TfL) to reverse its decision not to renew the licence. TFL said Uber could not hold a private hire operator licence on the grounds of ""public safety and security"". The ride-hailing app firm said it would appeal against TfL's decision. The petition says: ""If this decision stands, it will put more than 40,000 licensed drivers out of work and deprive millions of Londoners of a convenient and affordable form of transport."" TfL's concerns include Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences. What does London's Uber ban mean? Seven things people will miss if Uber goes Your views: Uber London loses licence Women's safety fears over Uber licence Uber's licence is due to expire on 30 September. It has 21 days to appeal and can continue to operate while any appeals are ongoing. Reacting to the petition reaching more than 500,000 signatures, Mr Khan said: ""I know that Uber has become a popular service for many Londoners - but it would be wrong for TfL to licence Uber if there was any way this could pose a threat to Londoners' safety or security. ""As mayor of London I welcome innovative new companies that help Londoners by providing a better and more affordable service - but providing an innovative service is not an excuse for not following the rules."" This video can not be played Drivers and passengers react to news that Uber's licence in London will be revoked Fred Jones, Uber's UK head of cities, said the mayor and TfL had ""caved to pressure from a small number of individuals and groups that want to protect the status quo and reduce consumer choice and competition from London"". He said the company had operated in London for five-and-a-half years, during which it was audited by TfL. ""The last time they audited us to check we were playing by the rules, they found that there were zero errors in our processes. ""This was one of the strange things around the TfL notice yesterday is they are the ones who do all of the checks and license the drivers."" He said when a driver signed up to the app, Uber made sure they had all the correct paperwork from TfL and that Uber did not carry out background checks itself. In a message to staff, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""It's worth examining how we got here. The truth is that there is a high cost to a bad reputation. ""It really matters what people think of us."" Kajal Odedra, UK director at Change.org, said it was ""the fastest growing petition we've seen in the UK this year"". ""The speed with which this grew shows how powerful online campaigning can be."" She said the petition showed how quickly the voices of citizens could become part of the debate between governments and corporations. Petitioner Glenn Gathercole, from London, said he added his signature because: ""Uber provides a much-needed alternative to minicabs and black cabs. It is more efficient, safer and economical than the alternatives."" Brighton: Local MP Caroline Lucas said Uber's business model was ""irresponsible to the core"" and that it needed to improve passenger safety so that it could get its licence back Bristol: The city council says it would ""keep an eye on the outcome"" of the dispute with TfL Cambridge: The council will ""look closely"" when it comes to renew Uber's current licence which will expire in December,reports Cambridge News,external Manchester: Uber Britania - a separate company to Uber London - is licensed until 2021 Nottingham: Uber has a licence until 2020, and the council has ""no intention"" to review it any earlier Woking: The borough council says it follows different licensing practices to TfL and has brought in a new strict criminal convictions policy And Twitter user @Gabbysalaza_said,externalshe was ""annoyed"" at the decision as Uber allowed her to get out of ""uncomfy"" situations if out at night. Others have said that the ruling was within the company's control. In 2015, hundreds of black cab drivers held a protest against Uber ""Uber knew the rules. TFL asked them to comply with the rules. Uber refused. What is TFL supposed to do?"" said political commentatorOwen Jones,external. Danielle Louiseâwrote on Twitter,external: ""Londoners are literally more outraged at the loss of Uber than the fact women are being sexually assaulted in fake taxis."" Conservative MP and minister for London Greg Hands said, while the company must address safety concerns, Mr Khan was threatening to leave users ""stranded"" and put thousands out of work. Uber has said the move ""would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said TfL was there to ""protect all of us and I think they are doing the right thing"". Analysis: From BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones Throughout its short, tempestuous life, Uber has clashed with regulators around the world - and more often than not it has come out on top. Its tactic has often been to arrive in a city, break a few rules, and then apologise when it's rapped over the knuckles. Some regulators have backed down, others have run the company out of town. In London, despite protests from angry taxi drivers, the company has had a relatively easy ride until now. But a wave of bad publicity about its corporate culture, its lax attitude to checks on its drivers and its treatment of this freelance army seems to have spurred TfL into action. Make no mistake, Uber will use every legal avenue to fight this ban. It will argue that consumers, in the shape of the millions of mainly young Londoners who rely on its service, will be seriously let down if it can no longer operate. But the courts will have to balance that with the serious concerns about public safety raised by TfL. Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London. Wes Streeting, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Taxis, says the blame lies with Uber for not following the rules. ""You cannot have a situation where, however big the customer base or however big the driver base, an operator that's providing a service like this in a city like ours can simply flout rules and regulations and on things as serious as criminal records checks for their own drivers, and this goes to the heart of passenger safety.""

How the internet helped Labour at the general election,"The 2017 general election was the moment when the internet finally delivered on its long-awaited promise of having a big effect, both on how individual people voted and the overall outcome of the election. A flood of young voters, many of whom had relatively low levels of political knowledge, used the internet to get news about the general election. This was crucial for boosting support for Labour and Jeremy Corbyn, according to new research on the dynamics of the 2017 vote. In recent years, there has been talk about the power of the internet to affect elections. Ahead of the 2017 general election, some pointed to a growth of pro-Labour websites and online forums as a potentially powerful weapon in Labour's arsenal. Our study is one of the first to document how this online activity really did help Jeremy Corbyn and his party. We've found that those who used the internet to get news about the general election were far more likely to have voted Labour. And we observed that those who used the internet less often to gather political news and information were much more likely to vote Conservative. This relationship is true for the entire electorate and across all age groups. And it continues to have a strong and positive effect on how people voted, even after we take into account a whole range of factors including age, gender, social class, party identification, how people voted in the referendum and levels of education. Overall, among all respondents, our research suggests that 16% used the internet ""a great deal"" to get information about the election, 23% used it ""a fair amount"", 23% ""not very much"" and 38% ""not at all"" or said they did not know. However, those who use the internet more often were significantly more likely to vote Labour. Sixty-one per cent of those who used the internet ""a great deal"" to gather news about the general election opted for Labour, compared with only 21% who voted Conservative. Conversely, 56% who said they used the internet ""not at all"" voted Conservative, while 30% opted for Labour. How much people use the internet also correlates with voting patterns among older people. Again, those who said they use the internet a great deal were strongly pro-Labour and pro-Jeremy Corbyn. The study found that Labour's vote was boosted by young people who followed the election online These effects involve a combination of two factors: ""mobilisation"" (things that influence people to turn out and vote) and ""persuasion"" (things that influence their choice of party). Turnout among people aged 18-29 was up by an estimated 19% on the previous general election in 2015. Our data shows that both the decision to vote and the choices these young people made at the polls were associated with the volume of news about the election that they consumed online. Another effect that we find relates to how knowledgeable people are about politics. In our surveys, we tested people's political knowledge by asking if eight randomly selected statements were true or false and then counted the number of correct answers. The statements included assertions like: ""The minimum voting age for UK general elections is now 16 years of age,"" and ""The chancellor of the Exchequer is responsible for setting interest rates in the UK."" Though internet usage and political knowledge are only slightly linked, it is clear that, after rigorous statistical tests, how knowledgeable people are about politics had significant effects on how they voted. If survey respondents were frequent internet users but did not know much about politics they tended to vote Labour.  In contrast, if they weren't internet savvy but knew a fair bit about politics, they tended to vote Conservative. These effects held across all age groups for both Labour and the Conservatives, with the exception of pensioners in the case of the Tories.  This means that those effects weren't caused by the age of the respondent, which at first sight is the obvious explanation for differences in internet usage among the voters. Put simply, political knowledge continues to have a strong effect on Labour and Conservative voting even after we take statistical account of all of ""the usual suspects"" that are used to explain voting - such as social class, age, gender income, people's ""left-right"" placement and how they voted in the 2016 referendum. The effects of internet usage and political knowledge work strongly through voters' images of the party leaders. Even after we take account of a whole host of other things, like age and income, people with low political knowledge who used the internet to get their election news tended to like Jeremy Corbyn and dislike Theresa May. Theresa May scored higher than Jeremy Corbyn among those who did not use the internet For example, among those who said they used the internet ""a great deal"", the average score for Jeremy Corbyn on a 0 (""really dislike"") to 10 (""really like"") scale is 6.4, whereas among those who said they did not use the internet at all, his average score is much lower, only 3.4. The pattern for Theresa May is the opposite: her average score among those who used the internet a great deal is 2.9, whereas among those who did not use the net, her average is considerably higher, at 5.3. For Jeremy Corbyn, political knowledge, the survey suggests,  has a negative effect on feelings about the Labour leader while internet usage has a positive effect. For Theresa May, political knowledge has a positive effect on feelings about the Conservative Party leader while internet usage has a negative effect. In contrast, people with high political knowledge who did not use the internet for general election news liked Mrs May and disliked Mr Corbyn.

Seven things Londoners will miss if Uber goes,"Transport for London says itwon't be renewing Uber's licenceand this news is stressing people out. The taxi app firm has 21 days to appeal before all its cars are removed from London's streets. This is what people will miss the most if the company fails to overturn the decision. Anyone who's ever sat a maths exam will know the formula: the shortest distance between A and B is a straight line. At times, though, some Uber drivers seem to think it's A, C, F, K, L , S, B. This is a tweet from Simpsdj claiming his Uber driver did not use the shortest route available.,external We've all woken up after a big night out with a regret or two, but your journey shouldn't be one of them. And then there's the Uber email waiting innocently in your inbox. Does Magic FM come as a preset in Uber cars? Or do all drivers just love a ballad. Either way, no matter the hour get ready for some Rick Astley, Whitney Houston or Lionel Richie. This is a tweet from DGD about listening to Whitney Houston in his taxi.,external At the press of a button a journey which normally costs you Â£10 could set you back nearly Â£30. This is a tweet from Adam after he booked a taxi with a 2.5 price surge.,external You can rate your driver but, more importantly, they can rate you. So be polite, smile and if your driver starts a conversation not being receptive might cost you a star or two. But clearly there are worse ways to be marked down than not wanting to chat about the news. This is a tweet from Sapphire who says her Uber rating went down after she threw up in the taxi.,external Remember the days of calling up your taxi to ask, ""Where are you?"". One of the benefits of Uber is being able to see exactly when your car will arrive. Although this feature also allows you to see your driver go around the one-way system countless times. And seemingly do a pirouette when you're running late. If you're trying to save money or you're just extremely sociable then Uber pool probably appealed to you. The chance to share a car ride with random strangers. Cue weird conversations and a rush for the window seats. This is a tweet posted by Fresh Air In about not wanting to move when someone else get's in your Uber.,external Or on the flipside promise the total stranger you'll stay in touch... only never to call. Back in April London black cab drivers caused gridlock with a huge protest against Uber. The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association argues that Uber's drivers are using a smartphone app to calculate fares despite it being illegal for private vehicles to be fitted with taximeters. The night bus driver, hero of the dark hours, may be glad to see you return, kebab in hand. With more people going old school it may mean more shifts or overtime for the bus drivers.

Miss Turkey stripped of crown over tweet,"Itir Esen (C) has lost her crown, and runner-up Asli Sumen (L) will take her place The winner of Miss Turkey 2017 has been stripped of her crown after one of her past tweets came to light. Itir Esen, 18, had shared a post referencing last year's coup attempt, comparing her menstrual cycle to the spilt blood of ""martyrs"". The competition's organisers said the tweet was ""unacceptable"" and confirmed their decision to dismiss her, just hours after she won. Ms Esen has since said, via Instagram, that she was not being political. The tweet was posted around the first anniversary of the 15 July coup attempt, when nearly 250 people died fighting an army uprising. She wrote: ""I am having my period this morning to celebrate the July 15 martyrs' day. I am celebrating the day by bleeding a representation of our martyrs' blood."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan regularly refers to the ""martyrs"" who died resisting the coup. The beauty pageant's organisers said the tweet did not come to light until after Thursday's ceremony in Istanbul, after which they held a long meeting to discuss the situation and verify the post. On Friday, they released a statement to announce their decision to rescind her title: ""We regret to say that this tweet has been tweeted by Itir Esen. It is not possible for the Miss Turkey Organisation to promote such a post, when it aims to introduce Turkey to the world and contribute to its image."" Ms Esen later responded with her own statement on social media:  ""I want to say that as a 18-year-old girl, I had no political aims while sharing this post."" Ex-Miss Turkey guilty of Erdogan insult Orhan Pamuk on Turkey's political climate The life of a 91-year-old beauty queen ""I was raised with respect for the homeland and the nation,"" she added, apologising for ""being misunderstood"". Runner-up Asli Sumen will now travel to China to represent Turkey in the Miss World competition. Ms Esen is not the first Miss Turkey to find herself embroiled in a political row. Former Miss Turkey Merve Buyuksarac got in trouble for ""insulting"" the president In 2016, another past winner, Merve Buyuksarac, was given a14-month suspended prison sentencefor insulting President Erdogan with a satirical poem she shared on social media. Ms Buyuksarac, who won the 2006 crown, was also briefly detained over the issue in 2015. Around that time, President Erdogan launched thousands of lawsuits against people he said had insulted him. He later withdrew them, saying he wasinspired by the feelings of unityafter the failed coup. However, a harsh crackdown has continued, which the president insists is necessary for national security. More than 150,000 state employees have been dismissed and some 50,000 people arrested. Beauty queen refuses to return crown.

UK must clarify Brexit issues - Macron,"The UK must provide more clarity about its negotiating position on Brexit, the French president has said. Emmanuel Macron said the issues of EU citizens' rights, the exit bill and the Irish border question must be settled before talks could be held on trade. On Friday, Theresa May made suggestions including a two-year transition period after Brexit, and that the UK pay the EU for ""commitments"" previously made. She hoped this offer, made in a speech in Italy, would unblock Brexit talks. In the first response by a European leader to the speech, Mr Macron welcomed her initiative, but said the British position still needed to be fleshed out. ""Before we move forward, we wish to clarify the issue of the regulation of European citizens, the financial terms of the exit and the question of Ireland,"" he said. ""If those three points are not clarified, then we cannot move forward on the rest."" Reality Check: Decoding the PM's speech Time for action, say businesses Will Tory MPs swallow May's Brexit formula? A guide to the Brexit negotiations Mrs May said there should be a transition period of ""about"" two years after March 2019 - when the UK leaves the EU - during which trade should continue on current terms EU migrants would still be able to live and work in the UK but they would have to register with the authorities, under her proposals. And she said the UK would pay into the EU budget for decisions made while it was a member, so other member states were not left out of pocket. She did not specify how much the UK would be prepared to pay during the transition period, but it has been estimated as being at least 20bn euros (about Â£18bn). Demonstrators were out in Florence for the speech In Germany, the ruling CDU's European spokesman Michael Stuebgen said Mrs May's speech would not provide the ""new dynamism"" needed as details had not been fleshed out. And the head of the country's small and medium business association said her speech was a ""wasted opportunity"". At home, Mrs May's speech was welcomed by senior Conservative figures including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond. But former Brexit minister Lord Bridges, who resigned from the department in June, said Britain needed to be ready for the scenario where the country crashed out of the EU without a deal. ""What will happen at customs, data, aviation, energy, law? The list goes on and on. I would urge the government to not be too coy about this,""he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. If the EU senses the UK is not ready to leave without a deal, it would be ""captured"" at the negotiating table, he said. Backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg criticised the PM's stance on freedom of movement until March 2019, offering the union money, and the role of the European Courts of Justice on Britain. This video can not be played May on Brexit: ""A two year transition period"" In her speech, the prime minister suggested there should be a new security agreement and a new model for trade She said the UK and EU would continue to work together on long-term economic projects and the UK would want to contribute to costs. When the two-year transition period was up, the UK and EU could move towards a new ""deep and special partnership,"" she said. By March 2019, neither the UK or EU would be ready to ""smoothly"" implement new arrangements, Mrs May said, so she suggested current trade terms should remain in place. That would last until new systems were set up. It's been pretty well established in Whitehall for many months - the most eager Brexiteers who wanted short, sharp exit lost that battle some time ago. Her acknowledgment of that pulls against her repeated insistence in the election that the public just want politicians to ""get on with it"". And there were new nuggets of information that will influence the talks. Read Laura's full blog Mrs May said she hoped to build a ""comprehensive and ambitious"" new economic partnership with the EU in the long-term. She reassured EU citizens in the UK that ""we want you to stay, we value you"" and said she wanted UK courts to take account of rulings by the European Court of Justice. Cabinet ministers were in the front row in Florence to hear the speech The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier described the speech as ""constructive"" and said the prime minister had shown ""a willingness to move forward"". But he said statements must now be translated into a precise negotiating position of the UK government. And he said he would look at the implications of the UK's pledge that no member state would have to pay more as a result of Brexit. European Parliament Brexit negotiatorGuy Verhofstadt said the UK's position,externalwas becoming ""more realistic"" but ruled out the UK registering EU citizens who wanted to stay. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn acknowledged a transition was needed to provide stability for businesses and workers. Mr Barnier meets Brexit Secretary David Davis for a fourth round of talks on Monday.

China slashes trade ties with North Korea,"Petrol prices are on the rise in Pyongyang China has moved to limit North Korea's oil supply and will stop buying textiles from the politically isolated nation, it said on Saturday. China is North Korea's most important trading partner, and one of its only sources of hard currency. The ban on textiles trade will hurt Pyongyang's income, while China's oil exports are the country's main source of petroleum products. The tougher stance follows North Korea's latest nuclear test this month. The United Nations agreed fresh sanctions - including the textiles and petroleum restrictions - in response. This video can not be played Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? A statement from China's commerce ministry said restrictions on refined petroleum products would apply from 1 October, and on liquefied natural gas immediately. Under the UN resolution, China will still be able to export a maximum of two million barrels of refined petroleum to North Korea annually, beginning next year. North Korea is estimated to have imported 6,000 barrels of refined petroleum daily from China in 2016 - the equivalent of nearly 2.2 million in total for the entire year. But China has not published data on oil exports since 2014. The ban on textiles - Pyongyang's second-biggest export - is expected to cost the country more than $700m (Â£530m) a year. Clothing has often partially been made in North Korea, but finished in China, allowing a Made in China label to be legally sewn onto the clothing, BBC World Service Asia-Pacific Editor Celia Hatton says. Kim and Trump 'children in kindergarten' What weapons does North Korea have? How a Pacific nuclear test might happen China and Russia had initially opposed a proposal from the US to completely ban oil exports, but later agreed to the reduced measures. North Korea has little energy production of its own, but does refine some petroleum products from crude oil it imports - which is not included in the new ban. Petrol prices in Pyongyang have risen by about 20% in the past two months, the AFP news agency reports. ""It was $1.90 yesterday, today it is $2,"" a petrol station employee told the agency. ""I expect the price will go up in the future."" Mr Kim delivered an unprecedented personal statement this week North Korea also produces coal, some $1.2bn of which was exported to China in 2016, but China had alreadystrictly limited its imports of North Korean coal earlier this year. North Korea's foreign minister is expected to speak at the United Nations General Assembly later on Saturday, amid an escalating war of words between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. The North Korean leader earlier labelled Mr Trump ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"" while Mr Trump labelled Mr Kim a ""madman"" in response. Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the row was ""like when children in a kindergarten start fighting and no-one can stop them"". Mr Lavrov said a pause was needed, ""to calm down the hotheads"". This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' The pair were at odds over President Trump's speech at the United Nations General Assembly, in which he threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if forced to do so in defence of the US or its allies. He also mocked Kim Jong-un with a disparaging nickname, saying: ""Rocket man is on a suicide mission."" But the North Korean leader said remarks by the ""deranged"" US president convinced him he is right to develop weapons for North Korea. 'Dotard' Trump?

May's offer to EU 'pauses Brexit',"Prime Minister Theresa May says a two-year transition period is needed before Brexit Many of the papers lead on the prime minister's Florence speech. ""Theresa May walks the tightrope"" is the headline onthe Mail,external. It says she's ""hit the pause button"" on Brexit to placate warring wings of the Conservative party. Those close to the Brexit secretary, David Davies, tell the paper Mrs May's rejection of what they call a ""never-ending transition period"" is a ""big setback for the remainers"". And while the prime minister's upbeat tone should be seen as a rebuke to the ""gloomy"" chancellor, Philip Hammond, the Mail says he's won a victory with the PM's offer of a transitional period. Meanwhile,the Times,externalfocuses on the figures. It says Mrs May has offered a significant compromise to Brussels, by signalling she's ready to pay a so-called divorce bill that the paper puts at Â£40bn. Its editorial,externaldescribes her speech as being full of major concessions - camouflaged with aspirational language in a bid to appease euro-sceptics. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Sun,externalsays the cautious welcome given by the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier will boost hopes that the deadlock in Brexit talks can be broken. It praises what it calls a ""grown-up, sensible"" speech - and tells Brussels ""Now it's your turn"". Criticism from some MEPs is highlighted inthe Guardian,externalas the paper points out the European Parliament has the power to veto any Brexit deal. According tothe paper,external, the leader of the European People's Party - Manfred Weber - says time is not on London's side. And it says another centre-right MEP believes the UK's position remains as vague as it was before. Away from Brexit,the Financial Times,externalsays the revoking of Uber's licence to operate in London comes at a sensitive time for the firm, as it courts a Â£10bn investment deal. In an editorial, the paper hopes Uber will recant its indifference to rules and make verifiable changes. But it questions whether investors will keep paying for the taxi-hailing firm to disrupt markets, while making huge losses. Finally, a long-standing scriptural justification for preventing women being ordained as priests might be based on dodgy ground, according tothe Daily Telegraph,external. A section of Corinthians says ""women should be silent in churches. They are not allowed to speak but must be in submission"". But researchers writing in the journal New Testament Studies have noticed a symbol next to the text, in one of the oldest versions of the Greek bible. They say it shows the verse was doctored. Some scholars dispute the claim, however - arguing there is no surviving manuscript without the key passage.

Bali volcano highest alert issued,"Mount Agung last erupted in 1963, killing more than 1,000 people Indonesia has issued its highest level alert for a volcano on Bali, warning that an eruption on the popular tourist island could be imminent. About 10,000 people have already been evacuated, with officials urging people to stay at least nine kilometres (5.6 miles) away from Mount Agung. Tremors have been reported, and there are indications that magma is rising to the surface, the officials say. More than 1,000 people died when Mount Agung last erupted in 1963. Evacuated local residents are staying in temporary shelters ""There should be zero public activity within the specified radius in case there is an eruption,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency was quoted as saying by Reuters. One villager, I Wayan Suwarjana, told the AFP news agency: ""Tremors happen very often, so we are afraid and I have taken all my family members to the refugee shelter."" Early on Saturday, officials said that increased seismic activity was ongoing, hours after the alert level was raised. The latest report from Indonesia's volcano observatory for aviation said the likelihood of an eruption appears to be increasing. But it added that eruptions cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy. Bali's international airport in Denpasar, which is used by millions of foreign tourists each year, is currently operating as normal, the officials say. Australia's department of foreign affairs has issued an advisory for the region, warning travellers that a possible eruption could severely disrupt air travel. Predictions about the potential eruption are based on the one in 1963, which saw the volcano expel large amounts of debris and extensive lava flows. It also involved a pyroclastic flow - a dangerous fast-moving hot cloud of gas, ash and volcanic matter. Mount Agung, which is more than 3,000m above sea level, lies in the eastern part of Bali. It is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia - an archipelago prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes as it sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"".

Zuckerberg drops controversial stock plan,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to retain control of the company but sell his shares Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has abandoned plans to create a new class of company stock. A group of investors had sued over the proposal, which would have allowed Mr Zuckerberg to retain voting control of Facebook but own a smaller share of the company's shares. Mr Zuckerberg still plans to sell up to $12bn (Â£9bn) of Facebook shares to fund philanthropic ventures. He would potentially have appeared in court next week as part of the lawsuit. Mr Zuckerbergwrote,externalon Facebook that when he proposed the stock split, he viewed it as the ""only way"" to fund those ventures, while maintaining control of Facebook. But he said the share price had increased so much that he no longer saw it as necessary. The proposed structure is popular with founders of firms such as Google's parent company Alphabet, but other shareholders view it as unfair. Facebook listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2012 ""Over the past year and a half, Facebook's business has performed well and the value of our stock has grown to the point that I can fully fund our philanthropy and retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more,"" Mr Zuckerberg wrote. ""As a result, I've asked our board to withdraw the proposal to reclassify our stock - and the board has agreed."" Mr Zuckerberg said he plans to sell 35 million to 75 million shares - worth up to $12bn at current prices - over the next 18 months to fund his family's philanthropic work. Investors, including pension funds, had alleged that Facebook's board breached its duty to represent shareholders when they approved the plan. Stuart Grant of Grant & Eisenhofer, an attorney for shareholders, called the decision a ""total victory"". He said the case was now expected to be dismissed. ""We're thrilled that Facebook has dropped the reclassification,"" Mr Grant said. Facebook has been grappling with controversy stemming from fake news spread through its network, as well as calls for increased regulator action.
