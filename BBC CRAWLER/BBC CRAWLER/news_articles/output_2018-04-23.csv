Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually,"A national day of commemoration for murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence will take place on 22 April every year, the prime minister has said. It came as the family of the black teenager attended the 25th anniversary memorial of his death in London. The 18-year-old was stabbed to death in a racially motivated attack in Eltham, south London, in 1993. Royal couple Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attended the service at St-Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square. Prime Minister Theresa May said that Stephen's mother Doreen - now a peer in the Lords - and his father Neville ""have fought heroically to ensure that their son's life and death will never be forgotten"". Mr Lawrence was set upon by a gang, stabbed and left to die in Eltham on the evening of 22 April 1993. Two of the group of up to six men who attacked the teenager and his friend Duwayne Brooks have been convicted of murder, but the rest have evaded justice. David Norris and Gary Dobson are both serving life sentences. The Macpherson Report into the investigation into Stephen Lawrence's death found that there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police. Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline of how the story unfolded Stephen Lawrence filmmaker wants viewers to feel family's emotions Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also attended the memorial. Mrs May said: ""It is right that Stephen's name and legacy lives on."" This video can not be played Harry and Meghan met Stuart and Doreen Lawrence before the service Baroness Lawrence, Stephen's mother, with Prime Minister Theresa May Baroness Lawrence said she looked forward to delivering the first Stephen Lawrence Day in 2019 alongside the government, adding: ""I feel honoured she has recognised the changes that have been made in Stephen's name and the changes that are still needed."" She thanked those who had helped her throughout the years and said that after 25 years ""it is time to draw a line"". The government will work alongside the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust - set up to transform the lives of young people and campaign for social change - to deliver an annual commemoration to the death of Stephen Lawrence, which was considered a watershed moment in race relations in the UK. Baroness Lawrence meeting Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at St-Martin-in-the-Field Prince Harry said: ""It hardly seems possible that 25 years have passed since Stephen Lawrence was so cruelly taken from his family. ""I remember vividly the profound shock that I felt at his senseless murder, a feeling shared by so many people across this country and beyond. ""I remember, too, just how deeply moved I was by the determination of Stephen's family to build something positive from the tragedy they endured and to ensure that Stephen's story did not end with despair, but continued with hope.""

Mr Bush became the 41st US president after serving eight years as vice-president to Ronald Reagan. His term in office between 1989 and 1993 was defined by foreign policy, coming at a time when communism was collapsing in Eastern Europe. Mr Bush built a successful international coalition to end Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait in the first Iraq War. But despite achieving popularity ratings of 90%, he was accused of neglecting domestic affairs and was defeated by Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election.

Ukraine gang hid wealth in London flats,"Four apartments in 199 Knightsbridge have been linked to the gang A Ukrainian crime gang used offshore firms in British tax havens to secretly invest millions of pounds in the UK, a BBC Panorama investigation has found. The gangsters, and in some cases family members, bought luxurious property in prime London locations, including a Â£12.5m flat. The daughter of a man dubbed the ""Don of Odessa"" is the registered owner of three homes in one expensive block. Many of the revelations come from the Paradise Papers data breach. The gang were from the Black Sea port of Odessa and made money in the oil industry. They came on to the police's radar in the late 1990s when they were suspected of drugs and arms smuggling. In the chaos following the collapse of the Soviet Union the gang branched out into Europe, using Italy as a base. But police were on to them. For four years specialist anti-mafia officers tracked their movements across the continent. They tapped their phones and what the men discussed was chilling, police said. This video can not be played As he interrogated a suspected gangster about money laundering, BBC reporter Andy Verity was kicked and knocked over ""They described murders that were particularly cruel. 'I kept hitting his head until it broke... I killed him with many blows,'"" recalls Italian state police Deputy Commissioner Nunzia Savino.  ""They were extremely violent."" The gang was organised along strict mafia lines with each member assigned a role. Among them were: Alexander Angert, nicknamed the Don of Odessa.  Police say he was once jailed for murder Nickolay Fomichev, described as a ""violent and armed person"" Gennadiy Trukhanov, a man who trained members of the gang in ""hand-to-hand combat and sniper shooting with high precision weapons"", according to Ms Savino.  He is now the mayor of Odessa Gennadiy Trukhanov was identified in an Italian state police report in 1998 Despite evidence from the phone taps, most of the gang members were never charged because their crimes were not committed in Italy. Eventually, the anti-mafia investigation was wound up. Mr Trukhanov returned to Odessa to begin his political career, Mr Angert settled in London while Mr Fomichev is believed to have moved to Belgium. Like many other investors looking for a solid return on their capital, the gangsters saw a promising opportunity for their cash in the London property market. The men kept their names off public records by using offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), where it was possible to be an anonymous owner. Mr Angert controlled a company called East Corner Properties set up in the BVI. It bought an apartment in an expensive Victorian block in Kensington where the poet TS Eliot once lived. In 2001 another offshore firm, Matelot Real Estate Incorporated, paid just over Â£1m for a flat in a shiny new tower block on the River Thames across from Chelsea Harbour, which it sold in 2006. The Thames apartment was purchased for more than Â£1m in 2001 We don't know who was originally behind it because when it was set up Matelot had nominee directors and an anonymous owner. But thanks to the huge Paradise Papers data breach, we do know in 2010 the ultimate beneficial owner of Matelot was Nickolay Fomichev, a member of the gang. In a joint investigation with theOrganised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project,external, Panorama has delved into documents from Appleby, the offshore services provider at the heart of the Paradise Papers. The documents were originally obtained by German newspaper Suddeustche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the BBC and nearly 100 other media partners. In December 2015, the Appleby Group's offshore fiduciary and administrative service business separated from its legal division to form a group of new companies called Estera. Appleby and Estera are now separately owned businesses. As well as revealing Mr Fomichev's connection to Matelot, the Paradise Papers show two other flats in the building were owned by another offshore company linked to the gang. Mr Fomichev's name crops up in connection with more property a couple of miles north of the river in one of the world's most affluent areas. Number 199 Knightsbridge resembles an expensive hotel, with security and staff manning the entrance. Paradise Papers: Everything you need to know WATCH: How to hide your cash offshore Are we taming offshore finance? Two apartments in the building were bought by offshore companies called Brightside Properties Number 3 and 4. The numbers don't relate to the flat numbers. Documents show by 2010 both companies were owned by Mr Fomichev, who is now believed to be dead. A document links Mr Fomichev with a company that bought a flat at 199 Knightsbridge In 2015 Brightside sold the flats to a young budding film-maker named Anya Angert. She is the daughter of the Don of Odessa. The purchase price for just one of the flats was Â£12.5m. It is unclear how Ms Angert was able to afford it, but she now owns a total of three flats at 199 Knightsbridge. The daughter of the ""Don of Odessa"" is the registered owner of a Â£12.5m flat We have also discovered that a fourth flat in the block was linked to the gang. Donald Toon, director of the National Crime Agency, said the case ""certainly gives me cause for suspicion... that there is money laundering taking place"". ""What we need to do in these circumstances is to be able to be clear how much of that material is capable of being used in court as evidence as it stands,"" he added. Establishing offshore companies needs help from professionals.  London accountant Alexander Popivker, working from an office in Finchley, set up and administered dozens of offshore companies - known as the Rubicon Group - with the help of Appleby. Some of these companies were used by the gang from Odessa. To guard against money laundering international firms like Appleby are required to carry out rigorous checks on all their clients. But they can allow other professionals to conduct due diligence checks for them. They made Mr Popivker an ""eligible introducer"", which meant he could bring new businesses into the Appleby fold and vouch for their owners. Mr Popivker is based in north London It is legal. But for the system to work the introducer has to be thorough and independent. Mr Popivker is married to the sister of mafia boss Alexander Angert. Money laundering checks should be especially thorough when a company is owned by politicians or politically exposed persons (PEPs). Mr Trukhanov has been accused of corruption in Odessa The Paradise Papers show Gennadiy Trukhanov had a major stake in four offshore firms that were administered by Appleby. For years, Appleby seemed unaware that he had become a PEP. When it asked Mr Popivker about the money, he told Appleby ""Gennadiy Trukhanov is unknown to us"". But documents in Appleby's own files suggest this was not true. When Panorama caught up with Mr Popivker, he denied dealings with the mayor, saying he had ""never dealt with him in any capacity"". Mr Popivker later told us: ""At no time and under no circumstances did my company or I personally engage, either historically or currently, with a client or group of clients where the clients' integrity, activities, sources of their funds or the nature of proposed transactions were in any doubt as to their legitimacy of legality."" Mr Trukhanov is currently under criminal investigation in Ukraine. Last October his home and offices in Odessa were raided. In February he was arrested and accused of embezzlement in Odessa but was allowed to carry on as mayor. ""We suspect the mayor of Odessa of stealing money from the city of Odessa,"" said Nazar Kholodnytskiy, Ukraine's special anti-corruption prosecutor. Mr Trukhanov denies the allegations. He also denied all of Panorama's claims, saying the programme was putting out false information which ""undermines his honour, dignity and reputation"". Appleby has been in the firing line in the past. For almost 10 years, the offshore service provider's BVI office failed to notice it was setting up and administering some companies that were being used by gangsters to launder money. In February 2009 a compliance manager pointed out that Appleby BVI was not running adequate checks on companies. A compliance manager in 2009 highlighted a lack of adequate checks by Appleby's BVI office The same report pointed to a company set up by Mr Popivker as an example of where proper checks had not been carried out. In 2011, an Appleby employee noticed serious problems in the record keeping for Mr Popivker's companies. Local regulators also picked up on problems in Appleby's BVI office. In 2012 the BVI Financial Services Commission (FSC) found there was missing compliance documentation. In 2013 the commission wrote to the group managing partner of Appleby about ""continued and significant regulatory deficiencies"" and in 2014 concluded Appleby BVI had broken money laundering rules. Appleby says that ""whilst it is correct that the 2014 FSC Report identified certain areas of improvement, Appleby had by that time already taken a number of corrective actions."" It says the documents we are using were stolen. Appleby BVI finally parted ways with Mr Popivker in 2015 after the BVI's Financial Investigation Agency demanded to know who was behind one of the companies he was acting for as part of a money-laundering inquiry. Appleby says it was legally entitled to rely on Mr Popivker to carry out due diligence and stopped using eligible introducers in 2015. In the same year the 60-plus companies in the Rubicon Group were moved to a different offshore provider. Transparency International, which assisted in the investigation, says it is far too easy for criminals to bring dirty money into the UK. ""Corrupt individuals cannot steal public funds unless they have a getaway vehicle and then a safe place to stash their stolen loot,"" said its head of advocacy, Rachel Davies Teka. ""And anonymous companies are the getaway vehicle and UK assets, such as property, are the safe haven."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the UK has become the money laundering capital of the world. ""Our reputation is being damaged by it... There's been too many examples over years of dirty money coming into the city and by allowing this to happen we are almost aiding and abetting these criminals,"" he said. The government has promised to introduce a public register to reveal the true owners of UK properties owned by offshore companies. Security and Economic Crime Minister Ben Wallace said he is determined to stop money laundering. ""We will come for them, for their assets and their money.  I am determined that we use all the powers we have, including the new powers in the Criminal Finances Act, to counter the threat from illicit funds."" The powers include unexplained wealth orders, which allow assets to be seized where the source of funds is suspicious. The National Crime Agency said the orders could potentially be used to seize some of the London flats linked to the Ukrainian gang.

"'TSB gave me someone else's Â£35,000'","Matthew Neal got a shock when he logged onto his TSB account A TSB customer was given access to someone else's Â£35,000 savings account, Â£11,000 Isa, and a business account when he logged onto his account last night. Matthew Neal had simply wanted to check how much he'd spent at the pub the night before. He's just one of potentially millions of TSB customers affected by a massive computer failure. The bank's upgrade to its banking systems has caused chaos for customers. The bank warned its users that it was carrying out upgrades at the weekend between 16:00 BST on Friday and 18:00 on Sunday. But a number of customers reported they were still facing problems on Monday morning, with many worried about being able to pay bills or even get cash to pay for essentials. TSB apologised and claimed it had fixed the issue. In a statement on Monday it said: ""We're really sorry that some of our customers experienced problems accessing our mobile app and internet banking yesterday evening. Both of these services are now up and running again."" Many customers took to Twitter to complain of being unable to access their accounts despite the bank's claim. The bank's social media staff simply repeated the line: ""Unfortunately, there are some intermittent problems affecting this service so please bear with us. We're working as hard as we can to resolve this."" Matthew Neal from Hertfordshire checked his TSB app after 6pm on Sunday evening to find out his balance and see how much he had spent at the pub the night before. But he got a shock. ""I could see all my accounts, but on top of that also three accounts belonging to someone else: a Â£35,000 savings account, an Â£11,000 Isa and a business account,"" he told the BBC. ""I could see their account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories and I had access to transfer money too, if I was that way inclined. ""The thing that was worrying me most was: what if someone can see mine too?"" He tried to ring the bank to alert it to the problem but after 45 minutes on hold, gave up. Since then he has been unable to access his accounts at all. A TSB spokesperson commented: ""We have noted some reports in the media regarding customers' access to account information last night. We can confirm the access issues, which lasted only about 20 minutes and impacted just a tiny fraction of our customer base, were fixed last night."" When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to rent a banking platform from its former owner while it developed its own ""state-of-the-art"" platform. That was ready to go live at the weekend and TSB moved its customers' data from the Lloyds' platform to its own. This was a long-planned disruption to the service and the bank said it informed customers of the change and that it would lead to them being unable to use online banking or payment systems at the weekend.

First, many customers said they were unaware of the changes and so were caught out. Second, customers experienced difficulties long after the 6pm deadline on Sunday evening that TSB promised that things would be sorted by. In fact many were still complaining of being unable to access services on Monday morning. Laim McKenzie, from Paisley, in Scotland, signed into his app shortly after 6pm on Sunday evening to discover the problem. The 20-year-old said: ""I saw the details of one other account holder, as well as my own. ""My balance, because of my overdraft, is in minus, but my balance was showing at Â£13,000. ""I closed the app and went in again at 19:00 and only my account was showing - but my balance was showing at zero. ""I've closed the app again and have not been able to access it since."" Many customers took to Twitter to complain about issues, including being unable to log into their internet banking accounts, being unable to transfer funds and not being able to make payments.

Alfie's parents lose 'last-ditch appeal',"Alfie Evans is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" in Alder Hey Children's Hospital The parents of seriously ill toddler Alfie Evans have lost a ""last-ditch appeal"" over his life support. A High Court judge dismissed fresh submissions heard in private from lawyers representing Alfie's parents via telephone link on Monday evening. His parents Tom Evans and Kate James have already lost a series of legal challenges for treatment to continue. In February the court ruled Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool could end life support. The hearing took place after the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs granted 23-month-old Alfie Italian citizenship, hoping it would allow an ""immediate transfer to Italy"". The toddler's parents had hoped he could be taken to the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome, which has links to the Vatican, where his care would continue. Tom Evans and Kate James want to take Alfie to a hospital in Rome Mr Justice Hayden, who ruled doctors could stop treating Alfie against the wishes of his parents, had overseen the further hearing on Monday evening. Barrister Paul Diamond, who represents Alfie's parents, told the judge that an Italian government representative wanted to intervene in the case and asked for more time. Sophia Roper, who represents Alfie and takes instructions from a court-appointed guardian, said she was not ""completely satisfied"" that Alfie had been granted Italian citizenship. She added that any granting of Italian citizenship seemed designed to ""frustrate"" orders made in a British court. Mr Justice Hayden dismissed Mr Diamond's application, saying it amounted to a ""last-ditch appeal"". ""Alfie is a British citizen, he is undoubtedly habitually resident in the UK"", he said. ""He falls therefore under the jurisdiction of the High Court."" This video can not be played Protesters tried to storm the Alder Hey Children's Hospital entrance Alfie has been in Alder Hey since December 2016 with a rare undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition. The hospital has argued that keeping him on a ventilator is not in ""his best interests"" and any further treatment was not only ""futile"" but also ""unkind and inhumane"". Pope Francis,externalrenewed his support for the family earlier by tweeting: ""Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted."" Before Alfie was granted Italian citizenship,a group of protesters supporting him tried to storm Alder Hey hospital, before police officers formed a line to block the entrance.

Alfie Evans granted Italian citizenship,"Alfie Evans is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" in Alder Hey Children's Hospital Terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans has been granted Italian citizenship, the Italian foreign office has said. The High Court ruled in February Alder Hey Children's Hospital could stop providing life support for Alfie against the wishes of his parents Tom Evans and Kate James. The parents have since lost a series of legal challenges to the decision. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it hopes Alfie will be allowed ""immediate transfer to Italy"". Posting on Facebook, Mr Evans said: ""Alfie has been granted Italian citizenship. We await for the [Italian] foreign minister to call Boris Johnson."" He then said outside the Liverpool hospital: ""I'm stood here now and Alfie is still here. Why? Because I'm still fighting for him, I'm still fighting and so is Alfie."" Mr Evans said he had been in touch with the ambassador of Italy and his son had been given Italian citizenship, which he claimed would block any planned withdrawal of life support. Tom Evans and Kate James want to take Alfie to a hospital in Rome The Christian Legal Centre, which represents Alfie's parents, said: ""The Italian ambassador has urgently contacted the court with a request for the Italian government to be allowed to intervene in the case and seek the return of their citizen Alfie Evans to Italy."" Mr Justice Hayden who ruled doctors could stop treating Alfie against the wishes of his parents has overseen a further hearing this evening. A spokeswoman indicated the judge had heard submissions from lawyers in private via a telephone link. Pope Francis,externalrenewed his support for the family earlier by tweeting: ""Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted."" Before Alfie was granted Italian citizenship,a group of protesters supporting him tried to storm Alder Hey hospitalbefore police officers formed a line to block the entrance. About 200 people turned up to protest outside the hospital after judges at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) refused to intervene in the case. This video can not be played Protesters tried to storm the Alder Hey Children's Hospital entrance Alfie has been in Alder Hey since December 2016 with a rare undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition. The hospital has argued that keeping him on a ventilator is not in ""his best interests"" and any further treatment was not only ""futile"" but also ""unkind and inhumane"". But his parents want to take him to Rome's Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital, which has links to the Vatican, where his palliative care would continue. Alfie's parents had lodged an urgent application with the ECHR over the 23-month-old's life support. However, an ECHR spokesman said the family's application was ""inadmissible"". Who is Alfie Evans? Supreme Court rules against Alfie parents Alfie Evans hospital 'scary' to visit Before today's ECHR ruling, Alfie's parents had already lost a first round of cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal and European Court of Human Rights, as well as two cases at the Supreme Court. Earlier this monthMr Evans flew to Rome to meet Pope Francisand begged him to ""save our son"". The Pope previously tweeted his support for Alfie, saying he hoped the ""deep suffering"" of the toddler's parents would be heard. The Foreign Office has been contacted by the BBC but is yet to comment.

By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent After some quieter times, the Royal Family is back in the news - and there is a noticeable sense of renewal; new faces, with Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fiancee, making her first public appearances, and now another child, the as-yet unnamed third child of Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. It's always gone like this - waves of interest followed by periods of relative quiet. But there has been a sense of renewal in the past few months. Of course there has been concern over the health of the Duke of Edinburgh; and interest in the Queen, with her decades of service, never falters. But the attention of a new group, both in Britain and around the world, has been caught by this birth and then the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle next month. From the darkest days of the World War Two to the Instagram generation, the Royal Family now connects them all. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Following a change in the law in 2013, Princess Charlotte keeps her place as fourth in line to the throne. Previously, younger royal males would have taken precedence over older female siblings. The duchess was admitted to hospital shortly before 06:00 on Monday with the announcement of the birth coming shortly after 13:00. This video can not be played BBC Rewind looks back at previous notable royal pregnancy announcements Senior royal doctors consultant obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston and consultant gynaecologist Alan Farthing oversaw the birth. Both were also called in for the arrival of Prince George in 2013 and Princess Charlotte in 2015. The new prince, born on St George's Day, shares a birthday with Lady Gabriella Windsor - the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, who was born at the Lindo Wing on 23 April 1981. Some royal fans have been waiting outside the hospital since early April To become King or Queen as the third-born royal child is rare - and has yet to happen within the current House of Windsor. But the third child of George III and Queen Charlotte, William IV, took on the task and ruled from 1830 to 1837. The Hanoverian king acceded to the throne aged 64 when his older brother, George IV, died without an heir. He became next in line when he was 62 and his other older brother, Frederick, Duke of York, died. Growing up third What might new prince be called?

The suspect has been named by police as Alek Minassian, 25. A man was arrested several streets away following a tense standoff with officers on the street.

The incident occurred at Yonge Street and Finch Avenue at 13:30 local time (17:30 GMT) on Monday. The crime scene encompassed a  an over 1km (0.6 mile) stretch of Yonge Street. About 18 miles (30km) away in the city centre, foreign ministers of the G7 leading industrialised nations - Canada, the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan - were holding meetings.

Toronto police spokeswoman Jenifferjit Sidhu told CBC News that the vehicle was stopped by police. Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto A long stretch of Yonge Street in Toronto's North York is cordoned off with yellow police tape for what police say will be a complex investigation. There are multiple sites where people were hit. At one intersection, debris and a lone shoe mark the spot of one fatality. In the aftermath, people who would usually be running errands or heading back to surrounding office towers and condominiums reacted with shock at what happened, sharing what they had seen or heard, even though reasons behind the incident remain unclear. Hours after the event there is mainly just quiet, as police begin the painstaking work of piecing together what happened on a wide stretch of road on Monday lunch hour. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted from Ottawa: ""Our thoughts are with all those affected by the terrible incident at Yonge and Finch in Toronto.""

Windrush citizenship fees and tests axed,"The home secretary said she would do all she could to ""right the wrongs"" that had been done UK citizenship fees and language tests will be waived for the Windrush generation and their families, Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said. She told MPs she wanted people to have the ""formal status"" they should have had all along, without having to pay naturalisation fees or pass any tests. She also vowed speedy compensation for anyone who had ""suffered loss"". Labour said the ""buck stopped"" with Ms Rudd for a crisis which had brought ""shame"" on the government. In a statement to Parliament, Ms Rudd said the citizenship offer would apply not just to the families of Caribbean migrants who came to the UK between 1948 and 1973, but anyone from other Commonwealth nations who settled in the UK over the same period. Who are the Windrush generation? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories Are you from the Windrush generation? Ms Rudd apologised again for changes to immigration rules - dubbed the ""hostile environment"" policy - which she said had had an ""unintended and devastating"" impact on the Windrush generation. While the public expected immigration rules to be enforced, she said, it had never been the intention for a crackdown on illegal immigration to affect those who were ""British in all but their legal status"". ""This should never have happened,"" she told MPs. ""We need to show a human face to how we work and exercise greater judgement where it is justified."" After days of damaging headlines and repeated apologies, the home secretary sought to draw a line under this scandal with a series of significant concessions. However, Amber Rudd sparked anger on the opposition benches after she suggested the scandal was the result of successive changes to immigration rules by governments dating back to the 1980s. While some of the detail surrounding the policy changes have yet be spelt out, ministers will hope that they have done enough to correct the mistakes that have been made and to assuage widespread public anger at the treatment of the Windrush families. She said she wanted to give the Windrush generation the formal immigration status they ""should have had a long time ago"" by encouraging those who were not UK citizens to apply to become so. All fees, language and citizenship tests connected with the naturalisation process would be waived and anyone who had left the UK but been prevented from coming back would now be helped to do so, without any fees. The offer will apply to those who already have leave to remain, those who do not have the paperwork usually required and children of the Windrush generation. ""In effect this means anyone from the Windrush generation who now wants to become a British citizen will be able to do so,"" she said. Ms Rudd said nine residency cases had been settled by a special Home Office team set up to deal with the crisis, while 84 individuals had had appointments made. Nick Broderick, who came to Britain from Jamaica as a toddler, has spent Â£30,000 fighting deportation. He told the BBC that Ms Rudd's announcement was ""positive"" and would ""help a lot of people"". He said he was hoping to work again ""and get my life back on track"". He said although he had heard nothing about compensation, he was glad he could now become a citizen. Glenda Caesar, who came to the UK from Dominica with her parents as a six-month-old baby, recently won her battle for citizenship with the Home Office. The fees and the documentation had been particularly difficult to provide, she said, and she was ""so happy"" with this move - but still felt annoyed by the saga. ""It's a lot of hurt that I had to go through... We've lost money, I've lost money, I'm in arrears with certain bills. ""So it was, y'know a financial loss to a lot of us, a lot of us, not only myself. ""They've taken 10 years away from me."" 'Let down' All Home Office records dating back to 2002 would be checked to see if anyone had been wrongly deported, Ms Rudd told MPs, adding that no cases had been identified so far with about 50% of documents verified. She added: ""The state has let these people down, with travel documents denied, exclusions from returning to the UK, benefits cut and and even threats of removal. This has happened for some time. ""I will put this right and where people have suffered loss, they will be compensated. This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? ""None of this can undo the pain already endured, but I hope it demonstrates the government's commitment to put these wrongs right, going forward."" Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said the scandal ""should not have been a surprise"" to ministers, given the warnings they had received, and told Ms Rudd ""ultimately the buck stops"" with her. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK ""She is behaving as if it is a shock to her that officials are implementing regulations in the way she intended them to be implemented,"" she said. While she welcomed the promise of compensation, she said there was a lack of detail and the sums should ""reflect the damage to family life"" suffered by families and not be ""token"". Reflecting on her families' personal experience, she said: ""This was a generation with unparalleled commitment to this country, unparalleled pride in being British, unparalleled commitment to hard work and contributing to society. ""It is shameful this government has treated this generation in this way."" And Labour's David Lammy, a leading campaigner for justice for the Windrush families, said they were being offered something which was already their right. He called on ministers to help others who also made their life in the UK after World War Two but who might not get equal treatment. ""They are from countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda,"" he said. ""Many of these people have temporary leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain. It is unfair. They were born under Empire."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New Zealand cinema bans pyjamas and onesies,"The cinema is located in the small town of Hawera A cinema in New Zealand has banned people from wearing pyjamas, onesies and dirty boots to screenings, in a move designed to raise dress standards. Hawera Cinemas said in recent months it had seen an increasing number of patrons attending in nightwear. It announced the ban in a Facebook post, adding the clothes did not encourage the right ""vibe"". The dress code at the cinema, located on the country's North Island, has sparked heated debate on social media. Store bans shoppers in nightwear NZ's Ardern wears Maori cloak to meet Queen Kirsty Bourke, manager at Hawera Cinemas said over the last two months the cinema has seen ""an increase in customers wearing pyjamas and customers wearing dirty gumboots and work boots, so like many restaurants and clubs we decided to adopt a dress code"". ""The support we have received is fantastic. We have had customers all day congratulating us,"" she told the BBC. Judging by the Facebook debate, many people support the dress code - and wouldn't have thought of violating it in the first place. But not everyone agrees. Some argue the cinema should mind its own business and let their audience show up in whatever they choose. While there's been lively debate on Facebook, the cinema itself hasn't received any complaints since the policy was announced at the weekend. But Ms Bourke warns ""if customers turn up in their pyjamas, we will refuse entry"". She's confident the change won't be bad for business. ""We believe we will lose more customers by not adopting a dress code,"" she said. ""Restaurants and clubs have always had dress codes so why not cinemas?""

Spotify tests explicit song blocker,"Drake is among the artists whose explicit songs are riding high in the Spotify charts Spotify, the UK's biggest music streaming service, has started testing a way of filtering out songs which have explicit lyrics. The feature has beenintroduced on its iPhone and iPad,externalapps - six years after being requested on its online forums. But some users have toldBBC Radio 5 live:that the feature does not have enough controls. Rivals such as Apple Music already have password-protected parental controls to skip explicit tracks. Since 2011, streaming music providers have been expected to display the word ""explicit"" next to tracks that record companies believe are unsuitable for children. Currently more than a third of the Top 50 songs in Spotify's UK chart contain explicit lyrics. Mother Nicola Ford set up an online petition calling for the filter after she was caught out listening at home. She said: ""I'd had quite a few awkward moments, where the kids had been listening to songs on the radio, and suddenly our home filled with swear words when they played the same songs on Spotify. ""I set up a petition online and found that lots of people were petitioning for the same thing, so I got a lot of interest."" Daniel Ek co-founded Swedish streaming company Spotify in 2006 The new setting, which was first introduced at the start of April, greys out explicit songs and prevents them from playing, but it doesn't replace them with clean versions. Nicola says this does not go far enough. ""The kids want to listen to the song that they've heard, so they will try and sneak the song in. ""If they are going to try to listen to the song, I'd like them to get the clean versions."" Others have complained that the setting. which is only available to Premium users, does not have a Pin code and can be changed by anyone with access to the device. ""It would be useful for the account holder, the parent, to control the setting,"" says Nicola. ""All these companies need to try really hard to help us manage what goes on in our homes, Spotify included.  I think they could have shown interest a lot earlier."" Spotify describes the explicit content filter as a ""beta version"" and says it is currently being tested for ""some users"". In a statement it said: ""We are always testing new products and experiences at Spotify, but have no further news to share on a product launch at this time.""

Paris attack suspect jailed in Belgium,"Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving suspect from the 2015 Paris attacks, has been jailed for 20 years in Belgium over a gunfight that led to his arrest. Abdeslam, 28, and co-defendant Sofien Ayari were both convicted of terror-related charges of attempted murder. Ayari, 24, was also given a 20-year sentence. Both fired on officers who raided a flat in Brussels in 2016. Abdeslam is being held in a jail in France and is due to face trial there over the Paris attacks themselves. He had refused to answer questions from the judge in the trial in Brussels, and eventually refused to attend the hearings. Neither he nor Ayari, a 24-year-old Tunisian national, was in court as the verdict was read out on Monday. Both received the maximum 20-year term requested by prosecutors. The judge, Marie France Keutgen, said that ""there can be no doubt"" about the two men's involvement with ""radicalism"". She added: ""Their intention is clear from the nature of the weapons they used, the number of bullets they fired and the nature of the police officers' wounds. Only the officers' professional response prevented it being worse."" On 15 March 2016, Belgian police hunting Abdeslam carried out a raid in the Forest area of Brussels. They targeted a flat believing that the suspect - who by then had been on the run for four months - had been there. This video can not be played Damian Grammaticas reports from the scene of the raid When they moved in they exchanged fire with the three occupants. One of the three was killed and three officers were wounded. Abdeslam and Ayari managed to escape, but Abdeslam's fingerprints were found in the flat, confirming his presence there. Five things about Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam He was picked up days later in a raid in the nearby Molenbeek area, and later transferred to France. He is a French national who was born in Brussels to French-Moroccan parents. He was involved in petty crime in Belgium as a youth, and is believed to have become radicalised along with his brother Salim around 2014. Both then reportedly joined a French-Belgian network linked with the Islamic State group (IS), which later claimed the Paris attacks. The network was involved in both the Paris attacks and bombings that struck the Brussels metro and airport on 22 March 2016, just days after Abdeslam's arrest, killing 32 people. In Monday's ruling, the court denied a request by victims from those attacks that they be regarded as a civil party to the case, saying no link had been established with Abdeslam and Ayari. Is Molenbeek a hotbed of extremism? Who were the Paris attackers? Paris attacks: What happened on the night He is believed to have played a key role on 13 November 2015 - when militants targeted a concert hall, stadium, restaurants and bars, killing 130 people and injuring hundreds more. French prosecutors believe Abdeslam helped the jihadists by hiring cars, flats and hotel rooms - although his role in the actual shootings and bombings is unclear. His brother Salim was among the attackers and blew himself up outside a cafe. Salah Abdeslam and two associates drove from Paris to Brussels the next day. They were stopped by police at a border checkpoint, but were allowed to travel as Abdeslam had not yet been identified as a suspect. French and Belgian authorities released Abdeslam's photo and name a day later - by which time he was Europe's most wanted man. Several flats were raided by Belgian police over the next few months. He and Ayari were finally picked up in the Molenbeek raid on 18 March 2016. Five things about Salah Abdeslam Who were Paris attackers?

Jubilation in streets as Armenia PM quits,"This video can not be played Supporters mob Armenian protest leader Nikol Pashinyan after PM resigns There were scenes of jubilation in the Armenian capital Yerevan after protests forced the resignation of Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan. Opposition supporters accused Mr Sargsyan, who was made prime minister last week after serving 10 years as president, of clinging to power. ""The street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand,"" Mr Sargsyan said in a statement. Former prime minister Karen Karapetyan has taken over as acting PM. President Armen Sarkissian accepted Mr Sargsyan's and the government's resignation. Mr Sargsyan's announcement came soon after opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan was released from detention. Mr Pashinyan had been arrested on Sunday after he called for Mr Sargsyan's resignation during televised talks. As well as Mr Pashinyan, two other opposition politicians and some 200 demonstrators were held. Demonstrators rallied again in the capital Yerevan on Monday In his statement published on his website, Mr Sargsyan said he was ""addressing all citizens of the Republic of Armenia... for the last time as leader of the country."" ""Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,"" he said. ""The situation has several solutions, but I will not take any of them... I am leaving office of the country's leader, of prime minister."" His spokesman, Hovhannes Nikoghosyan, told the BBC that Mr Sargsyan was behaving responsibly and fulfilling the demands of the street movement which opposed his appointment as prime minister. ""I think his resignation is a clear demonstration of a democracy in force. It's not that every demonstration in every corner of the world leads to the resignation of the authorities,"" Mr Nikoghosyan said. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest Protesters chanted ""Nikol, Nikol"" in the streets on Monday, the 11th straight day of protests. They were joined by hundreds of uniformed soldiers, despite warnings from the defence ministry that any soldiers protesting would be harshly punished. Mr Pashinyan congratulated the people on their ""victory"" following the resignation. ""You have won, proud citizens of the Republic of Armenia. And no-one can seize this victory from you. I congratulate you, victorious people,"" he wrote on Facebook. Mr Sargsyan had faced criticism in Armenia over his close ties to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has also moved between roles as president and prime minister to maintain his grip on power. Mr Putin's spokesman said on Monday that Moscow was closely watching events in Yerevan. ""We are very attentively observing what is happening in Armenia,"" Dmitry Peskov told journalists, calling the country ""extremely important"" for Russia. Asked if Russia would intervene, Mr Peskov said the matter was ""exclusively an internal affair"" and Russian action would be ""absolutely inappropriate"". Rayhan DemytrieinYerevan Jubilation filled the Republic Square in Yerevan as people cracked open bottles of champagne, dancing in the fountain, hugging and waving flags. ""This is what victory feels like,"" said Lena, wrapped in the Armenian tricolour. ""This is a day to live for, this is the day to be here to witness history!"" said her husband Armen. When Mr Pashinyan arrived at Republic Square after being released, the people chanted his name and ""Victory!"". Shortly after, news broke that Mr Sargsyan had resigned and it was as if a firework of joy had exploded in the square. Many here say it is a victory for the whole nation, that the people stood up for democracy and won. And it came on the eve of April 24, which Armenians worldwide mark as Remembrance Day for the victims of mass killings of Armenians at the turn of the 20th century in Ottoman Turkey. The events in Armenia are significant, because they demonstrate that in a post-Soviet country change is possible through a peaceful, organic, grassroots movement. The fact that the Armenian authorities showed restraint and did not use excessive force against the demonstrators is also an achievement. But it's important to remember that the new acting prime minister is an old ally of Mr Sargsyan. Only the leadership has changed. In 2015, Armenians voted in a referendum to shift the country from a presidential to a parliamentary system, stripping powers from the president and giving them to the prime minister. The vote was marred by allegations of ballot rigging and claims Mr Sargsyan wanted to simply switch office after his presidency ended. The ex-president had formally stated he would ""not aspire"" to the prime ministerial position, but on Tuesday last week the country's parliament officially confirmed Mr Sargsyan in the post. Protesters poured into the streets in the days beforehand to try to stop the parliament from passing the measure, and clashed with police. On the day of the confirmation, Mr Pashinyan said the demonstrations constituted a ""non-violent velvet revolution"". Mr Sargsyan has been criticised for his close ties to Russia Mr Sargsyan served two consecutive terms as president of Armenia, starting in 2008 and ending on 9 April this year. His initial election in 2008 prompted deadly clashes between the state and opposition supporters. At least eight people died. He won a second five-year term in 2013. Several of his opponents dropped out of the race and one candidate was shot in a suspected assassination attempt. Mr Sargsyan was also accused of failing to address continuing tensions with Azerbaijan and Turkey, as well as widespread poverty at home.

World first penis and scrotum transplant,"Dr Andrew Lee (second from left) and his team at Johns Hopkins University A team of US doctors has successfully carried out the world's first total transplant of a penis and scrotum. Surgeons at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, performed the operation on a soldier who had been wounded by a bomb in Afghanistan. They used a penis, scrotum and partial abdominal wall transplanted from a deceased donor. They say the soldier should be able to regain sexual function, which is impossible with penis reconstructions. The team of 11 surgeons performed the transplant over 14 hours on 26 March. It is the first surgery on a combat veteran injured on duty and the first to transplant a complete section of tissue including the scrotum and surrounding abdominal area. Doctors said the donor testicles were not transplanted, due to ethical considerations. ""While extremity amputations are visible and resultant disability obvious,"" said Dr WP Andrew Lee, head of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Johns Hopkins University, during a telebriefing on Monday, ""some war injuries are hidden and their impact not widely appreciated by others."" Dr Lee called genitalia wounds an ""unspoken injury of war"". ""In a 2014 symposium co-sponsored by Johns Hopkins titled 'Intimacy After Injury', we heard from the spouses, families, and caregivers of these wounded warriors about the devastating impact of genitourinary injuries on their identity, self-esteem and intimate relationships,"" he said. The soldier, who wishes to remain anonymous, said in a statement released by the university: ""When I first woke up, I felt finally more normal like finally I'm okay now."" His injury was the result of stepping on a hidden bomb in Afghanistan. In medical terms, the surgery is called a vascularised composite allotransplantation - which is all to say that the process involves transplanting skin, bone, muscles, tendons and blood vessels. The Johns Hopkins Genital Transplant Program, which funded the surgery, has initially focused on post-traumatic cases, particularly injured soldiers, as their wounds generally make conventional options impossible. Experts from the surgical team,externalexpect the soldier will be fully recovered in six to 12 months. Dr Rick Redett, clinical director of the genitourinary transplant programme, said that the soldier is recovering well and is expected to be discharged from hospital this week. ""It is our hope that such a life enhancing transplant will allow him to regain urinary and sexual function and lead a more normal life,"" Dr Redett said. ""It is also our goal to offer the procedure in the future to other suitable patients."" The transplant team also said that the university has approved 60 genital transplant surgeries as a part of the programme. Thefirst penis transplant in the USwas in 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In 2014,South African surgeonsperformed the world's first successful penis transplant.

Alfie protesters try to storm hospital,"This video can not be played Protesters tried to storm the Alder Hey Children's Hospital entrance A group of protesters supporting terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have tried to storm Alder Hey hospital. About 200 people turned up to protest outside the Liverpool hospital after judges at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) refused to intervene in the case. Dozens ran towards the main doors before police officers formed a line to block the entrance. An ECHR spokesman said the family's application was ""inadmissible"". After a short stand-off with police the supporters retreated to gather around 100 yards away on the road outside, chanting: ""Save Alfie Evans."" Earlier the supporters blocked the road outside the hospital for about 15 minutes, with an ambulance becoming trapped as traffic quickly backed up. Protesters, who had linked arms, allowed the ambulance to pass before moving to line both sides of the road. Alfie Evans is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" in Alder Hey Children's Hospital Alfie's father Tom Evans briefly spoke to supporters outside the hospital against the treatment of his son. He has also been broadcasting intermittently on Facebook from inside, where several groups of police officers have been patrolling the corridors. Mr Evans's sister Sarah later emerged briefly to speak to supporters outside and said: ""Tom is heartbroken upstairs, obviously he can't come out now."" In a statement Alder Hey said it remained open as usual for all visitors and appointments, but warned that visitors may notice an increase in visible police presence as part of ""our ongoing security arrangements"". It encouraged people to attend appointments, but told patients to contact the hospital about ""any concerns you may have attending"". Allow Twitter content?

Ch Insp Chris Gibson said while officers ""recognised the sensitivities involved in this very difficult and sad situation"" they would like to remind the public it was a hospital for sick children. ""It should not be forgotten that many families are going through extremely challenging and emotional times. ""We would ask protestors to respect families and staff, including the poorly children in the wards and to ensure that access to the hospital is not restricted at any time, so that services including the blood and ambulance service can run as efficiently as possible."" The road outside the hospital was blocked for about 15 minutes Mr Evans and Alfie's mother Kate James had lodged an urgent application with the ECHR over the 23-month-old's life support at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. The Supreme Court has approved a planfor withdrawing treatment and bringing Alfie's life to an end. Judges said the hospital must be ""free to do what has been determined to be in Alfie's best interests"". Who is Alfie Evans? Supreme Court rules against Alfie parents Alfie Evans hospital 'scary' to visit Last week Mr Evans and Ms James, who are from Liverpool, failed to persuade the Supreme Court that Alfie was being unlawfully detained at Alder Hey. They wanted to take Alfie - who has been suffering from an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease - to Rome's Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital, which has links to the Vatican, where his palliative care would continue. Before today's ECHR ruling, Alfie's parents had already lost a first round of cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal and European Court of Human Rights, as well as two cases at the Supreme Court. Tom Evans and Kate James want to take Alfie to a hospital in Rome Last week Merseyside Police said it was investigating ""acts of intimidation"" among protesters outside Alder Hey after the atmosphere outside the hospital was described as ""intimidating and scary"". Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, which is now representing Alfie's family, previously described Mr Evans and Ms James as ""devoted parents"". Earlier this monthMr Evans flew to Rome to meet Pope Francisand begged him to ""save our son"". The Pope previously tweeted his support for Alfie, saying he hoped the ""deep suffering"" of the toddler's parents would be heard.

"Rudd vows speedy Windrush compensationLabour warns against ""token sums"" as the home secretary promises to waive British citizenship fees.","The home secretary said she would do all she could to ""right the wrongs"" that had been done UK citizenship fees and language tests will be waived for the Windrush generation and their families, Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said. She told MPs she wanted people to have the ""formal status"" they should have had all along, without having to pay naturalisation fees or pass any tests. She also vowed speedy compensation for anyone who had ""suffered loss"". Labour said the ""buck stopped"" with Ms Rudd for a crisis which had brought ""shame"" on the government. In a statement to Parliament, Ms Rudd said the citizenship offer would apply not just to the families of Caribbean migrants who came to the UK between 1948 and 1973, but anyone from other Commonwealth nations who settled in the UK over the same period. Who are the Windrush generation? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories Are you from the Windrush generation? Ms Rudd apologised again for changes to immigration rules - dubbed the ""hostile environment"" policy - which she said had had an ""unintended and devastating"" impact on the Windrush generation. While the public expected immigration rules to be enforced, she said, it had never been the intention for a crackdown on illegal immigration to affect those who were ""British in all but their legal status"". ""This should never have happened,"" she told MPs. ""We need to show a human face to how we work and exercise greater judgement where it is justified."" After days of damaging headlines and repeated apologies, the home secretary sought to draw a line under this scandal with a series of significant concessions. However, Amber Rudd sparked anger on the opposition benches after she suggested the scandal was the result of successive changes to immigration rules by governments dating back to the 1980s. While some of the detail surrounding the policy changes have yet be spelt out, ministers will hope that they have done enough to correct the mistakes that have been made and to assuage widespread public anger at the treatment of the Windrush families. She said she wanted to give the Windrush generation the formal immigration status they ""should have had a long time ago"" by encouraging those who were not UK citizens to apply to become so. All fees, language and citizenship tests connected with the naturalisation process would be waived and anyone who had left the UK but been prevented from coming back would now be helped to do so, without any fees. The offer will apply to those who already have leave to remain, those who do not have the paperwork usually required and children of the Windrush generation. ""In effect this means anyone from the Windrush generation who now wants to become a British citizen will be able to do so,"" she said. Ms Rudd said nine residency cases had been settled by a special Home Office team set up to deal with the crisis, while 84 individuals had had appointments made. Nick Broderick, who came to Britain from Jamaica as a toddler, has spent Â£30,000 fighting deportation. He told the BBC that Ms Rudd's announcement was ""positive"" and would ""help a lot of people"". He said he was hoping to work again ""and get my life back on track"". He said although he had heard nothing about compensation, he was glad he could now become a citizen. Glenda Caesar, who came to the UK from Dominica with her parents as a six-month-old baby, recently won her battle for citizenship with the Home Office. The fees and the documentation had been particularly difficult to provide, she said, and she was ""so happy"" with this move - but still felt annoyed by the saga. ""It's a lot of hurt that I had to go through... We've lost money, I've lost money, I'm in arrears with certain bills. ""So it was, y'know a financial loss to a lot of us, a lot of us, not only myself. ""They've taken 10 years away from me."" 'Let down' All Home Office records dating back to 2002 would be checked to see if anyone had been wrongly deported, Ms Rudd told MPs, adding that no cases had been identified so far with about 50% of documents verified. She added: ""The state has let these people down, with travel documents denied, exclusions from returning to the UK, benefits cut and and even threats of removal. This has happened for some time. ""I will put this right and where people have suffered loss, they will be compensated. This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? ""None of this can undo the pain already endured, but I hope it demonstrates the government's commitment to put these wrongs right, going forward."" Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said the scandal ""should not have been a surprise"" to ministers, given the warnings they had received, and told Ms Rudd ""ultimately the buck stops"" with her. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK ""She is behaving as if it is a shock to her that officials are implementing regulations in the way she intended them to be implemented,"" she said. While she welcomed the promise of compensation, she said there was a lack of detail and the sums should ""reflect the damage to family life"" suffered by families and not be ""token"". Reflecting on her families' personal experience, she said: ""This was a generation with unparalleled commitment to this country, unparalleled pride in being British, unparalleled commitment to hard work and contributing to society. ""It is shameful this government has treated this generation in this way."" And Labour's David Lammy, a leading campaigner for justice for the Windrush families, said they were being offered something which was already their right. He called on ministers to help others who also made their life in the UK after World War Two but who might not get equal treatment. ""They are from countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda,"" he said. ""Many of these people have temporary leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain. It is unfair. They were born under Empire."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ukraine gang hid wealth in London flatsDetails from the Paradise Papers show millions were secretly invested in the UK via offshore firms.,"Four apartments in 199 Knightsbridge have been linked to the gang A Ukrainian crime gang used offshore firms in British tax havens to secretly invest millions of pounds in the UK, a BBC Panorama investigation has found. The gangsters, and in some cases family members, bought luxurious property in prime London locations, including a Â£12.5m flat. The daughter of a man dubbed the ""Don of Odessa"" is the registered owner of three homes in one expensive block. Many of the revelations come from the Paradise Papers data breach. The gang were from the Black Sea port of Odessa and made money in the oil industry. They came on to the police's radar in the late 1990s when they were suspected of drugs and arms smuggling. In the chaos following the collapse of the Soviet Union the gang branched out into Europe, using Italy as a base. But police were on to them. For four years specialist anti-mafia officers tracked their movements across the continent. They tapped their phones and what the men discussed was chilling, police said. This video can not be played As he interrogated a suspected gangster about money laundering, BBC reporter Andy Verity was kicked and knocked over ""They described murders that were particularly cruel. 'I kept hitting his head until it broke... I killed him with many blows,'"" recalls Italian state police Deputy Commissioner Nunzia Savino.  ""They were extremely violent."" The gang was organised along strict mafia lines with each member assigned a role. Among them were: Alexander Angert, nicknamed the Don of Odessa.  Police say he was once jailed for murder Nickolay Fomichev, described as a ""violent and armed person"" Gennadiy Trukhanov, a man who trained members of the gang in ""hand-to-hand combat and sniper shooting with high precision weapons"", according to Ms Savino.  He is now the mayor of Odessa Gennadiy Trukhanov was identified in an Italian state police report in 1998 Despite evidence from the phone taps, most of the gang members were never charged because their crimes were not committed in Italy. Eventually, the anti-mafia investigation was wound up. Mr Trukhanov returned to Odessa to begin his political career, Mr Angert settled in London while Mr Fomichev is believed to have moved to Belgium. Like many other investors looking for a solid return on their capital, the gangsters saw a promising opportunity for their cash in the London property market. The men kept their names off public records by using offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), where it was possible to be an anonymous owner. Mr Angert controlled a company called East Corner Properties set up in the BVI. It bought an apartment in an expensive Victorian block in Kensington where the poet TS Eliot once lived. In 2001 another offshore firm, Matelot Real Estate Incorporated, paid just over Â£1m for a flat in a shiny new tower block on the River Thames across from Chelsea Harbour, which it sold in 2006. The Thames apartment was purchased for more than Â£1m in 2001 We don't know who was originally behind it because when it was set up Matelot had nominee directors and an anonymous owner. But thanks to the huge Paradise Papers data breach, we do know in 2010 the ultimate beneficial owner of Matelot was Nickolay Fomichev, a member of the gang. In a joint investigation with theOrganised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project,external, Panorama has delved into documents from Appleby, the offshore services provider at the heart of the Paradise Papers. The documents were originally obtained by German newspaper Suddeustche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the BBC and nearly 100 other media partners. In December 2015, the Appleby Group's offshore fiduciary and administrative service business separated from its legal division to form a group of new companies called Estera. Appleby and Estera are now separately owned businesses. As well as revealing Mr Fomichev's connection to Matelot, the Paradise Papers show two other flats in the building were owned by another offshore company linked to the gang. Mr Fomichev's name crops up in connection with more property a couple of miles north of the river in one of the world's most affluent areas. Number 199 Knightsbridge resembles an expensive hotel, with security and staff manning the entrance. Paradise Papers: Everything you need to know WATCH: How to hide your cash offshore Are we taming offshore finance? Two apartments in the building were bought by offshore companies called Brightside Properties Number 3 and 4. The numbers don't relate to the flat numbers. Documents show by 2010 both companies were owned by Mr Fomichev, who is now believed to be dead. A document links Mr Fomichev with a company that bought a flat at 199 Knightsbridge In 2015 Brightside sold the flats to a young budding film-maker named Anya Angert. She is the daughter of the Don of Odessa. The purchase price for just one of the flats was Â£12.5m. It is unclear how Ms Angert was able to afford it, but she now owns a total of three flats at 199 Knightsbridge. The daughter of the ""Don of Odessa"" is the registered owner of a Â£12.5m flat We have also discovered that a fourth flat in the block was linked to the gang. Donald Toon, director of the National Crime Agency, said the case ""certainly gives me cause for suspicion... that there is money laundering taking place"". ""What we need to do in these circumstances is to be able to be clear how much of that material is capable of being used in court as evidence as it stands,"" he added. Establishing offshore companies needs help from professionals.  London accountant Alexander Popivker, working from an office in Finchley, set up and administered dozens of offshore companies - known as the Rubicon Group - with the help of Appleby. Some of these companies were used by the gang from Odessa. To guard against money laundering international firms like Appleby are required to carry out rigorous checks on all their clients. But they can allow other professionals to conduct due diligence checks for them. They made Mr Popivker an ""eligible introducer"", which meant he could bring new businesses into the Appleby fold and vouch for their owners. Mr Popivker is based in north London It is legal. But for the system to work the introducer has to be thorough and independent. Mr Popivker is married to the sister of mafia boss Alexander Angert. Money laundering checks should be especially thorough when a company is owned by politicians or politically exposed persons (PEPs). Mr Trukhanov has been accused of corruption in Odessa The Paradise Papers show Gennadiy Trukhanov had a major stake in four offshore firms that were administered by Appleby. For years, Appleby seemed unaware that he had become a PEP. When it asked Mr Popivker about the money, he told Appleby ""Gennadiy Trukhanov is unknown to us"". But documents in Appleby's own files suggest this was not true. When Panorama caught up with Mr Popivker, he denied dealings with the mayor, saying he had ""never dealt with him in any capacity"". Mr Popivker later told us: ""At no time and under no circumstances did my company or I personally engage, either historically or currently, with a client or group of clients where the clients' integrity, activities, sources of their funds or the nature of proposed transactions were in any doubt as to their legitimacy of legality."" Mr Trukhanov is currently under criminal investigation in Ukraine. Last October his home and offices in Odessa were raided. In February he was arrested and accused of embezzlement in Odessa but was allowed to carry on as mayor. ""We suspect the mayor of Odessa of stealing money from the city of Odessa,"" said Nazar Kholodnytskiy, Ukraine's special anti-corruption prosecutor. Mr Trukhanov denies the allegations. He also denied all of Panorama's claims, saying the programme was putting out false information which ""undermines his honour, dignity and reputation"". Appleby has been in the firing line in the past. For almost 10 years, the offshore service provider's BVI office failed to notice it was setting up and administering some companies that were being used by gangsters to launder money. In February 2009 a compliance manager pointed out that Appleby BVI was not running adequate checks on companies. A compliance manager in 2009 highlighted a lack of adequate checks by Appleby's BVI office The same report pointed to a company set up by Mr Popivker as an example of where proper checks had not been carried out. In 2011, an Appleby employee noticed serious problems in the record keeping for Mr Popivker's companies. Local regulators also picked up on problems in Appleby's BVI office. In 2012 the BVI Financial Services Commission (FSC) found there was missing compliance documentation. In 2013 the commission wrote to the group managing partner of Appleby about ""continued and significant regulatory deficiencies"" and in 2014 concluded Appleby BVI had broken money laundering rules. Appleby says that ""whilst it is correct that the 2014 FSC Report identified certain areas of improvement, Appleby had by that time already taken a number of corrective actions."" It says the documents we are using were stolen. Appleby BVI finally parted ways with Mr Popivker in 2015 after the BVI's Financial Investigation Agency demanded to know who was behind one of the companies he was acting for as part of a money-laundering inquiry. Appleby says it was legally entitled to rely on Mr Popivker to carry out due diligence and stopped using eligible introducers in 2015. In the same year the 60-plus companies in the Rubicon Group were moved to a different offshore provider. Transparency International, which assisted in the investigation, says it is far too easy for criminals to bring dirty money into the UK. ""Corrupt individuals cannot steal public funds unless they have a getaway vehicle and then a safe place to stash their stolen loot,"" said its head of advocacy, Rachel Davies Teka. ""And anonymous companies are the getaway vehicle and UK assets, such as property, are the safe haven."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the UK has become the money laundering capital of the world. ""Our reputation is being damaged by it... There's been too many examples over years of dirty money coming into the city and by allowing this to happen we are almost aiding and abetting these criminals,"" he said. The government has promised to introduce a public register to reveal the true owners of UK properties owned by offshore companies. Security and Economic Crime Minister Ben Wallace said he is determined to stop money laundering. ""We will come for them, for their assets and their money.  I am determined that we use all the powers we have, including the new powers in the Criminal Finances Act, to counter the threat from illicit funds."" The powers include unexplained wealth orders, which allow assets to be seized where the source of funds is suspicious. The National Crime Agency said the orders could potentially be used to seize some of the London flats linked to the Ukrainian gang.

"UK will leave customs union, insists No 10","This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? The government has restated its commitment to leaving the EU's custom union - ahead of a symbolic vote on the issue this week. Last Wednesday, the government suffered defeat on the EU Withdrawal Bill in the House of Lords on the issue of staying in a UK-EU customs union after Brexit. And MPs will get their own chance to debate the issue on Thursday. But a senior Downing Street source told the BBC the government's position would not change. ""We will not be staying in the customs union or joining a customs union,"" the source said. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Downing Street's move was an attempt to reassure Brexiteers worried about a U-turn following the Lords defeat and pressure from the EU. Laura Kuenssberg: A matter of confidence? Reality Check: What is a customs union? Brexit: All you need to know Ministers suffer first Lords Brexit defeat A customs union is when countries agree to apply the same taxes on imports to goods from outside the union. This means when goods have cleared customs in one country, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed. If the UK remains part of the customs union, it would be unable to strike trade deals with countries around the world. Please upgrade your browser But supporters say it would help to keep an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Labour has called for the UK to join a new customs union post-Brexit, saying it would leave the current one but negotiate a treaty afterwards that would ""do the work of the customs union"". But speaking on a visit to a business in the West Midlands, Mrs May said leaving the customs union would allow the UK to strike new trade deals around the world, adding that she was seeking a ""frictionless"" border with the EU. Brexit-supporting former minister John Whittingdale told BBC News Thursday's non-binding vote would be ""a piece of theatre"" but would have ""no significance at all"". But he predicted pressure for the government when the EU Withdrawal Bill returned to the House of Commons in the coming weeks, saying reversing peers' amendments could prove ""more challenging"". More crunch votes are expected when Remain-supporting MPs try to amend the trade and customs bills to put more pressure on the government to negotiate a customs union. By Eleanor Garnier, BBC political correspondent Theresa May has made leaving the customs union central to her whole approach to Brexit. Downing Street's decision to reiterate its long-held position demonstrates concern at the top of government. This week's debate will be purely symbolic and will not tie the government's hands. But it could give an indication of the opposition the prime minister might face in a crunch vote on the issue next month. With sabre-rattling from both sides of the argument, Downing Street felt sufficiently worried to clarify its position overnight. The House of Lords is continuing its examination of the government's key EU Withdrawal Bill this week. Last week's amendment would not necessarily keep the UK in the customs union - but would commit ministers to reporting on steps to negotiate a continued union. Meanwhilethe Times reports,externalthat Theresa May is facing pressure from Brexit-supporting ministers on the customs issue. The report focuses on one of the two possible options put forward by Mrs May last month that would involve the UK imposing the same checks as the EU when goods arrive at its borders that are destined for the EU. The Times said Brexit Secretary David Davis, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were concerned this would ""encourage Brussels to press for Britain to stay in a customs union after Brexit"". Mr Fox said the UK's trade policy would be ""infinitely adaptable"" in a speech where he promised the financial industry the government would ""make it easier to do business overseas"". The UK, he said, would use its ""economic and diplomatic influence"" around the world to remove barriers and ""spread prosperity to every corner of the globe"". He added: ""Whatever one's view on the referendum result, it must be acknowledged that, outside the EU, this country will enjoy a new degree of economic agility.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsStephen Lawrence Day to be held annuallyNational commemoration of murdered teenager to take place on 22 April each year, UK PM says7m8 minutes agoUK","A national day of commemoration for murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence will take place on 22 April every year, the prime minister has said. It came as the family of the black teenager attended the 25th anniversary memorial of his death in London. The 18-year-old was stabbed to death in a racially motivated attack in Eltham, south London, in 1993. Royal couple Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attended the service at St-Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square. Prime Minister Theresa May said that Stephen's mother Doreen - now a peer in the Lords - and his father Neville ""have fought heroically to ensure that their son's life and death will never be forgotten"". Mr Lawrence was set upon by a gang, stabbed and left to die in Eltham on the evening of 22 April 1993. Two of the group of up to six men who attacked the teenager and his friend Duwayne Brooks have been convicted of murder, but the rest have evaded justice. David Norris and Gary Dobson are both serving life sentences. The Macpherson Report into the investigation into Stephen Lawrence's death found that there had been ""institutional racism"" in the police. Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline of how the story unfolded Stephen Lawrence filmmaker wants viewers to feel family's emotions Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also attended the memorial. Mrs May said: ""It is right that Stephen's name and legacy lives on."" This video can not be played Harry and Meghan met Stuart and Doreen Lawrence before the service Baroness Lawrence, Stephen's mother, with Prime Minister Theresa May Baroness Lawrence said she looked forward to delivering the first Stephen Lawrence Day in 2019 alongside the government, adding: ""I feel honoured she has recognised the changes that have been made in Stephen's name and the changes that are still needed."" She thanked those who had helped her throughout the years and said that after 25 years ""it is time to draw a line"". The government will work alongside the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust - set up to transform the lives of young people and campaign for social change - to deliver an annual commemoration to the death of Stephen Lawrence, which was considered a watershed moment in race relations in the UK. Baroness Lawrence meeting Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at St-Martin-in-the-Field Prince Harry said: ""It hardly seems possible that 25 years have passed since Stephen Lawrence was so cruelly taken from his family. ""I remember vividly the profound shock that I felt at his senseless murder, a feeling shared by so many people across this country and beyond. ""I remember, too, just how deeply moved I was by the determination of Stephen's family to build something positive from the tragedy they endured and to ensure that Stephen's story did not end with despair, but continued with hope.""

"Missing stag do man's body 'found in river'Liam Colgan, 29, had been reported missing on his brother's stag weekend in Hamburg in February.3h3 hours agoHighlands & Islands","The body of missing Inverness man Liam Colgan is believed to have been found in the River Elbe in Hamburg. The 29-year-old was on his brother Eamonn's stag weekend in the German city when he vanished on 10 February. His disappearance sparked major searches in the city and widespread appeals on social media. Formal identification of the body - which was found on Monday morning - has still to take place, but Hamburg Police said it was believed to be Liam. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which helps families of people missing abroad, thanked those involved in the search. Emergency services gathered near the scene of where Liam's body was found in the River Elbe The trust said the man found in the River Elbe had been wearing the same clothes as Liam, and had his driving licence in his pocket. The discovery may bring to end more thantwo months of searching for Liam. The trust has asked that Mr Colgan's family ""be given space and privacy to grieve at this difficult time"". The charity's chief executive, Matthew Searle, said: ""An astonishing amount of support has been apparent in this case - the search for Liam has been joined by thousands of people, both German and British, and we would like to thank all of them for their support. ""Our thoughts are of course with Liam's family and friends today."" Eamonn Colgan has previously spoken of Liam being a 'very proud and doting uncle' to his children His disappearance had sparked a major search effort in the German city. Thousands of leaflets were distributed in Hamburg during the attempts to trace Liam, a postman and keen musician. Dundee-based police officer Eamonn and his fiancÃ©e Susan Dolan postponed their wedding while searches took place. Liam's family had beenpreparing to widen their search to other German cities, working on a theory that he injured his head in a fall and was suffering from amnesia. In an interview with BBC Radio Scotland last month, Eamonn described his brother as a ""very laid back, very positive, a very proud and doting uncle to my two children"". CCTV images of Liam at the time of his disappearance He also thanked those involved in the search for his brother. Eamonn said: ""It's incredible the help we've had from strangers. If they can be hopeful, then I can be that way as well. ""We've been told the efforts by ourselves and others in trying to find Liam in Hamburg is unprecedented. That makes me feel confident that we are doing everything we can to find him."" Eamonn added that the family were finding ""constant reminders"" of his brother.

Shania sorry for saying she'd vote Trump,"Twain also revealed to The Guardian that she had been abused as a child Shania Twain has apologised after saying she would have voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 US election. The Canadian singer, who cannot vote in the US,told the Guardian,externalshe appreciated the President's honesty. ""I would have voted for him because, even though he was offensive, he seemed honest,"" she said. ""Do you want straight or polite?"" After a social media backlash, the star issued a statement saying the comments were not ""representative of my values"". Twain, whose hits include That Don't Impress Me Much and You're Still The One, recently returned to the spotlight after a 14-year break, triggered by the collapse of her marriage followed by vocal problems and a battle with Lyme disease. She spoke to the Guardian as she embarked on her first tour since 2002. The comments about President Trump were not the focus of the interview, but were picked up by media outlets around the world. The 52-year-old said she felt the President was ""transparent - and politics has a reputation of not being that, right?"" Liberal fans treated the comments with a mixture of surprise and anger - with one declaring ""Shania Twain't"" - while conservatives welcomed her comments. Allow Twitter content?

Following the debate over her comments, Shania posted a four-part statement on Twitters, saying: ""I would like to apologise to anybody I have offended. ""The question caught me off guard. As a Canadian, I regret answering this unexpected question without giving my response more context,"" she continued. ""I was trying to explain, in a response to a question about the election, that my limited understanding was that the president talked to a portion of America like an accessible person they could relate to, as he was not a politician. ""My answer was awkward, but certainly should not be taken as representative of my values nor does it mean I endorse him. ""I make music to bring people together. My path will always be one of inclusivity, as my history shows.""

""I feel the sexual abuse goes hand in hand with the physical and psychological abuse when it's somebody you know,"" the star said. ""I learned to block it out.

Missing stag do man's body 'found in river',"The body of missing Inverness man Liam Colgan is believed to have been found in the River Elbe in Hamburg. The 29-year-old was on his brother Eamonn's stag weekend in the German city when he vanished on 10 February. His disappearance sparked major searches in the city and widespread appeals on social media. Formal identification of the body - which was found on Monday morning - has still to take place, but Hamburg Police said it was believed to be Liam. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which helps families of people missing abroad, thanked those involved in the search. Emergency services gathered near the scene of where Liam's body was found in the River Elbe The trust said the man found in the River Elbe had been wearing the same clothes as Liam, and had his driving licence in his pocket. The discovery may bring to end more thantwo months of searching for Liam. The trust has asked that Mr Colgan's family ""be given space and privacy to grieve at this difficult time"". The charity's chief executive, Matthew Searle, said: ""An astonishing amount of support has been apparent in this case - the search for Liam has been joined by thousands of people, both German and British, and we would like to thank all of them for their support. ""Our thoughts are of course with Liam's family and friends today."" Eamonn Colgan has previously spoken of Liam being a 'very proud and doting uncle' to his children His disappearance had sparked a major search effort in the German city. Thousands of leaflets were distributed in Hamburg during the attempts to trace Liam, a postman and keen musician. Dundee-based police officer Eamonn and his fiancÃ©e Susan Dolan postponed their wedding while searches took place. Liam's family had beenpreparing to widen their search to other German cities, working on a theory that he injured his head in a fall and was suffering from amnesia. In an interview with BBC Radio Scotland last month, Eamonn described his brother as a ""very laid back, very positive, a very proud and doting uncle to my two children"". CCTV images of Liam at the time of his disappearance He also thanked those involved in the search for his brother. Eamonn said: ""It's incredible the help we've had from strangers. If they can be hopeful, then I can be that way as well. ""We've been told the efforts by ourselves and others in trying to find Liam in Hamburg is unprecedented. That makes me feel confident that we are doing everything we can to find him."" Eamonn added that the family were finding ""constant reminders"" of his brother.

The footballers giving racism the boot,"Smile! The footballers of All Black FC - which has expanded to welcome Chinese Hongkongers and other ethnic minorities In Hong Kong, locals rarely play football with immigrants. Not surprising, perhaps, when a third of Chinese Hongkongers don't want to sit next to members of other ethnic groups on public transport, live next door to them, or have their children as classmates to their own children,according to a survey by the NGO Hong Kong Unison.,external Is the beautiful game really powerful enough to overcome that kind of prejudice? Since 2016, a ""refugee"" football team - All Black FC - has been testing the theory as its players try to integrate, and build a better image for Africans in Hong Kong. The team's founder Medard Privat Koya is a former professional footballer from the Central African Republic. While his first players were almost all African asylum seekers, the squad has expanded to welcome Chinese locals and other ethnic minorities. ""Football can bring all of us together,"" he reckons. ""We can bring ideas, share experience and support each other."" It's also a constructive use of time - which is valuable because asylum seekers aren't allowed to work in Hong Kong, even if they have lived in the city for years. Many of the team are unable to work legally in Hong Kong Darius, an asylum seeker from Togo, arrived in Hong Kong five years ago. He's the team captain, and says football gives him a sense of purpose as they are not allowed to work. ""It is really hard. It makes people feel they are dying slowly because you spend five or seven years of your youth life waiting. You really start wondering what's are you going to become in the future? ""After all that time with no work, or training, what kind of job are you going to do? Who would hire you?"" says Darius. When he became part of this team, it gave him hope. ""There is a group of people that I belong to,"" he says. ""We fight for something together. People will respect us based on our skills."" What is Hong Kong like? The night time 'McRefugees' of Hong Kong WATCH: Football unity in divided Cyprus And for the team's most talented players, the distraction can lead to something bigger. An exceptional few are chosen to represent local football clubs, and can then apply for visas to work legally in Hong Kong. Captain Darius (centre) and founder Medard (right) want the team to be a source of support for players Medard is encouraged to see locals and other non-Africans joining All Black FC. It shows that their values are respected, he says. That's an unusual feeling for some of the team. Darius says it's difficult for immigrants to rent a flat in the city as many landlords look down on foreigners. Solomon Nyassi, a 26-year-old Gambian, tells BBC Chinese that on his first day in Hong Kong, he saw some people using their hands to cover their noses when they passed by him. Sometimes, he says, he walks down the street, and Chinese tourists surround him and ask for pictures, which makes him feel ""embarrassed"". Solomon met his girlfriend, 20-year-old Hong Kong woman Louise Chan at an All Black FC match. She believes African men are more ""mature"" and ""self-motivated"", and her family support the pair's relationship. But some people's reactions have shocked her. ""Hong Kong people are so closed-minded,"" says Louise, who owns a clothes shop. ""Some keep sending articles to me to tell the bad rumours about African people. I feel very disappointed."" Footballer Solomon and his girlfriend Louise have faced prejudice from some quarters Prejudice can show its face on the pitch, too. Darius says some Hong Kong locals think Africans play football ""violently"". Some have shouted foul language at the team. ""We always tell our players to keep disciplined,"" the captain says. ""No matter what has happened, we just need to keep it calm. We can't let them label us."" Doug Tze, a 34-year-old Hong Kong man, has been part of All Black FC since July 2017. He says he didn't feel totally welcome at first, and blames the African players' previous poor treatment at the hands of Hongkongers. But when he showed some effort and commitment, Doug says they became good friends who now hang out together. ""I don't see race; I just see good players,"" he says. All Black FC in action against Biu Chun Rangers, who play in the Hong Kong Premier League Kevin Fung, a college football player who recently played All Black FC in a tournament, believes the African players could motivate Hong Kong natives. ""They are passionate, focused and work hard. But Hong Kong players give up easily,"" Kevin says. ""Hong Kong people focus on other work and study. They only spare their little leisure time for football."" For that reason, he doubts football can really achieve racial harmony in Hong Kong. ""After all, local football is not a popular activity,"" he notes. ""In Hong Kong, there are only a few competitions. Official games are not broadcast widely. No-one really cares (about local football). Solving racial problems through football is doomed to be difficult."" All Black FC understand that too. So to further their goal of achieving social change, the players sometimes do voluntary work like visiting old peoples' homes to connect with the wider community. ""It changes the locals' mindset,"" says Darius. ""Maybe we are not benefitted directly today. But it may make a path for the next generation so that ethnic minorities, asylum seekers and refugees will be seen differently in future.""

Woman 'fined $500 over free airline apple',"Ms Tadlock says she plans to take the matter to court A woman says she is facing a $500 (Â£357) fine from the US customs agency after a free apple she was given as a snack on a plane was found in her bag. Crystal Tadlock, travelling to the US from Paris, said she was saving the fruit for her onward flight to Denver. But the apple was found in a random search by US border agents after her first flight landed in Minneapolis. US Customs and Border Patrol would not comment on the case, but said all agricultural items should be declared. The apple was handed out in a plastic Delta Air Lines bag. Ms Tadlock said she did not remove it from the bag, and instead put it in her baggage for the second part of her journey to Denver, Colorado. She posted a photo on Twitter of the plastic bag and box which had contained the contraband sliced fruit, adding the hashtag ""#anappleadaydoesntkeepcustomsaway"". Allow Twitter content?

Armenian PM resigns after protests,"This video can not be played Supporters mob Armenian protest leader Nikol Pashinyan after PM resigns There were scenes of jubilation in the Armenian capital Yerevan after protests forced the resignation of Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan. Opposition supporters accused Mr Sargsyan, who was made prime minister last week after serving 10 years as president, of clinging to power. ""The street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand,"" Mr Sargsyan said in a statement. Former prime minister Karen Karapetyan has taken over as acting PM. President Armen Sarkissian accepted Mr Sargsyan's and the government's resignation. Mr Sargsyan's announcement came soon after opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan was released from detention. Mr Pashinyan had been arrested on Sunday after he called for Mr Sargsyan's resignation during televised talks. As well as Mr Pashinyan, two other opposition politicians and some 200 demonstrators were held. Demonstrators rallied again in the capital Yerevan on Monday In his statement published on his website, Mr Sargsyan said he was ""addressing all citizens of the Republic of Armenia... for the last time as leader of the country."" ""Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,"" he said. ""The situation has several solutions, but I will not take any of them... I am leaving office of the country's leader, of prime minister."" His spokesman, Hovhannes Nikoghosyan, told the BBC that Mr Sargsyan was behaving responsibly and fulfilling the demands of the street movement which opposed his appointment as prime minister. ""I think his resignation is a clear demonstration of a democracy in force. It's not that every demonstration in every corner of the world leads to the resignation of the authorities,"" Mr Nikoghosyan said. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest Protesters chanted ""Nikol, Nikol"" in the streets on Monday, the 11th straight day of protests. They were joined by hundreds of uniformed soldiers, despite warnings from the defence ministry that any soldiers protesting would be harshly punished. Mr Pashinyan congratulated the people on their ""victory"" following the resignation. ""You have won, proud citizens of the Republic of Armenia. And no-one can seize this victory from you. I congratulate you, victorious people,"" he wrote on Facebook. Mr Sargsyan had faced criticism in Armenia over his close ties to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has also moved between roles as president and prime minister to maintain his grip on power. Mr Putin's spokesman said on Monday that Moscow was closely watching events in Yerevan. ""We are very attentively observing what is happening in Armenia,"" Dmitry Peskov told journalists, calling the country ""extremely important"" for Russia. Asked if Russia would intervene, Mr Peskov said the matter was ""exclusively an internal affair"" and Russian action would be ""absolutely inappropriate"". Rayhan DemytrieinYerevan Jubilation filled the Republic Square in Yerevan as people cracked open bottles of champagne, dancing in the fountain, hugging and waving flags. ""This is what victory feels like,"" said Lena, wrapped in the Armenian tricolour. ""This is a day to live for, this is the day to be here to witness history!"" said her husband Armen. When Mr Pashinyan arrived at Republic Square after being released, the people chanted his name and ""Victory!"". Shortly after, news broke that Mr Sargsyan had resigned and it was as if a firework of joy had exploded in the square. Many here say it is a victory for the whole nation, that the people stood up for democracy and won. And it came on the eve of April 24, which Armenians worldwide mark as Remembrance Day for the victims of mass killings of Armenians at the turn of the 20th century in Ottoman Turkey. The events in Armenia are significant, because they demonstrate that in a post-Soviet country change is possible through a peaceful, organic, grassroots movement. The fact that the Armenian authorities showed restraint and did not use excessive force against the demonstrators is also an achievement. But it's important to remember that the new acting prime minister is an old ally of Mr Sargsyan. Only the leadership has changed. In 2015, Armenians voted in a referendum to shift the country from a presidential to a parliamentary system, stripping powers from the president and giving them to the prime minister. The vote was marred by allegations of ballot rigging and claims Mr Sargsyan wanted to simply switch office after his presidency ended. The ex-president had formally stated he would ""not aspire"" to the prime ministerial position, but on Tuesday last week the country's parliament officially confirmed Mr Sargsyan in the post. Protesters poured into the streets in the days beforehand to try to stop the parliament from passing the measure, and clashed with police. On the day of the confirmation, Mr Pashinyan said the demonstrations constituted a ""non-violent velvet revolution"". Mr Sargsyan has been criticised for his close ties to Russia Mr Sargsyan served two consecutive terms as president of Armenia, starting in 2008 and ending on 9 April this year. His initial election in 2008 prompted deadly clashes between the state and opposition supporters. At least eight people died. He won a second five-year term in 2013. Several of his opponents dropped out of the race and one candidate was shot in a suspected assassination attempt. Mr Sargsyan was also accused of failing to address continuing tensions with Azerbaijan and Turkey, as well as widespread poverty at home.

Waffle House 'saviour' denies heroism,"This video can not be played 'I was completely doing it to save myself"": James Shaw Jr disarmed the gunman A customer who wrestled a gun from a naked attacker who killed four people at a Waffle House in Nashville, Tennessee on Sunday has described his deed as a ""selfish act"". James Shaw Jr was hailed as a hero by Nashville's mayor for wrestling the rifle out of the gunman's hands. But Mr Shaw has been more modest, saying he did it ""just to save myself"". A manhunt is currently under way for suspect Travis Reinking, 29. Two people were injured by the attacker. How did Waffle House suspect get guns despite ban? Mr Reinking was arrested last year after entering a restricted area near the White House, Nashville police spokesman Don Aaron said. Clockwise from top left: DeEbony Groves, Joe Perez, Taurean Sanderlin, and Akilah DaSilva The Waffle House attacker burst into the restaurant at 03:25 local time (08:25 GMT) on Sunday in the suburb of Antioch and opened fire with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Mr Shaw wrestled the weapon from the man, who then fled the scene on foot. ""I was completely doing it just to save myself,"" Mr Shaw told reporters at a news conference. ""I did save other people, but I don't want people to think that I was the Terminator or Superman or anybody like that."" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Monday said that they ""commend the actions"" of Mr Shaw, and added that President Donald Trump had offered his condolences to the victims. Akilah DaSilva, 23, was wounded outside the restaurant and later died in hospital. He was a student at the Middle Tennessee State University and an aspiring musician. ""He meant the world to us. He was humble, kind, compassionate, outgoing and very creative,"" Mr DaSilva's mother told CBS News. ""He spoke through his creativity and he entertained the world through his music."" Mr DaSilva's girlfriend, Shanita Waggoner, was injured in the shooting. DeEbony Groves, 21, was fatally wounded at the Waffle House. She went there with friends from her sorority, reports say. She studied at Belmont University, majoring in social work. Joe Perez, 20, was getting food at the Waffle House and died outside, according to police. In a Facebook post,,externalhis mother, Trisha Perez, said his family was ""broken"" with the loss. Taurean Sanderlin, 29, worked at the restaurant and was fatally shot outside, police said. Police examined the scene for clues The gunman used an AR-15 rifle in Sunday's shooting, officials say Mr Shaw said he had heard gunshots and glass smashing as people ran for cover. He then hid in the restaurant's toilet area but the gunman shot through the door, injuring his arm. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It was at that time that I kind of made up my mind - because there's no way to lock that door - that if it was going to come down to it he was gonna have to work to kill me,"" he said. When the firing stopped and the gunman was looking at his weapon, Mr Shaw rushed him and a scuffle ensued. ""I hit him with the door and the gun was kind of jammed up,"" he said. ""I grabbed it from him and I threw it over the counter top."" He then forced the gunman out of the restaurant. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Arriving in a pick-up truck, the killer shot two people outside the restaurant, before firing more shots inside, Mr Aaron said. The shooting occurred in the small hours of Sunday in a suburb of Nashville Three victims died at the scene and the fourth in hospital. Police say he was naked except for a green jacket, which he removed as he left the scene. The suspect was later spotted in woodland wearing black trousers but no shirt, police say. Murder warrants are being drawn up against Mr Reinking. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The suspect was previously held for breaching the security barrier at the White House in 2017. He told Secret Service officers that he had a right to ""inspect the grounds"" and that he wanted to meet President Donald Trump. Authorities confiscated weapons from Mr Reinking after the White House incident, giving them instead to his father. One of those weapons was reportedly an AR-15, which was the gun used in the Waffle House shooting. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A CNN article reportspolice were called to a public swimming pool,externalafter Mr Reinking dived into the water wearing a pink women's coat, before exposing himself to the lifeguards. And a year before the White House incident, Mr Reinking allegedly told officers his belief that Taylor Swift was stalking him and hacking his phone. ""Travis stated he did not want to hurt Taylor Swift or anyone else, he only wanted the harassment to stop,"" the police report read.

European judges reject Alfie Evans appeal,"This video can not be played Protesters tried to storm the Alder Hey Children's Hospital entrance A group of protesters supporting terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have tried to storm Alder Hey hospital. About 200 people turned up to protest outside the Liverpool hospital after judges at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) refused to intervene in the case. Dozens ran towards the main doors before police officers formed a line to block the entrance. An ECHR spokesman said the family's application was ""inadmissible"". After a short stand-off with police the supporters retreated to gather around 100 yards away on the road outside, chanting: ""Save Alfie Evans."" Earlier the supporters blocked the road outside the hospital for about 15 minutes, with an ambulance becoming trapped as traffic quickly backed up. Protesters, who had linked arms, allowed the ambulance to pass before moving to line both sides of the road. Alfie Evans is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" in Alder Hey Children's Hospital Alfie's father Tom Evans briefly spoke to supporters outside the hospital against the treatment of his son. He has also been broadcasting intermittently on Facebook from inside, where several groups of police officers have been patrolling the corridors. Mr Evans's sister Sarah later emerged briefly to speak to supporters outside and said: ""Tom is heartbroken upstairs, obviously he can't come out now."" In a statement Alder Hey said it remained open as usual for all visitors and appointments, but warned that visitors may notice an increase in visible police presence as part of ""our ongoing security arrangements"". It encouraged people to attend appointments, but told patients to contact the hospital about ""any concerns you may have attending"". Allow Twitter content?

Ch Insp Chris Gibson said while officers ""recognised the sensitivities involved in this very difficult and sad situation"" they would like to remind the public it was a hospital for sick children. ""It should not be forgotten that many families are going through extremely challenging and emotional times. ""We would ask protestors to respect families and staff, including the poorly children in the wards and to ensure that access to the hospital is not restricted at any time, so that services including the blood and ambulance service can run as efficiently as possible."" The road outside the hospital was blocked for about 15 minutes Mr Evans and Alfie's mother Kate James had lodged an urgent application with the ECHR over the 23-month-old's life support at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. The Supreme Court has approved a planfor withdrawing treatment and bringing Alfie's life to an end. Judges said the hospital must be ""free to do what has been determined to be in Alfie's best interests"". Who is Alfie Evans? Supreme Court rules against Alfie parents Alfie Evans hospital 'scary' to visit Last week Mr Evans and Ms James, who are from Liverpool, failed to persuade the Supreme Court that Alfie was being unlawfully detained at Alder Hey. They wanted to take Alfie - who has been suffering from an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease - to Rome's Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital, which has links to the Vatican, where his palliative care would continue. Before today's ECHR ruling, Alfie's parents had already lost a first round of cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal and European Court of Human Rights, as well as two cases at the Supreme Court. Tom Evans and Kate James want to take Alfie to a hospital in Rome Last week Merseyside Police said it was investigating ""acts of intimidation"" among protesters outside Alder Hey after the atmosphere outside the hospital was described as ""intimidating and scary"". Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, which is now representing Alfie's family, previously described Mr Evans and Ms James as ""devoted parents"". Earlier this monthMr Evans flew to Rome to meet Pope Francisand begged him to ""save our son"". The Pope previously tweeted his support for Alfie, saying he hoped the ""deep suffering"" of the toddler's parents would be heard.

By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent After some quieter times, the
Royal Family is back in the news - and there is is a noticeable sense of
renewal; new faces, with Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fiancee, making her first
public appearances, and now another child, the as-yet unnamed third child of
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. It's always gone like this -
waves of interest followed by periods of relative quiet. But there has been a
sense of renewal in the past few months. Of course there has been
concern over the health of the Duke of Edinburgh, and interest in the Queen,
with her decades of service, never falters. But the attention of a new
group, both in Britain and around the world, has been caught by this birth and
then next month the wedding of Prince Harry and Ms Markle. From the darkest days of the
World War Two to the Instagram generation, the Royal Family now connects them
all. More than 93,000 people have ""liked"" Kensington Palace's tweet announcing the birth of the new prince. A further 32,000 have retweeted it as the #Royal baby has been trending on Twitter. Almost 3,000 have replied to the tweet with the majority offering congratulations Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The 29-year-old was on his brother Eamonn's stag weekend in the German city when he vanished on 10 February. His disappearance sparked major searches in the city and widespread appeals on social media. Formal identification of the body - which was found on Monday morning - has still to take place, but Hamburg Police said it was believed to be Liam. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which helps families of people missing abroad, thanked those involved in the search. Emergency services gathered near the scene of where Liam's body was found in the River Elbe The trust said the man found in the River Elbe had been wearing the same clothes as Liam, and had his driving licence in his pocket. The discovery may bring to end more thantwo months of searching for Liam. The trust has asked that Mr Colgan's family ""be given space and privacy to grieve at this difficult time"". The charity's chief executive, Matthew Searle, said: ""An astonishing amount of support has been apparent in this case - the search for Liam has been joined by thousands of people, both German and British, and we would like to thank all of them for their support. ""Our thoughts are of course with Liam's family and friends today."" Eamonn Colgan has previously spoken of Liam being a 'very proud and doting uncle' to his children His disappearance had sparked a major search effort in the German city. Thousands of leaflets were distributed in Hamburg during the attempts to trace Liam, a postman and keen musician. Dundee-based police officer Eamonn and his fiancÃ©e Susan Dolan postponed their wedding while searches took place. Liam's family had beenpreparing to widen their search to other German cities, working on a theory that he injured his head in a fall and was suffering from amnesia.

CCTV images of Liam at the time of his disappearance He also thanked those involved in the search for his brother. Eamonn said: ""It's incredible the help we've had from strangers.

Man fined over 'Nazi pug' hate crime,"This video can not be played Mark Meechan believed his sentence set a ""really, really dangerous precedent"" A man who filmed a pet dog giving Nazi salutes before putting the footage on YouTube has been fined Â£800. Mark Meechan, 30, recorded his girlfriend's pug, Buddha, responding to statements such as ""Sieg Heil"" by raising its paw. The clip was viewed more than three million times on YouTube. Meechan, of Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire,was sentenced at Airdrie Sheriff Court after being found guilty of committing a hate crime last month. He had denied any wrong-doing and insisted he made the video, which was posted in April 2016, to annoy his girlfriend. But Sheriff Derek O'Carroll found him guilty of a charge under the Communications Act that he posted a video on social media and YouTube which was grossly offensive because it was ""anti-Semitic and racist in nature"" and was aggravated by religious prejudice. Meechan with his girlfriend's pug, Buddha Fining Meechan Â£800, the sheriff told him: ""The centrepiece of your video consists of you repeating the phrase 'Gas the Jews' over and over again as a command to a dog which then reacts. ""You use the command Sieg Heil, having trained the dog to raise its paw in response and the video shows a clip of a Nuremberg rally and a flashing image of Hitler with strident music. You say the video was only intended as a joke to upset your girlfriend, whose dog you used, and nothing more. ""On the whole evidence..I found it proved that the video you posted, using a public communications network, was grossly offensive and contained menacing, anti-Semitic and racist material."" This video can not be played WATCH: 'Nazi pug' video-maker has no regrets He added: ""The fact that you claim in the video, and elsewhere, that the video was intended only to annoy your girlfriend and as a joke and that you did not intend to be racist is of little assistance to you. ""A joke can be grossly offensive. A racist joke or a grossly offensive video does not lose its racist or grossly offensive quality merely because the maker asserts he only wanted to get a laugh."" Meechan was supported in court by by Tommy Robinson, former leader of far-right group the English Defence League (EDL). Speaking after being fined, Meechan - who posts under the name Count Dankula - said he would be appealing the sentence. Meechan waved to supporters as he emerged from court Supporters staged a free speech protest outside court He defended the video, saying the whole point of the ""joke"" was ""the juxtaposition of having an adorable animal reacting to something vulgar"". Meechan said: ""This is a really dangerous precedent to set - for people to say things and their context to be completely ignored and then they can be convicted for it. ""You don't get to decide the context, other people don't get to decide the context, the court decides. That's dangerous."" Tommy Robinson, former leader of far-right group the English Defence League, supported Meechan in court There was a demonstration outside court by protesters claiming the case went against the principle of freedom of speech. Comedian Ricky Gervais had taken to Twitter to comment on the case after guilty the verdict. He tweeted: ""A man has been convicted in a UK court of making a joke that was deemed 'grossly offensive'. ""If you don't believe in a person's right to say things that you might find 'grossly offensive', then you don't believe in Freedom of Speech."" Even before Mark Meechan arrived for his sentence, dozens of free speech campaigners were outside the building, protesting his innocence. Also present was Tommy Robinson, ex-leader of the far-right English Defence League. Inside, courtroom number two was packed out as members of the public and journalists sat poised to hear Sheriff Derek O'Carroll impose sentence. Meechan's lawyer told the court his client was a man who enjoyed ""shock humour"" and questioned why he was in the dock, given the number of famous comedians who incorporate lines about the holocaust into their acts. Sheriff O'Carroll told Meechan he'd made a deliberate decision to post offensive material in a place where any member of the public could see it. At the same time, the sheriff said he was a first-offender with a low risk of committing further crime - and that he'd learned from his experience. Afterwards Meechan emerged from court defiant - insisting all he'd done was exercise his right to free speech. He left vowing to appeal.

What might the baby be called?,"The Duchess of Cambridge has given birth to her third child - her second son - and speculation continues about what the baby will be called. With Arthur, Albert and Philip among the current bookies' favourites for a boy, it appears the public expect the royal couple to opt for a traditional name, rather than something more left-field. But experts say there is a chance the ultimate name choice might also reflect the Middleton side of the family. For their first two children, the duke and duchess chose traditional options, seen as a tribute to previous members of the Royal Family. George Alexander Louis was a nod to six former kings, as well as Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India. Meanwhile, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana reflected William's mother and grandmother. The new baby will be fifth in line to the throne But might the royal couple be tempted to pick something more modern for their third child? The experts are doubtful. ""Tradition plays a huge part in the British Royal Family, even in the 21st Century,"" says Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine. ""It will probably be something we have heard attributed to a prince... before. It's quite likely to follow the traditional route that William and Kate seem to favour."" Duchess of Cambridge goes into labour Royal Family tree and line of succession Royal baby and extreme morning sickness ""Family links are tremendously important in this,"" adds royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams. ""You want a name that resonates, a name that's got family links and is popular. He said Albert was among the ""possibles"". ""There has been a renewal of interest in the Victorian era. After the success of Victoria on the small screen, there's more popular interest in these royals and it's a chance to pay tribute to one of the great royal romances."" However, while the decision may be guided by tradition, there is no strict protocol royal family members must adhere to. ""There are no hard and fast rules these days, it is much more relaxed,"" says Mr Little. Rules or not, Mr Fitzwilliams argues the Royal Family tends to think about three things when picking a name. ""When you choose a name for a royal baby there's the personal [preference]; there's the link with the royals past and present; but also you think about the public,"" he says. Mr Little adds: ""The Queen would obviously be consulted and, while she might not necessarily intervene and prevent a name from being used, she would certainly be aware of the name, long before any public announcement."" Bookmakers correctly predicted Prince George's name in 2013, but were wide of the mark two years later with the birth of Princess Charlotte. The name Alice was considered favourite in 2015. As Catherine went into labour, the median odds for the third baby's name, if it was a boy, were: Arthur - 6/1 Albert - 11/1 Philip - 11/1 Frederick - 13/1 James  - 13/1 While the Queen might not make the final decision, it was not that long ago that reigning monarchs were known to interfere. Queen Victoria vetoed her grandchildren's baby names if they did not suit her tastes, while the late Princess Margaret's parents wanted to call her Anne - before a complaint from King George V led to it being abandoned. There are no set rules, but some names, such as those belonging to current royal family members, are likely to be avoided. ""In the past there were several Princess Alices at once and that led to a bit of confusion,"" says Mr Little. So could we see a name more in line with more popular tastes? TheUK's top male baby names of 2018,externalare Liam, Noah, Logan and Oliver. But the experts say we are unlikely to see a Prince Logan in April. Mr Little says: ""Sometimes people go off on tangents - we see that both with this Royal Family and with overseas royal families."" Examples might include the Queen's first granddaughter Zara - a never-before-used royal name meaning star or flower in Arabic. Zara was an unusual royal name choice And the name Savannah was the choice of Princess Anne's son Peter Philips and his wife Autumn for their baby daughter born in 2010. But while William and Kate may well go for a traditional first name, the experts say there is a chance the couple could choose a name to represent the Middleton side of the family. ""I think they are more likely to stick with the traditional route, the royal side, but the Middletons could be reflected in the second or third name,"" Mr Little says. Will Catherine look to pay tribute to her mother or sister? Mr Fitzwilliams believes William and Kate are likely to pick a name that ""pays homage"" either to an ideal or a historical figure they admire. He says: ""I think Arthur for a boy. What's wonderful about Arthur is it conjures up a kingship that never existed - Camelot was an egalitarian paradise and of course there was the quest for the Holy Grail. ""It's one of the great royal legends - and that's my bet.""

King Charles III, the new monarch Camilla, the new Queen Consort Complete guide to King Charles III's Coronation Born: 1982 Prince William is the elder son of King Charles III and Diana, Princess of Wales, and is nowfirst in line to the throne. He was 15 when his mother died. He went on to study at the University of St Andrews, where he met his future wife, Kate Middleton. The couple were married in 2011. On his 21st birthday he was appointed a Counsellor of State - standing in for the late queen on official occasions. He and his wife had their first child, George, in July 2013, their second, Charlotte, in 2015 and third, Louis, in 2018. The prince trained with the Army, Royal Navy and RAF before spending three years as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot with RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales. He also worked part-time for two years as a co-pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance alongside his royal duties. He left the role in July 2017 to take on more royal duties on behalf of his grandparents. William inherited the Duchy of Cornwall estate from his father and is now the Prince of Wales. Catherine is now the Princess of Wales. As heir to the throne, his main duties are to support the King in his royal commitments. Born: 2013 George Alexander Louis was born on 22 July 2013 at St Mary's Hospital in London. His father was present for the birth of his son, who weighed 8lb 6oz (3.8kg).

He has been a Counsellor of State since his 21st birthday and stood in for the late queen on official duties. He married US actress Meghan Markle on 19 May 2018, at Windsor Castle. In January 2020, the royal couple said they would step back as ""senior"" royals and divide their time between the UK and North America. They said they intended to ""work to become financially independent"". Just over a year later, Buckingham Palace confirmed the couple would not be returning to royal duties, and would give up their honorary military appointments and royal patronages. Born: 2019 The Sussexes' first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on 6 May 2019, weighing 7lbs 3oz, with the duke present for his birth. Archie was not automatically a prince when he was born because he was not a grandson of the monarch. But he gained the right to that title when King Charles acceded to the throne. Harry and Meghan are understood to want their children to decide for themselves whether or not to use their titles when they are older. Born: 2021 The Duchess of Sussex gave birth to her second child in Santa Barbara, California, on 4 June 2021. Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor - to be known as Lili - is named after the Royal Family's nickname for the late queen. She was given the middle name Diana in honour of Prince Harry's mother, who died in a car crash in 1997 when he was 12 years old. Like her brother, she gained the right to use the royal title when her grandfather became king. Born: 1960 Prince Andrew,eighth in line to the throne,was the third child of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - but the first to be born to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They had two daughters - Beatrice, in 1988, and Eugenie, in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. In addition to royal engagements, he served as a special trade representative for the government until 2011. Prince Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after an interview with the BBC about his relationship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. In February 2022, the dukeagreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle a civil sexual assault case brought against himin the US by one of Epstein's victims, although he made no admission of liability and had repeatedly denied the allegations. Born: 1988 Princess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice. She married property tycoonEdoardo Mapelli Mozziat The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020. The couple had been due to marry in May, but coronavirus delayed the plans.

Complete guide to the King's coronation 360Â° video: Explore inside Westminster Abbey Born: 1990 Princess Eugenie is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie and she is11th in line to the throne. Like her sister Princess Beatrice, she has no official surname, but uses York. She married her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on 12 October 2018. Born: 2021 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's son, August, born on 9 February 2021. Born: 2023 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's second son was born on 30 May 2023. It is the first royal birth since the coronation of King Charles, Eugenie's uncle. Ernest is13th in line to the throne, moving the Duke of Edinburgh down to 14th place. Born: 1964 Prince Edward was given the title Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, almost two years after the death of his father Prince Philip, who previously held the title. It was understood that Philip had wanted Edward to take on the title, but the decision was left to King Charles. Prince Edward's wife Sophie becomes the Duchess of Edinburgh and the prince's former title, the Earl of Wessex, has now been given to his son James, Viscount Severn. The couple also have a daughter, Lady Louise, born in 2003. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company. He subsequently supported the late queen in her official duties and carried out public engagements for charities. He is14th in line to the throne. Born: 2007 James, Earl of Wessex is the younger child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023. When James was born, he was given the title Viscount Severn - a ""courtesy"" title as son of an earl, rather than using prince. It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter. Born: 1950 Anne, Princess Royal is Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's second child and only daughter. When she was born she was third in line to the throne, but is now17th. She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987. Princess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second is Vice-Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence. The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. Born: 1977 Peter Phillips is the eldest of the late queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles. Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Born: 2010 Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild. Born: 2012 Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly. Born: 1981 Zara Tindall followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple had their first child, Mia Grace, in 2014. The children of the Princess Royal do not hold a royal title, as they are descended from the female line, but she remains21st in line to the throne.Their father, Mark Phillips, turned down an earldom when he married Princess Anne, so they do not have courtesy titles. Born: 2014 Zara Tindall gave birth to her first child, Mia Grace, in January 2014. Born: 2018 The couple's second child was born on 18 June 2018 at Stroud Maternity Unit, Gloucestershire, weighing 9lb 3oz. Lena Elizabeth was named in honour of her great-grandmother. Like her sister, Lena does not have a royal title and so will also be known as Miss Tindall. Born: 2021 Zara and Mike Tindall's son Lucas Philip, their third child was born on 21 March 2021 weighing 8lbs 4oz. Read the latest from our royal correspondent Sean Coughlan -sign up here.

"'TSB gave me someone else's Â£35,000'Computer chaos for customers continues as one man gets access to someone else's accounts.7m8 minutes agoBusiness","Matthew Neal got a shock when he logged onto his TSB account A TSB customer was given access to someone else's Â£35,000 savings account, Â£11,000 Isa, and a business account when he logged onto his account last night. Matthew Neal had simply wanted to check how much he'd spent at the pub the night before. He's just one of potentially millions of TSB customers affected by a massive computer failure. The bank's upgrade to its banking systems has caused chaos for customers. The bank warned its users that it was carrying out upgrades at the weekend between 16:00 BST on Friday and 18:00 on Sunday. But a number of customers reported they were still facing problems on Monday morning, with many worried about being able to pay bills or even get cash to pay for essentials. TSB apologised and claimed it had fixed the issue. In a statement on Monday it said: ""We're really sorry that some of our customers experienced problems accessing our mobile app and internet banking yesterday evening. Both of these services are now up and running again."" Many customers took to Twitter to complain of being unable to access their accounts despite the bank's claim. The bank's social media staff simply repeated the line: ""Unfortunately, there are some intermittent problems affecting this service so please bear with us. We're working as hard as we can to resolve this."" Matthew Neal from Hertfordshire checked his TSB app after 6pm on Sunday evening to find out his balance and see how much he had spent at the pub the night before. But he got a shock. ""I could see all my accounts, but on top of that also three accounts belonging to someone else: a Â£35,000 savings account, an Â£11,000 Isa and a business account,"" he told the BBC. ""I could see their account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories and I had access to transfer money too, if I was that way inclined. ""The thing that was worrying me most was: what if someone can see mine too?"" He tried to ring the bank to alert it to the problem but after 45 minutes on hold, gave up. Since then he has been unable to access his accounts at all. A TSB spokesperson commented: ""We have noted some reports in the media regarding customers' access to account information last night. We can confirm the access issues, which lasted only about 20 minutes and impacted just a tiny fraction of our customer base, were fixed last night."" When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to rent a banking platform from its former owner while it developed its own ""state-of-the-art"" platform. That was ready to go live at the weekend and TSB moved its customers' data from the Lloyds' platform to its own. This was a long-planned disruption to the service and the bank said it informed customers of the change and that it would lead to them being unable to use online banking or payment systems at the weekend.

First, many customers said they were unaware of the changes and so were caught out. Second, customers experienced difficulties long after the 6pm deadline on Sunday evening that TSB promised that things would be sorted by. In fact many were still complaining of being unable to access services on Monday morning. Laim McKenzie, from Paisley, in Scotland, signed into his app shortly after 6pm on Sunday evening to discover the problem. The 20-year-old said: ""I saw the details of one other account holder, as well as my own. ""My balance, because of my overdraft, is in minus, but my balance was showing at Â£13,000. ""I closed the app and went in again at 19:00 and only my account was showing - but my balance was showing at zero. ""I've closed the app again and have not been able to access it since."" Many customers took to Twitter to complain about issues, including being unable to log into their internet banking accounts, being unable to transfer funds and not being able to make payments.

S Korea turns off North-facing loudspeakersSouth Korea says silencing the propaganda broadcasts will help set the mood for the inter-Korean summit.4h4 hours agoAsia,"South Korea's speakers were blasting pop music and propaganda over the border South Korea has stopped broadcasting propaganda via loudspeakers along the border with North Korea, ahead of top-level talks later this week. The South has dozens of loudspeakers along the border area, which blast everything from K-pop music to news reports critical of the North. The broadcasts can be heard by the North's troops stationed along the border and civilians in the area. Seoul said turning them off would help set the tone for Friday's talks. North Korea has its own system of speakers along the border, playing reports critical of Seoul and its allies. It is not yet known whether it will follow suit and silence them too. What do North and South Korea shout across the border? South Korea said the speakers, which play propaganda over the border at high volume, were turned off in the early hours of Monday morning. The broadcasts are designed to sow doubt among North Korean soldiers about the official message on the South The move aimed to ""ease the military tension between the two Koreas and develop a peaceful summit atmosphere,"" spokesman Choi Hoi-hyun told reporters. ""We hope this decision will lead both Koreas to stop mutual criticism and propaganda against each other and also contribute in creating peace and a new beginning."" North Korea announced at the weekend that it was suspending nuclear tests and closing an atomic test site.The surprise announcement came as the country prepares for historic talks with South Korea and the US. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has called it ""a significant decision towards total denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". Pyongyang's leader Kim Jong-un is due to meet Mr Moon next Friday at the truce village of Panmunjom, marking the first inter-Korean summit in over a decade. Mr Kim is also due to meet US President Donald Trump by June. It will be the first ever meeting between two sitting leaders of North Korea and the US. South Korea's propaganda broadcasts have been running on and off since the Korean War. The idea is to persuade North Korean soldiers to doubt what they are told by their leaders. Their use has been increased and decreased over the years, following the diplomatic mood on the peninsula. In 2004, the broadcasts were stopped as part of a deal negotiated between both countries. But in 2015, after two South Korean soldiers were severely injured by North Korean-planted mines in the demilitarised zone (DMZ), the South turned its speakers back on. The broadcasts were later halted again in 2015 but re-started in 2016 in response to the North testing a hydrogen bomb. South Korea did not say whether it planned to restart the broadcasts after the summits. Local residents say the Thaad system could itself become a target Also on Monday, South Korean police clashed with protesters near the site of a military base hosting a controversial US anti-missile system. The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) is designed to protect against missile attacks from North Korea. However, South Koreans in the central county of Seongju, where the system is located, believe it is a potential target for attacks and endangers the lives of those living nearby. About 200 residents blocked a road to the site, trying to prevent construction trucks from reaching the base, until they were removed by police on Monday. China also strongly opposes the anti-missile system, believing it interferes with the security of its own military operations. North Korea 'halts missile and nuclear tests' What are the Koreas shouting at each other?

Paris attack suspect jailed in BelgiumSalah Abdeslam receives a 20-year sentence over a gunfight that led to his arrest in 2016.8m9 minutes agoEurope,"Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving suspect from the 2015 Paris attacks, has been jailed for 20 years in Belgium over a gunfight that led to his arrest. Abdeslam, 28, and co-defendant Sofien Ayari were both convicted of terror-related charges of attempted murder. Ayari, 24, was also given a 20-year sentence. Both fired on officers who raided a flat in Brussels in 2016. Abdeslam is being held in a jail in France and is due to face trial there over the Paris attacks themselves. He had refused to answer questions from the judge in the trial in Brussels, and eventually refused to attend the hearings. Neither he nor Ayari, a 24-year-old Tunisian national, was in court as the verdict was read out on Monday. Both received the maximum 20-year term requested by prosecutors. The judge, Marie France Keutgen, said that ""there can be no doubt"" about the two men's involvement with ""radicalism"". She added: ""Their intention is clear from the nature of the weapons they used, the number of bullets they fired and the nature of the police officers' wounds. Only the officers' professional response prevented it being worse."" On 15 March 2016, Belgian police hunting Abdeslam carried out a raid in the Forest area of Brussels. They targeted a flat believing that the suspect - who by then had been on the run for four months - had been there. This video can not be played Damian Grammaticas reports from the scene of the raid When they moved in they exchanged fire with the three occupants. One of the three was killed and three officers were wounded. Abdeslam and Ayari managed to escape, but Abdeslam's fingerprints were found in the flat, confirming his presence there. Five things about Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam He was picked up days later in a raid in the nearby Molenbeek area, and later transferred to France. He is a French national who was born in Brussels to French-Moroccan parents. He was involved in petty crime in Belgium as a youth, and is believed to have become radicalised along with his brother Salim around 2014. Both then reportedly joined a French-Belgian network linked with the Islamic State group (IS), which later claimed the Paris attacks. The network was involved in both the Paris attacks and bombings that struck the Brussels metro and airport on 22 March 2016, just days after Abdeslam's arrest, killing 32 people. In Monday's ruling, the court denied a request by victims from those attacks that they be regarded as a civil party to the case, saying no link had been established with Abdeslam and Ayari. Is Molenbeek a hotbed of extremism? Who were the Paris attackers? Paris attacks: What happened on the night He is believed to have played a key role on 13 November 2015 - when militants targeted a concert hall, stadium, restaurants and bars, killing 130 people and injuring hundreds more. French prosecutors believe Abdeslam helped the jihadists by hiring cars, flats and hotel rooms - although his role in the actual shootings and bombings is unclear. His brother Salim was among the attackers and blew himself up outside a cafe. Salah Abdeslam and two associates drove from Paris to Brussels the next day. They were stopped by police at a border checkpoint, but were allowed to travel as Abdeslam had not yet been identified as a suspect.

Green prize goes to US water activistAn activist who helped expose a water crisis in a US town has been awarded a prestigious environment prize.,"Lead levels in Ms Walters' home were found to be seven times acceptable limits The founder of a citizens' movement that helped expose the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, is one of the recipients of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. Nearly 100,000 residents of Flint were left without safe tap water after lead began leaching into the supply. Mother of four LeeAnne Walters led a citizens' movement that tested the tap water to expose the health threat. Tests showed lead levels in her water were seven times the acceptable limit. In 2014, the water in Ms Walters' home turned brownish and she noticed rashes on her three-year-old twins. Her daughters' hair then fell out in clumps. Women who stopped SA nuclear deal win prize Walters spent months reading technical documents about the Flint water system. She then teamed up with environmental engineer Dr Marc Edwards, from Virginia Tech, who helped her conduct extensive water testing in the city. She methodically sampled each zip code in Flint and set up a system to ensure the integrity of the tests, working over 100 hours per week for three weeks. They showed lead levels as high as 13,200 parts per billion in some parts of the city - more than twice the level classified as hazardous waste by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The contamination was traced to the city switching its water supply away from Detroit's system, which draws from Lake Huron, and beginning instead to draw water from the Flint River. The city has now switched back to Detroit's water system Bottled water was distributed to help residents caught up in the crisis Flint was in a financial state of emergency and this switch was meant to save the city millions of dollars. But the water from the Flint River was more corrosive than Lake Huron's water and the pipes began leaching lead, which is a powerful neurotoxin. The city has since switched back to using Detroit's water system. But Flint continues towrestle with the aftermath of the crisis,external, and pipe replacement is ongoing. In their citation, the jurors praised Ms Walters' ""inquisitive, persistent, and logical mind"", adding: ""Her communal spirit and powerful moral compass proved equally critical to her ability to reach and organize Flint residents and experts alike."" Ms Walters is this year's recipient from North America, but the prize is also awarded to activists from several other global regions. They include France's Claire Nouvian who led a data-driven campaign against what she and many other activists regarded as the destructive practice of deep sea bottom trawling.

Elderly dog helps save girl lost in bush,"Max, a cattle dog, stayed with the girl for 16 hours Australian police have praised a dog for remaining with a three-year-old girl as she spent a night lost in bushland. The girl, Aurora, had been the subject of a large search after she wandered away from her home in Queensland. She was followed by her family's 17-year-old cattle dog, Max, who is partially deaf and blind. The dog stayed with the girl for 16 hours before relatives found them on a hillside on Saturday morning. Aurora's grandmother, Leisa Marie Bennett, said she had heard the girl call out from the location, about 2km (1.2 miles) from home. ""I shot up the mountain and when I came to the top, the dog came to me and led me straight to her,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Relatives said Aurora had taken shelter with the dog under a rock as temperatures dipped to 15C (59F). She suffered only minor cuts. Animal experts say older dogs particularly value human connection More than 100 emergency workers and volunteers had taken part in the search in Queensland's Southern Downs. Police praised Max's actions, and named him an honorary police dog. ""At three years old, I would imagine that the young child would be very scared and frightened through the night and very cold,"" Insp Craig Berry said. ""You can hope the dog was good company for the child and kept her warm. It's a positive outcome."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Man fined over 'Nazi pug' hate crimeMark Meechan put footage on YouTube of the dog reacting to statements such as ""Sieg Heil"" by raising its paw.7m7 minutes agoGlasgow & West Scotland","This video can not be played Mark Meechan believed his sentence set a ""really, really dangerous precedent"" A man who filmed a pet dog giving Nazi salutes before putting the footage on YouTube has been fined Â£800. Mark Meechan, 30, recorded his girlfriend's pug, Buddha, responding to statements such as ""Sieg Heil"" by raising its paw. The clip was viewed more than three million times on YouTube. Meechan, of Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire,was sentenced at Airdrie Sheriff Court after being found guilty of committing a hate crime last month. He had denied any wrong-doing and insisted he made the video, which was posted in April 2016, to annoy his girlfriend. But Sheriff Derek O'Carroll found him guilty of a charge under the Communications Act that he posted a video on social media and YouTube which was grossly offensive because it was ""anti-Semitic and racist in nature"" and was aggravated by religious prejudice. Meechan with his girlfriend's pug, Buddha Fining Meechan Â£800, the sheriff told him: ""The centrepiece of your video consists of you repeating the phrase 'Gas the Jews' over and over again as a command to a dog which then reacts. ""You use the command Sieg Heil, having trained the dog to raise its paw in response and the video shows a clip of a Nuremberg rally and a flashing image of Hitler with strident music. You say the video was only intended as a joke to upset your girlfriend, whose dog you used, and nothing more. ""On the whole evidence..I found it proved that the video you posted, using a public communications network, was grossly offensive and contained menacing, anti-Semitic and racist material."" This video can not be played WATCH: 'Nazi pug' video-maker has no regrets He added: ""The fact that you claim in the video, and elsewhere, that the video was intended only to annoy your girlfriend and as a joke and that you did not intend to be racist is of little assistance to you. ""A joke can be grossly offensive. A racist joke or a grossly offensive video does not lose its racist or grossly offensive quality merely because the maker asserts he only wanted to get a laugh."" Meechan was supported in court by by Tommy Robinson, former leader of far-right group the English Defence League (EDL). Speaking after being fined, Meechan - who posts under the name Count Dankula - said he would be appealing the sentence. Meechan waved to supporters as he emerged from court Supporters staged a free speech protest outside court He defended the video, saying the whole point of the ""joke"" was ""the juxtaposition of having an adorable animal reacting to something vulgar"". Meechan said: ""This is a really dangerous precedent to set - for people to say things and their context to be completely ignored and then they can be convicted for it. ""You don't get to decide the context, other people don't get to decide the context, the court decides. That's dangerous."" Tommy Robinson, former leader of far-right group the English Defence League, supported Meechan in court There was a demonstration outside court by protesters claiming the case went against the principle of freedom of speech. Comedian Ricky Gervais had taken to Twitter to comment on the case after guilty the verdict. He tweeted: ""A man has been convicted in a UK court of making a joke that was deemed 'grossly offensive'. ""If you don't believe in a person's right to say things that you might find 'grossly offensive', then you don't believe in Freedom of Speech."" Even before Mark Meechan arrived for his sentence, dozens of free speech campaigners were outside the building, protesting his innocence. Also present was Tommy Robinson, ex-leader of the far-right English Defence League. Inside, courtroom number two was packed out as members of the public and journalists sat poised to hear Sheriff Derek O'Carroll impose sentence. Meechan's lawyer told the court his client was a man who enjoyed ""shock humour"" and questioned why he was in the dock, given the number of famous comedians who incorporate lines about the holocaust into their acts. Sheriff O'Carroll told Meechan he'd made a deliberate decision to post offensive material in a place where any member of the public could see it. At the same time, the sheriff said he was a first-offender with a low risk of committing further crime - and that he'd learned from his experience. Afterwards Meechan emerged from court defiant - insisting all he'd done was exercise his right to free speech. He left vowing to appeal.

Canadian lynched in Peruvian AmazonPolice find the body of a Canadian man who was accused of murdering an indigenous spiritual leader.,"Sebastian Woodroffe went to Peru to learn from indigenous plant healers, a friend said Officials in Peru are investigating the lynching of a Canadian man in the remote Amazon region of Peru. Police found the body of Sebastian Woodroffe, 41, on Saturday buried near where an indigenous spiritual healer had been killed days previously. Investigators say locals suspected Mr Woodroffe of the murder of 81-year-old Olivia ArÃ©valo, who was shot dead on Thursday. Officials said they would not rest until both murders had been solved. Mr Woodroffe was a Canadian citizen from the town of Courtenay on the east coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Canadian broadcaster CBC quoted a friend of Mr Woodroffe as saying that the 41-year-old had travelled to Peru on a number of occasions to experiment with ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic drug. Yarrow Willard described Mr Woodroffe as a gentle person on a journey to find enlightenment and ""deeper meaning"".,external According to Canadian news portal Canoe.com, Mr Woodroffe went to the Ucayali region in Peru's rainforest hoping to do an apprenticeship with a plant healer from the Shipibo indigenous group. ""I feel responsible trying to support this culture and retain some of their treasure in me and my family, and share it with those that wish to learn,"" Mr Woodroffe wrote on afundraising site,external. His goal was to change careers to become an addiction counsellor using hallucinogenic medicine. A family member's struggle with alcoholism inspired Mr Woodroffe's decision to help ""fix the family spirit"", he said in a 2013YouTube video,external. Police launched a search for the Canadian after a video emerged on social media showing a man identified by Peruvian prosecutors as Mr Woodroffe lying in a puddle groaning while another man puts a rope around his neck and drags him along. A group of locals stands by and watches while the man with the rope around his neck appears to go limp. Mr Woodroffe's body was found in a shallow unmarked grave on Saturday. Peruvian officials say forensic tests carried out on his body show that he died by strangulation and that he had received several blows across his body. Local prosecutor Ricardo Palma Jimenez says officials are still investigating several theories as to why Mr Woodroffe was killed but local media say some villagers blamed him for the killing of Olivia ArÃ©valo. Mr Woodroffe had not been named as a suspect in Ms ArÃ©valo's murder but villagers suspected him because he was allegedly one of the spiritual healer's clients. ""A foreigner can come and kill us, day after day, like dogs or cats, and nothing happens, the state does nothing,"" one local woman told a Peruvian official on television, according tothe Washington Post,external. ""We want the communities of the Amazon to know that there is justice,"" Jimeneztold TV Peru,externalin Ucayali. ""But not justice by their own hands."" Olivia ArÃ©valo was a spiritual healer as well as a rights activist Ms ArÃ©valo was a member of the indigenous Shipibo-Conibo group, who was known as a spiritual healer and shaman in her local community. She was also a vocal advocate for the group's culture and rights. She was shot dead outside her home on Thursday. Her killing sparked outrage among the local community who have seen a number of indigenous leaders killed over recent years. Some members of Ms ArÃ©valo's community blamed Mr Woodroffe for her killing As a spiritual healer, Ms ArÃ©valo would have had extensive knowledge about ayahuasca, the hallucinogenic drug Mr Woodroffe went to the Amazon to study. The Shipibo have been using ayahuasca for centuries as part of their ""healing ceremonies"". Ayahuasca is considered one of the strongest psychedelic drugs in the world. Read more about ayahuasca: Why do people take ayahuasca? Could psychedelic drug ayahuasca have health benefits? Gap year student dies in Colombia after taking ayahuasca Also known as yage, it is a blend of two plants - the ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and a shrub called chacruna (Psychotria viridis), which contains the hallucinogenic drug dimethyltryptamine (DMT). DMT - and therefore ayahuasca - is illegal in the UK, the US and many other countries although some exceptions are made for members of particular churches which use the tea as part of their religious ceremonies. It has been used by shamans, or healers, in the Amazon for centuries for medical and spiritual purposes. It has become increasingly popular with backpackers who take part in ayahuasca ceremonies in the rainforest. A number of deaths has been attributed to the drug, including that of British gap-year student Henry Miller in Colombia in 2014 and that of New Zealander Matthew Dawson-Clarke last year. In at least one case, a Briton was stabbed to death during an ayahuasca ceremony when he allegedly attacked a Canadian who was also taking part in the ceremony. Read:Briton Unais Gomes killed in Peru 'during shamanic ceremony' Remote areas of the Amazon have a very thin police presence and crimes often go unpunished. Communities sometimes bypass the police altogether, choosing to punish those they suspect of committing crimes themselves. Local media report that villagers were outraged by the murder of Ms ArÃ©valo, who was an influential figure. It is not clear, however, why their anger focussed on the Canadian as other indigenous leaders have in the past been targeted by landowners. Could psychedelic drug ayahuasca have health benefits?

Duchess of Cambridge goes into labour,"The Duchess of Cambridge has gone into labour with her third child. Catherine and the Duke of Cambridge arrived at the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, in central London shortly before 6:00 BST on Monday. Catherine has been on maternity leave sincemaking a last royal visit to a charity lunchin London on 22 March. The baby, whose title will be HRH Prince or Princess of Cambridge, will be fifth in line to the throne and the Queen's sixth great-grandchild. The birth will be announced with an email to the press and a celebratory tweet posted on the Kensington Palace Twitter feed. There will also be the traditional custom of placing a framed paper proclamation on an ornate gold stand behind the iron railings of Buckingham Palace. As with her first two children, Kate is hoping for a natural birth and does not know whether she is having a boy or a girl. What might the royal baby be called? Royal baby and extreme morning sickness Severe sickness can be 'traumatic' Royal Family tree and line of succession Consultant obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston and consultant gynaecologist Alan Farthing are the two senior royal doctors overseeing the birth. Both were called in for the arrival of Prince George in 2013 and Princess Charlotte in 2015. Favourite names at the bookmakers include Mary, Alice, Alexandra, Elizabeth and Victoria for a girl and Arthur, Albert, Frederick, James and Philip for a boy. The world's media is already gathering outside the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital Some royal fans have been waiting outside the hospital since early April The duchess's pregnancy was announced in October. If, as expected, the child is born on Monday, St George's Day, they will share their birthday with Lady Gabriella Windsor - the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, who was born at the Lindo Wing on 23 April 1981. The baby has just missed arriving on the Queen's birthday, which was on Saturday. Sharon McEwan used to read about the royal family while growing up in Jamaica Already the streets outside St Mary's Hospital are awash with royal fans, curious tourists and journalists from around the world. Sharon McEwan from Kilburn, north-west London, has been coming to the hospital every day for more than a fortnight. ""I love the royals - I read about them growing up in Jamaica,"" she says. ""My wish was that I could one day come to England to see the Queen."" John Loughrey, 63 from Streatham, has been camping outside the hospital for 15 days. ""This is my temporary home,"" he says. ""The hospital have been so good to us. They brought us porridge for breakfast, let us use the showers and on the Queen's birthday we got champagne."" French au pairs Eleonor Ollieric and Constance Denis came to the hospital as soon as they could Eleonor Ollieric, 20 and Constance Denis, 21, are au pairs from France. ""We dropped the kids off at school and came straight here,"" says Ms Denis. ""We love the Royal Family in France. If it's a girl we think it'll be called Victoria and Albert if it's a boy."" As with her previous two pregnancies, Catherine, 36, has suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness. The condition affects about one in every 200 pregnancies and results in severe nausea and vomiting - with one of the main dangers being dehydration. To become King or Queen as the third-born royal child is rare - and has yet to happen within the current House of Windsor. But the third child of George III and Queen Charlotte, William IV, took on the task and ruled from 1830 to 1837. The Hanoverian king acceded to the throne aged 64 when his older brother, George IV, died without an heir. He became next in line when he was 62 and his other older brother, Frederick, Duke of York, died. What might the new prince be called? Quiz: Which royal baby is which? The royal baby in numbers!

Ministers suffer Lords defeat,"Lord Patten was among two dozen Conservative peers to defy the party whip Peers have defeated the government on the issue of staying in a UK-EU customs union after Brexit. Lords voted by 348 to 225 in favour of a plan requiring ministers to report on steps to negotiate a continued union. Backing it, ex-EU Commissioner Lord Patten said the UK would be worse off unless current arrangements continued. But Brexit minister Lord Callanan said it required the government to report on the steps taken towards an objective it has ""clearly ruled out"". Number 10 argues that remaining in the customs union would prevent the UK from signing third-party trade agreements with countries across the world. Lord Callanan signalled the government's intention to overturn the measures at a later stage, saying before the vote it had no intention to ""reflect further"" on the matter. The defeat is the first of several expected as the House of Lords - in which the government does not have a majority - debates the government's flagship EU Withdrawal Bill in detail. The bill will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK while ensuring existing laws passed since the UK's entry in 1973 continue to apply. A total of 24 Conservatives voted against the government on the customs union amendment, including former ministers Lord Heseltine, Lord Lansley and Lord Willetts. Serving notice that he would be a serial rebel during the bill's passage, the former EU commissioner said: ""There are times in one's political career where what is alleged to be party loyalty comes way behind trying to stand up for the national interest."" Campaigners demand 'people's' Brexit vote Barnier: UK can change mind on single market Brexit bill fundamentally flawed, say peers Brexit: All you need to know However, former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson said Lord Patten was putting forward a ""political argument dressed up as a trade argument"" and it amounted to a ""wrecking amendment"". Remaining in a customs union while leaving the EU would leave the UK in a ""quasi-colonial"" status, he said. ""I can see there are political reason for remaining in the EU, but I think the political reasons for leaving are much stronger. But what it is absolute nonsense to suggest is that there is an economic case for what is being proposed."" The former chancellor said the financial arguments were ""economic nonsense"" Lord Forsyth went further, suggesting it was a plot by ""Remainers in this House, who are the majority, who refuse to accept the verdict of the British people - and I believe they are playing with fire"". ""I say to colleagues in this House, 'Have a care to what we are doing.' We are an unelected house, and this amendment [is] part of a campaign which is putting peers against the people."" Tory MP and Remain supporter Anna Soubry tweeted that the Lords had ""put their country first"", and called on her colleagues in the Commons to back them when the amendment returns.

But a statement from the Department for Exiting the EU said the fundamental purpose of the bill was to prepare the UK's statute book for exit day, not about the terms of departure. ""This amendment does not commit the UK to remaining in a customs union with the EU, it requires us to make a statement in Parliament explaining the steps we've taken,"" a spokesman said. ""Our policy on this subject is very clear. We are leaving the customs union and will establish a new and ambitious customs arrangement with the EU while forging new trade relationships with our partners around the world."" Analysis:By BBC political correspondent Ben Wright Peers turned out in force on Wednesday to wrestle with a question the government insists is settled - whether or not the UK should form a customs union with the EU after Brexit. It is one of the government's negotiating red lines that Britain must not remain in any sort of customs union. However, Labour believes the creation of a new union would keep goods flowing freely without tariffs and provide a workable solution to the Irish border issue. Many Tory peers strongly criticised Wednesday's amendment as an attempt by Remain supporters in the Lords to wreck the Bill and tie the hands of negotiators. But a number of Conservatives, combined with opposition parties, inflicted a heavy defeat on the government and the issue will now have to return to the House of Commons. What will be crucial then is how many Tory MPs align with Labour to try and force a change to the government's policy. The government also lost a vote against a second amendment aimed at ensuring that existing protections from EU law cannot be changed - except by primary legislation - which would require any changes to go through both the Commons and the Lords. Lord Callanan said the government had already taken steps to address concerns around employment, equality, and health and safety laws, ""potentially in ways that are even stronger than the amendment"". But Labour's Lady Hayter, who proposed the change, said there were ""parts of the government that appear a bit more deregulation obsessed"". After the debate, peers voted by 314 to 217 in favour of the amendment. Other potential flashpoints in the bill include amendments relating to Northern Ireland and a plan to scrap the government's decision to fix Brexit for 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.

MPs to force customs union vote,"Peers defeated the government on Wednesday A powerful cross-party group of MPs is to force a vote on a customs union next week in the House of Commons. The Liaison Committee, made up of Labour, Conservative and SNP committee chairmen, has tabled a debate calling for ""an effective customs union"". Theresa May has pledged to leave the current customs union after Brexit. Downing Street believes that trying to replicate it when the UK leaves the EU would stop the country from being able to sign its own trade deals. Laura Kuenssberg: Vote to add to pressure Ministers suffer first Lords Brexit defeat Brexit: All you need to know The news about the Commons vote comes the day after the House of Lords inflicted a defeat on the government over the customs union issue. The government had hoped to avoid a vote on the issue in the Commons until next month. But the MPs, including Yvette Cooper, Nicky Morgan, Sarah Wollaston, and Hilary Benn, have secured a debate that will force the issue. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that although a vote would not be binding on the government, it will ratchet up the pressure on No 10 to shift its position if the Commons agrees. Conservative backbencher Anna Soubry said that it would ""not be a meaningful vote at all"" but the debate would be important. She said the ""crunch question"" was whether the government would have sufficient MPs prepared to overturn the Lords amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, when it returned to the Commons. She told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the Lords vote had asked the government only to ""explore"" a customs union. ""There is an increasing number of Conservative MPs... who are worried and now understand the benefits of us having a customs arrangement, not just for the benefit of manufacturers in particular in our country... but also for peace in Northern Ireland. ""I do hope the government will look at the numbers - but look at the strength of the argument - do the right thing and that is not to seek to whip Conservative members of Parliament to take out this eminently sensible and hugely reasonable amendment that the Lords passed last night."" Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the Lords defeat on Wednesday should prompt the prime minister to change her approach. He said: ""There's a growing view, I think probably a majority view in Parliament now, that it's in our national interests and economic interests to stay in a customs union with the EU. ""We've got a huge manufacturing sector in the UK that needs to be protected, with many goods going over borders many, many times, and we need to protect that."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government might face a battle in the Commons to overturn the Lords vote. He said: ""It is the case that there are lots of potential future votes - given the arithmetic in the House of Commons, given the fact that we don't have a majority - which are always going to rely on the persuasive powers of ministers to get colleagues to support the Government."" The Liaison Committee members calling for the motion also include the SNP's Angus McNeil, Lib Dem Norman Lamb, Labour MP Meg Hillier, Conservative Bob Neil, Labour's Rachel Reeves and the SNP's Pete Wishart.

'Vote will add to pressure',"Yvette Cooper is among the MPs tabling a debate on the customs union The House of Lords voting to reject the government's existing plan for how customs will work after we leave the EU was as surprising as the sun rising in the morning and setting at night. Why it mattered was the political encouragement and cover it gives to Conservative rebels who are considering defying Theresa May on the issue in the Commons next month. The extent of the Lords defeat last night gave succour to MPs from different parties who are working closely together to try to change the government's current position of avoiding any form of customs union once we are completely out of the EU. Ministers had hoped to avoid the nightmare of holding a vote on the issue in the Commons until next month, giving more time to get likely rebels on board, more time to persuade and cajole. Senior MPs to force customs union vote Ministers suffer first Lords Brexit defeat The fact is, as the government knows full well, if there was a one-off vote on the issue with no other strings attached, most MPs would probably choose to stay in some form of customs union. Despite strong feelings in Number 10 and among Brexiteers that such a policy is unacceptable, the Parliamentary arithmetic on the green benches is against them. But no more will ministers be able to run from the issue. It's just emerged that a powerful cross-party group of MPs is to force a vote on a customs union next week. The Liaison Committee, made up of Labour, Conservative, Lib Dem and SNP select committee chairs, has tabled a debate for next week calling for ""an effective Customs Union"". The MPs, including Yvette Cooper, Nicky Morgan, Sarah Wollaston, and Hilary Benn, are voices who carry credibility with them. The vote would not be binding on ministers, but will ratchet up the pressure on Number 10 to shift its position if, as seems likely, the numbers go against the government. And, remember, there are ministers in government, even though they are probably a minority, who also believe that in the end, staying in some form of customs union is the way to go.

S Korea turns off North-facing loudspeakers,"South Korea's speakers were blasting pop music and propaganda over the border South Korea has stopped broadcasting propaganda via loudspeakers along the border with North Korea, ahead of top-level talks later this week. The South has dozens of loudspeakers along the border area, which blast everything from K-pop music to news reports critical of the North. The broadcasts can be heard by the North's troops stationed along the border and civilians in the area. Seoul said turning them off would help set the tone for Friday's talks. North Korea has its own system of speakers along the border, playing reports critical of Seoul and its allies. It is not yet known whether it will follow suit and silence them too. What do North and South Korea shout across the border? South Korea said the speakers, which play propaganda over the border at high volume, were turned off in the early hours of Monday morning. The broadcasts are designed to sow doubt among North Korean soldiers about the official message on the South The move aimed to ""ease the military tension between the two Koreas and develop a peaceful summit atmosphere,"" spokesman Choi Hoi-hyun told reporters. ""We hope this decision will lead both Koreas to stop mutual criticism and propaganda against each other and also contribute in creating peace and a new beginning."" North Korea announced at the weekend that it was suspending nuclear tests and closing an atomic test site.The surprise announcement came as the country prepares for historic talks with South Korea and the US. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has called it ""a significant decision towards total denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". Pyongyang's leader Kim Jong-un is due to meet Mr Moon next Friday at the truce village of Panmunjom, marking the first inter-Korean summit in over a decade. Mr Kim is also due to meet US President Donald Trump by June. It will be the first ever meeting between two sitting leaders of North Korea and the US. South Korea's propaganda broadcasts have been running on and off since the Korean War. The idea is to persuade North Korean soldiers to doubt what they are told by their leaders. Their use has been increased and decreased over the years, following the diplomatic mood on the peninsula. In 2004, the broadcasts were stopped as part of a deal negotiated between both countries. But in 2015, after two South Korean soldiers were severely injured by North Korean-planted mines in the demilitarised zone (DMZ), the South turned its speakers back on. The broadcasts were later halted again in 2015 but re-started in 2016 in response to the North testing a hydrogen bomb. South Korea did not say whether it planned to restart the broadcasts after the summits. Local residents say the Thaad system could itself become a target Also on Monday, South Korean police clashed with protesters near the site of a military base hosting a controversial US anti-missile system. The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) is designed to protect against missile attacks from North Korea. However, South Koreans in the central county of Seongju, where the system is located, believe it is a potential target for attacks and endangers the lives of those living nearby. About 200 residents blocked a road to the site, trying to prevent construction trucks from reaching the base, until they were removed by police on Monday. China also strongly opposes the anti-missile system, believing it interferes with the security of its own military operations.

TSB customers report online problems,"Matthew Neal got a shock when he logged onto his TSB account A TSB customer was given access to someone else's Â£35,000 savings account, Â£11,000 Isa, and a business account when he logged onto his account last night. Matthew Neal had simply wanted to check how much he'd spent at the pub the night before. He's just one of potentially millions of TSB customers affected by a massive computer failure. The bank's upgrade to its banking systems has caused chaos for customers. The bank warned its users that it was carrying out upgrades at the weekend between 16:00 BST on Friday and 18:00 on Sunday. But a number of customers reported they were still facing problems on Monday morning, with many worried about being able to pay bills or even get cash to pay for essentials. TSB apologised and claimed it had fixed the issue. In a statement on Monday it said: ""We're really sorry that some of our customers experienced problems accessing our mobile app and internet banking yesterday evening. Both of these services are now up and running again."" Many customers took to Twitter to complain of being unable to access their accounts despite the bank's claim. The bank's social media staff simply repeated the line: ""Unfortunately, there are some intermittent problems affecting this service so please bear with us. We're working as hard as we can to resolve this."" Matthew Neal from Hertfordshire checked his TSB app after 6pm on Sunday evening to find out his balance and see how much he had spent at the pub the night before. But he got a shock. ""I could see all my accounts, but on top of that also three accounts belonging to someone else: a Â£35,000 savings account, an Â£11,000 Isa and a business account,"" he told the BBC. ""I could see their account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories and I had access to transfer money too, if I was that way inclined. ""The thing that was worrying me most was: what if someone can see mine too?"" He tried to ring the bank to alert it to the problem but after 45 minutes on hold, gave up. Since then he has been unable to access his accounts at all. A TSB spokesperson commented: ""We have noted some reports in the media regarding customers' access to account information last night. We can confirm the access issues, which lasted only about 20 minutes and impacted just a tiny fraction of our customer base, were fixed last night."" When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to rent a banking platform from its former owner while it developed its own ""state-of-the-art"" platform. That was ready to go live at the weekend and TSB moved its customers' data from the Lloyds' platform to its own. This was a long-planned disruption to the service and the bank said it informed customers of the change and that it would lead to them being unable to use online banking or payment systems at the weekend.

First, many customers said they were unaware of the changes and so were caught out. Second, customers experienced difficulties long after the 6pm deadline on Sunday evening that TSB promised that things would be sorted by. In fact many were still complaining of being unable to access services on Monday morning. Laim McKenzie, from Paisley, in Scotland, signed into his app shortly after 6pm on Sunday evening to discover the problem. The 20-year-old said: ""I saw the details of one other account holder, as well as my own. ""My balance, because of my overdraft, is in minus, but my balance was showing at Â£13,000. ""I closed the app and went in again at 19:00 and only my account was showing - but my balance was showing at zero. ""I've closed the app again and have not been able to access it since."" Many customers took to Twitter to complain about issues, including being unable to log into their internet banking accounts, being unable to transfer funds and not being able to make payments.

Liam Colgan's body 'found in river',"The body of missing Inverness man Liam Colgan is believed to have been found in the River Elbe in Hamburg. The 29-year-old was on his brother Eamonn's stag weekend in the German city when he vanished on 10 February. His disappearance sparked major searches in the city and widespread appeals on social media. Formal identification of the body - which was found on Monday morning - has still to take place, but Hamburg Police said it was believed to be Liam. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which helps families of people missing abroad, thanked those involved in the search. Emergency services gathered near the scene of where Liam's body was found in the River Elbe The trust said the man found in the River Elbe had been wearing the same clothes as Liam, and had his driving licence in his pocket. The discovery may bring to end more thantwo months of searching for Liam. The trust has asked that Mr Colgan's family ""be given space and privacy to grieve at this difficult time"". The charity's chief executive, Matthew Searle, said: ""An astonishing amount of support has been apparent in this case - the search for Liam has been joined by thousands of people, both German and British, and we would like to thank all of them for their support. ""Our thoughts are of course with Liam's family and friends today."" Eamonn Colgan has previously spoken of Liam being a 'very proud and doting uncle' to his children His disappearance had sparked a major search effort in the German city. Thousands of leaflets were distributed in Hamburg during the attempts to trace Liam, a postman and keen musician. Dundee-based police officer Eamonn and his fiancÃ©e Susan Dolan postponed their wedding while searches took place. Liam's family had beenpreparing to widen their search to other German cities, working on a theory that he injured his head in a fall and was suffering from amnesia. In an interview with BBC Radio Scotland last month, Eamonn described his brother as a ""very laid back, very positive, a very proud and doting uncle to my two children"". CCTV images of Liam at the time of his disappearance He also thanked those involved in the search for his brother. Eamonn said: ""It's incredible the help we've had from strangers. If they can be hopeful, then I can be that way as well. ""We've been told the efforts by ourselves and others in trying to find Liam in Hamburg is unprecedented. That makes me feel confident that we are doing everything we can to find him."" Eamonn added that the family were finding ""constant reminders"" of his brother.

Â£6m pledge for children of alcoholics,"This video can not be played Jon Ashworth MP in 2017: 'Dad would pick me up from school drunk' The government has announced Â£6m of funding to help children with alcoholic parents get support and advice. Plans include fast access to mental health services for children - and programmes to treat parents' addiction. An estimated 200,000 children in England live with alcohol-dependent parents. The NSPCC says there has been a 30% increase in calls to its helpline over the welfare of a child due to a parent misusing alcohol in the past year. When mum or dad is an alcoholic Remembering my alcoholic mum The funding is coming jointly from the Department of Health and Social Care and the Department for Work and Pensions. Local councils will be able to bid for a share of Â£4.5m, based on their need for services. The money will help to speed up the identification of children who are at risk, give support to reduce the numbers going into care, and provide programmes helping parents through their treatment. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""The consequences of alcohol abuse are devastating for those in the grip of an addiction, but for too long, the children of alcoholic parents have been the silent victims. This is not right, nor fair. ""These measures will ensure thousands of children affected by their parent's alcohol dependency have access to the support they need and deserve."" This video can not be played Six women share their stories of being the child of an alcoholic with Woman's Hour Mr Hunt paid tribute to shadow health secretary Mr Ashworth, who has spoken out about his own experiences of growing up with an alcoholic father. ""Some things matter much more than politics, and I have been moved by my Labour counterpart Jon Ashworth's bravery in speaking out so honestly about life as the child of an alcoholic,"" he said. ""I pay tribute to him and MPs with similar experiences across the House who have campaigned so tenaciously to turn their personal heartache into a lifeline for children in similar circumstances today."" The 'secrecy and shame' of having alcoholic parents MSP didn't invite alcoholic father to wedding Mr Ashworth welcomed the announcement, saying it was a ""real breakthrough"". He told BBC Breakfast he felt alone and embarrassed growing up with an alcoholic father and said the government's plans ""would have made a tremendous difference to my childhood"". Mr Hunt has appointed public health minister Steve Brine to have ministerial responsibility for children with alcohol-dependent parents. The move has won praise from Labour MP Liam Byrne, who also lost his father to alcoholism, and chairs the all party group on children of alcoholics. He said: ""This is a huge step forward for Britain's innocent victims of booze; the kids of parents who drink too much and end up scarred for life.""

Britons killed in Saudi Arabia coach crash,"This video can not be played Gulfaraz Zaman, director of Hashim Travel, called the incident 'disturbing' Four British people have died and 12 others have been hurt in a coach crash in Saudi Arabia, a travel firm says. Raj Begum Hussain, 70, from Blackburn, died alongside an elderly man and a mother and her grown-up son, all from Preston, in Lancashire. The coach was travelling from Mecca on an Umrah pilgrimage, when it was hit by a fuel tanker which caught fire and set the bus alight, the firm said. Trip organisers Hashim Travel said the incident on Saturday was ""horrendous"". Eighteen people were aboard the coach when it crashed. All were taken to hospital, where six remain. Mrs Hussain - a mother of six and a grandmother of 13 - was travelling with her younger sister who survived but was injured. ""She will be sorely missed by all family and friends.  We would like to thank the whole community for their condolences and support at this difficult time,"" her family said in a statement. It is understood that a young child was also among the injured. The group were travelling as part of an Umrah pilgrimage and had been in Saudi Arabia for a week. The crash happened near the start of the group's five-hour road trip from Mecca to Medina, near the town of Al Khalas. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Umrah pilgrimage is on a smaller scale than the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Blackburn-based Hashim Travel says it specialises in Umrah and Hajj and has been providing travel packages to people in north-west England for 20 years. The company's director, Gulfaraz Zaman, called the incident ""horrendous"" and ""very distressing"". ""If you see the remains of the bus, there's just the metal frame of it that's left,"" he told the BBC. ""It's very upsetting - especially the people that have passed away,"" he added, ""our thoughts are with the families."" He said visas had been arranged for family members of the deceased who were now travelling out to Saudi Arabia. The Council of British Hajjis said it was providing support to a British family which had been affected. Rashid Mogradia, chief executive of Council of British Hajjis, told the BBC the route between Mecca and Medina was a long but ""relatively safe journey"". A lot has been done by the Saudi authorities to improve the safety of pilgrims, he told the BBC. Passengers on the bus were from Accrington, Preston, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Northampton and Blackburn. Abdul Hamid Qureshi, chairman of Lancashire Council of Mosques said: ""This is a very sad incident. Our prayers and thoughts are with the deceased and their families."" Conservative MP for Wyre and Preston North Ben Wallace tweeted his condolences and Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi, who is chair of the recently formed All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hajj and Umrah, said: ""I am really saddened to hear of the death of pilgrims."" ""We are supporting the British families of those who have died and those injured following a serious road traffic accident near the town of Al Khalas, Saudi Arabia,"" a Foreign Office spokesperson said. The British nationals were travelling to the holy city of Medina on an Umrah pilgrimage The Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca that takes place in the month of Dhul Hijjah, which is the 12th month of the Islamic lunar calendar. The Umrah is an extra, optional pilgrimage and does not count as the once-in-a-lifetime Hajj. Although it includes some of the rituals of the Hajj, they are shortened and there are fewer of them. Unlike Hajj, it is not obligatory and can take place at any time of the year.

Tough French immigration bill approved,"The vote opened fractures in President Emmanuel Macron's governing centrist party The French National Assembly has passed a tough new immigration law that tightens the rules around asylum. The bill shortens asylum application deadlines, doubles the time for which illegal migrants can be detained, and introduces a one-year prison sentence for entering France illegally. President Emmanuel Macron's governing centrist party says the bill will speed up the process of claiming asylum. But opposition figures and human rights groups say the measures go too far. The bill passed by 228 votes to 139, with 24 abstentions, after more than 60 hours of debate over the weekend and hundreds of amendments. Migrants at the frozen French border UK and France sign new Calais treaty France will not allow another 'Jungle' One member of Mr Macron's La RÃ©publique en Marche (LREM) party, Jean-Michel ClÃ©ment, voted against the legislation and 14 members abstained. ""I am not sure we're sending to world citizens the universal message that has always been ours,"" Mr ClÃ©ment, a former Socialist, said in a statement after the vote. He later announced he was leaving the parliamentary group. The main aim of the law is to cut the length of asylum applications and make the deportation system more efficient for those rejected. Refugees given asylum will be given greater help with integration and learning French. One of the most significant changes is that failed asylum seekers awaiting deportation can be held for up to 90 days, double the existing period of 45 days. The government had initially aimed for a 135-day period. Opponents complained in parliament that migrants were being treated like criminals. Children can also be kept in detention with their families, although officials agreed to set up a working group to look into the issue. In 2017, 275 minors were being held in administrative detention centres. Far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon condemned the practice as ""barbaric"". The deadlines for filing asylum applications or appealing against a rejection have also raised concerns. Claimants will have 90 days to file an application, down from 120 days, and two weeks to appeal against rejection. Human Rights Watch says shortening asylum application deadlines could negatively impact the ""most vulnerable asylum seekers, who would be the ones most likely to miss the deadline"". ""Under the guise of providing a more effective asylum system, the bill includes a series of measures that would diminish access to protection,""  the group's France director BÃ©nÃ©dicte Jeannerod said in a statement. Left-wing parties were deeply opposed to the changes and the right-wing Republicans joined them. The far-right National Front backed some of the measures. The bill will now be debated in the upper house, the Senate, in June. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Bloomberg donates $4.5m for climate deal,"Michael Bloomberg says he hopes the US will rejoin the climate agreement Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he will pay $4.5m (Â£3.2m) to cover some of the lapsed US commitment to the Paris climate accord. He said he had a responsibility to help improve the environment because of President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the deal. The withdrawal was announced last June and sparked international condemnation. It will make the US in effect the only country not to be part of the Paris accord. The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris climate deal explained Will US cities tackle climate change? What is climate change? As part of the agreement, the US had pledged $3bn to the Green Climate Fund, set up by the UN to help countries deal with the effects of global warming. The money promised by Mr Bloomberg does not aim to cover this, but the US contribution to the UN's climate change secretariat. ""America made a commitment and, as an American, if the government's not going to do it then we all have a responsibility,""Mr Bloomberg said on CBS,external. ""I'm able to do it. So, yes, I'm going to send them a cheque for the monies that America had promised to the organisation as though they got it from the federal government."" His charity, Bloomberg Philanthropies, offered $15m to cover a separate climate change shortfall last year. It said the money would go to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In January,President Trump said the US could ""conceivably"" returnto the deal if it treated America more fairly. ""It's an agreement that I have no problem with but I had a problem with the agreement that they (the Obama administration) signed,"" he told reporters. Mr Bloomberg said he hoped that by next year Mr Trump will have reconsidered his position on the deal. ""He's been known to change his mind, that is true,"" he said. ""America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster."" The deal unites all the world's nations in a single agreement on tackling climate change for the first time in history. Coming to a consensus among nearly 200 countries on the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions is regarded by many observers as an achievement in itself and has been hailed as ""historic"". As well as the limit on global temperatures, it includes a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity and a requirement for rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"".

Capita reveals big loss and funding plans,"Capita has reported a Â£513m annual loss as the outsourcing firm set out plans to revive its indebted business. The company was hit by Â£850m of one-off costs, mainly from writing down the value of acquisitions made under its previous management. However, underlying pre-tax profits, which exclude restructuring costs and one-off items, rose by 23% to Â£401m. The company said it would raise Â£701m through a rights issue to fund a reorganisation of the business. Capita's shares closed 13% higher at 180.8p in London, valuing Capita at just over Â£1.2bn. It operates the London congestion charge and runs an electronic tagging service for the Ministry of Justice, The loss compares with a Â£89.8m deficit in 2016, while revenues last year fell by 4% to Â£4.2bn However, new chief executive Jonathan Lewis dismissed any comparison to Carillion, the services and outsourcing group that went bust earlier this year. ""I get frustrated with that comparison - we are a completely different business,"" Mr Lewis said. ""We have Â£1bn in liquidity, strong cash flow and a new strategy with investor support. We are not in PFI contracts and have nothing like the risk profile."" Mr Lewis has announced a major overhaul of the company which has debt totalling Â£1.7bn. The rights issue will reduce borrowings as well as fund investment. Under its new strategy, Capita plans to raise about Â£300m disposals this year and is targeting cost savings of Â£175m by the end of 2020. Capita's share pricejumped by 12.7% to 180.1p in early trade. The company collects the licence fee on behalf of the BBC and recently won a five-year extension to provide audience services to the broadcaster. Commenting on Capita's future, Mr Lewis said the business was ""fundamentally strong"" but ""needs to evolve"". He added: ""We need to simplify Capita by focusing on growth markets and to improve our cost competitiveness. We need to strengthen Capita and plan to invest up to Â£500m in our infrastructure, technology and people over the next three years.""

Breaking|Breaking newsDuchess of Cambridge in early stages of labourDuchess of Cambridge has been admitted to hospital in the early stages of labour with her third child3m3 minutes agoUK,"The Duchess of Cambridge has gone into labour with her third child. Catherine and the Duke of Cambridge arrived at the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, in central London shortly before 6:00 BST on Monday. Catherine has been on maternity leave sincemaking a last royal visit to a charity lunchin London on 22 March. The baby, whose title will be HRH Prince or Princess of Cambridge, will be fifth in line to the throne and the Queen's sixth great-grandchild. The birth will be announced with an email to the press and a celebratory tweet posted on the Kensington Palace Twitter feed. There will also be the traditional custom of placing a framed paper proclamation on an ornate gold stand behind the iron railings of Buckingham Palace. As with her first two children, Kate is hoping for a natural birth and does not know whether she is having a boy or a girl. What might the royal baby be called? Royal baby and extreme morning sickness Severe sickness can be 'traumatic' Royal Family tree and line of succession Consultant obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston and consultant gynaecologist Alan Farthing are the two senior royal doctors overseeing the birth. Both were called in for the arrival of Prince George in 2013 and Princess Charlotte in 2015. Favourite names at the bookmakers include Mary, Alice, Alexandra, Elizabeth and Victoria for a girl and Arthur, Albert, Frederick, James and Philip for a boy. The world's media is already gathering outside the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital Some royal fans have been waiting outside the hospital since early April The duchess's pregnancy was announced in October. If, as expected, the child is born on Monday, St George's Day, they will share their birthday with Lady Gabriella Windsor - the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, who was born at the Lindo Wing on 23 April 1981. The baby has just missed arriving on the Queen's birthday, which was on Saturday. Sharon McEwan used to read about the royal family while growing up in Jamaica Already the streets outside St Mary's Hospital are awash with royal fans, curious tourists and journalists from around the world. Sharon McEwan from Kilburn, north-west London, has been coming to the hospital every day for more than a fortnight. ""I love the royals - I read about them growing up in Jamaica,"" she says. ""My wish was that I could one day come to England to see the Queen."" John Loughrey, 63 from Streatham, has been camping outside the hospital for 15 days. ""This is my temporary home,"" he says. ""The hospital have been so good to us. They brought us porridge for breakfast, let us use the showers and on the Queen's birthday we got champagne."" French au pairs Eleonor Ollieric and Constance Denis came to the hospital as soon as they could Eleonor Ollieric, 20 and Constance Denis, 21, are au pairs from France. ""We dropped the kids off at school and came straight here,"" says Ms Denis. ""We love the Royal Family in France. If it's a girl we think it'll be called Victoria and Albert if it's a boy."" As with her previous two pregnancies, Catherine, 36, has suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness. The condition affects about one in every 200 pregnancies and results in severe nausea and vomiting - with one of the main dangers being dehydration. To become King or Queen as the third-born royal child is rare - and has yet to happen within the current House of Windsor. But the third child of George III and Queen Charlotte, William IV, took on the task and ruled from 1830 to 1837. The Hanoverian king acceded to the throne aged 64 when his older brother, George IV, died without an heir. He became next in line when he was 62 and his other older brother, Frederick, Duke of York, died. What might the new prince be called? Quiz: Which royal baby is which? The royal baby in numbers!

Man mauled by bear survives shark attackA 20-year-old outdoorsman bitten by a shark had previously survived a bear attack and snake bite.,"They say bad luck comes in threes, and for Dylan McWilliams, a 20-year-old from Colorado, that has unfortunately proved true. The young outdoorsman has survived his third bloody brush with the animal kingdom - a shark attack while body boarding off the coast of Hawaii. ""It's kind of crazy,"" Dylan told the BBC from the island of Kauai. ""I don't seem to have a lot of luck but it's kind of lucky in unlucky situations."" He was enjoying the Pacific waves on Thursday morning when he felt something hit his leg. He explained: ""I saw the shark underneath me. I started kicking at it - I know I hit it at least once - and swam to shore as quickly as I could."" Worried about the trail of blood he was leaving, he told local media after the attack: ""I didn't know if I lost half my leg or what."" Warning: This story contains some graphic images The shark, believed to be a tiger shark between 6 and 8ft (about 2m), left distinctive teeth marks in Dylan's leg that needed seven stitches. ""My mum was worried,"" Dylan said of his call to his parents soon after paramedics saw to his injury. ""I don't know if they want me doing all this stuff,"" he admits, but he believes they support him. The outdoors enthusiast from Grand Junction in western Colorado, has been backpacking across the US and Canada for the past few years, funding his travels with odd jobs working as a ranch hand and even as a survival training instructor. How to survive a shark attack Zoo attacks and the people who survive them What are the world's deadliest animals? His grandfather was the first person to teach him survival techniques at the age of three or four, and a love for the outdoors was born. ""I've been teaching kids and people, whoever wants, how to survive in the wilderness and live off the land like the explorers did,"" said the Crocodile Hunter fan from his camping spot on a Hawaiian beach. He was putting those survival skills to use on a camping trip in Colorado last July, when at 4am, while sleeping outdoors, he was woken up to find his head being clamped in the jaws of a bear. Dylan McWilliams was mauled by a bear in 2017 (left) and bitten by a shark last week (right) ""This black bear grabbed me by the back of the head, and I was fighting back, poking it in the eye until it let me go,"" Dylan describes vividly. His friends awoke to the commotion, but after the 300 pound (136kg) male bear stomped on Dylan, it walked away. Park authorities caught it the next morning, and after tests confirmed Dylan's blood was under the bear's claws, the outdoorsman said the animal was put down. Nine staples to the back of his head have left scars and a pain when he touches them, but the experience hasn't put off the young man from his love of the outdoors. ""I've always loved animals and spent as much time with them as I could,"" the backpacker said from Kauai island, which has recently been plagued with floods. He attributes these dangerous incidents to just being in the wrong place at the wrong time, adding: ""I don't blame the shark, I don't blame the bear, and I don't blame the rattlesnake.""

And this brings us to Dylan's arguably least deadly run-in three years ago - a rattlesnake attack during a hiking trip in Utah. ""I was walking down a trail and I thought I kicked a cactus but couldn't see one, and then saw a rattlesnake all coiled up."" The then 17-year-old made the call not to go to the hospital because he figured he had only suffered a dry bite. ""There was a little venom so I did get a bit sick for a couple of days,"" the aspiring police officer said. ""We have to respect [animals'] boundaries but I don't think I was invading or provoking any of the attacks - they just happened."" Dylan McWilliams is now impatient for his wounds to heal so he can get back on to the surf. Despite his run of bad luck, he encourages everyone to experience the outdoors. ""I still go hiking, I still catch rattle snakes, and I will still swim in the ocean."" When asked if he thinks he will have another brush with dangerous wildlife, he said: ""I hope not, but I spend most of my time outside with animals... so I guess anything could happen.""

Nicaragua president scraps pensions law,"The protests have turned increasingly violent during the past five days The state department has ordered relatives of US government employees based in Nicaragua to leave the Central American country. Services at the US embassy in the capital in Managua will be curtailed. The order comes after days of deadly rioting triggered by planned changes to Nicaragua's social security system. Even though Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega had scrapped the changes, the situation remains tense and more protests are expected. The state department also said it would authorise US government personnel to leave Nicaragua but that those decisions would have to be taken on a case-by-by-case basis. In a statement it warned that ""political rallies and demonstrations are occurring daily, often with little notice or predictability"". ""Some protests result in injuries and deaths,"" it says, adding that buying food and fuel could become a challenge and access to the airport in Managua could be blocked. A human rights group says at least 27 people have been killed in total as a result of the unrest, more than double the official death toll of 10. The unrest first started on Wednesday when hundreds of people, mainly pensioners, took to the streets of the capital, Managua, to protest against changes to the country's social security system. This video can not be played The protest against pension changes have escalated in recent days The protesters and some of the journalists covering the demonstration were set upon by men wearing motorcycle helmets who beat them with metal pipes and electric cables. Some local media said those beating up the protesters were part of pro-government gangs and were wearing T-shirts with pro-government slogans. On Thursday, students and employers joined the protesting pensioners in several cities, boosting the numbers of demonstrators to thousands rather than hundreds. There were also further stand-offs between the protesters and pro-government groups. Protesters took out their anger on some of the ""Trees of Life"" sculptures designed by the First Lady Students took over the National University of Engineering and confronted riot police, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets. The protests spread from Managua to a dozen other cities across the country. On Friday, the army was deployed to guard government buildings and the protests turned deadly with several people, including two protesters and a policeman, killed. Profile: Daniel Ortega President chooses wife as running mate Nicaragua reporter killed on Facebook Live The security forces were accused of using excessive force to contain the protests, which had started peacefully. But First Lady Rosario Murillo, who is also the country's vice-president, defended the response, saying it constituted a ""legitimate defence against a tiny group"" of troublemakers. Over the weekend, protests escalated further with a reporter shot dead during a live broadcast in the town of Bluefields on the Caribbean coast. Stores were looted in Managua Some shop owners armed themselves to protect their shuttered businesses Some took advantage of the chaos to loot shops, while shopkeepers armed themselves and stood guard around their businesses. The changes were aimed at boosting Nicaragua's troubled social security system, which has been running on a deficit. Pensioners would have had to pay 5% of their pensions into a fund for medical expenses. Employees would have had to contribute a larger chunk of their salary towards social security - 7% instead of the current 6.25%. And employers, too, would have had to pay more money into the social security pot. The changes were due to come into force on 1 July. The protests were triggered by the proposed changes but the harsh response to what started as peaceful demonstrations brought many more people onto the streets. There was also outrage over the fact that journalists were among those killed. A number of TV stations also complained of censorship after they were taken off the cable network. Protesters are demanding freedom of speech be restored Miguel Mora, the director of 100% Noticias, one of the stations to be taken off air, wrote on Facebook: ""They are threatening us!"" The protests also appear to have grown into a bigger anti-government movement, with protesters expressing their anger at the president's increasingly authoritarian style. For those whose main concern was the increase in social security payments, its scrapping will be seen as a victory and it may satisfy them. But the anti-government protests, the largest in decades, have emboldened many Nicaraguans to speak out more freely against President Daniel Ortega and his influential wife and vice-president. There has been discontent with the president, who is on his third consecutive term in office, for years in some parts of society. The 2014 scrapping of presidential term limits has been seen as a threat to democracy and some of those who have been demonstrating have accused Mr Ortega and his wife of having ""dictatorial tendencies"". The business community has said it will not sit down for talks with the government until police violence stops and freedom of speech is restored. Protesting students have demanded that those arrested during the demonstrations be freed.

Canadian lynched in Peruvian Amazon,"Sebastian Woodroffe went to Peru to learn from indigenous plant healers, a friend said Officials in Peru are investigating the lynching of a Canadian man in the remote Amazon region of Peru. Police found the body of Sebastian Woodroffe, 41, on Saturday buried near where an indigenous spiritual healer had been killed days previously. Investigators say locals suspected Mr Woodroffe of the murder of 81-year-old Olivia ArÃ©valo, who was shot dead on Thursday. Officials said they would not rest until both murders had been solved. Mr Woodroffe was a Canadian citizen from the town of Courtenay on the east coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Canadian broadcaster CBC quoted a friend of Mr Woodroffe as saying that the 41-year-old had travelled to Peru on a number of occasions to experiment with ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic drug. Yarrow Willard described Mr Woodroffe as a gentle person on a journey to find enlightenment and ""deeper meaning"".,external According to Canadian news portal Canoe.com, Mr Woodroffe went to the Ucayali region in Peru's rainforest hoping to do an apprenticeship with a plant healer from the Shipibo indigenous group. ""I feel responsible trying to support this culture and retain some of their treasure in me and my family, and share it with those that wish to learn,"" Mr Woodroffe wrote on afundraising site,external. His goal was to change careers to become an addiction counsellor using hallucinogenic medicine. A family member's struggle with alcoholism inspired Mr Woodroffe's decision to help ""fix the family spirit"", he said in a 2013YouTube video,external. Police launched a search for the Canadian after a video emerged on social media showing a man identified by Peruvian prosecutors as Mr Woodroffe lying in a puddle groaning while another man puts a rope around his neck and drags him along. A group of locals stands by and watches while the man with the rope around his neck appears to go limp. Mr Woodroffe's body was found in a shallow unmarked grave on Saturday. Peruvian officials say forensic tests carried out on his body show that he died by strangulation and that he had received several blows across his body. Local prosecutor Ricardo Palma Jimenez says officials are still investigating several theories as to why Mr Woodroffe was killed but local media say some villagers blamed him for the killing of Olivia ArÃ©valo. Mr Woodroffe had not been named as a suspect in Ms ArÃ©valo's murder but villagers suspected him because he was allegedly one of the spiritual healer's clients. ""A foreigner can come and kill us, day after day, like dogs or cats, and nothing happens, the state does nothing,"" one local woman told a Peruvian official on television, according tothe Washington Post,external. ""We want the communities of the Amazon to know that there is justice,"" Jimeneztold TV Peru,externalin Ucayali. ""But not justice by their own hands."" Olivia ArÃ©valo was a spiritual healer as well as a rights activist Ms ArÃ©valo was a member of the indigenous Shipibo-Conibo group, who was known as a spiritual healer and shaman in her local community. She was also a vocal advocate for the group's culture and rights. She was shot dead outside her home on Thursday. Her killing sparked outrage among the local community who have seen a number of indigenous leaders killed over recent years. Some members of Ms ArÃ©valo's community blamed Mr Woodroffe for her killing As a spiritual healer, Ms ArÃ©valo would have had extensive knowledge about ayahuasca, the hallucinogenic drug Mr Woodroffe went to the Amazon to study. The Shipibo have been using ayahuasca for centuries as part of their ""healing ceremonies"". Ayahuasca is considered one of the strongest psychedelic drugs in the world. Read more about ayahuasca: Why do people take ayahuasca? Could psychedelic drug ayahuasca have health benefits? Gap year student dies in Colombia after taking ayahuasca Also known as yage, it is a blend of two plants - the ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and a shrub called chacruna (Psychotria viridis), which contains the hallucinogenic drug dimethyltryptamine (DMT). DMT - and therefore ayahuasca - is illegal in the UK, the US and many other countries although some exceptions are made for members of particular churches which use the tea as part of their religious ceremonies. It has been used by shamans, or healers, in the Amazon for centuries for medical and spiritual purposes. It has become increasingly popular with backpackers who take part in ayahuasca ceremonies in the rainforest. A number of deaths has been attributed to the drug, including that of British gap-year student Henry Miller in Colombia in 2014 and that of New Zealander Matthew Dawson-Clarke last year. In at least one case, a Briton was stabbed to death during an ayahuasca ceremony when he allegedly attacked a Canadian who was also taking part in the ceremony. Read:Briton Unais Gomes killed in Peru 'during shamanic ceremony' Remote areas of the Amazon have a very thin police presence and crimes often go unpunished. Communities sometimes bypass the police altogether, choosing to punish those they suspect of committing crimes themselves. Local media report that villagers were outraged by the murder of Ms ArÃ©valo, who was an influential figure. It is not clear, however, why their anger focussed on the Canadian as other indigenous leaders have in the past been targeted by landowners. Could psychedelic drug ayahuasca have health benefits?

Senior MPs to force customs union vote,"Peers defeated the government on Wednesday A powerful cross-party group of MPs is to force a vote on a customs union next week in the House of Commons. The Liaison Committee, made up of Labour, Conservative and SNP committee chairmen, has tabled a debate calling for ""an effective customs union"". Theresa May has pledged to leave the current customs union after Brexit. Downing Street believes that trying to replicate it when the UK leaves the EU would stop the country from being able to sign its own trade deals. Laura Kuenssberg: Vote to add to pressure Ministers suffer first Lords Brexit defeat Brexit: All you need to know The news about the Commons vote comes the day after the House of Lords inflicted a defeat on the government over the customs union issue. The government had hoped to avoid a vote on the issue in the Commons until next month. But the MPs, including Yvette Cooper, Nicky Morgan, Sarah Wollaston, and Hilary Benn, have secured a debate that will force the issue. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that although a vote would not be binding on the government, it will ratchet up the pressure on No 10 to shift its position if the Commons agrees. Conservative backbencher Anna Soubry said that it would ""not be a meaningful vote at all"" but the debate would be important. She said the ""crunch question"" was whether the government would have sufficient MPs prepared to overturn the Lords amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, when it returned to the Commons. She told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the Lords vote had asked the government only to ""explore"" a customs union. ""There is an increasing number of Conservative MPs... who are worried and now understand the benefits of us having a customs arrangement, not just for the benefit of manufacturers in particular in our country... but also for peace in Northern Ireland. ""I do hope the government will look at the numbers - but look at the strength of the argument - do the right thing and that is not to seek to whip Conservative members of Parliament to take out this eminently sensible and hugely reasonable amendment that the Lords passed last night."" Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the Lords defeat on Wednesday should prompt the prime minister to change her approach. He said: ""There's a growing view, I think probably a majority view in Parliament now, that it's in our national interests and economic interests to stay in a customs union with the EU. ""We've got a huge manufacturing sector in the UK that needs to be protected, with many goods going over borders many, many times, and we need to protect that."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government might face a battle in the Commons to overturn the Lords vote. He said: ""It is the case that there are lots of potential future votes - given the arithmetic in the House of Commons, given the fact that we don't have a majority - which are always going to rely on the persuasive powers of ministers to get colleagues to support the Government."" The Liaison Committee members calling for the motion also include the SNP's Angus McNeil, Lib Dem Norman Lamb, Labour MP Meg Hillier, Conservative Bob Neil, Labour's Rachel Reeves and the SNP's Pete Wishart.

Customs union vote to add to pressure,"Yvette Cooper is among the MPs tabling a debate on the customs union The House of Lords voting to reject the government's existing plan for how customs will work after we leave the EU was as surprising as the sun rising in the morning and setting at night. Why it mattered was the political encouragement and cover it gives to Conservative rebels who are considering defying Theresa May on the issue in the Commons next month. The extent of the Lords defeat last night gave succour to MPs from different parties who are working closely together to try to change the government's current position of avoiding any form of customs union once we are completely out of the EU. Ministers had hoped to avoid the nightmare of holding a vote on the issue in the Commons until next month, giving more time to get likely rebels on board, more time to persuade and cajole. Senior MPs to force customs union vote Ministers suffer first Lords Brexit defeat The fact is, as the government knows full well, if there was a one-off vote on the issue with no other strings attached, most MPs would probably choose to stay in some form of customs union. Despite strong feelings in Number 10 and among Brexiteers that such a policy is unacceptable, the Parliamentary arithmetic on the green benches is against them. But no more will ministers be able to run from the issue. It's just emerged that a powerful cross-party group of MPs is to force a vote on a customs union next week. The Liaison Committee, made up of Labour, Conservative, Lib Dem and SNP select committee chairs, has tabled a debate for next week calling for ""an effective Customs Union"". The MPs, including Yvette Cooper, Nicky Morgan, Sarah Wollaston, and Hilary Benn, are voices who carry credibility with them. The vote would not be binding on ministers, but will ratchet up the pressure on Number 10 to shift its position if, as seems likely, the numbers go against the government. And, remember, there are ministers in government, even though they are probably a minority, who also believe that in the end, staying in some form of customs union is the way to go.

"Corbyn: PM 'ignored Windrush warnings'The Labour leader says Theresa May is responsible for the effects of a ""hostile"" migration policy.8h8 hours agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Windrush scandal: Facing the threat of deportation Jeremy Corbyn has called for an end to the government's so-called ""hostile environment"" immigration policy, saying it has ""ripped apart"" people's lives. The Labour leader said the Windrush generation and their families had been treated as ""second-class citizens"". The opposition has repeated its call for Home Secretary Amber Rudd to quit. Justice Secretary David Gauke said there had been major ""implementation failures"" but the core policy of trying to deter illegal migration was right. Theresa May has apologised on several occasions for the distress caused to the relatives of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK between 1948 and 1971 - some of whom have been threatened with deportation, have lost their jobs or been refused access to medical treatment arising from changes to immigration rules since 2014. Leaders clash over Windrush landing cards PM: Compensation for Windrush generation She has promised compensation to those whose right to live in the UK was questioned and who suffered hardship because they did not have proof of residency or their documentation was rejected by immigration officials. The BBC's political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said the Home Office is expected to set out more details about compensation this week. If that doesn't come quickly enough or if there isn't significant progress in helping people affected, she added, then the pressure on the home secretary and prime minister will increase. Speaking at the Welsh Labour conference in Llandudno, Mr Corbyn said Mrs May was personally responsible as she had set ""a deliberately unreachable bar"" in her previous role as home secretary by forcing migrants to provide proof of residence to access services such as housing and healthcare. ""This week something rotten at the heart of government has come to the surface,"" he said. This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? ""We have seen one government minister after another, including the prime minister, try and dodge and weave around the facts to avoid scrutiny and entirely justified criticism. ""It is not that they weren't warned. At the time the Tories were pushing their hostile immigration policy through Parliament, some of us warned of the consequences this could have for many people and families. ""People's lives ripped apart because of the personal decisions and actions of Theresa May and her government."" He called for a stop to ""disgraceful"" and ""discriminatory"" policies which have resulted in people being ""shut out of public life"". In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr show - presented this week by Nick Robinson - shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry conceded the phrase ""hostile environment"" in relation to illegal immigration had first been used under the last Labour government. But she insisted it had been cranked up by the Conservatives to a point where ""people have died, people have lost their jobs, lost their futures"". Her colleague Dawn Butler went further, telling Sky News she thought the PM had ""presided over racist legislation that has discriminated against a whole generation of people from the Commonwealth"". However, Labour MP Owen Smith told ITV's Peston on Sunday his party should have done more to oppose a tightening of the rules in the 2014 Immigration Act which had had ""terrible unintended consequences"" for people. This video can not be played Poet Benjamin Zephaniah wants the government to act ""immediately"" over Windrush The party - then led by Ed Miliband - abstained in crucial votes, although Mr Corbyn and a handful of allies now on Labour's frontbench, such as John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, voted against it. Defending the government, Mr Gauke said British citizens whose right to live in the UK had been questioned and who had suffered huge anxiety should get financial redress. Although there had been ""very significant failures in terms of how it was implemented"", he said the government would not be backing down on its core policy of bearing down on illegal immigration and, ""in these circumstances"", it would not be right for ministers to quit. ""Where there are failures of policy, then we are held accountable for that,"" he told the Andrew Marr show. ""When it comes down to it, the central policy is right,"" he added. ""When it comes to those who are illegal, those who should not be here, if we want a sustainable immigration system that has public support, it's right that we address this."" But Conservative former Communities Secretary Baroness Warsi said ministers should ""think long and hard about the trauma"" caused to families by their immigration policies - calling again on the government to drop its ""unrealistic"" target of reducing annual net migration to below 100,000 a year.

Nicaragua reporter killed on Facebook LiveÃngel Gahona is gunned down on Facebook Live while reporting on a wave of anti-government protests.,"Riot police and students in Managua have faced off across barricades A journalist in Nicaragua has been shot dead while doing a live broadcast about anti-government protests. Ãngel Gahona was reporting on damage at a bank in the Caribbean coast town of Bluefields when a bullet hit him during his Facebook Live newscast. Video footage shows him falling to the ground and bleeding. More than 10 people have died in days of protests against pension changes approved by the government of President Daniel Ortega on Wednesday. The move increased pension contributions for workers and employers and reduced overall benefits by 5%. This video can not be played The protest against pension changes have escalated in recent days Mr Ortega has offered talks but protest leaders have refused, saying police violence must stop first. Government buildings have been damaged or set on fire, and troops have been deployed in several cities. Students from Polytechnic University in Managua have barricaded their campus. At least 100 people have been injured. Pope Francis has called for an end to the violence and for differences to ""be resolved peacefully and with a sense of responsibility."" One human rights group reported that the death toll was more than 25. Who is Daniel Ortega? Nicaragua's first lady In Friday's incident in Bluefields, the footage shows Mr Gahona describing a damaged cash machine before a shot rings out. He is then seen slumping to the ground, as people scream his name and try to help. It is unclear who shot him or why. Mr Ortega won the 2016 election along with his wife, Rosario Murillo, who became Nicaragua's vice-president The protests are the biggest challenge to Mr Ortega's authority since he took office in 2007. He has said the new measures will not go into effect until 1 July, which gives the government and the private sector time to negotiate. The government seemed to have the situation under control on Saturday, with deployment of army troops across the country. Protesters blamed riot police and government supporters for the violence. The human rights group Amnesty International said the authorities had been carrying out a ""terrifying clampdown on dissent"".

Encouraging tolerance in a divided town,"This video can not be played Casey and Waj have forged a rare and deep friendship that cuts across Rotherham's ethnic divides The virtue of tolerance is regarded as fundamental to the British character. We are taught that our respect for the values, ideas and beliefs of others is somehow written into our national DNA. Indeed, the government has passed a law requiring teachers and other public servants to promote just this idea as a way to deal with the threat from terrorism. Ask the British if they think they really are a tolerant people, as an Ipsos Mori poll for the BBC'sCrossing Dividesseason did, and a majority (53%) agree. That may not sound emphatic, but the equivalent figure for France, Italy and Spain is around a third. In Hungary it is just 16%. Among the countries that have the strongest sense of national tolerance, though, are Canada (74%), China (65%) and India (63%). If tolerance is an essential part of the British temperament, then other nationalities feel it even more strongly these days. Scratch away at what is happening and our survey finds half of people fear Britain is less tolerant than a decade ago, close to double the proportion that think we have become more so. About the Crossing Divides season Three-quarters of those surveyed thought British society was also becoming more divided, with half saying that tensions were greatest between immigrants and those born in the UK. The poll also identified significant concern about ethnic tensions. Of the countries polled, only South Africa emerged with greater anxiety about race relations than Britain. Official encouragement of tolerance is not enough to counter the sense of unease. More than 25% of people in Britain think the country is ""very divided"", according to the poll. Unsurprisingly but unhappily, the proportion that thinks the country is not divided at all is zero. The Yorkshire town is deeply troubled by its divisions. The numerous bridges over the River Don disguise the racial tensions scored across the borough, divides that have deepened substantially since the discovery that gangs of men of predominantly Pakistani origin hadsexually abused hundreds of young girls,externalin the town over decades. Rotherham child sex abuse: Inquiry finds 100 more potential victims High levels of hate crime have subsequently been identified; Muslims are reporting attacks, mostly assaults, once every three weeks. Rotherham's schools appear to be becoming increasingly divided on ethnic lines. Some neighbourhoods are almost exclusively white, while in others the majority of households trace their family heritage to Pakistan. With the far-right regularly marching through the town and attempting to stir up racial conflict, one shudders to remember the race riots that swept through northern English towns back in 2001.  A government-commissioned inquiry into the disturbances blamed segregated communities living ""parallel lives"". The report's author, Ted Cantle, warned of further violence unless the polarisation could be broken and cross-cultural contact encouraged. His recommendations are being dusted off in Rotherham. Schemes such as the National Citizen Service have brought young people together ""It is not just about people living separate lives,"" says Shokat Lal, Rotherham Council's assistant chief executive. ""Some of those tensions have been deliberately created by people outside the borough coming in."" ""We have had to deal with that, and the whole purpose of theBuilding Stronger Communities,externalwork that we do is to create some really simple mechanisms for people to come and meet each other."" The council has made improving community relations a key part of its plan for Rotherham. A number of schemes have been introduced, including Let's Drink Tea Together which employed an age-old Yorkshire remedy for calming strife. ""We have a responsibility for being an enabler, a facilitator to bring people together,"" Mr Lal explains, ""not in an engineered way, not in an enforced way, but creating the space where people can quite simply just talk to each other."" It sounds trivial but the evidence is that - if people from different backgrounds meet and mix - tensions can be reduced. And vital new friendships forged. ""Where I am from it's mainly white British,"" 17-year-old Casey Holmes from Rotherham's Maltby district tells me. ""I tend to stick with people who are like myself, so I never had any interaction with people from different backgrounds."" Across town in the Eastwood area I met Waj Malik, also 17. ""I wouldn't be comfortable going around in a predominately white area because I would be scared, especially with things in the news, that there would be some sort of hate there,"" she says. The stories of the two girls are typical of the ""parallel lives"" phenomenon identified by the Cantle Report, published when they were still in nappies. But Casey and Waj have now forged a rare and deep friendship that cuts across Rotherham's ethnic divides. They met while completing their National Citizen Service (NCS), the government scheme for 16- and 17-year-olds designed to strengthen social cohesion. ""It was the first day when we had team-building games and Casey was on my side. We were helping each other and we thought we make a really good team,"" Waj recalls. ""Where I come from there are not many people from different ethnic minorities, so with Waj it is something new and something I have not experienced it before, so our friendship is special,"" Casey agrees. A welcoming sign: Will Rotherham be able to heal its divisions? Without NCS, it is unlikely the two girls would ever have spoken to each other, even though they are the same age and live in the same town. Having found each other, the two girls think there are lessons for wider society. ""NCS brings young people together, but I think there needs to be something that brings older and younger people together from different communities and backgrounds as it is just so important,"" Casey says. ""It's been such a learning curve for me so it needs to done in other places in my opinion."" ""We are bonding over our differences,"" Waj believes. ""People think difference tears things apart but it doesn't.  Sometimes it just brings people closer together and that's a bit powerful."" Their story suggests it takes more than legislation to foster tolerance. The state cannot force people to become friends. But what can be done is to create environments in which relationships can grow and blossom, an aim that seems urgent in a country so pessimistic about its divisions.

Africans fight HK prejudice with football,"Smile! The footballers of All Black FC - which has expanded to welcome Chinese Hongkongers and other ethnic minorities In Hong Kong, locals rarely play football with immigrants. Not surprising, perhaps, when a third of Chinese Hongkongers don't want to sit next to members of other ethnic groups on public transport, live next door to them, or have their children as classmates to their own children,according to a survey by the NGO Hong Kong Unison.,external Is the beautiful game really powerful enough to overcome that kind of prejudice? Since 2016, a ""refugee"" football team - All Black FC - has been testing the theory as its players try to integrate, and build a better image for Africans in Hong Kong. The team's founder Medard Privat Koya is a former professional footballer from the Central African Republic. While his first players were almost all African asylum seekers, the squad has expanded to welcome Chinese locals and other ethnic minorities. ""Football can bring all of us together,"" he reckons. ""We can bring ideas, share experience and support each other."" It's also a constructive use of time - which is valuable because asylum seekers aren't allowed to work in Hong Kong, even if they have lived in the city for years. Many of the team are unable to work legally in Hong Kong Darius, an asylum seeker from Togo, arrived in Hong Kong five years ago. He's the team captain, and says football gives him a sense of purpose as they are not allowed to work. ""It is really hard. It makes people feel they are dying slowly because you spend five or seven years of your youth life waiting. You really start wondering what's are you going to become in the future? ""After all that time with no work, or training, what kind of job are you going to do? Who would hire you?"" says Darius. When he became part of this team, it gave him hope. ""There is a group of people that I belong to,"" he says. ""We fight for something together. People will respect us based on our skills."" What is Hong Kong like? The night time 'McRefugees' of Hong Kong WATCH: Football unity in divided Cyprus And for the team's most talented players, the distraction can lead to something bigger. An exceptional few are chosen to represent local football clubs, and can then apply for visas to work legally in Hong Kong. Captain Darius (centre) and founder Medard (right) want the team to be a source of support for players Medard is encouraged to see locals and other non-Africans joining All Black FC. It shows that their values are respected, he says. That's an unusual feeling for some of the team. Darius says it's difficult for immigrants to rent a flat in the city as many landlords look down on foreigners. Solomon Nyassi, a 26-year-old Gambian, tells BBC Chinese that on his first day in Hong Kong, he saw some people using their hands to cover their noses when they passed by him. Sometimes, he says, he walks down the street, and Chinese tourists surround him and ask for pictures, which makes him feel ""embarrassed"". Solomon met his girlfriend, 20-year-old Hong Kong woman Louise Chan at an All Black FC match. She believes African men are more ""mature"" and ""self-motivated"", and her family support the pair's relationship. But some people's reactions have shocked her. ""Hong Kong people are so closed-minded,"" says Louise, who owns a clothes shop. ""Some keep sending articles to me to tell the bad rumours about African people. I feel very disappointed."" Footballer Solomon and his girlfriend Louise have faced prejudice from some quarters Prejudice can show its face on the pitch, too. Darius says some Hong Kong locals think Africans play football ""violently"". Some have shouted foul language at the team. ""We always tell our players to keep disciplined,"" the captain says. ""No matter what has happened, we just need to keep it calm. We can't let them label us."" Doug Tze, a 34-year-old Hong Kong man, has been part of All Black FC since July 2017. He says he didn't feel totally welcome at first, and blames the African players' previous poor treatment at the hands of Hongkongers. But when he showed some effort and commitment, Doug says they became good friends who now hang out together. ""I don't see race; I just see good players,"" he says. All Black FC in action against Biu Chun Rangers, who play in the Hong Kong Premier League Kevin Fung, a college football player who recently played All Black FC in a tournament, believes the African players could motivate Hong Kong natives. ""They are passionate, focused and work hard. But Hong Kong players give up easily,"" Kevin says. ""Hong Kong people focus on other work and study. They only spare their little leisure time for football."" For that reason, he doubts football can really achieve racial harmony in Hong Kong. ""After all, local football is not a popular activity,"" he notes. ""In Hong Kong, there are only a few competitions. Official games are not broadcast widely. No-one really cares (about local football). Solving racial problems through football is doomed to be difficult."" All Black FC understand that too. So to further their goal of achieving social change, the players sometimes do voluntary work like visiting old peoples' homes to connect with the wider community. ""It changes the locals' mindset,"" says Darius. ""Maybe we are not benefitted directly today. But it may make a path for the next generation so that ethnic minorities, asylum seekers and refugees will be seen differently in future.""

The benefits of having friends who aren't 'just like us',"Having a strong network of friends has many advantages, from offering support when we are down, to a group we can share our thoughts with. But could we be missing out if we only mix with people ""just like us""? For most of us, the people we see on a regular basis - our social network - are a defining part of our lives. Friends help us understand our place in the world and research shows thatstrong friendships are associated with reduced anxiety,external. But there is a growing body of evidence that suggests people tend to make friends with people who are similar to them. It may well be that we could all benefit from widening the circles we move in. For example, mixing witha diverse set of people can stimulate creativity,externaland benefits both the individual and society. The impact that our social networks have on the strength of our opinions is an area that researchers are investigating. The attitudes we hold most strongly guide the way we see the world and are more resistant to being changed by the persuasion of others. Often, we seek out, process and retain information that confirms our views, while discarding information that disagrees with our opinions. An example of this ""confirmation bias"" might be the way we listen to others' views on Brexit and whether we believe it is good, or bad, for the UK. Creating connections in a polarised world How to survive tough conversations Marriage 'provides a health boost' Health risks of love-hate friends Most people are in social networks made up of like-minded people, whereas a small minority mix with people with a wider range of views. As groups become more diverse, evidence suggests their members are more open to persuasion and theirattitudes towards a particular issue become less entrenched,external. In the case of Brexit, many of us may have had that ""aha"" moment, when we realised that just about everyone we knew held the same view as we did. This is why, if you are a Remainer, you may have been amazed to learn the outcome of the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU. If you were a Leaver, however, the result would have seemed much more obvious - after all, many of the people you know held that view. It is a compelling example of a current dispute where people hold starkly different views. Consequences can follow when people have such polarised positions. The tendency of ""birds of a feather to flock together"" - a behaviour sociologists call homophily - often strengthens stereotypes about both our own group and those of others. It can happen in many ways, for examplechildren in school cafeterias grouping themselves,externalby everything from ethnicity to less intuitively obvious characteristics like hairstyle and whether they wear glasses. Soon, we can find our social world divided along lines of age, social class, political views, religion and race. Additional psychological biases may then take over. For example,we may see our own group as ""better"",external- for example, more interesting, entertaining, or informed - and other groups as less favourable. In the worst cases, we can move from a slight preference for our own group to active dislike of others. As groups move further apart, they can end up living in different neighbourhoods, attending different schools and believing different ""facts"". The BBC'sCrossing Dividesseries looks at stories about the ways that people connect in an increasingly polarised world The series runs across BBC News from Monday 23 to Friday 27 April Ignorance of others' habits, thoughts and feelings can shape our views of the world, aswe tend to use stereotypes to make sense of people,externalwe rarely encounter. Despite this, research suggests that having friends who belong to other groups can be good for us. It can reduce anxiety about mixing with people who aren't ""just like us"" and dispel negative expectations of interactions with them. This, in turn, can lead to more positive attitudes towards other groups in general. It enables and encourages us to take the perspective of their members and to feel more empathy towards them. A surprising effect is that contact with one group of ""others"", for example gay people, can change our attitudes towards other groups, for example people with more or less money than us. Contact appears to reduce prejudice, polarisation and segregation - the effects of contact trickle down from one group to others. The way contact with other groups changes our attitudes has been shown in many studies all over the world. Most of this early work was done in the US, where studies of white American and African American students following the desegregation of schools found that increased contact reduced prejudice. Other examples of successful contact, frommy own research group at Oxford University,external, include Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland; Malay, Chinese and Indian people in Malaysia and Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot people in Cyprus. Most recently, we found that the merger of previously separate schools, catering for White-British and Asian-British students in Oldham, led to more positive attitudes towards one another and more mixed groups of friends. More stories like this: How parents' arguments really affect their children Where are the UK's youngest and oldest city populations? Why has Saudi Arabia suddenly decided cinema is OK? Why are sugar and alcohol about to get more expensive? Of course, in many places, groups still live segregated lives. But indirect contact between them can still lead to changing attitudes. For example, knowing of other groups through mutual friends has been shown to reduce prejudice almost as effectively as direct contact. People have also been shown to change their attitudes towards other groups after watching films, or television, that portray members of these groups. For example, research about the comedy Will and Grace, which centres around a friendship between a heterosexual woman and gay men, suggests that attitudes about gay people are more positive among those who watch more episodes. Are viewers of TV's Will And Grace more positive in attitudes towards gay people? This result is not simply due to who wants to watch such programmes. Experiments that randomly assigned people to watchprogrammes including Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,externalfound they were more likely to display reduced levels of prejudice compared with those who watched other shows. Contact is not, however, a panacea for prejudice. Its effectiveness is limited by continued segregation, or where a sense of threat is felt when groups mix - confirming prejudices in the worst cases. Over 60 years of research - from North America to Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia - suggests that contact between groups is a powerful means of improving relations. In many cases it can see us live together more positively and peaceably in an increasingly diverse world.
