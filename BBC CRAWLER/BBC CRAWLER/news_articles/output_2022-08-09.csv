Operation begins to rescue whale from French river,"This video can not be played The whale was trapped for several days before the failed rescue mission A beluga whale that became stranded in France's Seine river had to be put down, ending a dramatic rescue mission that captivated world audiences. Officials say vets took the decision as the four-metre (13ft) mammal was being moved in a refrigerated truck. Overnight, rescuers spent nearly six hours lifting the 800kg (1,763lb) whale from the river using a crane and nets. They had planned to release the animal in the sea but its health deteriorated after failing to eat. ""It is with heavy hearts we announce that the beluga did not survive,"" Sea Shepherd France conservation group wrote in a Twitter post on Wednesday. ""We are devastated by this tragic outcome that we knew was very likely,"" it added. Meanwhile, Florence Ollivet-Courtois, a vet for the local emergency services, was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that ""the animal was not getting enough air and [was] suffering visibly."" ""We therefore decided that it made no sense to set it free and proceeded to euthanasia,"" the vet added. Experts are still puzzled as to how the whale - who had been trapped more than 100km (62 miles) inland - managed to stray so far south, away from its natural habitat. On Wednesday, crowds were seen gathering on the banks of the river in the northern town of Saint-Pierre-La-Garenne to watch the rescue. But interest in the whale's survival spread far beyond France, and conservation groups and a number of individuals have made financial donations to help the rescue operation. Belugas occasionally venture south in the autumn to feed as ice forms, but it is rare for them to travel so far from their native home. According to France's Pelagis Observatory which specialises in sea mammals, the nearest beluga population is off the Svalbard archipelago, north of Norway, 3,000km (1,870 miles) from the Seine. But similar stories are not unheard of. In May,a killer whale was found dead after swimming up the River Seine in Normandy.And in 2019, adead whale was found in the River Thames near Gravesend, UK officials said.

Thames Water plans to introduce hosepipe ban,"Similar restrictions on water use are already in place in parts of England Thames Water has announced it is planning to introduce a hosepipe ban. The firm supplies 10 million people across parts of southern England, including London. The company said it was planning to announce the temporary ban ""in the coming weeks"" but the timing is yet to be confirmed. It comes as a new heatwave nears and the Met Office has issued an amber extreme heat warning for much of England. In a statement Thames Water said: ""Given the long term forecast of dry weather and another forecast of very hot temperatures coming this week we are planning to announce a temporary use ban in the coming weeks."" The ban would be the third implemented in England this year, followingSouthern Water's banwhich began last Friday in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. South East Water will introduce similar restrictionsacross Kent and Sussex from 12 August. The Isle of Man has also hada ban in place since July. Thames Water added: ""Our aim is always to ensure that we will have enough water to supply our customers, regardless of the weather."" Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Is the UK heading for a drought? Driest first half of year in England since 1976 England's driest July since 1935 - Met Office The statement explained the firm is not able to give an exact date for the start of the ban, due to ""a number of operational and legal procedural requirements"" and added that in the meantime customers were being urged to ""only use what they need for their essential use."" Thames Water provides water to 10 million people in an area that covers parts of London, Surrey, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Kent. Temperatures are set to reach up to 35Â°C (95Â°F) in some areas this week. The Met Office has issued a four-day amber extreme heat warningwhich applies to southern and central England and parts of Wales from midnight on Thursday until Sunday.

Four-day extreme heat warning in England and Wales,"The Met Office has issued a four-day amber extreme heat warning, meaning vulnerable people's health could be impacted and travel could be disrupted. The warning applies to southern and central England and parts of Wales from midnight on Thursday until Sunday. Temperatures are set to reach up to 35C (95F) in some areas andThames Water has becomethe latest water firm to announce hosepipe ban plans. Meanwhile,a 14-year-old boy has died in a lakein Hertfordshire. Emergency services were called to North Met Lake, off Cadmore Lane in Cheshunt, just after 17:00 BST on Monday, with his body recovered six hours later, Hertfordshire Constabulary said. A second search is under way for a man in his early 20s who has gone missing in a lake in Hounslow, west London, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. The amber alert is the longest the Met Office has issued since it introduced the warning system in 2021 and is lower than thefirst-ever red warningin July, when temperaturesexceeded 40Cfor the first time. Is your postcode area vulnerable to high heat? But the Met Office said while temperatures this week would remain below last month's record highs, this heatwave could last longer. The Met Office warning is one of several alerts aimed at preparing the country for the heat: A level-three heat-health alert will apply from Tuesday to Sunday in central and southern England, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. This ""requires social and healthcare services to target specific actions at high-risk groups"" A level-two alert has been issued for northern England The Met Office's fire severity index is ""very high"" for most of England and Wales and will reach ""exceptional"" for parts of England by the weekend. This assesses how severe a fire could become if one starts While the warnings remain lower than those issued during last month's record temperatures, the UKHSA's Dr Agostinho Sousa emphasised it was important vulnerable people, like the elderly who live alone or anyone with underlying health conditions, were ""prepared for coping during the hot weather"". ""The most important advice is to ensure they stay hydrated, keep cool and take steps to prevent their homes from overheating,"" he added. Disabled people could be particularly affected by heat, and may suffer fatigue, difficulty regulating their body temperatures, or problems moving to cooler spots in the home, Fazilet Hadi, from Disability Rights UK, said. Meanwhile, a dairy farmer in Shropshire has said he might have tosend some of his cows to slaughter if there is no rain in Augustas a result of the reduced amount of grass available. This video can not be played Amber warning for extreme heat in UK The amber warning for extreme heat comes as Thames Water has had to provide bottled water to residents in the village of Northend in Oxfordshire. The water company said supplies were disrupted due to a technical issue, later adding that customers should now have water, but the pressure could be lower than normal. One farmer told the BBC the situation had become ""dire"" - explaining that he had almost considered filling up cattle troughs with bottled water. Another Northend resident said they had not been able to shower, flush the toilet or prepare food - apart from when using bottled water. Thames Water supplied bottled water to a village in Oxfordshire when supplies ran out England had itsdriest July this year since 1935, according to the Met Office, while south-east and central southern England had the driest month since records began in 1836. Between the start of this year and 6 August, the south-east recorded 144 days with average rainfall of less than 0.5mm. Of those, 57 saw no rain at all. Cathryn Ross from Thames Water said the water company was ""seeing unprecedentedly low storage"" and this summer saw ""less than 65% of rainfall"" than expected. ""We're looking at less than 75% of our storage at the moment as to where we would expect it to be. She said Thames Water was planning ahead for hotter, drier summers by becoming more water efficient, increasing storage and ""potentially"" new reservoirs. Meanwhile, a disabled man from Llandysul, Wales says he has beenstruggling in the heat with no water or low water pressurefor three weeks. Data from the Environment Agency has shownRiver Wye levels are now as low as 2cmand water temperatures are expected to rise in coming days. Warnings of the threat posed by wildfires have been issued, with fire services urging people not to light bonfires or barbecues, or let off fireworks or sky lanterns. On Tuesday, around 70 firefighters battled a blaze over five hectares (12.36 acres) of grass and shrubland in Enfield, north London, while there were also fireson the outskirts of Ipswich,in Northamptonshireandnear Reading. An aerial view of a fire on Rushmore Heath on the outskirts of Ipswich The heatwave combined with months of dry weather have also led to increasing problems for farmers, with grass not growing and irrigation water running low cited as two key concerns. Thames Water said it would be announcing restrictions on water use in response to forecasts of more hot and dry weather, with the exact timings to be confirmed later. Hosepipe bans are already in force in Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight, and others are due to come into force in Kent, Sussex, Pembrokeshire, and Carmarthenshire. The UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology has warned river flows are set to remain exceptionally low in central, southern and eastern England until October. River Action founder Charles Watson called for the government to act to prevent an ""ecological emergency"", warning that if river flows slowed down the ecology of rivers could be killed and the concentration of pollution in them would increase. Christine Farnish, a former board member of water regulator Ofwat, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme water companies ""need to get their houses in order"" over leakage and said they had been ""very slow"" to wake up to the realities of climate change. But Water UK's director of policy Stuart Colville said Ofwat figures showed companies were at the lowest ever levels of leakage on record and said the industry was doing ""everything we can"" to avoid restrictions on water use. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? The National Trust haswarned that bats, lichen and stately gardens have been hit hard by the hot summer weather, with its climate change adviser describing the impact as ""stark"".

"Energy bills forecast to hit over Â£4,200 a year","Energy bills for a typical household could hit Â£4,266 next year, consultancy Cornwall Insight has warned. The higher estimate means the average household would be paying Â£355 a month, instead of Â£164 a month currently. Cornwall cited regulator Ofgem's decisionto change the price cap every three months instead of six and higher wholesale prices for its high forecast. But Ofgem said no forecast for next year could be ""robust"" at this stage and had ""limited value"". The latest price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers for average energy usagein England, Scotland and Wales for October - is due to be announced at the end of this month. Cornwall expects this to rise to Â£3,582 a year, compared to theregulator's prediction of Â£2,800 a year. Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall, said its price cap forecasts had been steadily rising but the big jump was ""a fresh shock"". The energy bill warning comes asthe government rejected calls for further helpon energy bills until a new prime minister was in place. The CBI business lobby group said it ""made no sense to wait"" for a new Conservative party leader. What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill? Regulator Ofgem warned wholesale prices were moving so quickly that future forecasts were not reliable. ""We cannot stop others from making predictions, but we would ask that extreme caution is applied to any predictions for the price cap in January or beyond."" Earlier this month, the government announced how households in England, Scotland and Waleswill receive Â£400 to help with rising fuel bills this autumn, with the money paid in six instalments. But Dr Lowrey called on the government to use the latest predictions of higher bills to review the support package. ""If the Â£400 was not enough to make a dent in the impact of our previous forecast, it most certainly is not enough now. ""The government must make introducing more support over the first two quarters of 2023 a number-one priority."" Hannah Absalom has been stocking up on thermal clothing ahead of winter. Hannah Absalom, a PHD student in Birmingham, lives on Â£850 per month in a one-bed flat and has spent Â£80 already on thermal clothing and a heated blanket so she can avoid heating her home in winter. ""I'm doing everything I can but there's not enough support. I'll more than likely end up in debt, or eat into my buffer savings - saved for getting a job,"" she says. Supermarket head office worker Stuart Lane, 47, who lives in Buckinghamshire with his wife and their three children, currently pays Â£100 a month for a fixed price deal. but that ends in September. ""When I looked at getting a new deal, the only fixed prices was pushing up to Â£420. We will be having to look at our outgoings,"" he says. Sylvia Simpson, chief executive at debt help charity Money Buddies in Leeds, told the BBC there were limited options for helping people with soaring energy bills: ""The tools that we used to have before, for example, for switching utility providers to get the best deal - that has gone now. There is no switching to get the best deal anymore. ""People are really, really struggling."" Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has said he would provide more money to help people with their energy bills, if he becomes prime minister. His rival for the leadership, Liz Truss, has pledged tax cuts to help people hit by cost of living increases. ButLiberal Democrat Leader Ed Daveyhas suggested that the government should scrap the energy price cap rise in October, which he said would save the typical household Â£1,400 this year. Mr Davey said the cost of the plan - which the party puts at nearly Â£36bn - could be funded through backdating the windfall tax on oil and gas companies' profits. Dr Lowry said that without the more frequent changes to the price cap, more energy suppliers might be in danger of collapse - though he questioned whether it should exist at all. ""If it is not controlling consumer prices, and is damaging suppliers' business models, we must wonder if it is fit for purpose - especially in these times of unprecedented energy market conditions,"" he said. However, if wholesale prices remain at current rates, it expects lower bills in the second half of next year than it had previously forecast. The energy price cap sets a limit on the amount that can be paid for each unit of energy. It is based on the price energy suppliers pay producers for electricity and gas. This has risen sharply, fuelled by the war in Ukraine whichhas threatened supplies from Russia. Many families are already facing soaring costs, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices are rising -at the highest in 40 years. The Don't Pay group, which is demanding bills be reduced to to an affordable level, says tens of thousands of people have pledged to cancel their direct debit payments from 1 October. However, charities have said not paying energy bills has very serious consequences for consumers, including being threatened with disconnection and damage to their credit rating. Householders who are struggling to meet their bill payments are advisedto contact their suppliers to come up with a payment plan. The warning comes as the government dismissed reports of disruption to energy supplies, following reports that plans for a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" included organised blackouts for firms and households. A source told the BBC that such scenarios are ""made up"" and ""extreme"" so that the government's response can be tested. Predictions of January energy bills were already sending shivers down spines, as the wholesale prices suppliers have to pay spiked due a fear of Russia withholding gas supplies. But it's partly a technical tweak that's caused those estimates to jump by another 10% in just a few days. At present, suppliers are often having to buy energy at a higher price to meet the needs of customers. But those customers, under the cap, may be paying a lower tariff. The regulator, under new plans, is allowing suppliers to recoup those extra costs from customers over the space of six months, a shorter period than previously thought. It's not just about protecting profits; 28 suppliers have already folded in the last couple of years, leaving customers to pick up a tab Â£2.7bn, nearly Â£100 per household, due to their failures. On top of that, over Â£1bn of taxpayer funds are expected to be needed to deal with the largest collapse, that of Bulb. The idea is to protect customers from the cost of future failures. But in the short term, it could mean devastating choices in the depths of winter. And the extra help currently on offer from both Tory leadership hopefuls is unlikely to offset even the increase in the estimate unveiled today.

Households already in debt as energy bills rise,"This video can not be played Martin Lewis: Rising prices are a crisis on a scale with the pandemic The situation with energy bills is ""a national crisis"" on the scale of the Covid pandemic, Martin Lewis has said. The consumer expert told the BBC support needed to double tomake up for the huge expected risein bills. The government said it had ""continually taken action to help households"". It comes as a survey by comparison site Uswitch suggested many people are already behind on energy bill payments with total debt owed three times higher than in September last year. Almost a quarter of households owe Â£206 on average, according to the survey of 2,000 people. Uswitch advised people falling into debt to speak to their provider to work out a more affordable payment plan. The figures come a day after consultancy Cornwall Insight warned energy bills couldrise much higher than previously thoughtin October. Cornwall also expects bills to increase much more sharply in January, with the average household paying Â£355 a month, instead of the current Â£164 a month. What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill? What is a recession and how could it affect me? Mr Lewis said according to forecasts, the price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - would effectively double between May of this year and October. The latest price cap is due to be announced at the end of this month by the energy regulator Ofgem. In May the government announced a package of support, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills for all UK households and an additional Â£650 for more than eight million low-income households. But Mr Lewis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If [the chancellor] is going to be consistent, he will need to double every number in that package."" Ministers are set tohold talks with energy giantson Thursday to discuss measures to ease the cost of living. However, Mr Lewis said ultimately it was ""government alone"" which could help by putting ""more money into people's pockets"". The boss of Octopus Energy also said he thought the government needed to improve its offer of Â£400 for households to help with rising energy bills. Greg Jackson told the BBC that while the initial package of support may have been ""right"" at the time, ""clearly it's not sufficient now and we need to look at a similarly significant assistance from the government for this winter"". Derek Lickorish, chairman of energy supplier Utilita, called for a social tariff, which offers discounted rates for lower income households, to be introduced. He also said the government needed to ""dramatically"" increase support by Â£800 - Â£1,000 per household. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said the Treasury had been preparing ""options"" for the next prime minister on what further support could be offered. However, Treasury officials have stressed that any decisions on major fiscal issues will be decided after the new PM takes office. Leadership frontrunner Liz Truss rejected the idea of holding talks with Boris Johnson and her rival Rishi Sunak before the end of the contest, saying ""now is not the time to pre-empt those decisions"". She denied she was ruling out payments to help with energy bills. However, stressing her support for tax cuts, Ms Truss said her priority was ""making sure we're not taking money off people and then giving it back to them later on"". James has had to take out a loan to cover his family's energy bill James Gilmour, who lives with his partner and three children in Essex, has taken out a Â£5,000 loan to help cover his energy bills when they go up in October. His gas and electricity bill has already doubled from Â£145 per month to Â£320 a month and from October he said he will be paying more than Â£600 per month, according to the latest forecasts. ""As a family of five we simply cannot afford to pay this monthly as we are already getting half way into the month with no money left for food and essentials,"" he told the BBC. James, who works in the automotive industry, said the loan was ""the only way to survive through this crisis"". Read more here. There are two main reasons households end up in debt to their supplier: the first reason, their direct debit payments may be set too low to cover the amount of energy being used. Anyone who finds themselves in that position should contact their supplier as quickly as possible to avoid a sudden bill shock, and give it their correct meter readings. The second reason is because people are just not keeping up with their payments. The Uswitch survey revealed that in addition to the group in debt, eight million households have no credit balances, meaning they have no cushion against the bill rises this winter. ""This is an alarming situation, as summer is traditionally a time when households are using less power for heating, which helps bill payers to build up energy credit ahead of the winter,"" said Justina Miltienyte, head of policy at Uswitch.com. An Ofgem spokesperson said its ""priority"" is to ""protect consumers"" and make sure suppliers treat their customers in a ""fair and reasonable manner"". A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We know the pressures people are facing with rising costs, which is why we have continually taken action to help households by phasing in Â£37bn worth of support throughout the year."" Separately on Wednesday, E.On reported first-half profits of just under â¬4.1bn (Â£3.5bn), which was about â¬700m below the previous year. The company, which is one of the UK's biggest energy suppliers, described the energy crisis as ""extraordinary"", and said it highlighted the need for Europe ""to transform its energy system. To be independent of Russian gas. To ensure supply security"". It is worth saying again that the old advice to shop around to find a better energy deal just does not apply anymore. The default price cap, although super high, is the best rate available at the moment, so don't be pushed into signing up for a new fixed deal unless you want to, as you may end up paying more in the long-run. If you are falling behind on your energy payments, or are unable to keep-up with the increases in direct debits being suggested by your supplier, then the first thing to do is let them know you're struggling. Making that call might be tough, as it's never easy to admit you're finding things difficult, however it's likely to be the best protection for your household this winter. Taking action is important because there is an extra layer of legal help available for people who are unable to pay, which forces suppliers to work through lots of different options with their customers. That includes agreeing a payment plan, giving temporary credit for prepayment customers, and arranging for payment directly through benefits. Crucially, making that call to explain that you're struggling means they can't just cut you off. 'I'm borrowing Â£5,000 to pay my energy bills' What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?

What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill?,"Energy prices have fallen from 1 April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills. Some will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support. From April, energy bills fell by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales. Energy regulator Ofgem announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit would nowpay Â£1,690 a year. That's a drop of Â£238 (or about Â£20 a month) from the previousenergy price cap,external- the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used. It's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What is the Ofgem energy price cap and how much are bills going down? About5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier,external, research by Citizens Advice suggests. The charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter. Its survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up. It estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024. Under Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan. If you don't agree one, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed orswitch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode. In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection. If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either: live alone live only with pensioners, or under-18s Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this. Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments. Non-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future. Suppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements. These were brought in after aninvestigation by The Times,externalfound debt agents acting for British Gaswrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Therules,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a ""site welfare visit"". Meters cannot be fitted for: customers over 75, without someone else in the home, or anyone with a terminal illness people with health conditions that could be worsened by a cold home those with children under the age of two those who need a continuous energy supply for health reasons households where no-one can top up the meter due to physical or mental incapacity About four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem. Prepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same. If you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier. You can ask for a review of your payments anddebt repayments,external, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay andaccess to hardship funds,external. If eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support,the Priority Services Register,external. It doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons. Make sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check theMoneyHelper benefits guide,externalor use theEntitledto,externalandTurn2us,externalbenefits calculators. Pensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can gethelp with energy bills,external. Councils can offer help through theHousehold Support Fund,external, which has been extended for six months from March 2024. Finally,adjusting settings on your boilercan save money.

How high will my energy bill go?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

Where does Scotland stand with the attainment gap?,"As pupils across Scotland receive their results, the BBC has looked at where the country's attainment gap stands - and how it has been affected by exams, the pandemic and government policy. In a nutshell, children from richer families tend to do better at school than children from poorer families. For the disadvantaged pupil â and in turn for their children â this means a lower chance of progressing to further education and a decent job. Scottish exam pass rate drops from pandemic high Scottish exam results: What happens next? School attainment gap 'still wide', watchdog warns The complex and difficult task of breaking this cycle of poverty has been a stated ""priority"" of Nicola Sturgeon since she took charge of the Scottish government eight years ago. In 2015 the first minister told the Scottish National Party conference she wanted to be judged on closing the attainment gap. ""I've put my own neck on the line,"" she said. The SNP's 2016programme for government,externalpledged to ""substantially eliminate [the attainment gap] within a decade"". Education was the ""defining mission"" of Ms Sturgeon's government, the party said. Badly. In March 2021 the public spending watchdog Audit Scotland reported that ""the poverty-related attainment gap remains wide and inequalities have been exacerbated by Covid-19."" The report acknowledged that some progress had been made but concluded it was ""limited and falls short of the Scottish government's aims."" At Holyrood on 18 May Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somervilleappeared to concede,externalthat the SNP would not meet its pledge to ""substantially eliminate"" the attainment gap by 2026, telling MSPs ""I will not set an arbitrary date for when the attainment gap will be closed, particularly so close to the experiences that we are still having with the pandemic."" Today, though, Ms Somerville told me that while Covid had made the task more difficult, the government remained ""absolutely determined"" to fulfil the promise of substantially eliminating the gap by 2026, insisting ""we're putting the investment in"" to make it happen. It certainly hasn't helped. Areas of high deprivation were ""hit hardest by Covid,"" said Leanne McGuire, who chairs Glasgow City Parents Group, which argues for more educational resources for poorer families. Leanne McGuire, who chairs the Glasgow City Parents Group Less well-off parents couldn't afford to purchase devices for home schooling and often were not able to take time off work to help educate their children, explained Ms McGuire. ""If you've got the money to hire a private tutor or if you've got the money to pay for private therapy for your child, obviously that child's going to excel further,"" she added. Her conclusions are supported by last year'sAudit Scotland report,externalwhich warned that ""variation in the learning experience of children and young people"" during the pandemic could well ""exacerbate the poverty-related attainment gap."" We are around a decade in to a controversial revamp of Scottish education called the Curriculum for Excellence, an ""outcome-based curriculum"" with little prescribed content, intended to help young people ""gain the knowledge, skills and attributes needed for life in the 21st century"". Students (from left) Michael Stewart, Aaron Boyack, John Poole and Claire McNab at Auchmuty High School in Glenrothes The project, instigated by a Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition and continued by the SNP, has been praised by some, including the OECD. The latter described it as offering an""inspiring and widely supported philosophy of education"",externalbut critics say it has been a disaster which has made closing the attainment gap harder. Lindsay Paterson, professor of educational policy at the University of Edinburgh, argues that education should focus first and foremost on instilling knowledge rather than on developing ""soft skills"" such as the ability to work in teams. ""Unless schools aim to devote themselves to improving young people's intellectual capacities, for most children there will be no other opportunities for that to happen,"" he said, adding that this particularly applied to pupils ""who don't have the good fortune of having parents who themselves are well-educated to stimulate that kind of development at home."" In 2020 and 2021 formal exams were shelved as the government prioritised preventing the spread of disease. Instead, a system of teacher assessments and, later, hastily arranged tests was used, provoking controversy for the way in which many disadvantaged pupils were initially marked down by moderators. After the grades had been reassessed in 2020 the attainment gap appeared to have narrowed but in 2021 it widened again. Covid exam changes to continue next year Holyrood's education committee has since taken evidence from about 60 young people and reported that while they had found the rapid shift to classroom assessments stressful, on the whole they nonetheless wanted to move away from""high pressure and high stakes"",externalend-of-year exams in which final grade awards were determined by ""on-the-day performance rather than recognising effort throughout the year."" Many of the students instead favoured ""a system of continuous assessment, including practical work and presentations as well as written tests."" The Scottish government has said that it expects to continue with externally assessed exams but Prof Louise Hayward of the University of Glasgow - who is chairing a review of qualifications and exams for the Scottish government - insistsnothing is off the table,external. In our interview, Ms Somerville denied that her comments had prejudiced the inquiry from the outset, saying there were ""different ways that you can assess people and the balance can be perhaps different"". It is spending a lot of taxpayers' money â almost Â£1bn since 2015. Some of that money was allocated to head teachers throughout Scotland to spend as they saw fit, such as employing extra staff, buying equipment or funding trips. Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville announced attainment gap funding would be shared by local authorities Another chunk of cash was directed at nine local authority areas with high levels of deprivation: Clackmannanshire, Dundee, East Ayrshire, Glasgow, Inverclyde, North Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire. Last year Ms Somerville announced that thosetargeted funds would in future be sharedby all 32 Scottish councils, a change which prompted Labour to decry ""callous cuts"" in the poorest communities and the Conservatives to accuse the SNP of ""rehashing the same failing initiatives"". Ms Somerville has also, on the recommendation of the OECD report,ordered the scrapping and replacement of Scotland's education and exams agencies, Education Scotland and the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). More information for one thing. A report,externalfor think tank Reform Scotland criticised a decision to abandon the Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy in 2017 - this assessed performance in P4, P7 and S2. The report also lamented Scotland's withdrawal from international surveys assessing performance in science, maths and literacy. ""We know less now about the performance of Scotland's schools than at any time since the 1950s"" concluded the report, a situation Prof Paterson describes as scandalous. ""Scotland is now worse served than any other country in Europe, as far as I can see, and it's certainly far worse served than England,"" he argued. For Leanne McGuire, of Glasgow City Parents Group, access to state-funded tutoring for all pupils regardless of their means would be transformative. ""I can't see how they're going to be able to close the attainment gap without putting something like that in place,"" she said. Other ideas such as improving school leadership and recruiting and training more high quality teachers are fleshed outhere,external. Whatever the methods, the education secretary has now reiterated that closing the gap remains a defining mission by which the Scottish government should be judged. The clock is ticking.

"Energy bills forecast to hit over Â£4,200 a yearThe average household could pay Â£355 a month, up from Â£164 currently, consultancy Cornwall Insight warns.Business","Energy bills for a typical household could hit Â£4,266 next year, consultancy Cornwall Insight has warned. The higher estimate means the average household would be paying Â£355 a month, instead of Â£164 a month currently. Cornwall cited regulator Ofgem's decisionto change the price cap every three months instead of six and higher wholesale prices for its high forecast. But Ofgem said no forecast for next year could be ""robust"" at this stage and had ""limited value"". The latest price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers for average energy usagein England, Scotland and Wales for October - is due to be announced at the end of this month. Cornwall expects this to rise to Â£3,582 a year, compared to theregulator's prediction of Â£2,800 a year. Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall, said its price cap forecasts had been steadily rising but the big jump was ""a fresh shock"". The energy bill warning comes asthe government rejected calls for further helpon energy bills until a new prime minister was in place. The CBI business lobby group said it ""made no sense to wait"" for a new Conservative party leader. What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill? Regulator Ofgem warned wholesale prices were moving so quickly that future forecasts were not reliable. ""We cannot stop others from making predictions, but we would ask that extreme caution is applied to any predictions for the price cap in January or beyond."" Earlier this month, the government announced how households in England, Scotland and Waleswill receive Â£400 to help with rising fuel bills this autumn, with the money paid in six instalments. But Dr Lowrey called on the government to use the latest predictions of higher bills to review the support package. ""If the Â£400 was not enough to make a dent in the impact of our previous forecast, it most certainly is not enough now. ""The government must make introducing more support over the first two quarters of 2023 a number-one priority."" Hannah Absalom has been stocking up on thermal clothing ahead of winter. Hannah Absalom, a PHD student in Birmingham, lives on Â£850 per month in a one-bed flat and has spent Â£80 already on thermal clothing and a heated blanket so she can avoid heating her home in winter. ""I'm doing everything I can but there's not enough support. I'll more than likely end up in debt, or eat into my buffer savings - saved for getting a job,"" she says. Supermarket head office worker Stuart Lane, 47, who lives in Buckinghamshire with his wife and their three children, currently pays Â£100 a month for a fixed price deal. but that ends in September. ""When I looked at getting a new deal, the only fixed prices was pushing up to Â£420. We will be having to look at our outgoings,"" he says. Sylvia Simpson, chief executive at debt help charity Money Buddies in Leeds, told the BBC there were limited options for helping people with soaring energy bills: ""The tools that we used to have before, for example, for switching utility providers to get the best deal - that has gone now. There is no switching to get the best deal anymore. ""People are really, really struggling."" Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has said he would provide more money to help people with their energy bills, if he becomes prime minister. His rival for the leadership, Liz Truss, has pledged tax cuts to help people hit by cost of living increases. ButLiberal Democrat Leader Ed Daveyhas suggested that the government should scrap the energy price cap rise in October, which he said would save the typical household Â£1,400 this year. Mr Davey said the cost of the plan - which the party puts at nearly Â£36bn - could be funded through backdating the windfall tax on oil and gas companies' profits. Dr Lowry said that without the more frequent changes to the price cap, more energy suppliers might be in danger of collapse - though he questioned whether it should exist at all. ""If it is not controlling consumer prices, and is damaging suppliers' business models, we must wonder if it is fit for purpose - especially in these times of unprecedented energy market conditions,"" he said. However, if wholesale prices remain at current rates, it expects lower bills in the second half of next year than it had previously forecast. The energy price cap sets a limit on the amount that can be paid for each unit of energy. It is based on the price energy suppliers pay producers for electricity and gas. This has risen sharply, fuelled by the war in Ukraine whichhas threatened supplies from Russia. Many families are already facing soaring costs, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices are rising -at the highest in 40 years. The Don't Pay group, which is demanding bills be reduced to to an affordable level, says tens of thousands of people have pledged to cancel their direct debit payments from 1 October. However, charities have said not paying energy bills has very serious consequences for consumers, including being threatened with disconnection and damage to their credit rating. Householders who are struggling to meet their bill payments are advisedto contact their suppliers to come up with a payment plan. The warning comes as the government dismissed reports of disruption to energy supplies, following reports that plans for a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" included organised blackouts for firms and households. A source told the BBC that such scenarios are ""made up"" and ""extreme"" so that the government's response can be tested. Predictions of January energy bills were already sending shivers down spines, as the wholesale prices suppliers have to pay spiked due a fear of Russia withholding gas supplies. But it's partly a technical tweak that's caused those estimates to jump by another 10% in just a few days. At present, suppliers are often having to buy energy at a higher price to meet the needs of customers. But those customers, under the cap, may be paying a lower tariff. The regulator, under new plans, is allowing suppliers to recoup those extra costs from customers over the space of six months, a shorter period than previously thought. It's not just about protecting profits; 28 suppliers have already folded in the last couple of years, leaving customers to pick up a tab Â£2.7bn, nearly Â£100 per household, due to their failures. On top of that, over Â£1bn of taxpayer funds are expected to be needed to deal with the largest collapse, that of Bulb. The idea is to protect customers from the cost of future failures. But in the short term, it could mean devastating choices in the depths of winter. And the extra help currently on offer from both Tory leadership hopefuls is unlikely to offset even the increase in the estimate unveiled today.

Tory rivals clash over help for energy bills,"This video can not be played Martin Lewis: Rising prices are a crisis on a scale with the pandemic Ministers will hold talks with energy giants on Thursday to discuss measures to ease the cost of living. The government says talks will focus on how energy companies can alleviate pressure on consumers. But Treasury officials have stressed that any big decisions will be decided by the next prime minister, when they take office in early September. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he would make sure options and ideas were in place for the new PM. Concerns over what will happen this winter come as figures suggest many households are already in energy debt. Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak said he would be ""happy"" to meet his rival Liz Truss to agree emergency support ahead of the winter. Ms Truss has dismissed the proposal telling reporters ""now is not the time to pre-empt those decisions"". Yet new figures from comparison service Uswitch laid bare the challenge facing Mr Johnson's successor. Unclaimed: Are you missing out on any universal credit? How high will my energy bill go? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Almost a quarter of households owe Â£206 to energy firms, on average, with the total debt owed by the public triple that of September last year,according to a survey of 2,000 households. Forecasts predict average annual energy bills could rise to over Â£4,200 by January - while the state pension is typically worth between Â£7,376 and Â£9,628. Mr Johnson has faced growing criticism for not announcing further support beyond the Â£15bn package set out in May, while the government is under pressure to do more to help with bills. Mr Zahawi said he was focused on ensuring that the money the government had already promised was getting ""into people's bank accounts"". He added that he would make sure ""we have the ideas and the options available to whoever becomes prime minister on the 5 September"". But consumer expert Martin Lewishas called on,externalwhat he described as the ""zombie"" government to ""wake up"" and put together a plan immediately. Speaking to the BBC, he compared the current situation to the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are currently in that position of watching the beds in European hospitals and doing nothing about it,"" he said. On Wednesday morning, Ms Truss did not rule out making cash payments to help people with energy bills but said her priority would be to reverse April's National Insurance rise and temporarily drop green levies on energy bills arguing that low taxes were ""vitally important"" for growing the economy. She also said she would boost energy supply by ""getting more gas out of the North Sea"" and allowing more fracking to take place. Analysis by Rajdeep Sandhu, BBC political correspondent Liz Truss is trying to appeal to two different electorates at the same time. The first and arguably most important (right now) is the Conservative membership. Her message of tax cuts seems to be going down well with the people who will decide the next prime minister. But she'll also have one eye on the future electorate she might one day face - the general public and those voters who gave the Conservatives a chance last time and might not give them a second one if they are struggling with day-to-day costs. That might explain why Liz Truss's language has been very careful in recent days. Because while she is convinced tax cuts are the way to help the economy grow, she isn't categorically ruling out direct support to those who are vulnerable. She's left herself enough room to change her mind in the future if she does become prime minister and the growing calls for financial help become deafening. The Liberal Democratshave arguedthat the energy profits levy - or windfall tax - should be backdated to October 2021 and the extra money raised should be used to help people with energy bills. A windfall tax is a one-off charge imposed by a government on a company, designed to target firms that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for. Companies supplying energy are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic, but more recently because of supply constraints following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Thelevy- which the Treasury previously said could raise up to Â£5bn - came into effect on 26 May. Energy firms like BP have reported recorded quarterly profits this year that will not be impacted by the levy. Asked about backdating the windfall tax, Ms Truss replied: ""The answer to our problems is not more taxes."" Speaking at a leadership hustings, former Chancellor Mr Sunak warned that the Conservative Party would be ""hammered"" at the next election without offering further direct support to households. This video can not be played Labour's Bridget Philipson says the party has been ""consistently ahead of the government"" on energy bills He has not set out in detail what further payments he would make to households, saying the exact scale of the rise is still unclear, and any payments would come on top of existing support. Labour's shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Breakfast the situation was ""deeply worrying"" and said Labour would cut VAT on gas and electricity bills. She also said her party would set out further proposals ""very soon"" but added that they ""wouldn't have let things get to this point in the first place"".

Johnson defends leaving fuel response to successor,"The PM has defended leaving decisions on the cost-of-living crisis to his successor who takes over in September. Boris Johnson said he was ""absolutely certain"" his successor would do more to help people with rising fuel bills. But Labour accused him of leaving a ""political vacuum"" and called on the government not to wait but to act now. Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss has promised tax cuts, while her rival Rishi Sunak vowed to provide more money to vulnerable households. The outgoing PM has ruled out spending commitments during his remaining time in office, despite pressure from opposition parties. PM rules out immediate cost-of-living action Set budget before financial timebomb, says Brown Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Speaking during an event at Downing Street, Mr Johnson said he was confident the government had the economic tools to ""look after people"". On his successor, he said: ""Whoever he or she may be, they, I'm absolutely certain, will be wanting to make some more announcements in September, October about what we're going to do further in the next period, in December, January. ""I just want you to know that I'm absolutely confident we will have the fiscal firepower and the headroom to look after people as we've done throughout."" The Bank of England has predicted inflation - how fast prices are rising - will hit 13% and the UK will plunge into a recession later this year. And consultancy Cornwall Insight has warned that energy bills for a typical household could hit Â£4,266 next year. Ms Truss said her policies will focus on cutting taxes to let people ""keep more of their own money"" Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy criticised the government for not acting on the rise in the energy price cap. Speaking to BBC News, he added: ""There is a lot that we need to do, but at the moment what we have got is bickering in the Conservative party, a race to the bottom amongst the candidates, an absent prime minister nowhere to be seen. ""We have got this political vacuum as people worry, fret, and struggle their into dealing with this crisis."" ""This needs a rapid response from government and it needs a response now - why are we waiting? We had a debate about having the prime minister in office. He's in office. He can act."" Business lobby group the CBI has also called for more action now, whilst the Liberal Democrats called for October's expected energy price cap riseto be scrapped, with the cost covered by a wider windfall tax on energy companies. What to do about rising energy prices has become a central theme of the contest between Ms Truss and Mr Sunak to replace Mr Johnson. Mr Sunak, who is trailing Ms Truss in the polls,has vowed to provide more moneyto help people with their energy bills, if he wins. In an interview with ITV, the former chancellor said he could not yet put a figure on this level of support because ""we don't know exactly what energy bills are going to go up by"" - but agreed it would amount to ""hundreds of pounds more"". He has said the extra help can be funded whilst keeping additional public borrowing to an ""absolute minimum"" by making ""efficiency savings"" in government. However, he has not set out details. Pressed on how this would be funded, Mr Sunak told ITV the total bill would be ""much smaller"" than the Â£15bn cost of the package of measures heannounced in May, and his plan to fund it through savings was ""manageable"". Ms Truss, the foreign secretary, has instead focused on her pledge to lower taxes, which she argues will help households by putting more money in their pockets and boosting economic growth. But in recent days, she has come under fire after she indicated there would be no more ""handouts"" if she became prime minister, despitethe energy bills forecast.,external Repeatedly pressed on whether she would provide direct support to households, Ms Truss told reporters: ""What I don't believe in is taxing people to the highest level in 70 years, and then giving them their own money back. ""My fundamental principle is that people keep more of their own money."" Ms Truss said she would not comment on what was going to be in an emergency budget she has proposed, insisting she would wait to ""see what the situation is like in the future"". Mr Sunak has argued Ms Truss's tax cuts - worth an estimated Â£30bn - would stoke inflation and saddle the UK with debt. His campaign said Ms Truss's latest commitment to tax cuts rather than direct support showed she was ""divorced from reality"". ""Liz Truss has doubled down, refusing five times to say she will provide direct support for British families and pensioners this winter,"" a Sunak campaign source said. ""Under her plans Liz will get Â£1,800 of support whilst hard working families will get as little as Â£60, while facing the same rises in bills. ""Liz's plan will not touch the sides for the majority of British families this winter and pensioners will get no help whatsoever."" Allow Twitter content?

LiveLiveMike Pence shares 'deep concern' over FBI search of Trump's homeLess than a minute ago,"Ex-US President Donald Trump's Florida home was searched by the FBI on Monday evening, in what he says was a raid He said Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach was ""occupied by a large group of FBI agents"" who broke into his safe It is reportedly connected to an investigation into Trump's handling of official papers and whether he took classified records from the White House Meanwhile, former US Vice President Mike Pence has called on US Attorney General Merrick Garland to give a ""a full accounting"" to the public of why the search warrant was carried out at Mar-a-Lago Trump is thought to be preparing for a possible third presidential run in 2024 He is facing numerous investigations, including a Congressional inquiry into the 6 January Capitol riots Edited by Chris Giles Today's live page was brought to you by: Jude Sheerin, Francesca Gillett, Thomas Spender, Catherine Evans, Jack Burgess, Anna Boyd, Krystyna Gajda, James Harness, Bernd Debusmann, Sam Cabral, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Ben Tobias, Alexandra Fouche, Jeremy Gahagan and Chris Giles. You can read more on this storyhere. We're bringing our live coverage to a close shortly, but before we go hereâs a look at the main developments in the FBI search of
former President Donald Trumpâs Florida home   President Joe Biden was not given a 'heads up' about the FBI's search on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home, says White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. This video can not be played Trump home search: Biden not given a 'heads up' - White House A former FBI special agent has told CNN the Trump investigation shows there is a ""national security threat"". Asha Rangappa says the former president is ""a counter-intelligence nightmare"". She says the large number of visitors to Mar-a-Lago could make it very dangerous if classified documents had been kept there. I think it's important to underscore that because these involve classified documents, this is a national security investigation.  There's an ongoing national security threat. You can imagine the kinds of secrets that make their way to the White House, specifically to the desk of the president.  They can be a threat to our national security, they can get sources killed, they can compromise sources of information that we have if they get into the wrong hands."" Asha Rangappa, Former FBI special agent New York Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has suggested that the FBI carrying out a search warrant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago property is something that could happen to ordinary Americans. ""If the FBI can raid a US president, imagine what they can do to you,"" she wrote on Twitter. Stefanik is one of a number of Republican opponents of the Biden administration who have vowed to investigate the Justice Department if the Republicans take control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections.

Another Representative, Ohio Republican and close Trump ally Jim Jordan, used a quote from Trump to make a similar point. ""Always remember, they are coming after me because I'm fighting for you,"" he wrote on Twitter. Supporters of Donald Trump have been speaking to the BBC's Chi Chi Izundu in Florida about the search of his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach. One told us ""we feel the FBI is doing a political hit job,"" adding he wanted to show his support for the former president. This video can not be played The FBI is doing a political hit job on Trump - ex-president's supporters say Michelle FleuryReporting from Bedminster, New Jersey The entrance to Donald Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey A day after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Donald Trump has gone to his summer residence in Bedminster, New Jersey. Security at the golf course, accessible via a country road which takes you past several farms, was tight â with some VIP guests expected later today.The former president is to meet with about a dozen House Republicans, a day after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Florida home. The former president will dine with members of the House Republican Study Committee, a conservative caucus group, today at his golf club in Bedminster New Jersey. The dinner had been in the works for weeks but has now taken on an air of soldiers rallying around their general. In a show of solidarity, several Republicans have condemned the investigation and pledged to investigate the Department of Justice if elected in Novemberâs midterm elections. The approach to Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey Nobody at the White House was briefed about or aware of the search warrant carried out at Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate, according to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Jean-Pierre said that President Biden's staff learned of the search through ""public reports"". Despite repeated questions from the gathered press corps, Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the raid and referred questions to the Justice Department. ""The Justice Department conducts investigations independently and we leave any law enforcement matters to them,"" she said. While she declined to comment on what President Biden thinks of the search, she said that he has been ""unequivocal"" in his belief in the rule of law. She also quoted a 7 January 2021 speech in which Biden vowed to ""restore the integrity"" of the Justice Department. Mick Mulvaney acted as Donald Trump's chief of staff from January 2019 until March 2020 Mick Mulvaney, Donald Trump's former Chief of Staff, says the FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago home - where he reportedly took government documents when he left office - is either ""the most egregious political hit job in history or part of the most significant criminal investigation in our history"". Speaking to the BBC, Mulvaney says that during his time at the White House, he was in charge of running the West Wing where he ensured documents were preserved. ""When the law says you have to preserve everything, that's everything - a scratch pad, a newspaper the president had seen, it could be something very serious or something trivial, such as a menu with Boris Johnson, for example,"" he says. ""If that's all they're looking for, technical violations of the law, then this is a tremendous overreach by the department of justice (DoJ). ""If on the other hand, it's somehow tied to a very serious charge of trying to interfere with the transition of authority to the Biden administration, and if the DoJ thinks there might be documents the president retained at Mar-a-Lago that speak to say, conversations with the right wing extremists  and the rioters, then that's very serious."" He said ""complete incompetence"" could explain why Donald Trump reportedly took so many documents from the White House when his presidency ended. ""Is it possible there's something in that stack that is very damning to the president? Yes there is. And if there is, I hope that's what the DoJ was looking for."" This video can not be played WATCH: The State Attorney for Palm Beach Dave Aronberg reflects on the Mar-a-Lago search More comments now from Dave Aronberg, the State Attorney for Palm Beach in Florida. Aronberg says his office had no prior warning about the FBI's search of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. He says such secrecy is normal for ""the Feds"", especially when it involves ""something so sensitive"", such as searching the home of a former president. He pushes back against claims the search was politically motivated. Aronberg thinks the judge who granted the search warrant will have scrutinised it more than ""any other in history"" due to the request being so unprecedented. The FBI carried out a warranted search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's a look at the key developments in the FBI search on former President Donald Trumpâs Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. Christopher Wray was appointed as FBI Director in 2017 The FBIâs search of Donald Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago home was kept
firmly under wraps until Trump himself announced it to the world. Even President Joe Biden was given no notice of it
happening, a senior White House official told CBS. So who did know about it? The FBI reports to the US Attorney General, the nationâs top
lawyer, and its activities are overseen by the Director of National
Intelligence. The bureau does not report directly to the White House. Any search warrant like this has to be signed off by a
judge. To do so, investigators must demonstrate that there is probable cause for the search, which essentially boils down to whether it is reasonable to believe that a crime has been or is being committed. But given the explosive ramifications of this search in particular, many political analysts believe the approval would have had to come from the highest level. That would likely include FBI Director Christopher Wray â
who was appointed by Trump when he was president â and also his boss, the
current attorney general Merrick Garland. Supporters and opponents of Donald Trump have held up placards and banners outside Trump Tower in New York. The building on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue serves as the headquarters for the Trump Organization. This video can not be played People have gathered at Trump Tower following the FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago Mike Pence at an event on 3 August Former US Vice President Mike Pence has called on US Attorney General Merrick Garland to give a ""a full accounting"" to the public of why the search warrant was carried out at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. In aseries of Tweets,,externalPence - who has distanced himself from Trump amid speculation he may launch a 2024 presidential run - said that he shares ""a deep concern"" over the ""unprecedented"" search of Trump's property. ""No former President of the United States has ever been subject to a raid of their personal residence in American history,"" he wrote. Additionally, Pence said that the search ""undermines public confidence in our system of justice."" ""Attorney General [Merrick] Garland must give a full accounting to the American people as to why this action was taken and he must do so immediately,"" he added. The lead Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee has called for the director of the FBI to give an ""immediate briefing"" about the information that led to the search warrant conducted at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. In a letter directed to FBI Director Christopher Wray,Rep. Mike Turner,externalcalled the search warrant ""unprecedented"" in US history. Turner also said that as the committee's ranking member, he is ""unaware of any actual or alleged national security threat posed by any information, data, or documents in the possession of former President Trump"". ""Congress deserves immediate answers from you as to the actions you ordered,"" the letter adds. A former US Senator once considered a leading contender to be Joe Biden's attorney general has said that the US ""is not some banana republic"" that conducts searches without cause. In an interview with the BBC, ex-Alabama Senator Doug Jones  - a former US district attorney - said the search warrant on Donald Trump's property at Mar-a-Lago is a sign of the checks and balances that ""the constitution envisions"". ""This is not some banana republic where the government just breaks down the door and barges in,"" he said. ""This is a process that is set up in the constitution of the United States and it appears to be followed to the letter here."" Jones also said that despite mounting pressure on the justice department to be more ""forthcoming"" with any investigation into former President Trump, doing so would be ""inconsistent"" with departmental guidelines. ""I don't believe the Department of Justice will or should succumb to that pressure,"" he said. ""I think it would be a big mistake for the future of that department to break with that long-standing policy."" Chi Chi IzunduReporting from Mar-a-Lago About two dozen Trump supporters are protesting outside Trump's Florida residence Even though Donald Trump isnât here and Mar-a-Lago is closed during the summer months, about two dozen loyal supporters, in the blazing sun of West Palm Beach, have lined the state road outside the property, waving flags and carrying Trump 2020 banners. They've been taking the opportunity to tell the members of press camped here that we are reporting âfake newsâ. One man whispered as we walked past: âThis whole thing is crazy. Itâs all nonsense."" Support for the former president was also reflected by cars beeping their horns as they drove past. Justin, who lives up the road from the complex, was being stopped and asked whether the many flags he was carrying were for sale. âNo,â he replied, âjust supportâ. He called the execution of the FBI warrant âliesâ, while Adrienne, waving her American flag, encouraged âpeople with a voiceâ to show their support. Security guards were seen walking outside Mar-a-Lago today after the Florida home belonging to ex-President Trump was searched by the FBI Guards were also seen patrolling the perimeter of the residence in Palm Beach Some Trump supporters gathered outside to show their support to the former president Supporters of Donald Trump are speaking up today, with many backing the former president's assertion that Monday's FBI search is part of a Democrat strategy to stop him from running for office again in 2024. Among them is Republican strategist Seth Weathers, who calls the operation at Trump's Florida home ""truly, unbelievably outrageous"". Speaking to the BBC, Weathers says a precedent has been set that he thinks is ""going to be very hard to take back"". He claims the legal authorisation of the search warrant was politically motivated, and says the ""overreach"" from Joe Biden's administration has reached levels ""I don't think many people thought would happen"". President Biden has tried to distance himself from the justice department, and a White House official has said he was given no advanced notice of Mondays's FBI search. According to former US district attorney for Idaho, Wendy Olson, granting the FBI a search warrant would not be politically motivated. Olson says the warrant would have been subject to a ârigorous applicationâ, signed off and vetted by those at the âhighest levelsâ of the Department of Justice and the FBI - including the Trump-appointed FBI director Chris Wray. Reality Check The emails date back to when Hillary Clinton was US Secretary of State In Trump's statement about Monday's FBI search, he reacted angrily and compared his situation to that of his former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. âHillary Clinton was allowed to deleteâ¦ 33,000 emails after they were subpoenaed by Congress. Absolutely nothing has happened to hold her accountable,"" he claimed. This claim refers to an investigation into Clintonâs
use of a private email server for government business, which is against
official protocol. In March 2015, after sheâd
left office as secretary of state, the company that maintained her email server
deleted the archive mailbox, erasing about 32,000 emails, including
some from when she was in her official role. This happened after Congress had already asked Clinton to hand over any work-related emails. She did hand over thousands of
other emails, and said she believed the deleted emails were not
work-related. The FBI later investigated and found she was
âextremely carelessâ with government material. But it said
there was no evidence of collusion between her and the company that maintained
the server to improperly delete work-related emails, or that Clinton was âallowedâ to delete these emails as Trump suggests. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Backlog of longest-wait patients slashed in England,"People waiting longer than two years were offered treatment further from home to speed up their care The number of people waiting longer than two years for routine operations in England has fallen from 22,500 at the start of the year, to fewer than 200, according to NHS figures. This excludes more than 2,500 who are complex cases or chose not to travel for speedier treatment. NHS England said it had achieved the first milestone in its plan to eliminate backlogs caused by Covid. But a record 6.6 million people are still waiting for hospital treatment. Health experts say there is still a mountain to climb to reduce the number - currently about 400,000 - waiting more than a year. And winter will probably bring more delays and pressure. Eliminating 18-month waits - currently affecting about 50,000 - by April 2023 is next on the government's agenda. The numbers of people waiting a long time for routine hospital treatment have soared during the past two years throughout the UK, as operations were cancelled to free up beds for Covid patients. The situation pushed people intoborrowing thousands of pounds for private treatment. To reduce the backlog,patients have been offered travel and accommodation coststo be treated in an alternative part of the country. In England, large numbers have been sent to private hospitals for surgical procedures, while community diagnostic centres have been set up to deliver thousands of checks and scans. NHS England promised to ""virtually eradicate"" the list of people waiting more than two years for treatment, by the end of July. It has now shrunk to 168 patients, who mostly live in the South West - the area worst affected by Covid staff absences and pressure on the health service. Consultant Gavin Jennings says his hospital has been innovative in the way it has treated extra patients to bring down waiting lists Sulis Hospital Bath has been treating patients from seven local hospitals in the region - more than 1,100 extra patients since September. Extended theatre times, an temporary operating theatre and close relationships with the local trust have all helped to increase the numbers. And the private hospital, now owned by a local NHS trust, plans to take more people from greater distances, for a wide variety of orthopaedic surgery and eye procedures. ""It's been a lot of hard work,"" clinical director and consultant Gavin Jennings said. The Omicron Covid variant, first identified in South Africa, had hit the hospital quite hard, he said, affecting staffing levels and causing operations to be cancelled. ""As a result of people waiting longer than usual, some of those cases are now more complex and symptoms may have become worse,"" Mr Jennings said. ""That's why there's a need to recover from Covid quickly."" In addition to the 22,500 people waiting two years or more at the start of the year, a further 43,500 who would have waited more than two years by the end of July had also been treated, NHS England said. More than 6.6 million people are still waiting for scans, procedures or operations NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the health service had continued to reform the way it delivered care, ""using innovate techniques and adopting pioneering technology, like robot surgery"". But there are now warnings of high demand on other services. Saffron Cordery, the interim chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts, told the BBC: ""There is a long way to go with mental health, community and hospital care backlogs, and to relieve pressure on ambulance services."" Cutting cancer diagnosis waiting times and eliminating 78-week waits was now a priority, she said, adding that progress could be ""put at risk"" if the government did not increase investment in the NHS. Regarding potential strikes by nurses over pay, Ms Cordery said: ""Nobody wants to see industrial action, but what we have to remember is that we have a workforce that has been working flat-out for the past two-and-a-half years, and is now being asked to go the extra mile again to get these waiting lists down."" Nigel Edwards, chief executive of The Nuffield Trust independent health think tank, said: ""This is a good achievement - but like getting to base camp, there's quite a mountain to climb in terms of people waiting over a year... and over 78 weeks, which are much bigger numbers than the figure for two-year waits."" Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: ""We are working hard with the NHS to get our health system back to peak performance, by growing the healthcare workforce, opening new community diagnostic centres and surgical hubs across the country, and investing in innovative technology to ensure patients can access the treatment they need while saving staff time."" Elsewhere in the UK, work continues to try to reduce the longest waiting times. In Wales, the number of patients waiting the longest has been reducing for the past two months, due to more staff and equipment and new facilities, the Welsh government said. In Scotland, more than 10,000 people were waiting more than two years in June, compared with 648 the year before. A Scottish government spokesperson said they had introduced new targets to address the backlog and ""increased the flexibility health boards and clinicians have to manage waiting lists, with a focus on eliminating long waits, as well as continuing to treat the most clinically urgent patients"".

"Over-50s quitting fuels inflation, warns John Lewis","Dame Sharon White An exodus of over-50s who left the workforce during the Covid pandemic is fuelling wage inflation, says the boss of John Lewis. Dame Sharon White said any government must think ""really hard"" about how to get more older people back into work. The UK has seen one million people, mostly in their 50s, leave work since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. That ""inevitably"" causes wage inflation, said Dame Sharon. The number of ""economically inactive"" people - those without a job and not seeking to work - is higher than before Covid struck, according to the Office for National Statistics. Retirement is the mostpopular reason given by people aged between 50 and 70,externalfor not working. Job vacancies are at a record high and employers who want to attract and retain staff are under pressure to lift wages, which in turn fuels inflation. Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, is currently at a 40-year high while the Bank of England has warned the UK will fall into recession later this year. The chairwoman of the John Lewis Partnership, owner of the department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain,told the BBC's Today Programmeshe had ""never seen anything quite like"" the country's current economic situation throughout her entire career. Dame Sharon, who is a former Treasury civil servant, said she was cautious about giving advice to her former colleagues, but said ""one area"" that had not had ""enough attention"" was the job market over the past 18 months. Listen to Sharon White's interview in full Where are Britain's missing million workers? UK will fall into recession this year, warns Bank ""Regardless of what has happened coming out of Covid, if the labour market is that tight, if we continue to have far fewer people in work [or] looking for work -  you've inevitably got more inflation and more wage inflation,"" she said. ""I guess I would encourage...any government to really think much more about how to encourage more people back into work. ""There's not a business in the UK that's not finding it very difficult to recruit at the moment because there are so many more jobs and far fewer people looking for work. It's a big issue."" Steve Willis retired from his full-time job as a regional account manager for a motor finance broker after he ""saw life in a completely different way"" when he was furloughed during the height of the pandemic. ""You do not realise the stress that you're under,"" he said. ""What the lockdown and Covid did is make me slow down because you couldn't do anything."" The 58-year-old, who lives in Kent, said his company were ""very generous"" to him while he was furloughed but said when he returned to work ""the whole world for everybody had completely changed"". Having previously met clients face-to-face, out on the road, he was asked to work from home more often and conduct business on the telephone. ""When you get to my age you start questioning things: 'Why am I doing this? I'm not enjoying it anymore,'"" he said. After speaking to his company, Mr Willis agreed to stay on to train a new member of staff before departing. He now works on a zero-hours contract job driving for the NHS where his wife, Grainne, works full-time. And despite the rising cost of living, he has no plans to return to full-time employment. ""We are in a lucky position,"" Mr Willis said. ""I could not have done this without my wife working full-time. She totally enjoys her job. I'm lucky enough that we have not got a mortgage and my daughter is grown-up."" Dame Sharon said she had ""never"" seen ""such a combination of some very difficult factors"" impacting the economy during her working career, which has also included a stint as boss of Ofcom. ""I've never seen anything quite like the economic environment we have at the moment,"" she said. ""I think the big worry that everybody has is inflation combined with low growth, low productivity. So I think the big focus for all of us is how do we avoid stagflation? ""How do we avoid the UK becoming Japan with very low, very persistently low, rates of productivity and very low persistent rates of growth? To come out of that you have got to get businesses investing."" Dame Sharon said introducing flexible retirement plans for people and skills courses for older workers to retrain for different jobs could help encourage people back into work ""A million people out of the labour market has got profound, long-term, systemic implications. I would like there to be more of a debate, more of an open debate and certainly more of a debate, between business and government,"" she said. Dame Sharon admitted trading for John Lewis had been ""tough"" over the past few months, with the company discussing how it can help customers through loyalty schemes, as well as its staff. She said John Lewis had doubled its financial assistance fund - a pot of cash where workers can apply for grants and loans if they have difficulty paying bills - from Â£400,000 to Â£800,000. John Lewis has handed out a bonus of 3% this year to its 80,000 staff - equivalent to one-and-a-half weeks' pay - and increased wages by 2%. However, the current rate at which prices are rising is 9.4% - with the rate is expected to peak at 13% later this year. And the Bank of England is warning the UK will fall into recession. Asked why John Lewis had not increased its wages in line with the rising cost of living, Dame Sharon said the department store had sought to find a balance: ""How do we ensure our partners are able to cope with the cost of living, whilst also thinking about the affordability of pay for the business,"" she told BBC Radio 4. ""I think the same dilemmas that the partnership faces are the same dilemmas that the whole of the economy faces,"" she added.

Birmingham 2022 gives Scotland platform to build onTeam Scotland have achieved their most successful Commonwealth Games away from home soil.Scotland,"Eilish McColgan emulated her mother Liz by winning gold for Scotland in the 10,000m In the city of the bull, they boasted these would be the biggest and best Commonwealth Games ever. A claim that most host cities make to attract athletes and crowds alike. In fairness, save a few exceptions, most cities can usually back it up after the bandwagon has packed up and rolled out of town. In the build up to these Games, Team Scotland decided against bold predictions of their own. Gold Coast in 2018 was the country's most successful Games on non Scottish soil. A total of 44 medals were won - nine of those were gold. Scotland reach 51 medals at Commonwealth Games Scotland at Birmingham 2022 - the games in review Behind the scenes, in the build up to Birmingham, few were talking about that being bettered in the West Midlands. It's fair to assume then that even those who picked the team, would have been more than pleasantly surprised to see a final medal tally of 51, which included 13 golds. The counting of medals mid Games is part of the Commonwealth experience. Organisers, fans, journalists and athletes look for the medal table come close of play on any given day. Ross Murdoch won three bronze medals in the pool If it's going well, the spectators get the feel-good factor, the journalists get their copy and those competing lap up the bragging rights and pride. But the final medal table can also be looked upon as a snapshot of a nation's sporting competence. It can be used to take the temperature of a country's relationship with certain sports. The results suspended in time and used as a tool in the fight for more funding or to show why investment is working and should continue. These are the battles that will now play out away from the field of play in the coming months. Conversations will take place between governing bodies, Sportscotland and the Scottish government to see how best to build on what has been achieved. To make sure, for the right reasons, that success can breed success. Dumfries pensioner Rosemary Lenton became the Commonwealth Games' oldest gold medallist with her triumph in Para women's pairs bowls. Ministers will be reminded of the commitment to double the budget for sport during this parliament. At a time when money has rarely been tighter, it can seem like a big sell. Why then should sport ask for more during such troubled financial times? What can't be measured in the way sporting achievements can, is the impact on the psyche of a nation. Games like Birmingham 2022 provide people with sporting memories that will live on. Scotland won't quickly forgetEilish McColgan storming home to take gold in the 10,000 metresand stepping out from the shadow of her mother, Liz, who did the same over three decades ago. The words of swimmer Ross Murdoch after his last racewill resonate with those who have struggled with sport and beyond. And athletes like 49-year-oldcyclist Aileen McGlynnand72-year-old bowler Rosemary Lentonreminded us all that if you work hard enough, for long enough, the rewards can be there. Scotland's Samantha Kinghorn celebrates after winning bronze in the women's T53/54 1500m The integrated nature of the para sports is also one of the selling points of the Commonwealth Games. A reminder that those who cheer on able-bodied athletes are just as willing to do the same for those with disabilities. Sometimes sport struggles to be heard, or even taken seriously, in the wider context of what we are told is happening in the world around us. But, despite concerns over the future relevance of an event that was born of Britain's colonial past, Birmingham 2022 once again showed the power of sport to bring people together, to celebrate life and to inspire. Few things have the ability to unite just when unity is needed. Organisers will use what was witnessed in the West Midlands to argue this event has a future. Team Scotland will use what they achieved to build a more successful one.

Four-day extreme heat warning for England and Wales,"The Met Office has issued a four-day amber extreme heat warning, meaning vulnerable people's health could be impacted and travel could be disrupted. The warning applies to southern and central England and parts of Wales from midnight on Thursday until Sunday. Temperatures are set to reach up to 35C (95F) in some areas andThames Water has becomethe latest water firm to announce hosepipe ban plans. Meanwhile,a 14-year-old boy has died in a lakein Hertfordshire. Emergency services were called to North Met Lake, off Cadmore Lane in Cheshunt, just after 17:00 BST on Monday, with his body recovered six hours later, Hertfordshire Constabulary said. A second search is under way for a man in his early 20s who has gone missing in a lake in Hounslow, west London, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. The amber alert is the longest the Met Office has issued since it introduced the warning system in 2021 and is lower than thefirst-ever red warningin July, when temperaturesexceeded 40Cfor the first time. Is your postcode area vulnerable to high heat? But the Met Office said while temperatures this week would remain below last month's record highs, this heatwave could last longer. The Met Office warning is one of several alerts aimed at preparing the country for the heat: A level-three heat-health alert will apply from Tuesday to Sunday in central and southern England, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. This ""requires social and healthcare services to target specific actions at high-risk groups"" A level-two alert has been issued for northern England The Met Office's fire severity index is ""very high"" for most of England and Wales and will reach ""exceptional"" for parts of England by the weekend. This assesses how severe a fire could become if one starts While the warnings remain lower than those issued during last month's record temperatures, the UKHSA's Dr Agostinho Sousa emphasised it was important vulnerable people, like the elderly who live alone or anyone with underlying health conditions, were ""prepared for coping during the hot weather"". ""The most important advice is to ensure they stay hydrated, keep cool and take steps to prevent their homes from overheating,"" he added. Disabled people could be particularly affected by heat, and may suffer fatigue, difficulty regulating their body temperatures, or problems moving to cooler spots in the home, Fazilet Hadi, from Disability Rights UK, said. Meanwhile, a dairy farmer in Shropshire has said he might have tosend some of his cows to slaughter if there is no rain in Augustas a result of the reduced amount of grass available. This video can not be played Amber warning for extreme heat in UK The amber warning for extreme heat comes as Thames Water has had to provide bottled water to residents in the village of Northend in Oxfordshire. The water company said supplies were disrupted due to a technical issue, later adding that customers should now have water, but the pressure could be lower than normal. One farmer told the BBC the situation had become ""dire"" - explaining that he had almost considered filling up cattle troughs with bottled water. Another Northend resident said they had not been able to shower, flush the toilet or prepare food - apart from when using bottled water. Thames Water supplied bottled water to a village in Oxfordshire when supplies ran out England had itsdriest July this year since 1935, according to the Met Office, while south-east and central southern England had the driest month since records began in 1836. Between the start of this year and 6 August, the south-east recorded 144 days with average rainfall of less than 0.5mm. Of those, 57 saw no rain at all. Cathryn Ross from Thames Water said the water company was ""seeing unprecedentedly low storage"" and this summer saw ""less than 65% of rainfall"" than expected. ""We're looking at less than 75% of our storage at the moment as to where we would expect it to be. She said Thames Water was planning ahead for hotter, drier summers by becoming more water efficient, increasing storage and ""potentially"" new reservoirs. Meanwhile, a disabled man from Llandysul, Wales says he has beenstruggling in the heat with no water or low water pressurefor three weeks. Data from the Environment Agency has shownRiver Wye levels are now as low as 2cmand water temperatures are expected to rise in coming days. Warnings of the threat posed by wildfires have been issued, with fire services urging people not to light bonfires or barbecues, or let off fireworks or sky lanterns. On Tuesday, around 70 firefighters battled a blaze over five hectares (12.36 acres) of grass and shrubland in Enfield, north London, while there were also fireson the outskirts of Ipswich,in Northamptonshireandnear Reading. An aerial view of a fire on Rushmore Heath on the outskirts of Ipswich The heatwave combined with months of dry weather have also led to increasing problems for farmers, with grass not growing and irrigation water running low cited as two key concerns. Thames Water said it would be announcing restrictions on water use in response to forecasts of more hot and dry weather, with the exact timings to be confirmed later. Hosepipe bans are already in force in Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight, and others are due to come into force in Kent, Sussex, Pembrokeshire, and Carmarthenshire. The UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology has warned river flows are set to remain exceptionally low in central, southern and eastern England until October. River Action founder Charles Watson called for the government to act to prevent an ""ecological emergency"", warning that if river flows slowed down the ecology of rivers could be killed and the concentration of pollution in them would increase. Christine Farnish, a former board member of water regulator Ofwat, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme water companies ""need to get their houses in order"" over leakage and said they had been ""very slow"" to wake up to the realities of climate change. But Water UK's director of policy Stuart Colville said Ofwat figures showed companies were at the lowest ever levels of leakage on record and said the industry was doing ""everything we can"" to avoid restrictions on water use. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? The National Trust haswarned that bats, lichen and stately gardens have been hit hard by the hot summer weather, with its climate change adviser describing the impact as ""stark"".

Ofsted: Babies ate lotion in nursery messy playInspectors rate a Liverpool nursery inadequate and find it needs to improve risk assessments.,"Ofsted has ordered Barton's Day Nursery in Liverpool to improve after rating it ""inadequate"" A nursery which gave babies lotion to explore during messy play, which they subsequently ate, has been ordered to improve following an Ofsted inspection. Inspectors found learning at Barton's Day Nursery, on Liverpool's Lower Lane, was ""inconsistent"" and ""not focused"" and rated it inadequate. The June inspection,externalalso highlighted a need to improve risk assessments and staff training. Owner Christine Barton said changes had been made following the inspection. She toldthe Local Democracy Reporting Servicethat she was ""confident that our next inspection will paint a truer picture of our setting as a whole"". The Ofsted report said the centre, which cares for children under the age of four, did not ""properly risk assess or consider the age of children when choosing the materials used during messy play activities"". It said that led to children under one year old being given baby lotion to explore, which was ""subsequently eaten"". The report also said that while staff received ""supervision meetings and some feedback on their performance"", what they were told was ""not specific enough to improve their knowledge and skills further"". ""This means there are inconsistencies in the quality of care and education that children receive,"" it said. They said that while toddlers and two-year-old children had ""a lovely experience"" and accessed ""interesting activities"" that were tailored to meet their individual needs"", for babies and pre-school children, learning was ""much more inconsistent"". ""Not all activities are tailored to support their existing skills,"" the report said. ""Learning is not focused and does not help children to extend their knowledge further. ""Consequently, some babies wander around not engaged in play or learning."" Rating all areas of the nursery as either inadequate or requiring improvement, the report said it needed to ""implement thorough risk assessments... with particular regard to messy play materials"" and ""implement effective coaching, mentoring and training"". Ms Barton said the report was ""most unexpected"", but the nursery had ""reviewed our processes and put robust procedures in place to ensure that baby lotion or any substance deemed inappropriate is not used in messy play and sensory activities"".

You can read more on this storyhere. We're bringing our live coverage to a close shortly, but before we go hereâs a look at the main developments in the FBI search of
former President Donald Trumpâs Florida home   President Joe Biden was not given a 'heads up' about the FBI's search on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home, says White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. This video can not be played Trump home search: Biden not given a 'heads up' - White House A former FBI special agent has told CNN the Trump investigation shows there is a ""national security threat"". Asha Rangappa says the former president is ""a counter-intelligence nightmare"". She says the large number of visitors to Mar-a-Lago could make it very dangerous if classified documents had been kept there. I think it's important to underscore that because these involve classified documents, this is a national security investigation.  There's an ongoing national security threat. You can imagine the kinds of secrets that make their way to the White House, specifically to the desk of the president.  They can be a threat to our national security, they can get sources killed, they can compromise sources of information that we have if they get into the wrong hands."" Asha Rangappa, Former FBI special agent New York Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has suggested that the FBI carrying out a search warrant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago property is something that could happen to ordinary Americans. ""If the FBI can raid a US president, imagine what they can do to you,"" she wrote on Twitter. Stefanik is one of a number of Republican opponents of the Biden administration who have vowed to investigate the Justice Department if the Republicans take control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections.

Another Representative, Ohio Republican and close Trump ally Jim Jordan, used a quote from Trump to make a similar point. ""Always remember, they are coming after me because I'm fighting for you,"" he wrote on Twitter. Supporters of Donald Trump have been speaking to the BBC's Chi Chi Izundu in Florida about the search of his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach. One told us ""we feel the FBI is doing a political hit job,"" adding he wanted to show his support for the former president. This video can not be played The FBI is doing a political hit job on Trump - ex-president's supporters say Michelle FleuryReporting from Bedminster, New Jersey The entrance to Donald Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey A day after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Donald Trump has gone to his summer residence in Bedminster, New Jersey. Security at the golf course, accessible via a country road which takes you past several farms, was tight â with some VIP guests expected later today.The former president is to meet with about a dozen House Republicans, a day after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Florida home. The former president will dine with members of the House Republican Study Committee, a conservative caucus group, today at his golf club in Bedminster New Jersey. The dinner had been in the works for weeks but has now taken on an air of soldiers rallying around their general. In a show of solidarity, several Republicans have condemned the investigation and pledged to investigate the Department of Justice if elected in Novemberâs midterm elections. The approach to Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey Nobody at the White House was briefed about or aware of the search warrant carried out at Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate, according to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Jean-Pierre said that President Biden's staff learned of the search through ""public reports"". Despite repeated questions from the gathered press corps, Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the raid and referred questions to the Justice Department. ""The Justice Department conducts investigations independently and we leave any law enforcement matters to them,"" she said. While she declined to comment on what President Biden thinks of the search, she said that he has been ""unequivocal"" in his belief in the rule of law. She also quoted a 7 January 2021 speech in which Biden vowed to ""restore the integrity"" of the Justice Department. Mick Mulvaney acted as Donald Trump's chief of staff from January 2019 until March 2020 Mick Mulvaney, Donald Trump's former Chief of Staff, says the FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago home - where he reportedly took government documents when he left office - is either ""the most egregious political hit job in history or part of the most significant criminal investigation in our history"". Speaking to the BBC, Mulvaney says that during his time at the White House, he was in charge of running the West Wing where he ensured documents were preserved. ""When the law says you have to preserve everything, that's everything - a scratch pad, a newspaper the president had seen, it could be something very serious or something trivial, such as a menu with Boris Johnson, for example,"" he says. ""If that's all they're looking for, technical violations of the law, then this is a tremendous overreach by the department of justice (DoJ). ""If on the other hand, it's somehow tied to a very serious charge of trying to interfere with the transition of authority to the Biden administration, and if the DoJ thinks there might be documents the president retained at Mar-a-Lago that speak to say, conversations with the right wing extremists  and the rioters, then that's very serious."" He said ""complete incompetence"" could explain why Donald Trump reportedly took so many documents from the White House when his presidency ended. ""Is it possible there's something in that stack that is very damning to the president? Yes there is. And if there is, I hope that's what the DoJ was looking for."" This video can not be played WATCH: The State Attorney for Palm Beach Dave Aronberg reflects on the Mar-a-Lago search More comments now from Dave Aronberg, the State Attorney for Palm Beach in Florida. Aronberg says his office had no prior warning about the FBI's search of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. He says such secrecy is normal for ""the Feds"", especially when it involves ""something so sensitive"", such as searching the home of a former president. He pushes back against claims the search was politically motivated. Aronberg thinks the judge who granted the search warrant will have scrutinised it more than ""any other in history"" due to the request being so unprecedented. The FBI carried out a warranted search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's a look at the key developments in the FBI search on former President Donald Trumpâs Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. Christopher Wray was appointed as FBI Director in 2017 The FBIâs search of Donald Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago home was kept
firmly under wraps until Trump himself announced it to the world. Even President Joe Biden was given no notice of it
happening, a senior White House official told CBS. So who did know about it? The FBI reports to the US Attorney General, the nationâs top
lawyer, and its activities are overseen by the Director of National
Intelligence. The bureau does not report directly to the White House. Any search warrant like this has to be signed off by a
judge. To do so, investigators must demonstrate that there is probable cause for the search, which essentially boils down to whether it is reasonable to believe that a crime has been or is being committed. But given the explosive ramifications of this search in particular, many political analysts believe the approval would have had to come from the highest level. That would likely include FBI Director Christopher Wray â
who was appointed by Trump when he was president â and also his boss, the
current attorney general Merrick Garland. Supporters and opponents of Donald Trump have held up placards and banners outside Trump Tower in New York. The building on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue serves as the headquarters for the Trump Organization. This video can not be played People have gathered at Trump Tower following the FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago Mike Pence at an event on 3 August Former US Vice President Mike Pence has called on US Attorney General Merrick Garland to give a ""a full accounting"" to the public of why the search warrant was carried out at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. In aseries of Tweets,,externalPence - who has distanced himself from Trump amid speculation he may launch a 2024 presidential run - said that he shares ""a deep concern"" over the ""unprecedented"" search of Trump's property. ""No former President of the United States has ever been subject to a raid of their personal residence in American history,"" he wrote. Additionally, Pence said that the search ""undermines public confidence in our system of justice."" ""Attorney General [Merrick] Garland must give a full accounting to the American people as to why this action was taken and he must do so immediately,"" he added. The lead Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee has called for the director of the FBI to give an ""immediate briefing"" about the information that led to the search warrant conducted at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. In a letter directed to FBI Director Christopher Wray,Rep. Mike Turner,externalcalled the search warrant ""unprecedented"" in US history. Turner also said that as the committee's ranking member, he is ""unaware of any actual or alleged national security threat posed by any information, data, or documents in the possession of former President Trump"". ""Congress deserves immediate answers from you as to the actions you ordered,"" the letter adds. A former US Senator once considered a leading contender to be Joe Biden's attorney general has said that the US ""is not some banana republic"" that conducts searches without cause. In an interview with the BBC, ex-Alabama Senator Doug Jones  - a former US district attorney - said the search warrant on Donald Trump's property at Mar-a-Lago is a sign of the checks and balances that ""the constitution envisions"". ""This is not some banana republic where the government just breaks down the door and barges in,"" he said. ""This is a process that is set up in the constitution of the United States and it appears to be followed to the letter here."" Jones also said that despite mounting pressure on the justice department to be more ""forthcoming"" with any investigation into former President Trump, doing so would be ""inconsistent"" with departmental guidelines. ""I don't believe the Department of Justice will or should succumb to that pressure,"" he said. ""I think it would be a big mistake for the future of that department to break with that long-standing policy."" Chi Chi IzunduReporting from Mar-a-Lago About two dozen Trump supporters are protesting outside Trump's Florida residence Even though Donald Trump isnât here and Mar-a-Lago is closed during the summer months, about two dozen loyal supporters, in the blazing sun of West Palm Beach, have lined the state road outside the property, waving flags and carrying Trump 2020 banners. They've been taking the opportunity to tell the members of press camped here that we are reporting âfake newsâ. One man whispered as we walked past: âThis whole thing is crazy. Itâs all nonsense."" Support for the former president was also reflected by cars beeping their horns as they drove past. Justin, who lives up the road from the complex, was being stopped and asked whether the many flags he was carrying were for sale. âNo,â he replied, âjust supportâ. He called the execution of the FBI warrant âliesâ, while Adrienne, waving her American flag, encouraged âpeople with a voiceâ to show their support. Security guards were seen walking outside Mar-a-Lago today after the Florida home belonging to ex-President Trump was searched by the FBI Guards were also seen patrolling the perimeter of the residence in Palm Beach Some Trump supporters gathered outside to show their support to the former president Supporters of Donald Trump are speaking up today, with many backing the former president's assertion that Monday's FBI search is part of a Democrat strategy to stop him from running for office again in 2024. Among them is Republican strategist Seth Weathers, who calls the operation at Trump's Florida home ""truly, unbelievably outrageous"". Speaking to the BBC, Weathers says a precedent has been set that he thinks is ""going to be very hard to take back"". He claims the legal authorisation of the search warrant was politically motivated, and says the ""overreach"" from Joe Biden's administration has reached levels ""I don't think many people thought would happen"". President Biden has tried to distance himself from the justice department, and a White House official has said he was given no advanced notice of Mondays's FBI search. According to former US district attorney for Idaho, Wendy Olson, granting the FBI a search warrant would not be politically motivated. Olson says the warrant would have been subject to a ârigorous applicationâ, signed off and vetted by those at the âhighest levelsâ of the Department of Justice and the FBI - including the Trump-appointed FBI director Chris Wray. Reality Check The emails date back to when Hillary Clinton was US Secretary of State In Trump's statement about Monday's FBI search, he reacted angrily and compared his situation to that of his former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. âHillary Clinton was allowed to deleteâ¦ 33,000 emails after they were subpoenaed by Congress. Absolutely nothing has happened to hold her accountable,"" he claimed. This claim refers to an investigation into Clintonâs
use of a private email server for government business, which is against
official protocol. In March 2015, after sheâd
left office as secretary of state, the company that maintained her email server
deleted the archive mailbox, erasing about 32,000 emails, including
some from when she was in her official role. This happened after Congress had already asked Clinton to hand over any work-related emails. She did hand over thousands of
other emails, and said she believed the deleted emails were not
work-related. The FBI later investigated and found she was
âextremely carelessâ with government material. But it said
there was no evidence of collusion between her and the company that maintained
the server to improperly delete work-related emails, or that Clinton was âallowedâ to delete these emails as Trump suggests. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Grease co-stars lead tributes to Olivia Newton-John,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Tributes have been paid from around the world to Olivia Newton-John, who has died from cancer aged 73. The British-born Australian singer and actress was best known for playing Sandy in Grease, one of the most successful film musicals ever made. Her Grease co-star John Travolta said she ""made all of our lives so much better"" while its director said: ""What you see is what you get with her."" She died peacefully at her California ranch surrounded by family and friends. An actress and musician, Newton-John achieved commercial success as a country singer and sold millions of records globally. But it was her role as high school student Sandy in the film Grease that catapulted her to worldwide fame. The musical was the biggest box-office hit of 1978, and gave Newton-John three huge hit singles, including You're The One That I Want and Summer Nights, both performed with co-star John Travolta. And it was a catalyst for change in both her image and her musical direction - shedding her innocent, country-pop image. Obituary: Olivia Newton-John Australia mourns a national sweetheart Following the news of her death, scores of fans, as well as famous figures from the world of entertainment, shared heartfelt messages and memories. Actress Stockard Channing - who played Rizzo in Grease - said: ""I don't know if I've known a lovelier human being. Newton-John soared to global fame playing girl-next-door Sandy in smash-hit musical Grease ""Olivia was the essence of summer - her sunniness, her warmth and her grace are what always come to mind when I think of her. I will miss her enormously."" Singer Rod Stewart called her ""the perfect lady, gorgeous, with great poise and with a certain Aussie sophistication"". ""Her spandex trousers in Grease were my inspiration for my 'Da ya think I'm Sexy' era,"" he added, referencing the iconic tight black outfit that she wore at the film's finale. US television host Oprah Winfrey said her ""positivity was just infectious"". ""You'll be missed, Olivia,"" she wrote. ""Here's to the good times."" Travoltawrote on Instagram:,external""Your impact was incredible. I love you so much. We will see you down the road and we will all be together again."" ""Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever!"" he added, signing off: ""Your Danny, your John!"" The film's director Randal Kleiser said he had been friends with Newton-John for 40 years and ""she never changed, she was always exactly the way everyone imagines her"". ""She was charming, lovely, warm... There are so many clichÃ©s you can say about her, but in her case it was all true."" Asked what his everlasting memory of her will be, he told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Hanging out with her at her ranch. Seeing the real Olivia which was exactly like the Olivia she projected. No cameras around, no people around... she was exactly the same and as loving as ever."" Didi Conn, who played Frenchy in Grease, told BBC's Newsnight: ""She was such a humungous, big, big pop star and her persona was of this beauty... pure and sweet. In the movie we would call her Miss Goody Two Shoes, you know,  but simmering under that faÃ§ade of innocence was a hot mama ready to come out."" Other tributes came from singers Kylie Minogue, who called her an inspiration, and Dionne Warwick, who called Newton-John ""one of the nicest people I had the pleasure of recording and performing with"". Australian rock legend John Farnham, a long-time friend and with whom Newton-John released her final studio album, said she would be ""greatly missed"" and ""behind that iconic smile was a tenacious fighter"". Olivia Moore, who is currently playing Sandy in Grease in London's West End, broke the news to a shocked audience at the end of Monday evening's performance. Allow Twitter content?

Newton-John was first diagnosed with cancer in 1992 and went on to become a leading advocate of cancer research. Her charity, the Olivia Newton-John Foundation, has raised millions of pounds to support research. In a statement, the hospital that runs the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne - which was opened after the star's campaigning - said she ""encouraged, inspired and supported"" staff and patients every day. ""We are incredibly grateful for the special relationship we had with Olivia for many years. Her generous support and gift provided hope and changed the lives of thousands of cancer patients... She was the light at the end of the tunnel for many, many people."" Her efforts in the field were recognised by the Queen, who honoured her with a damehood in the 2020 New Year's Honours list. In a statement posted to her social media channels, Newton-John's husband John Easterling said she had died on Monday, hailing her ""a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years, sharing her journey with breast cancer"". ""Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer."" In later years, Newton-John became a cancer campaigner which led to the opening of an institute named after her in Melbourne Newton-John was born in Cambridge on 26 September 1948. Her father had been a British spy during World War Two. Her mother was the daughter of the German Nobel laureate, Max Born, and had fled with her family when the Nazis came to power in 1933. The family moved to Australia in 1954, where she was raised. Her breakthrough came in 1971 when she released a Bob Dylan-penned track, If Not For You, which reached number seven in the UK charts and featured on an album of the same name. She won four Grammy awards and scored seven US number one hits between 1974 and 1977. While critics never warmed to her audience-friendly style of music, the star forthrightly dismissed the reviews. ""It annoys me when people think because it's commercial, it's bad,"" she told Rolling Stone. ""It's completely opposite. If people like it, that's what it's supposed to be."" In 1978 she became a global star with the release of Grease. The film, set in the 1950s, told the story of Sandy's summer fling with John Travolta's Danny and the difficulties the relationship encounters. In the end the pair reconcile, with Sandy having transformed her appearance. In 2019, after being diagnosed with breast cancer for the third time, she was asked by CBS News how she coped. ""It was consuming my day and after a time I went 'you know what', I need to enjoy my life so I'm going to eat a cookie if I want it,"" she said. ""Because the joy of life and everyday living has to be a part of that healing process as well. So I've chosen that path to be grateful and to feel good about things because the other side's not so good.""

Ofsted: Babies ate lotion in nursery messy play,"Ofsted has ordered Barton's Day Nursery in Liverpool to improve after rating it ""inadequate"" A nursery which gave babies lotion to explore during messy play, which they subsequently ate, has been ordered to improve following an Ofsted inspection. Inspectors found learning at Barton's Day Nursery, on Liverpool's Lower Lane, was ""inconsistent"" and ""not focused"" and rated it inadequate. The June inspection,externalalso highlighted a need to improve risk assessments and staff training. Owner Christine Barton said changes had been made following the inspection. She toldthe Local Democracy Reporting Servicethat she was ""confident that our next inspection will paint a truer picture of our setting as a whole"". The Ofsted report said the centre, which cares for children under the age of four, did not ""properly risk assess or consider the age of children when choosing the materials used during messy play activities"". It said that led to children under one year old being given baby lotion to explore, which was ""subsequently eaten"". The report also said that while staff received ""supervision meetings and some feedback on their performance"", what they were told was ""not specific enough to improve their knowledge and skills further"". ""This means there are inconsistencies in the quality of care and education that children receive,"" it said. They said that while toddlers and two-year-old children had ""a lovely experience"" and accessed ""interesting activities"" that were tailored to meet their individual needs"", for babies and pre-school children, learning was ""much more inconsistent"". ""Not all activities are tailored to support their existing skills,"" the report said. ""Learning is not focused and does not help children to extend their knowledge further. ""Consequently, some babies wander around not engaged in play or learning."" Rating all areas of the nursery as either inadequate or requiring improvement, the report said it needed to ""implement thorough risk assessments... with particular regard to messy play materials"" and ""implement effective coaching, mentoring and training"". Ms Barton said the report was ""most unexpected"", but the nursery had ""reviewed our processes and put robust procedures in place to ensure that baby lotion or any substance deemed inappropriate is not used in messy play and sensory activities"". She added that the nursery has traded for almost 30 years and had ""worked hard to support parents and carers by creating a safe, stimulating and happy place for their children to learn and thrive"".

Four-day extreme heat warning issued,"The Met Office has issued a four-day amber extreme heat warning, meaning vulnerable people's health could be impacted and travel could be disrupted. The warning applies to southern and central England and parts of Wales from midnight on Thursday until Sunday. Temperatures are set to reach up to 35C (95F) in some areas andThames Water has becomethe latest water firm to announce hosepipe ban plans. Meanwhile,a 14-year-old boy has died in a lakein Hertfordshire. Emergency services were called to North Met Lake, off Cadmore Lane in Cheshunt, just after 17:00 BST on Monday, with his body recovered six hours later, Hertfordshire Constabulary said. A second search is under way for a man in his early 20s who has gone missing in a lake in Hounslow, west London, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. The amber alert is the longest the Met Office has issued since it introduced the warning system in 2021 and is lower than thefirst-ever red warningin July, when temperaturesexceeded 40Cfor the first time. Is your postcode area vulnerable to high heat? But the Met Office said while temperatures this week would remain below last month's record highs, this heatwave could last longer. The Met Office warning is one of several alerts aimed at preparing the country for the heat: A level-three heat-health alert will apply from Tuesday to Sunday in central and southern England, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. This ""requires social and healthcare services to target specific actions at high-risk groups"" A level-two alert has been issued for northern England The Met Office's fire severity index is ""very high"" for most of England and Wales and will reach ""exceptional"" for parts of England by the weekend. This assesses how severe a fire could become if one starts While the warnings remain lower than those issued during last month's record temperatures, the UKHSA's Dr Agostinho Sousa emphasised it was important vulnerable people, like the elderly who live alone or anyone with underlying health conditions, were ""prepared for coping during the hot weather"". ""The most important advice is to ensure they stay hydrated, keep cool and take steps to prevent their homes from overheating,"" he added. Disabled people could be particularly affected by heat, and may suffer fatigue, difficulty regulating their body temperatures, or problems moving to cooler spots in the home, Fazilet Hadi, from Disability Rights UK, said. Meanwhile, a dairy farmer in Shropshire has said he might have tosend some of his cows to slaughter if there is no rain in Augustas a result of the reduced amount of grass available.

The water company said supplies were disrupted due to a technical issue, later adding that customers should now have water, but the pressure could be lower than normal. One farmer told the BBC the situation had become ""dire"" - explaining that he had almost considered filling up cattle troughs with bottled water. Another Northend resident said they had not been able to shower, flush the toilet or prepare food - apart from when using bottled water. Thames Water supplied bottled water to a village in Oxfordshire when supplies ran out England had itsdriest July this year since 1935, according to the Met Office, while south-east and central southern England had the driest month since records began in 1836. Between the start of this year and 6 August, the south-east recorded 144 days with average rainfall of less than 0.5mm. Of those, 57 saw no rain at all. Cathryn Ross from Thames Water said the water company was ""seeing unprecedentedly low storage"" and this summer saw ""less than 65% of rainfall"" than expected. ""We're looking at less than 75% of our storage at the moment as to where we would expect it to be. She said Thames Water was planning ahead for hotter, drier summers by becoming more water efficient, increasing storage and ""potentially"" new reservoirs. Meanwhile, a disabled man from Llandysul, Wales says he has beenstruggling in the heat with no water or low water pressurefor three weeks. Data from the Environment Agency has shownRiver Wye levels are now as low as 2cmand water temperatures are expected to rise in coming days. Warnings of the threat posed by wildfires have been issued, with fire services urging people not to light bonfires or barbecues, or let off fireworks or sky lanterns. On Tuesday, around 70 firefighters battled a blaze over five hectares (12.36 acres) of grass and shrubland in Enfield, north London, while there were also fireson the outskirts of Ipswich,in Northamptonshireandnear Reading. An aerial view of a fire on Rushmore Heath on the outskirts of Ipswich The heatwave combined with months of dry weather have also led to increasing problems for farmers, with grass not growing and irrigation water running low cited as two key concerns. Thames Water said it would be announcing restrictions on water use in response to forecasts of more hot and dry weather, with the exact timings to be confirmed later. Hosepipe bans are already in force in Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight, and others are due to come into force in Kent, Sussex, Pembrokeshire, and Carmarthenshire. The UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology has warned river flows are set to remain exceptionally low in central, southern and eastern England until October. River Action founder Charles Watson called for the government to act to prevent an ""ecological emergency"", warning that if river flows slowed down the ecology of rivers could be killed and the concentration of pollution in them would increase. Christine Farnish, a former board member of water regulator Ofwat, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme water companies ""need to get their houses in order"" over leakage and said they had been ""very slow"" to wake up to the realities of climate change. But Water UK's director of policy Stuart Colville said Ofwat figures showed companies were at the lowest ever levels of leakage on record and said the industry was doing ""everything we can"" to avoid restrictions on water use. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? The National Trust haswarned that bats, lichen and stately gardens have been hit hard by the hot summer weather, with its climate change adviser describing the impact as ""stark"".

The Garden of France withers in worst drought Wildlife under stress as dry spell shrinks rivers Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Dan Rudman said temperatures would be ""rising day-on-day through this week"" and were expected to peak at 35C on Friday and Saturday in some areas. Any showers would be to the far north-west of the UK and would be short-lived in nature, he said, adding there would be ""no relief for parched land"" in the south. A dried up lake in Wanstead Park, north-east London A heatwave is defined as above average temperatures being reached for three days or more. Heatwaves are becomingmore likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. We are living in the hottest period for 125,000 years, according to the UN's climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. How is the hot weather affecting you?

Birmingham 2022 gives Scotland platform to build on,"Eilish McColgan emulated her mother Liz by winning gold for Scotland in the 10,000m In the city of the bull, they boasted these would be the biggest and best Commonwealth Games ever. A claim that most host cities make to attract athletes and crowds alike. In fairness, save a few exceptions, most cities can usually back it up after the bandwagon has packed up and rolled out of town. In the build up to these Games, Team Scotland decided against bold predictions of their own. Gold Coast in 2018 was the country's most successful Games on non Scottish soil. A total of 44 medals were won - nine of those were gold. Scotland reach 51 medals at Commonwealth Games Scotland at Birmingham 2022 - the games in review Behind the scenes, in the build up to Birmingham, few were talking about that being bettered in the West Midlands. It's fair to assume then that even those who picked the team, would have been more than pleasantly surprised to see a final medal tally of 51, which included 13 golds. The counting of medals mid Games is part of the Commonwealth experience. Organisers, fans, journalists and athletes look for the medal table come close of play on any given day. Ross Murdoch won three bronze medals in the pool If it's going well, the spectators get the feel-good factor, the journalists get their copy and those competing lap up the bragging rights and pride. But the final medal table can also be looked upon as a snapshot of a nation's sporting competence. It can be used to take the temperature of a country's relationship with certain sports. The results suspended in time and used as a tool in the fight for more funding or to show why investment is working and should continue. These are the battles that will now play out away from the field of play in the coming months. Conversations will take place between governing bodies, Sportscotland and the Scottish government to see how best to build on what has been achieved. To make sure, for the right reasons, that success can breed success. Dumfries pensioner Rosemary Lenton became the Commonwealth Games' oldest gold medallist with her triumph in Para women's pairs bowls. Ministers will be reminded of the commitment to double the budget for sport during this parliament. At a time when money has rarely been tighter, it can seem like a big sell. Why then should sport ask for more during such troubled financial times? What can't be measured in the way sporting achievements can, is the impact on the psyche of a nation. Games like Birmingham 2022 provide people with sporting memories that will live on. Scotland won't quickly forgetEilish McColgan storming home to take gold in the 10,000 metresand stepping out from the shadow of her mother, Liz, who did the same over three decades ago. The words of swimmer Ross Murdoch after his last racewill resonate with those who have struggled with sport and beyond. And athletes like 49-year-oldcyclist Aileen McGlynnand72-year-old bowler Rosemary Lentonreminded us all that if you work hard enough, for long enough, the rewards can be there. Scotland's Samantha Kinghorn celebrates after winning bronze in the women's T53/54 1500m The integrated nature of the para sports is also one of the selling points of the Commonwealth Games. A reminder that those who cheer on able-bodied athletes are just as willing to do the same for those with disabilities. Sometimes sport struggles to be heard, or even taken seriously, in the wider context of what we are told is happening in the world around us. But, despite concerns over the future relevance of an event that was born of Britain's colonial past, Birmingham 2022 once again showed the power of sport to bring people together, to celebrate life and to inspire. Few things have the ability to unite just when unity is needed. Organisers will use what was witnessed in the West Midlands to argue this event has a future. Team Scotland will use what they achieved to build a more successful one.

Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake dies,"Issey Miyake at a catwalk show in Paris in 1997 Revolutionary Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake has died aged 84, his company has announced. Known for his innovative styles and perfume, Miyake built a global fashion brand, which included designing Steve Jobs' famous black turtle neck jumpers. Miyake was known to work with traditional and modern fashion techniques during his long career. He died of liver cancer on Friday, and a private funeral has already taken place, Japanese media report. Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake was just seven years old when the city was devastated by an atomic bomb dropped by the United States. His mother died of radiation exposure three years later. ""When I close my eyes, I still see things no one should ever experience,"" he wrote in aNew York Times opinion piece in 2009,external- adding that he prefers to think of things ""that can be created, not destroyed, and that bring beauty and joy"". Issey Miyake: His fashion in pictures Miyake reportedly wanted to be a dancer or athlete when he was young - but that changed after he read his sister's fashion magazines. He studied graphic design at a Tokyo art university and then moved to Paris in the 1960s, where he worked with lauded fashion designers Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy. He moved to New York for a short time, before heading back to Tokyo in 1970 to open the Miyake Design Studio. By the 1980s he was celebrated as one of the world's most pioneering designers as he worked with materials from plastic to metal - and also traditional Japanese material and paper. The Pleats, Please line on the catwalk in Paris in 1995 Miyake developed a new way of pleating fabric by wrapping it between layers of paper in a heat press. It was a phenomenal success - various tests proved the pleats stayed in place and didn't wrinkle, and it lead to his signature line called Pleats, Please. Miyake's distinctive Bao Bao line of bags, recognisable for their small resin triangles, was celebrated for its engineering and was so popular that knock-offs flooded the fake designer market. He became known for creating a style that was high-tech yet practical and comfortable, and was a household name in not only Japan's fashion industry - but on the global catwalk. His fashion house developed highly sought-after clothes for men and women, as well as bags, watches and perfumes - a bottle of L'Eau d'Issey, launched in 1992, was rumoured to sell every 14 seconds. HisA-POC (A Piece of Clothing) line,external, which can now be seen in museums, used a special weaving machine that made outfits out of one continuous tube of fabric. The distinctive Bao Bao bag Miyake was asked by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs to design his iconic turtle neck jumpers and reportedly made 100 of them, at $175 each. He was awarded the prestigious Kyoto Prize for his dedication to the arts in 2006, and received the Order of Culture in 2010 for ""remarkable accomplishments"" in Japan's culture and arts. ""Design needs to express hope,"" Issey Miyake famously said, as he believed in the role of fashion in questioning how humans should exist - instead of making money. For people here, he is one of a few Japanese names which get recognised around the world, along with Yoko Ono. Not many will know about his traumatic childhood, as Miyake himself didn't talk about it until his later years. It was because, he wrote in 2009, he didn't want to be known as ""the designer who survived the atomic bomb"". Miyake may have chosen not to talk about it for a long time, but Japan's revolutionary designer left us one day before the 77th anniversary of his hometown's bombing.

former President Donald Trumpâs Florida home   President Joe Biden was not given a 'heads up' about the FBI's search on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home, says White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. This video can not be played Trump home search: Biden not given a 'heads up' - White House A former FBI special agent has told CNN the Trump investigation shows there is a ""national security threat"". Asha Rangappa says the former president is ""a counter-intelligence nightmare"". She says the large number of visitors to Mar-a-Lago could make it very dangerous if classified documents had been kept there. I think it's important to underscore that because these involve classified documents, this is a national security investigation.  There's an ongoing national security threat. You can imagine the kinds of secrets that make their way to the White House, specifically to the desk of the president.  They can be a threat to our national security, they can get sources killed, they can compromise sources of information that we have if they get into the wrong hands."" Asha Rangappa, Former FBI special agent New York Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has suggested that the FBI carrying out a search warrant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago property is something that could happen to ordinary Americans. ""If the FBI can raid a US president, imagine what they can do to you,"" she wrote on Twitter. Stefanik is one of a number of Republican opponents of the Biden administration who have vowed to investigate the Justice Department if the Republicans take control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections.

Supporters of Donald Trump have been speaking to the BBC's Chi Chi Izundu in Florida about the search of his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach.

This video can not be played The FBI is doing a political hit job on Trump - ex-president's supporters say Michelle FleuryReporting from Bedminster, New Jersey The entrance to Donald Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey A day after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Donald Trump has gone to his summer residence in Bedminster, New Jersey. Security at the golf course, accessible via a country road which takes you past several farms, was tight â with some VIP guests expected later today.The former president is to meet with about a dozen House Republicans, a day after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Florida home. The former president will dine with members of the House Republican Study Committee, a conservative caucus group, today at his golf club in Bedminster New Jersey. The dinner had been in the works for weeks but has now taken on an air of soldiers rallying around their general. In a show of solidarity, several Republicans have condemned the investigation and pledged to investigate the Department of Justice if elected in Novemberâs midterm elections. The approach to Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey Nobody at the White House was briefed about or aware of the search warrant carried out at Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate, according to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Jean-Pierre said that President Biden's staff learned of the search through ""public reports"". Despite repeated questions from the gathered press corps, Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the raid and referred questions to the Justice Department. ""The Justice Department conducts investigations independently and we leave any law enforcement matters to them,"" she said. While she declined to comment on what President Biden thinks of the search, she said that he has been ""unequivocal"" in his belief in the rule of law.

Mick Mulvaney acted as Donald Trump's chief of staff from January 2019 until March 2020 Mick Mulvaney, Donald Trump's former Chief of Staff, says the FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago home - where he reportedly took government documents when he left office - is either ""the most egregious political hit job in history or part of the most significant criminal investigation in our history"". Speaking to the BBC, Mulvaney says that during his time at the White House, he was in charge of running the West Wing where he ensured documents were preserved. ""When the law says you have to preserve everything, that's everything - a scratch pad, a newspaper the president had seen, it could be something very serious or something trivial, such as a menu with Boris Johnson, for example,"" he says. ""If that's all they're looking for, technical violations of the law, then this is a tremendous overreach by the department of justice (DoJ). ""If on the other hand, it's somehow tied to a very serious charge of trying to interfere with the transition of authority to the Biden administration, and if the DoJ thinks there might be documents the president retained at Mar-a-Lago that speak to say, conversations with the right wing extremists  and the rioters, then that's very serious."" He said ""complete incompetence"" could explain why Donald Trump reportedly took so many documents from the White House when his presidency ended. ""Is it possible there's something in that stack that is very damning to the president? Yes there is. And if there is, I hope that's what the DoJ was looking for.""

Aronberg says his office had no prior warning about the FBI's search of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. He says such secrecy is normal for ""the Feds"", especially when it involves ""something so sensitive"", such as searching the home of a former president. He pushes back against claims the search was politically motivated. Aronberg thinks the judge who granted the search warrant will have scrutinised it more than ""any other in history"" due to the request being so unprecedented. The FBI carried out a warranted search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's a look at the key developments in the FBI search on former President Donald Trumpâs Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. Christopher Wray was appointed as FBI Director in 2017 The FBIâs search of Donald Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago home was kept
firmly under wraps until Trump himself announced it to the world. Even President Joe Biden was given no notice of it
happening, a senior White House official told CBS. So who did know about it? The FBI reports to the US Attorney General, the nationâs top
lawyer, and its activities are overseen by the Director of National
Intelligence. The bureau does not report directly to the White House. Any search warrant like this has to be signed off by a
judge. To do so, investigators must demonstrate that there is probable cause for the search, which essentially boils down to whether it is reasonable to believe that a crime has been or is being committed. But given the explosive ramifications of this search in particular, many political analysts believe the approval would have had to come from the highest level. That would likely include FBI Director Christopher Wray â
who was appointed by Trump when he was president â and also his boss, the
current attorney general Merrick Garland. Supporters and opponents of Donald Trump have held up placards and banners outside Trump Tower in New York. The building on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue serves as the headquarters for the Trump Organization. This video can not be played People have gathered at Trump Tower following the FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago Mike Pence at an event on 3 August Former US Vice President Mike Pence has called on US Attorney General Merrick Garland to give a ""a full accounting"" to the public of why the search warrant was carried out at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. In aseries of Tweets,,externalPence - who has distanced himself from Trump amid speculation he may launch a 2024 presidential run - said that he shares ""a deep concern"" over the ""unprecedented"" search of Trump's property. ""No former President of the United States has ever been subject to a raid of their personal residence in American history,"" he wrote. Additionally, Pence said that the search ""undermines public confidence in our system of justice."" ""Attorney General [Merrick] Garland must give a full accounting to the American people as to why this action was taken and he must do so immediately,"" he added. The lead Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee has called for the director of the FBI to give an ""immediate briefing"" about the information that led to the search warrant conducted at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. In a letter directed to FBI Director Christopher Wray,Rep. Mike Turner,externalcalled the search warrant ""unprecedented"" in US history. Turner also said that as the committee's ranking member, he is ""unaware of any actual or alleged national security threat posed by any information, data, or documents in the possession of former President Trump"". ""Congress deserves immediate answers from you as to the actions you ordered,"" the letter adds. A former US Senator once considered a leading contender to be Joe Biden's attorney general has said that the US ""is not some banana republic"" that conducts searches without cause. In an interview with the BBC, ex-Alabama Senator Doug Jones  - a former US district attorney - said the search warrant on Donald Trump's property at Mar-a-Lago is a sign of the checks and balances that ""the constitution envisions"". ""This is not some banana republic where the government just breaks down the door and barges in,"" he said. ""This is a process that is set up in the constitution of the United States and it appears to be followed to the letter here."" Jones also said that despite mounting pressure on the justice department to be more ""forthcoming"" with any investigation into former President Trump, doing so would be ""inconsistent"" with departmental guidelines. ""I don't believe the Department of Justice will or should succumb to that pressure,"" he said. ""I think it would be a big mistake for the future of that department to break with that long-standing policy."" Chi Chi IzunduReporting from Mar-a-Lago About two dozen Trump supporters are protesting outside Trump's Florida residence Even though Donald Trump isnât here and Mar-a-Lago is closed during the summer months, about two dozen loyal supporters, in the blazing sun of West Palm Beach, have lined the state road outside the property, waving flags and carrying Trump 2020 banners. They've been taking the opportunity to tell the members of press camped here that we are reporting âfake newsâ. One man whispered as we walked past: âThis whole thing is crazy. Itâs all nonsense."" Support for the former president was also reflected by cars beeping their horns as they drove past. Justin, who lives up the road from the complex, was being stopped and asked whether the many flags he was carrying were for sale. âNo,â he replied, âjust supportâ. He called the execution of the FBI warrant âliesâ, while Adrienne, waving her American flag, encouraged âpeople with a voiceâ to show their support. Security guards were seen walking outside Mar-a-Lago today after the Florida home belonging to ex-President Trump was searched by the FBI Guards were also seen patrolling the perimeter of the residence in Palm Beach Some Trump supporters gathered outside to show their support to the former president Supporters of Donald Trump are speaking up today, with many backing the former president's assertion that Monday's FBI search is part of a Democrat strategy to stop him from running for office again in 2024. Among them is Republican strategist Seth Weathers, who calls the operation at Trump's Florida home ""truly, unbelievably outrageous"". Speaking to the BBC, Weathers says a precedent has been set that he thinks is ""going to be very hard to take back"". He claims the legal authorisation of the search warrant was politically motivated, and says the ""overreach"" from Joe Biden's administration has reached levels ""I don't think many people thought would happen"". President Biden has tried to distance himself from the justice department, and a White House official has said he was given no advanced notice of Mondays's FBI search. According to former US district attorney for Idaho, Wendy Olson, granting the FBI a search warrant would not be politically motivated. Olson says the warrant would have been subject to a ârigorous applicationâ, signed off and vetted by those at the âhighest levelsâ of the Department of Justice and the FBI - including the Trump-appointed FBI director Chris Wray. Reality Check The emails date back to when Hillary Clinton was US Secretary of State In Trump's statement about Monday's FBI search, he reacted angrily and compared his situation to that of his former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. âHillary Clinton was allowed to deleteâ¦ 33,000 emails after they were subpoenaed by Congress. Absolutely nothing has happened to hold her accountable,"" he claimed. This claim refers to an investigation into Clintonâs
use of a private email server for government business, which is against
official protocol. In March 2015, after sheâd
left office as secretary of state, the company that maintained her email server
deleted the archive mailbox, erasing about 32,000 emails, including
some from when she was in her official role. This happened after Congress had already asked Clinton to hand over any work-related emails. She did hand over thousands of
other emails, and said she believed the deleted emails were not
work-related. The FBI later investigated and found she was
âextremely carelessâ with government material. But it said
there was no evidence of collusion between her and the company that maintained
the server to improperly delete work-related emails, or that Clinton was âallowedâ to delete these emails as Trump suggests. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Grease co-stars lead tributes to Olivia Newton-JohnBest known for playing Sandy in Grease, the actor and singer has died from cancer aged 73.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Tributes have been paid from around the world to Olivia Newton-John, who has died from cancer aged 73. The British-born Australian singer and actress was best known for playing Sandy in Grease, one of the most successful film musicals ever made. Her Grease co-star John Travolta said she ""made all of our lives so much better"" while its director said: ""What you see is what you get with her."" She died peacefully at her California ranch surrounded by family and friends. An actress and musician, Newton-John achieved commercial success as a country singer and sold millions of records globally. But it was her role as high school student Sandy in the film Grease that catapulted her to worldwide fame. The musical was the biggest box-office hit of 1978, and gave Newton-John three huge hit singles, including You're The One That I Want and Summer Nights, both performed with co-star John Travolta. And it was a catalyst for change in both her image and her musical direction - shedding her innocent, country-pop image. Obituary: Olivia Newton-John Australia mourns a national sweetheart Following the news of her death, scores of fans, as well as famous figures from the world of entertainment, shared heartfelt messages and memories. Actress Stockard Channing - who played Rizzo in Grease - said: ""I don't know if I've known a lovelier human being. Newton-John soared to global fame playing girl-next-door Sandy in smash-hit musical Grease ""Olivia was the essence of summer - her sunniness, her warmth and her grace are what always come to mind when I think of her. I will miss her enormously."" Singer Rod Stewart called her ""the perfect lady, gorgeous, with great poise and with a certain Aussie sophistication"". ""Her spandex trousers in Grease were my inspiration for my 'Da ya think I'm Sexy' era,"" he added, referencing the iconic tight black outfit that she wore at the film's finale. US television host Oprah Winfrey said her ""positivity was just infectious"". ""You'll be missed, Olivia,"" she wrote. ""Here's to the good times."" Travoltawrote on Instagram:,external""Your impact was incredible. I love you so much. We will see you down the road and we will all be together again."" ""Yours from the first moment I saw you and forever!"" he added, signing off: ""Your Danny, your John!"" The film's director Randal Kleiser said he had been friends with Newton-John for 40 years and ""she never changed, she was always exactly the way everyone imagines her"". ""She was charming, lovely, warm... There are so many clichÃ©s you can say about her, but in her case it was all true."" Asked what his everlasting memory of her will be, he told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Hanging out with her at her ranch. Seeing the real Olivia which was exactly like the Olivia she projected. No cameras around, no people around... she was exactly the same and as loving as ever."" Didi Conn, who played Frenchy in Grease, told BBC's Newsnight: ""She was such a humungous, big, big pop star and her persona was of this beauty... pure and sweet. In the movie we would call her Miss Goody Two Shoes, you know,  but simmering under that faÃ§ade of innocence was a hot mama ready to come out."" Other tributes came from singers Kylie Minogue, who called her an inspiration, and Dionne Warwick, who called Newton-John ""one of the nicest people I had the pleasure of recording and performing with"". Australian rock legend John Farnham, a long-time friend and with whom Newton-John released her final studio album, said she would be ""greatly missed"" and ""behind that iconic smile was a tenacious fighter"". Olivia Moore, who is currently playing Sandy in Grease in London's West End, broke the news to a shocked audience at the end of Monday evening's performance. Allow Twitter content?

Newton-John was first diagnosed with cancer in 1992 and went on to become a leading advocate of cancer research. Her charity, the Olivia Newton-John Foundation, has raised millions of pounds to support research. In a statement, the hospital that runs the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne - which was opened after the star's campaigning - said she ""encouraged, inspired and supported"" staff and patients every day. ""We are incredibly grateful for the special relationship we had with Olivia for many years. Her generous support and gift provided hope and changed the lives of thousands of cancer patients... She was the light at the end of the tunnel for many, many people."" Her efforts in the field were recognised by the Queen, who honoured her with a damehood in the 2020 New Year's Honours list. In a statement posted to her social media channels, Newton-John's husband John Easterling said she had died on Monday, hailing her ""a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years, sharing her journey with breast cancer"". ""Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer."" In later years, Newton-John became a cancer campaigner which led to the opening of an institute named after her in Melbourne Newton-John was born in Cambridge on 26 September 1948. Her father had been a British spy during World War Two. Her mother was the daughter of the German Nobel laureate, Max Born, and had fled with her family when the Nazis came to power in 1933. The family moved to Australia in 1954, where she was raised. Her breakthrough came in 1971 when she released a Bob Dylan-penned track, If Not For You, which reached number seven in the UK charts and featured on an album of the same name. She won four Grammy awards and scored seven US number one hits between 1974 and 1977. While critics never warmed to her audience-friendly style of music, the star forthrightly dismissed the reviews. ""It annoys me when people think because it's commercial, it's bad,"" she told Rolling Stone. ""It's completely opposite. If people like it, that's what it's supposed to be."" In 1978 she became a global star with the release of Grease. The film, set in the 1950s, told the story of Sandy's summer fling with John Travolta's Danny and the difficulties the relationship encounters. In the end the pair reconcile, with Sandy having transformed her appearance. In 2019, after being diagnosed with breast cancer for the third time, she was asked by CBS News how she coped. ""It was consuming my day and after a time I went 'you know what', I need to enjoy my life so I'm going to eat a cookie if I want it,"" she said. ""Because the joy of life and everyday living has to be a part of that healing process as well. So I've chosen that path to be grateful and to feel good about things because the other side's not so good.""

Asha Rangappa says the former president is ""a counter-intelligence nightmare"". She says the large number of visitors to Mar-a-Lago could make it very dangerous if classified documents had been kept there. I think it's important to underscore that because these involve classified documents, this is a national security investigation.  There's an ongoing national security threat. You can imagine the kinds of secrets that make their way to the White House, specifically to the desk of the president.  They can be a threat to our national security, they can get sources killed, they can compromise sources of information that we have if they get into the wrong hands."" Asha Rangappa, Former FBI special agent New York Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has suggested that the FBI carrying out a search warrant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago property is something that could happen to ordinary Americans. ""If the FBI can raid a US president, imagine what they can do to you,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Security at the golf course, accessible via a country road which takes you past several farms, was tight â with some VIP guests expected later today.The former president is to meet with about a dozen House Republicans, a day after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Florida home. The former president will dine with members of the House Republican Study Committee, a conservative caucus group, today at his golf club in Bedminster New Jersey. The dinner had been in the works for weeks but has now taken on an air of soldiers rallying around their general. In a show of solidarity, several Republicans have condemned the investigation and pledged to investigate the Department of Justice if elected in Novemberâs midterm elections. The approach to Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey Nobody at the White House was briefed about or aware of the search warrant carried out at Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate, according to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

This excludes more than 2,500 who are complex cases or chose not to travel for speedier treatment. NHS England said it had achieved the first milestone in its plan to eliminate backlogs caused by Covid. But a record 6.6 million people are still waiting for hospital treatment. Health experts say there is still a mountain to climb to reduce the number - currently about 400,000 - waiting more than a year. And winter will probably bring more delays and pressure. Eliminating 18-month waits - currently affecting about 50,000 - by April 2023 is next on the government's agenda. The numbers of people waiting a long time for routine hospital treatment have soared during the past two years throughout the UK, as operations were cancelled to free up beds for Covid patients. The situation pushed people intoborrowing thousands of pounds for private treatment. To reduce the backlog,patients have been offered travel and accommodation coststo be treated in an alternative part of the country. In England, large numbers have been sent to private hospitals for surgical procedures, while community diagnostic centres have been set up to deliver thousands of checks and scans. NHS England promised to ""virtually eradicate"" the list of people waiting more than two years for treatment, by the end of July. It has now shrunk to 168 patients, who mostly live in the South West - the area worst affected by Covid staff absences and pressure on the health service. Consultant Gavin Jennings says his hospital has been innovative in the way it has treated extra patients to bring down waiting lists Sulis Hospital Bath has been treating patients from seven local hospitals in the region - more than 1,100 extra patients since September. Extended theatre times, an temporary operating theatre and close relationships with the local trust have all helped to increase the numbers. And the private hospital, now owned by a local NHS trust, plans to take more people from greater distances, for a wide variety of orthopaedic surgery and eye procedures. ""It's been a lot of hard work,"" clinical director and consultant Gavin Jennings said. The Omicron Covid variant, first identified in South Africa, had hit the hospital quite hard, he said, affecting staffing levels and causing operations to be cancelled. ""As a result of people waiting longer than usual, some of those cases are now more complex and symptoms may have become worse,"" Mr Jennings said. ""That's why there's a need to recover from Covid quickly."" In addition to the 22,500 people waiting two years or more at the start of the year, a further 43,500 who would have waited more than two years by the end of July had also been treated, NHS England said. More than 6.6 million people are still waiting for scans, procedures or operations NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the health service had continued to reform the way it delivered care, ""using innovate techniques and adopting pioneering technology, like robot surgery"". But there are now warnings of high demand on other services. Saffron Cordery, the interim chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts, told the BBC: ""There is a long way to go with mental health, community and hospital care backlogs, and to relieve pressure on ambulance services."" Cutting cancer diagnosis waiting times and eliminating 78-week waits was now a priority, she said, adding that progress could be ""put at risk"" if the government did not increase investment in the NHS. Regarding potential strikes by nurses over pay, Ms Cordery said: ""Nobody wants to see industrial action, but what we have to remember is that we have a workforce that has been working flat-out for the past two-and-a-half years, and is now being asked to go the extra mile again to get these waiting lists down."" Nigel Edwards, chief executive of The Nuffield Trust independent health think tank, said: ""This is a good achievement - but like getting to base camp, there's quite a mountain to climb in terms of people waiting over a year... and over 78 weeks, which are much bigger numbers than the figure for two-year waits."" Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: ""We are working hard with the NHS to get our health system back to peak performance, by growing the healthcare workforce, opening new community diagnostic centres and surgical hubs across the country, and investing in innovative technology to ensure patients can access the treatment they need while saving staff time."" Elsewhere in the UK, work continues to try to reduce the longest waiting times. In Wales, the number of patients waiting the longest has been reducing for the past two months, due to more staff and equipment and new facilities, the Welsh government said. In Scotland, more than 10,000 people were waiting more than two years in June, compared with 648 the year before. A Scottish government spokesperson said they had introduced new targets to address the backlog and ""increased the flexibility health boards and clinicians have to manage waiting lists, with a focus on eliminating long waits, as well as continuing to treat the most clinically urgent patients"". Travel-for-surgery offer to cut long waits 'Please ask the ambulance to hurry or I'll be dead' Hospital waiting list at 6.5 million in England Gynaecology waits soar by 60% during pandemic NHS waiting-list backlog will take years to clear Plan to tackle England's NHS backlog delayed 4.7 million waiting for operations in England Two-year waits for NHS treatment unacceptable - FM A&E and ambulance performance worst ever - again Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you What happens if TikTok is banned?

"Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake diesThe revolutionary designer died of liver cancer in Tokyo aged 84, his company said in a statement.","Issey Miyake at a catwalk show in Paris in 1997 Revolutionary Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake has died aged 84, his company has announced. Known for his innovative styles and perfume, Miyake built a global fashion brand, which included designing Steve Jobs' famous black turtle neck jumpers. Miyake was known to work with traditional and modern fashion techniques during his long career. He died of liver cancer on Friday, and a private funeral has already taken place, Japanese media report. Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake was just seven years old when the city was devastated by an atomic bomb dropped by the United States. His mother died of radiation exposure three years later. ""When I close my eyes, I still see things no one should ever experience,"" he wrote in aNew York Times opinion piece in 2009,external- adding that he prefers to think of things ""that can be created, not destroyed, and that bring beauty and joy"". Issey Miyake: His fashion in pictures Miyake reportedly wanted to be a dancer or athlete when he was young - but that changed after he read his sister's fashion magazines. He studied graphic design at a Tokyo art university and then moved to Paris in the 1960s, where he worked with lauded fashion designers Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy. He moved to New York for a short time, before heading back to Tokyo in 1970 to open the Miyake Design Studio. By the 1980s he was celebrated as one of the world's most pioneering designers as he worked with materials from plastic to metal - and also traditional Japanese material and paper. The Pleats, Please line on the catwalk in Paris in 1995 Miyake developed a new way of pleating fabric by wrapping it between layers of paper in a heat press. It was a phenomenal success - various tests proved the pleats stayed in place and didn't wrinkle, and it lead to his signature line called Pleats, Please. Miyake's distinctive Bao Bao line of bags, recognisable for their small resin triangles, was celebrated for its engineering and was so popular that knock-offs flooded the fake designer market. He became known for creating a style that was high-tech yet practical and comfortable, and was a household name in not only Japan's fashion industry - but on the global catwalk. His fashion house developed highly sought-after clothes for men and women, as well as bags, watches and perfumes - a bottle of L'Eau d'Issey, launched in 1992, was rumoured to sell every 14 seconds. HisA-POC (A Piece of Clothing) line,external, which can now be seen in museums, used a special weaving machine that made outfits out of one continuous tube of fabric. The distinctive Bao Bao bag Miyake was asked by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs to design his iconic turtle neck jumpers and reportedly made 100 of them, at $175 each. He was awarded the prestigious Kyoto Prize for his dedication to the arts in 2006, and received the Order of Culture in 2010 for ""remarkable accomplishments"" in Japan's culture and arts. ""Design needs to express hope,"" Issey Miyake famously said, as he believed in the role of fashion in questioning how humans should exist - instead of making money. For people here, he is one of a few Japanese names which get recognised around the world, along with Yoko Ono. Not many will know about his traumatic childhood, as Miyake himself didn't talk about it until his later years. It was because, he wrote in 2009, he didn't want to be known as ""the designer who survived the atomic bomb"". Miyake may have chosen not to talk about it for a long time, but Japan's revolutionary designer left us one day before the 77th anniversary of his hometown's bombing.

"Warning energy prices to hit over Â£4,200 in January","Energy bills for a typical household could hit Â£4,266 next year, consultancy Cornwall Insight has warned. The higher estimate means the average household would be paying Â£355 a month, instead of Â£164 a month currently. Cornwall cited regulator Ofgem's decisionto change the price cap every three months instead of six and higher wholesale prices for its high forecast. But Ofgem said no forecast for next year could be ""robust"" at this stage and had ""limited value"". The latest price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers for average energy usagein England, Scotland and Wales for October - is due to be announced at the end of this month. Cornwall expects this to rise to Â£3,582 a year, compared to theregulator's prediction of Â£2,800 a year. Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall, said its price cap forecasts had been steadily rising but the big jump was ""a fresh shock"". The energy bill warning comes asthe government rejected calls for further helpon energy bills until a new prime minister was in place. The CBI business lobby group said it ""made no sense to wait"" for a new Conservative party leader. What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill? Regulator Ofgem warned wholesale prices were moving so quickly that future forecasts were not reliable. ""We cannot stop others from making predictions, but we would ask that extreme caution is applied to any predictions for the price cap in January or beyond."" Earlier this month, the government announced how households in England, Scotland and Waleswill receive Â£400 to help with rising fuel bills this autumn, with the money paid in six instalments. But Dr Lowrey called on the government to use the latest predictions of higher bills to review the support package. ""If the Â£400 was not enough to make a dent in the impact of our previous forecast, it most certainly is not enough now. ""The government must make introducing more support over the first two quarters of 2023 a number-one priority."" Hannah Absalom has been stocking up on thermal clothing ahead of winter. Hannah Absalom, a PHD student in Birmingham, lives on Â£850 per month in a one-bed flat and has spent Â£80 already on thermal clothing and a heated blanket so she can avoid heating her home in winter. ""I'm doing everything I can but there's not enough support. I'll more than likely end up in debt, or eat into my buffer savings - saved for getting a job,"" she says. Supermarket head office worker Stuart Lane, 47, who lives in Buckinghamshire with his wife and their three children, currently pays Â£100 a month for a fixed price deal. but that ends in September. ""When I looked at getting a new deal, the only fixed prices was pushing up to Â£420. We will be having to look at our outgoings,"" he says. Sylvia Simpson, chief executive at debt help charity Money Buddies in Leeds, told the BBC there were limited options for helping people with soaring energy bills: ""The tools that we used to have before, for example, for switching utility providers to get the best deal - that has gone now. There is no switching to get the best deal anymore. ""People are really, really struggling."" Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has said he would provide more money to help people with their energy bills, if he becomes prime minister. His rival for the leadership, Liz Truss, has pledged tax cuts to help people hit by cost of living increases. ButLiberal Democrat Leader Ed Daveyhas suggested that the government should scrap the energy price cap rise in October, which he said would save the typical household Â£1,400 this year. Mr Davey said the cost of the plan - which the party puts at nearly Â£36bn - could be funded through backdating the windfall tax on oil and gas companies' profits. Dr Lowry said that without the more frequent changes to the price cap, more energy suppliers might be in danger of collapse - though he questioned whether it should exist at all. ""If it is not controlling consumer prices, and is damaging suppliers' business models, we must wonder if it is fit for purpose - especially in these times of unprecedented energy market conditions,"" he said. However, if wholesale prices remain at current rates, it expects lower bills in the second half of next year than it had previously forecast. The energy price cap sets a limit on the amount that can be paid for each unit of energy. It is based on the price energy suppliers pay producers for electricity and gas. This has risen sharply, fuelled by the war in Ukraine whichhas threatened supplies from Russia. Many families are already facing soaring costs, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices are rising -at the highest in 40 years. The Don't Pay group, which is demanding bills be reduced to to an affordable level, says tens of thousands of people have pledged to cancel their direct debit payments from 1 October. However, charities have said not paying energy bills has very serious consequences for consumers, including being threatened with disconnection and damage to their credit rating. Householders who are struggling to meet their bill payments are advisedto contact their suppliers to come up with a payment plan. The warning comes as the government dismissed reports of disruption to energy supplies, following reports that plans for a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" included organised blackouts for firms and households. A source told the BBC that such scenarios are ""made up"" and ""extreme"" so that the government's response can be tested. Predictions of January energy bills were already sending shivers down spines, as the wholesale prices suppliers have to pay spiked due a fear of Russia withholding gas supplies. But it's partly a technical tweak that's caused those estimates to jump by another 10% in just a few days. At present, suppliers are often having to buy energy at a higher price to meet the needs of customers. But those customers, under the cap, may be paying a lower tariff. The regulator, under new plans, is allowing suppliers to recoup those extra costs from customers over the space of six months, a shorter period than previously thought. It's not just about protecting profits; 28 suppliers have already folded in the last couple of years, leaving customers to pick up a tab Â£2.7bn, nearly Â£100 per household, due to their failures. On top of that, over Â£1bn of taxpayer funds are expected to be needed to deal with the largest collapse, that of Bulb. The idea is to protect customers from the cost of future failures. But in the short term, it could mean devastating choices in the depths of winter. And the extra help currently on offer from both Tory leadership hopefuls is unlikely to offset even the increase in the estimate unveiled today.

What we learned from Trump's return to Washington,"For the first time since he broke with tradition and left town before Joe Biden's presidential inauguration in January 2021, Donald Trump has returned to Washington DC. In an address before Republican members of Congress and former administration officials at the America First Policy Institute summit, the former president set out what he believes should be the focus of the Republican party if they gain control of Congress in November and the presidency in 2024. So, what did we learn? Mr Trump led with a seven-part plan for cracking down on what he said was rampant crime in cities across the US. Some of the proposals were familiar, such as increasing liability protection for police officers, more funding for law enforcement and a return to stop-and-frisk policies that allow impromptu warrantless searches of suspects. Others were somewhat new. He again called for the death penalty for drug dealers, but added praise for the ""quick trials"" that authoritarian countries like China use to combat the narcotics trade. He suggested construction of government-run tent compounds outside of urban areas to rehabilitate homeless people so that American cities could again be ""clean, safe and beautiful"". He also called for the presidential authority to deploy National Guard soldiers to fight crime in cities without a local governor's permission - harkening back to the clashes between the president and Democratic governors over whether to use US military forces during the sometimes violent Black Lives Matters protests in 2020. The former president has always leaned into tough-on-crime rhetoric, but it's ironic that perhaps the biggest bipartisan policy achievement of his term in office was criminal justice reform, which granted thousands of prison inmates early release and revised federal sentencing guidelines. The first half of the former president's speech focused on crime, and as he ticked through his seven-part policy outline his delivery was monotone, almost as though he were bored by his own words.  This was set-piece Trump, not the unscripted Trump from his raucous rallies. Then he complained about how transgender athletes were allowed to compete in women's sports, and the audience gave him one of the largest cheers of the afternoon. Mr Trump came to life. ""Sir, don't say that, it's very controversial,"" he said his advisers had told him about that line. ""It's not written down anywhere, I just said it."" And it was off to the races. Mr Trump said he wanted to start a women's basketball team with NBA star LeBron James on it. He railed against Biden's immigration policies. He complained about the ""China virus"" and claimed that as president he had done the opposite of whatever federal infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci had recommended. This was Mr Trump in his natural habitat, free to go wherever his mind took him. After listing a number of other policy prescriptions - stopping inflation, protecting parents' rights, making it easier to fire high-level federal employees, restoring free speech, bringing back manufacturing jobs and welfare reform - Mr Trump ventured back to a favourite pastime: complaining about the 2020 election results. ""I won a second time, did much better the second time,"" he said of his 2020 re-election effort. ""Did a lot better. Very corrupt. We got millions, millions more votes. That's going to be a story for a long time, what a disgrace it was."" He groused that he was the ""most persecuted president ever"". He complained about his twin impeachments and the ongoing 6 January committee hearings. He defended his supporters who marched to the Capitol before its attack, saying many were being unfairly prosecuted and ""tortured and handled so horribly"". ""Something is going to have to happen,"" he said. ""People are not going to take it much longer."" Earlier in the day, Mike Pence - Mr Trump's 2020 running mate - also gave a speech in Washington. When asked about whether there was a division within the Republican party, and whether he was attempting to draw distinctions between himself and his former boss, the former vice-president demurred. ""I don't know that our movement is that divided,"" he said. ""I don't know that the president and I differ on issues. But we may differ on focus. I truly do believe that elections are about the future. And it is absolutely essential at a time when so many Americans are hurting, so many families are struggling, that we don't give way to the temptation to look back."" Clearly Mr Pence, who has 2024 ambitions of his own, sees Mr Trump's continued fixation with his election defeat as an opportunity. ""Let's focus on the future"" is a line he has repeated multiple times and in multiple ways as he has travelled the country, laying the groundwork for a potential presidential bid. But if the former vice-president wants the White House in 2024, his path may have to go through his former boss, who once again hinted on Tuesday that his career in politics may not be over. ""We may just have to do it again,"" Mr Trump said of running for president. ""We have to straighten out our country."" At one point, the crowd chanted ""four more years"". The former president thanked them, adding that if he quit politics his enemies would leave him alone. ""But that's not what I do,"" he said. ""I can't do that because I love our country, and I can't do that because I love the people of our country."" In other words, stay tuned.

"Warning energy prices to hit over Â£4,200 in JanuaryConsultancy Cornwall Insight now forecasts a typical household will pay Â£4,266 a year for energy,Business","Energy bills for a typical household could hit Â£4,266 next year, consultancy Cornwall Insight has warned. The higher estimate means the average household would be paying Â£355 a month, instead of Â£164 a month currently. Cornwall cited regulator Ofgem's decisionto change the price cap every three months instead of six and higher wholesale prices for its high forecast. But Ofgem said no forecast for next year could be ""robust"" at this stage and had ""limited value"". The latest price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers for average energy usagein England, Scotland and Wales for October - is due to be announced at the end of this month. Cornwall expects this to rise to Â£3,582 a year, compared to theregulator's prediction of Â£2,800 a year. Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall, said its price cap forecasts had been steadily rising but the big jump was ""a fresh shock"". The energy bill warning comes asthe government rejected calls for further helpon energy bills until a new prime minister was in place. The CBI business lobby group said it ""made no sense to wait"" for a new Conservative party leader. What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill? Regulator Ofgem warned wholesale prices were moving so quickly that future forecasts were not reliable. ""We cannot stop others from making predictions, but we would ask that extreme caution is applied to any predictions for the price cap in January or beyond."" Earlier this month, the government announced how households in England, Scotland and Waleswill receive Â£400 to help with rising fuel bills this autumn, with the money paid in six instalments.

"Backlog of longest-wait patients slashed in EnglandThousands waiting more than two years for scans, checks and surgery have finally been treated.Health","People waiting longer than two years were offered treatment further from home to speed up their care The number of people waiting longer than two years for routine operations in England has fallen from 22,500 at the start of the year, to fewer than 200, according to NHS figures. This excludes more than 2,500 who are complex cases or chose not to travel for speedier treatment. NHS England said it had achieved the first milestone in its plan to eliminate backlogs caused by Covid. But a record 6.6 million people are still waiting for hospital treatment. Health experts say there is still a mountain to climb to reduce the number - currently about 400,000 - waiting more than a year. And winter will probably bring more delays and pressure. Eliminating 18-month waits - currently affecting about 50,000 - by April 2023 is next on the government's agenda. The numbers of people waiting a long time for routine hospital treatment have soared during the past two years throughout the UK, as operations were cancelled to free up beds for Covid patients. The situation pushed people intoborrowing thousands of pounds for private treatment. To reduce the backlog,patients have been offered travel and accommodation coststo be treated in an alternative part of the country. In England, large numbers have been sent to private hospitals for surgical procedures, while community diagnostic centres have been set up to deliver thousands of checks and scans. NHS England promised to ""virtually eradicate"" the list of people waiting more than two years for treatment, by the end of July. It has now shrunk to 168 patients, who mostly live in the South West - the area worst affected by Covid staff absences and pressure on the health service. Consultant Gavin Jennings says his hospital has been innovative in the way it has treated extra patients to bring down waiting lists Sulis Hospital Bath has been treating patients from seven local hospitals in the region - more than 1,100 extra patients since September. Extended theatre times, an temporary operating theatre and close relationships with the local trust have all helped to increase the numbers. And the private hospital, now owned by a local NHS trust, plans to take more people from greater distances, for a wide variety of orthopaedic surgery and eye procedures. ""It's been a lot of hard work,"" clinical director and consultant Gavin Jennings said. The Omicron Covid variant, first identified in South Africa, had hit the hospital quite hard, he said, affecting staffing levels and causing operations to be cancelled. ""As a result of people waiting longer than usual, some of those cases are now more complex and symptoms may have become worse,"" Mr Jennings said. ""That's why there's a need to recover from Covid quickly."" In addition to the 22,500 people waiting two years or more at the start of the year, a further 43,500 who would have waited more than two years by the end of July had also been treated, NHS England said. More than 6.6 million people are still waiting for scans, procedures or operations NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the health service had continued to reform the way it delivered care, ""using innovate techniques and adopting pioneering technology, like robot surgery"". But there are now warnings of high demand on other services. Saffron Cordery, the interim chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts, told the BBC: ""There is a long way to go with mental health, community and hospital care backlogs, and to relieve pressure on ambulance services."" Cutting cancer diagnosis waiting times and eliminating 78-week waits was now a priority, she said, adding that progress could be ""put at risk"" if the government did not increase investment in the NHS. Regarding potential strikes by nurses over pay, Ms Cordery said: ""Nobody wants to see industrial action, but what we have to remember is that we have a workforce that has been working flat-out for the past two-and-a-half years, and is now being asked to go the extra mile again to get these waiting lists down."" Nigel Edwards, chief executive of The Nuffield Trust independent health think tank, said: ""This is a good achievement - but like getting to base camp, there's quite a mountain to climb in terms of people waiting over a year... and over 78 weeks, which are much bigger numbers than the figure for two-year waits."" Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: ""We are working hard with the NHS to get our health system back to peak performance, by growing the healthcare workforce, opening new community diagnostic centres and surgical hubs across the country, and investing in innovative technology to ensure patients can access the treatment they need while saving staff time."" Elsewhere in the UK, work continues to try to reduce the longest waiting times. In Wales, the number of patients waiting the longest has been reducing for the past two months, due to more staff and equipment and new facilities, the Welsh government said. In Scotland, more than 10,000 people were waiting more than two years in June, compared with 648 the year before. A Scottish government spokesperson said they had introduced new targets to address the backlog and ""increased the flexibility health boards and clinicians have to manage waiting lists, with a focus on eliminating long waits, as well as continuing to treat the most clinically urgent patients"". Travel-for-surgery offer to cut long waits 'Please ask the ambulance to hurry or I'll be dead' Hospital waiting list at 6.5 million in England Gynaecology waits soar by 60% during pandemic NHS waiting-list backlog will take years to clear Plan to tackle England's NHS backlog delayed 4.7 million waiting for operations in England Two-year waits for NHS treatment unacceptable - FM A&E and ambulance performance worst ever - again Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you What happens if TikTok is banned?

Child deaths expose mental health unit pressures,"Chelsea Mooney died aged 17 following a self-harm incident in a unit in Sheffield Deaths, staff shortages and a culture of life-threatening self-harm are exposing deep fears about the quality of mental health care in hospitals for children and young people. Since 2019, at least 20 patients aged 18 or under have died in NHS or privately-run units, the BBC has found. A further 26 have died within a year of leaving units, amid claims of a lack of ongoing community support. The NHS said it had ""invested record amounts"" in response to record demand. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) units look after about 4,000 patients with many different diagnoses each year. The aim is to help them recover over a period of weeks or months through specialist care. Some patients are in and out of the units for years. The BBC's data requests found 18 of the deaths in Camhs wards since 2019 were in England. Fourteen were in NHS-run wards, and four in privately-run units. There was one death in Scotland, and one in Northern Ireland. Previously, the charity Inquest said data they had obtained showed there had been at least nine deaths in Camhs wards in England and Wales between 2010 and 2014. The BBC has also heard serious claims regarding the unsafe discharge of patients sent home from Camhs hospitals. Several former patients told the BBC they had serious self-harm incidents or tried to take their own life within days of returning home. Parents have described being on ""suicide watch"" 24 hours a day, to ensure their child's safety. At least 26 patients in the UK have died within 12 months of being discharged since 2019, figures obtained from NHS Trusts show. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, editor in chief of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, said that Camhs wards can be a ""lifeline"" for many patients, and that while there is ""an awful lot of variation in [standards of] practice... there are a lot of excellent staff who are really striving to do their best"". But she says that despite evidence showing ""post-discharge is one of the most risky periods in a young person's life"", in large parts of the country there is not enough intensive support from community Camhs teams for patients returning back home. Chelsea loved to sing, dance and do gymnastics Chelsea Mooney is one of the 20 children and young people to have died in inpatient units since 2019. She was 15 when she was first sent by the NHS to a Camhs ward, having struggled with an eating disorder that her father Steve Blackford said was ""becoming worse by the day"". Chelsea was in the system for two years, across multiple units, during which time, Mr Blackford says, her mental health ""deteriorated"". He says that while she entered the system with ""superficial"" levels of self-harm, Chelsea quickly began to learn increasingly dangerous methods from other patients. In her final unit in Sheffield, she self-harmed in a way that put her life in danger 250 times in 18 months. It was an NHS-funded placement at a specialist unit run by the provider Cygnet Health Care. Despite repeatedly asking for updates, Mr Blackford said he was not informed by staff of the scale of Chelsea's incidents. ""We used to tell them, 'If there's an incident - no matter if it's four o'clock in the morning - let us know'. But it didn't happen."" In April last year, Chelsea experienced a serious self-harm incident from which she did not recover. Steve Blackford believes lessons must be learned following his daughter's death Chelsea was meant to have been observed by staff every 10 minutes to ensure her safety, but an inquest found there had been an unjustifiable delay of more than two minutes, and that when she was discovered staff were too slow to respond. The coroner said she had seen ""no evidence"" of ongoing attempts by staff to engage with Chelsea as to why she self-harmed, which might have affected her level of risk. Cygnet Health Care said it worked proactively to ""involve families and carers in care decisions... [and] to reduce incidents of self-harm"", with an inspection earlier this year finding it followed best practice in safeguarding patients. Information and support for those affected by mental health issues or self-harm is available via theBBC's Action Line. There are also fears that patient safety in the sector is being put at risk by an overreliance on temporary staff. New data collated by the BBC, from 32 of the 41 areas with NHS-run Camhs wards across the UK, suggests spending on agency nurses per bed rose by 72% between 2017 and 2021. In Birmingham, 21-year-old Zaynab said staffing pressures could be ""dangerous"". She was first sent to an inpatient unit at the age of 14 following multiple self-harm admissions to A&E. Over the next four years she was in and out of multiple hospitals run by both NHS and private providers. Within one privately run unit, she said, agency staff ""would just turn up on the day"" and, not knowing patient care plans, would give them objects on request that they could use to self-harm or take their own life. Zaynab was sent to hospitals run by both NHS and private providers from the age of 14 She adds that in some units there was little psychological support, and she used to wake up each morning and spend the day planning how she would self-harm. ""The whole day, I would just thinkâ¦ 'What should I do today? What method should I use?'"" Zaynab says other patients would ""collude"" with one another - sharing self-harm objects, or organising collective self-harming. ""[The units] are built to be reactive to when self-harm happens, not proactive into stopping it from happening in the first place."" One patient, she says, would self-harm at the same time every day. But rather than intervening beforehand with psychological support, she says staff would wait for the incident to occur, ring the alarm and then deal with the self-harm once it had taken place. Dr Dubicka, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says more focus must be placed on providing intensive community support The NHS says it is facing ""record demand"" for services. There has been a 77% rise in the number of children needing specialist treatment for severe mental health crisis,previous analysis for the BBChas shown. For Dr Dubicka, this has been fuelled by the pandemic. She says the number of young people presenting to A&E or Camhs services with mental health needs is rising each year. She believes this has led to a ""perfect storm"", and that ""chronic underinvestment [in the Camhs system] over the years"" is leading to a staffing shortage that must be addressed by government. Young people are waiting ""month on month, year on year"" for help, she adds, not receiving the intensive community support they need. ""So, by the time they are seen, their mental health problems are really entrenched."" A Camhs inpatient bed costs about Â£230,000 per year on average, which is money that Dr Dubicka says in many cases would be better spent on community provision. The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was ""working to recruit an additional 27,000 mental health professionals by 2024"". The NHS said there had been an expansion of community services during the pandemic, that it was investing in training for inpatient staff and that all providers should have a clear plan for discharging patients at the time they are admitted. With good standard of care, Dr Dubicka believes there are positive outcomes for patients within the inpatient system. Zaynab says in her final unit she was able to build relationships with staff, engage with psychological treatment and work towards a return to the community. She is now studying at university with the aim of becoming a psychiatrist herself. ""I want to be the person to other people, that my past-self needed,"" she says.

"Breaking|Breaking newsJapanese fashion designer Issey Miyake diesJapanese fashion designer Issey Miyake, known for his bold style, fragrances and Steve Jobs' turtle necks, has died aged 84Asia","Issey Miyake at a catwalk show in Paris in 1997 Revolutionary Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake has died aged 84, his company has announced. Known for his innovative styles and perfume, Miyake built a global fashion brand, which included designing Steve Jobs' famous black turtle neck jumpers. Miyake was known to work with traditional and modern fashion techniques during his long career. He died of liver cancer on Friday, and a private funeral has already taken place, Japanese media report. Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake was just seven years old when the city was devastated by an atomic bomb dropped by the United States. His mother died of radiation exposure three years later. ""When I close my eyes, I still see things no one should ever experience,"" he wrote in aNew York Times opinion piece in 2009,external- adding that he prefers to think of things ""that can be created, not destroyed, and that bring beauty and joy"". Issey Miyake: His fashion in pictures Miyake reportedly wanted to be a dancer or athlete when he was young - but that changed after he read his sister's fashion magazines. He studied graphic design at a Tokyo art university and then moved to Paris in the 1960s, where he worked with lauded fashion designers Guy Laroche and Hubert de Givenchy. He moved to New York for a short time, before heading back to Tokyo in 1970 to open the Miyake Design Studio. By the 1980s he was celebrated as one of the world's most pioneering designers as he worked with materials from plastic to metal - and also traditional Japanese material and paper. The Pleats, Please line on the catwalk in Paris in 1995 Miyake developed a new way of pleating fabric by wrapping it between layers of paper in a heat press. It was a phenomenal success - various tests proved the pleats stayed in place and didn't wrinkle, and it lead to his signature line called Pleats, Please. Miyake's distinctive Bao Bao line of bags, recognisable for their small resin triangles, was celebrated for its engineering and was so popular that knock-offs flooded the fake designer market. He became known for creating a style that was high-tech yet practical and comfortable, and was a household name in not only Japan's fashion industry - but on the global catwalk. His fashion house developed highly sought-after clothes for men and women, as well as bags, watches and perfumes - a bottle of L'Eau d'Issey, launched in 1992, was rumoured to sell every 14 seconds. HisA-POC (A Piece of Clothing) line,external, which can now be seen in museums, used a special weaving machine that made outfits out of one continuous tube of fabric. The distinctive Bao Bao bag Miyake was asked by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs to design his iconic turtle neck jumpers and reportedly made 100 of them, at $175 each. He was awarded the prestigious Kyoto Prize for his dedication to the arts in 2006, and received the Order of Culture in 2010 for ""remarkable accomplishments"" in Japan's culture and arts. ""Design needs to express hope,"" Issey Miyake famously said, as he believed in the role of fashion in questioning how humans should exist - instead of making money. For people here, he is one of a few Japanese names which get recognised around the world, along with Yoko Ono. Not many will know about his traumatic childhood, as Miyake himself didn't talk about it until his later years. It was because, he wrote in 2009, he didn't want to be known as ""the designer who survived the atomic bomb"". Miyake may have chosen not to talk about it for a long time, but Japan's revolutionary designer left us one day before the 77th anniversary of his hometown's bombing.

"Child deaths expose mental health unit pressuresChelsea Mooney was 17 when she died in a Camhs unit last year, following a self-harm incident.","Chelsea Mooney died aged 17 following a self-harm incident in a unit in Sheffield Deaths, staff shortages and a culture of life-threatening self-harm are exposing deep fears about the quality of mental health care in hospitals for children and young people. Since 2019, at least 20 patients aged 18 or under have died in NHS or privately-run units, the BBC has found. A further 26 have died within a year of leaving units, amid claims of a lack of ongoing community support. The NHS said it had ""invested record amounts"" in response to record demand. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) units look after about 4,000 patients with many different diagnoses each year. The aim is to help them recover over a period of weeks or months through specialist care. Some patients are in and out of the units for years. The BBC's data requests found 18 of the deaths in Camhs wards since 2019 were in England. Fourteen were in NHS-run wards, and four in privately-run units.

Rishi Sunak vows more support for energy costs,"Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has vowed to provide more money to help people with their energy bills, if he becomes prime minister. The former chancellor said he would seek government ""efficiency savings"" to fund the support, to limit borrowing. The amount of support is yet to be determined and would depend on the extent to which energy bills rise later this month. Allies of his rival Liz Truss accused Mr Sunak of ""another big U-turn"". ""Three weeks ago he was saying more borrowing was irresponsible and inflationary - has he changed his mind? How can Rishi's borrowing not be inflationary, but Liz's tax cuts are? Intellectually it's as watertight as a sieve,"" a source in the Truss camp said. In a statement, Mr Sunak said he wanted to keep ""any one-off borrowing to an absolute minimum"" and would ""first seek efficiency savings across Whitehall to provide direct support for families to help with the unprecedented situation we face"". PM rules out immediate cost-of-living action Set budget before financial timebomb, says Brown Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? The energy regulator Ofgem is due to announce a rise to the cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers per unit - on 26 August. In a new forecast,external, industry analysts Cornwall Insight estimated the typical household annual energy bill will be Â£3,582 in October and Â£4,266 in January. Mr Sunak said ""there is no doubt in my mind that more support will be needed"", adding ""as soon as we know how much bills will go up by, I will act"". The former chancellor is competing with Ms Truss to be leader of the Conservative party and the next British prime minister. Both Tory leadership candidates, as well as the outgoing prime minister, Boris Johnson, are facing questions about how they will tackle rising costs. Downing Street has said Mr Johnson has no plans to introduce big tax and spending measures to ease the cost of living crisis before he leaves office in early September. The Bank of England has predicted inflation - how fast prices are rising - will hit 13% and the UK will plunge into a recession later this year. Business group leader Tony Danker has urged the prime minister and the Tory leadership candidates to ""agree on the principles"" of support for energy bills. The director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) - which represents British businesses - said civil servants should be ""working with the candidates now"" to draw up options for helping vulnerable people as soon as one of them takes office. ""I just don't think it's responsible government for a prime minister, or future prime ministers, not to give the country reassurance,"" Mr Danker said. This video can not be played Watch: Liz Truss quizzed on 'no handouts' cost of living policy In a campaign dominated by the worsening state of the UK economy, Ms Truss has focused on her pledge to lower taxes, which she argues will help households and boost growth. But Mr Sunak has argued her tax cuts - worth an estimated Â£30bn - would stoke inflation and saddle the UK with debt. Writing in support of Mr Sunak, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said Ms Truss's emergency tax-cutting budget risked becoming an ""electoral suicide note"" for the Conservatives. Mr Raab said the foreign secretary's tax cuts would ""do little for the most vulnerable"" and did not represent ""Conservative politics"". ""It's bad politics,""Mr Raab wrote in the Times,external. Former cabinet minister Sajid Javid told the i newspaper that Ms Truss - whom he backs for the leadership - had the best plan for boosting living standards. But, he said, ""more needs to be done"" to support people on lower incomes, suggesting an uplift in benefits payments as one option. Meanwhile, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon haswritten to Mr Johnsonto request an emergency meeting, telling him only the UK government could access resources ""on the scale required"" to provide the required support. Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has also been calling for immediate action, sayinga meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee,externalshould be convened to address a crisis which, he said, would leave ""millions standing on the edge of a financial precipice"". Labour MP and shadow employment minister Alison McGovern said ""every day counts"" in working on emergency measures to deal with the cost of living crisis. She said the party wanted VAT removed from fuel bills and suggested more targeted help could be introduced too. Ms McGovern told the BBC: ""We do have government ministers who could take responsibility for bringing forward some of these things and making it clear to everyone in the country that we are going to start taking action today. Not waiting."" The Liberal Democratshave calledfor the October energy price cap rise to be scrapped. The party argues that this could be paid for by expanding the windfall tax imposed on energy company profits. Leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Sunak's plans for more support were ""too timid"", and accused the Conservatives of living in a ""parallel universe"". Support that has already been announced by the government includes a Â£650 payment for the eight million lowest-income households, an additional Â£300 for pensioner households, and Â£400 for all households. With the current government ruling out emergency action until next week - there are growing calls for reassurance that ministers will act when the price cap goes up. Rishi Sunak today sets out principles - but not figures. He says he would use the same template as earlier this year, when the government pledged universal support for every household and extra for those on lower incomes. Exactly how much Mr Sunak is promising won't be confirmed until later this month, when the new energy price cap is confirmed. Liz Truss has not yet clarified what she meant when she said she wanted tax cuts, not handouts. Her allies insist nothing has been ruled out. But Dominic Raab - who is backing Mr Sunak - this morning warns Ms Truss that failing to live up to the challenge would be an ""electoral suicide note"" for the Conservatives.

Olive oil price warning as heatwave hits crops,"The price of olive oil is set to rise as heatwaves hit production in Spain, a leading exporter has warned. Acesur, which supplies the UK's biggest supermarkets, told the BBC this would feed through into prices in shops in the next three to four months when companies renew their contracts. The company's export manager, Miguel Colmenero, said customers could see prices rise by 20-25%. Spain produces nearly half of the world's olive oil. But the country, along with other parts of Western Europe which produce olive oil, including Italy and Portugal, has been experiencing extreme temperatures and a lack of rain in recent weeks. Records fall as extreme heat bakes Western Europe UK sunflower oil bottler has few weeks' supply left Acesur is involved in the production of more than 200,000 tonnes of olive oil a year, out of the roughly 1.4 million tonnes produced in Spain annually, and sells its products in more than 100 countries. It sells around 20,000 tonnes a year in the UK and packs own-label brands for Sainsbury's, Tesco, Waitrose, Morrisons and Asda. The supermarkets also stock its La Espanola brand, which is the third biggest in the UK. Most of the olives in its products are grown in Andalucia, southern Spain, which has had very little rainfall in recent weeks. Mr Colmenero said the impact of the heatwave on production was ""drastic"". Last year, Spain produced around 1.4 million tonnes of olive oil but he said officials were now forecasting as little as one million tonnes for this season. He added that the dry weather could also impact next season's crop, if olive trees could not grow new branches due to lack of water. This is having an impact on global prices. In July the Mintec benchmark price for extra virgin olive oil rose to its highest level so far this year, up by 7.3% on the previous month and 14.2% on the previous year, according to the market research group. Mr Colmenero said this would eventually feed through into prices for customers, although there would be a three to four month lag because many companies would already have signed 12-month contracts with retailers. However, he added companies would eventually have to raise their prices when they renewed contracts and customers could see increases of 20-25%. The BBC contacted the UK's other biggest olive oil brands, including Filippo Berio and Napolina, but did not get a response. Italy's olive crop has also been reduced by heatwaves and drought The average price of own-label olive oil in the four biggest UK supermarket chains was up 50.2% on last year at the beginning of August, according to retail research firm Assosia. From June to July, average prices increased 28.5%. If the dry weather continues, Roxanne Nikoro, a market analyst for Mintec, said prices could rise further. However, she added that if thegrain corridoragreed from Ukraine led to more supplies of sunflower oil coming out of the country, this ""could bring some relief"". Mr Colmenero said disruption to the supply of sunflower oil from Ukraine was also contributing to ""dramatic"" price increases, as people turned to olive oil as an alternative, increasing demand. Ukraine was previously the world's top exporter of sunflower oil. Other parts of Western Europe which produce olive oil have also experienced record high temperatures and Mr Colmenero said this would reduce production in other countries too.

Supermarket food could soon carry eco-labels,"Ryan Holmes of the catering group Compass (centre) has used the Oxford method to reduce the environmental impact of its workplace meals Supermarket shoppers could soon be checking the environmental impact of food before putting it in their trolleys, thanks to new research. Reliable information of this kind hasn't been available. That's because UK manufacturers only have to list their main ingredients, and that's by percentage, not amount. Scientists have overcome the problem by using public databases to estimate the composition of thousands of food products and their impact. Many consumers want to know how their weekly food shop affects the planet, even though rising prices will likely be a more immediate concern for most. Prof Peter Scarborough from Oxford University told BBC News he hopes that the research leads to an eco-labelling system for customers, but he believes that the bigger impact would come if the food industry uses it to cut its environmental footprint. He said the food industry has also been ""crying out"" for the new tool and that the algorithm is already being used by some manufacturers and caterers to make their meals more sustainable. ""It fills a huge gap. Manufacturers, caterers and retailers have targets for reaching net zero [emissions] and they don't have the tools they need to get there."" ""Now they have this data, and some of them are talking to us about things they can do to help people move towards more sustainable food purchasing. The data could help manufacturers adjust their formulations."" The analysis has limits. Ingredient lists don't tend to show sourcing information such as country of origin or agricultural production method. But Dr Mike Clark, who led the research at Oxford University, called the tool ""a significant step towards providing information that could enable informed decision-making"". The Oxford team estimated the composition of 57,000 foods and drinks in supermarkets in the UK and Ireland. It then assessed the impact of growing methods, processing and transport, against key environmental measures including greenhouse gas emissions and impacts on nature. The team developed an algorithm to calculate an eco-score for the environmental impact of individual food and drink products. Catering firm Compass Group began working with the researchers in January. Its Culinary Director for Business and Industry Ryan Holmes, told BBC News that use of the algorithm ""made us think about how we approach sustainability within the workplace"" as the company sought to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. He said the company took out some meat, increased proteins from other sources such as lentils and used more whole grains and vegetables and obtained a better score for many of its meal options for staff canteens. Under the algorithm, the higher the score, the higher the environmental impact. As expected, foods containing more meat and dairy score much higher than those with more plant-based ingredients. By contrast, many meat alternatives such as plant-based sausages or burgers, had between a fifth and less than a tenth of the environmental impact of meat-based equivalents. But there was also wide variation within specific categories. For example, the highest-impact pork sausage scored about a third higher than the least impactful. And the impact of biscuits rose the more chocolate they contained, showing that small recipe changes could make big differences, according to Prof Scarborough. ""If you look at the government strategy on achieving net zero [emissions by 2050] around food systems, they are not measuring the actual greenhouse gas emissions, instead the recommendation is to reduce meat consumption. ""That's OK, because meat has the biggest greenhouse gas emissions, but you miss a massive amount in multi-ingredient foods which had previously had no reduction targets based on them whatsoever."" The food firm COOK is assessing whether eco-labelling would help its customers move to a more sustainable diet COOK, a Kent-based frozen food producer looking to diversify away from meat, has also worked with the researchers. It wants to explore whether measures like putting eco-labels on its products would help customers embrace a more sustainable diet. ""The tool could help us by ensuring that as we are developing new recipes there is a delicious option for someone who is actively looking to reduce their environmental impact through what they eat,"" said Andy Stephens, COOK's head of sustainable food. The researchers don't foresee eco-labelling becoming compulsory in the near future. They want firms to adopt it voluntarily, something they believe would lead them to compete over the sustainability of their food and drink products. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs welcomed the initiative. ""We want to give everyone the information to make healthier, greener or more sustainable choices with the food they buy, if they want to. Voluntary industry schemes are really positive and through our Food Strategy we're also looking at how we can better support them in future."" The research has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"Over 50s quitting fuels inflation, warns John Lewis","Dame Sharon White An exodus of over-50s who left the workforce during the Covid pandemic is fuelling wage inflation, says the boss of John Lewis. Dame Sharon White said any government must think ""really hard"" about how to get more older people back into work. The UK has seen one million people, mostly in their 50s, leave work since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. That ""inevitably"" causes wage inflation, said Dame Sharon. The number of ""economically inactive"" people - those without a job and not seeking to work - is higher than before Covid struck, according to the Office for National Statistics. Retirement is the mostpopular reason given by people aged between 50 and 70,externalfor not working. Job vacancies are at a record high and employers who want to attract and retain staff are under pressure to lift wages, which in turn fuels inflation. Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, is currently at a 40-year high while the Bank of England has warned the UK will fall into recession later this year. The chairwoman of the John Lewis Partnership, owner of the department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain,told the BBC's Today Programmeshe had ""never seen anything quite like"" the country's current economic situation throughout her entire career. Dame Sharon, who is a former Treasury civil servant, said she was cautious about giving advice to her former colleagues, but said ""one area"" that had not had ""enough attention"" was the job market over the past 18 months. Listen to Sharon White's interview in full Where are Britain's missing million workers? UK will fall into recession this year, warns Bank ""Regardless of what has happened coming out of Covid, if the labour market is that tight, if we continue to have far fewer people in work [or] looking for work -  you've inevitably got more inflation and more wage inflation,"" she said. ""I guess I would encourage...any government to really think much more about how to encourage more people back into work. ""There's not a business in the UK that's not finding it very difficult to recruit at the moment because there are so many more jobs and far fewer people looking for work. It's a big issue."" Steve Willis retired from his full-time job as a regional account manager for a motor finance broker after he ""saw life in a completely different way"" when he was furloughed during the height of the pandemic. ""You do not realise the stress that you're under,"" he said. ""What the lockdown and Covid did is make me slow down because you couldn't do anything."" The 58-year-old, who lives in Kent, said his company were ""very generous"" to him while he was furloughed but said when he returned to work ""the whole world for everybody had completely changed"". Having previously met clients face-to-face, out on the road, he was asked to work from home more often and conduct business on the telephone. ""When you get to my age you start questioning things: 'Why am I doing this? I'm not enjoying it anymore,'"" he said. After speaking to his company, Mr Willis agreed to stay on to train a new member of staff before departing. He now works on a zero-hours contract job driving for the NHS where his wife, Grainne, works full-time. And despite the rising cost of living, he has no plans to return to full-time employment. ""We are in a lucky position,"" Mr Willis said. ""I could not have done this without my wife working full-time. She totally enjoys her job. I'm lucky enough that we have not got a mortgage and my daughter is grown-up."" Dame Sharon said she had ""never"" seen ""such a combination of some very difficult factors"" impacting the economy during her working career, which has also included a stint as boss of Ofcom. ""I've never seen anything quite like the economic environment we have at the moment,"" she said. ""I think the big worry that everybody has is inflation combined with low growth, low productivity. So I think the big focus for all of us is how do we avoid stagflation? ""How do we avoid the UK becoming Japan with very low, very persistently low, rates of productivity and very low persistent rates of growth? To come out of that you have got to get businesses investing."" Dame Sharon said introducing flexible retirement plans for people and skills courses for older workers to retrain for different jobs could help encourage people back into work ""A million people out of the labour market has got profound, long-term, systemic implications. I would like there to be more of a debate, more of an open debate and certainly more of a debate, between business and government,"" she said. Dame Sharon admitted trading for John Lewis had been ""tough"" over the past few months, with the company discussing how it can help customers through loyalty schemes, as well as its staff. She said John Lewis had doubled its financial assistance fund - a pot of cash where workers can apply for grants and loans if they have difficulty paying bills - from Â£400,000 to Â£800,000. John Lewis has handed out a bonus of 3% this year to its 80,000 staff - equivalent to one-and-a-half weeks' pay - and increased wages by 2%. However, the current rate at which prices are rising is 9.4% - with the rate is expected to peak at 13% later this year. And the Bank of England is warning the UK will fall into recession. Asked why John Lewis had not increased its wages in line with the rising cost of living, Dame Sharon said the department store had sought to find a balance: ""How do we ensure our partners are able to cope with the cost of living, whilst also thinking about the affordability of pay for the business,"" she told BBC Radio 4. ""I think the same dilemmas that the partnership faces are the same dilemmas that the whole of the economy faces,"" she added.

Eight dead in Seoul amid heaviest rain in decades,"This video can not be played Watch: Deadly floods submerge South Korea's capital At least eight people have died and 14 others have been injured as flooding caused by torrential rain hit parts of South Korea's capital Seoul. Heavy downpours on Monday night submerged roads, flooded metro stations and caused blackouts across the city and neighbouring provinces. Some areas received the highest rate of rainfall in 80 years, Korea's meteorological agency said. Weather officials said the rain was likely to continue over several days. Images showed floodwater gushing down the steps of metro staircases, parked cars submerged up to their windows and people making their way across streets in knee-high water. Local reports said three victims were living in a semi-basement apartment known as a banjiha. Rescue officials said they were unable to access the apartment as floodwaters had risen to waist-high levels on the street. Destruction is scattered all around Seoul this morning. But the scene of real tragedy is one pink house, where tiny smashed-out windows peek out from just above the pavement. The windows belong to a basement apartment where three people, trapped by the water, drowned last night - two sisters in their 40s and one of their 13-year-old daughters. This morning it is still surrounded by floodwater and debris. Sun-woo has lived in the flat above the family for 10 years. By the time he arrived home at 8pm, their home was submerged. ""I feel devastated about this tragedy,"" he said. ""If I'd come home earlier perhaps, I could have saved them. I have a lot of regrets."" He said the family who had died had lived there for 10 years, and that their older sister had learning difficulties. The home is almost identical to the apartment featured in the Oscar-winning film Parasite. The real life events here evoke the opening scene, in which the leading family tries desperately to funnel the water out of their home during a torrential downpour - only this outcome is far worse. That South Korea's President Yoon visited the apartment earlier shows these deaths are significant. They are a reminder that away from the glitzy towers of upmarket Gangnam, where much much of the damage was done, live hundreds of Koreans in these subterranean apartments that are not fit for purpose. The real people living in a 'Parasite' basement Three people were killed when floodwater submerged their semi-basement flat Parts of Seoul, the western port city of Incheon and Gyeonggi province surrounding Seoul charted rainfall of over 10cm per hour on Monday night, according to Yonhap news agency. Meanwhile, Seoul's Dongjak district recorded more than 141.5 mm of rain per hour - the highest rate since 1942, according to Korea's Meteorological Administration (KMA). The other victims included a person who was electrocuted, one person was found under the wreckage of a bus stop and another died in a landslide. At least 14 were injured and six others reported missing. At least 163 people in Seoul have been made homeless and have taken shelter in schools and public facilities, according to Yonhap. The downpour also affected public transportation, as flooded railroads forced suspension of railway services in Seoul and Incheon. South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol ordered government officials to evacuate residents from high-risk areas, and urged businesses to grant employees flexible commuting hours on Tuesday morning. The KMA continued to issue heavy rain warnings across Seoul and surrounding metropolitan areas, and said it expected rainfall for the central part of the country to continue at least until Wednesday.

Heat health-alert to begin across England,"The Met Office has issued a four-day amber extreme heat warning, meaning vulnerable people's health could be impacted and travel could be disrupted. The warning applies to southern and central England and parts of Wales from midnight on Thursday until Sunday. Temperatures are set to reach up to 35C (95F) in some areas andThames Water has becomethe latest water firm to announce hosepipe ban plans. Meanwhile,a 14-year-old boy has died in a lakein Hertfordshire. Emergency services were called to North Met Lake, off Cadmore Lane in Cheshunt, just after 17:00 BST on Monday, with his body recovered six hours later, Hertfordshire Constabulary said. A second search is under way for a man in his early 20s who has gone missing in a lake in Hounslow, west London, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. The amber alert is the longest the Met Office has issued since it introduced the warning system in 2021 and is lower than thefirst-ever red warningin July, when temperaturesexceeded 40Cfor the first time. Is your postcode area vulnerable to high heat? But the Met Office said while temperatures this week would remain below last month's record highs, this heatwave could last longer. The Met Office warning is one of several alerts aimed at preparing the country for the heat: A level-three heat-health alert will apply from Tuesday to Sunday in central and southern England, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. This ""requires social and healthcare services to target specific actions at high-risk groups"" A level-two alert has been issued for northern England The Met Office's fire severity index is ""very high"" for most of England and Wales and will reach ""exceptional"" for parts of England by the weekend. This assesses how severe a fire could become if one starts While the warnings remain lower than those issued during last month's record temperatures, the UKHSA's Dr Agostinho Sousa emphasised it was important vulnerable people, like the elderly who live alone or anyone with underlying health conditions, were ""prepared for coping during the hot weather"". ""The most important advice is to ensure they stay hydrated, keep cool and take steps to prevent their homes from overheating,"" he added. Disabled people could be particularly affected by heat, and may suffer fatigue, difficulty regulating their body temperatures, or problems moving to cooler spots in the home, Fazilet Hadi, from Disability Rights UK, said. Meanwhile, a dairy farmer in Shropshire has said he might have tosend some of his cows to slaughter if there is no rain in Augustas a result of the reduced amount of grass available. This video can not be played Amber warning for extreme heat in UK The amber warning for extreme heat comes as Thames Water has had to provide bottled water to residents in the village of Northend in Oxfordshire. The water company said supplies were disrupted due to a technical issue, later adding that customers should now have water, but the pressure could be lower than normal. One farmer told the BBC the situation had become ""dire"" - explaining that he had almost considered filling up cattle troughs with bottled water. Another Northend resident said they had not been able to shower, flush the toilet or prepare food - apart from when using bottled water. Thames Water supplied bottled water to a village in Oxfordshire when supplies ran out England had itsdriest July this year since 1935, according to the Met Office, while south-east and central southern England had the driest month since records began in 1836. Between the start of this year and 6 August, the south-east recorded 144 days with average rainfall of less than 0.5mm. Of those, 57 saw no rain at all. Cathryn Ross from Thames Water said the water company was ""seeing unprecedentedly low storage"" and this summer saw ""less than 65% of rainfall"" than expected. ""We're looking at less than 75% of our storage at the moment as to where we would expect it to be. She said Thames Water was planning ahead for hotter, drier summers by becoming more water efficient, increasing storage and ""potentially"" new reservoirs. Meanwhile, a disabled man from Llandysul, Wales says he has beenstruggling in the heat with no water or low water pressurefor three weeks. Data from the Environment Agency has shownRiver Wye levels are now as low as 2cmand water temperatures are expected to rise in coming days. Warnings of the threat posed by wildfires have been issued, with fire services urging people not to light bonfires or barbecues, or let off fireworks or sky lanterns. On Tuesday, around 70 firefighters battled a blaze over five hectares (12.36 acres) of grass and shrubland in Enfield, north London, while there were also fireson the outskirts of Ipswich,in Northamptonshireandnear Reading. An aerial view of a fire on Rushmore Heath on the outskirts of Ipswich The heatwave combined with months of dry weather have also led to increasing problems for farmers, with grass not growing and irrigation water running low cited as two key concerns. Thames Water said it would be announcing restrictions on water use in response to forecasts of more hot and dry weather, with the exact timings to be confirmed later. Hosepipe bans are already in force in Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight, and others are due to come into force in Kent, Sussex, Pembrokeshire, and Carmarthenshire. The UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology has warned river flows are set to remain exceptionally low in central, southern and eastern England until October. River Action founder Charles Watson called for the government to act to prevent an ""ecological emergency"", warning that if river flows slowed down the ecology of rivers could be killed and the concentration of pollution in them would increase. Christine Farnish, a former board member of water regulator Ofwat, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme water companies ""need to get their houses in order"" over leakage and said they had been ""very slow"" to wake up to the realities of climate change. But Water UK's director of policy Stuart Colville said Ofwat figures showed companies were at the lowest ever levels of leakage on record and said the industry was doing ""everything we can"" to avoid restrictions on water use. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? The National Trust haswarned that bats, lichen and stately gardens have been hit hard by the hot summer weather, with its climate change adviser describing the impact as ""stark"".

A dried up lake in Wanstead Park, north-east London A heatwave is defined as above average temperatures being reached for three days or more. Heatwaves are becomingmore likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

Olive oil prices to rise as heatwave hits crops,"The price of olive oil is set to rise as heatwaves hit production in Spain, a leading exporter has warned. Acesur, which supplies the UK's biggest supermarkets, told the BBC this would feed through into prices in shops in the next three to four months when companies renew their contracts. The company's export manager, Miguel Colmenero, said customers could see prices rise by 20-25%. Spain produces nearly half of the world's olive oil. But the country, along with other parts of Western Europe which produce olive oil, including Italy and Portugal, has been experiencing extreme temperatures and a lack of rain in recent weeks. Records fall as extreme heat bakes Western Europe UK sunflower oil bottler has few weeks' supply left Acesur is involved in the production of more than 200,000 tonnes of olive oil a year, out of the roughly 1.4 million tonnes produced in Spain annually, and sells its products in more than 100 countries. It sells around 20,000 tonnes a year in the UK and packs own-label brands for Sainsbury's, Tesco, Waitrose, Morrisons and Asda. The supermarkets also stock its La Espanola brand, which is the third biggest in the UK. Most of the olives in its products are grown in Andalucia, southern Spain, which has had very little rainfall in recent weeks. Mr Colmenero said the impact of the heatwave on production was ""drastic"". Last year, Spain produced around 1.4 million tonnes of olive oil but he said officials were now forecasting as little as one million tonnes for this season. He added that the dry weather could also impact next season's crop, if olive trees could not grow new branches due to lack of water. This is having an impact on global prices. In July the Mintec benchmark price for extra virgin olive oil rose to its highest level so far this year, up by 7.3% on the previous month and 14.2% on the previous year, according to the market research group. Mr Colmenero said this would eventually feed through into prices for customers, although there would be a three to four month lag because many companies would already have signed 12-month contracts with retailers. However, he added companies would eventually have to raise their prices when they renewed contracts and customers could see increases of 20-25%. The BBC contacted the UK's other biggest olive oil brands, including Filippo Berio and Napolina, but did not get a response. Italy's olive crop has also been reduced by heatwaves and drought The average price of own-label olive oil in the four biggest UK supermarket chains was up 50.2% on last year at the beginning of August, according to retail research firm Assosia. From June to July, average prices increased 28.5%. If the dry weather continues, Roxanne Nikoro, a market analyst for Mintec, said prices could rise further. However, she added that if thegrain corridoragreed from Ukraine led to more supplies of sunflower oil coming out of the country, this ""could bring some relief"". Mr Colmenero said disruption to the supply of sunflower oil from Ukraine was also contributing to ""dramatic"" price increases, as people turned to olive oil as an alternative, increasing demand. Ukraine was previously the world's top exporter of sunflower oil. Other parts of Western Europe which produce olive oil have also experienced record high temperatures and Mr Colmenero said this would reduce production in other countries too. In July, Italy declared a state of emergency in five northern regions surrounding the Po River,as it experienced the worst drought in 70 years.

Few details are known about the new track - called Hold Me Closer. There had been speculation that the pair were working on a new version of Sir Elton's hit Tiny Dancer. It is the first new music from Spears since she was freed from a 13-year conservatorship, during which aspects of her finances and personal life were controlled by her father and others. More information is expected in the coming week, a spokesperson has told PA news agency.

The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained Rumours about the collaboration were reported by US media outlets last month, although there had been no official confirmation until now. The announcement comes as the legal battle between the singer and her father Jamie Spears continues. A US judge denied a motion by Mr Spears last month that the singer should return to court to face further questioning over the legal agreement. Britney Spears and Elton John at the 21st annual Elton John Aids Foundation Academy awards in 2013 Spears' conservatorship was set up in 2008 after the US pop star, known for hits like Oops I Did It Again! and Toxic, faced a public mental health crisis. The legal agreement, which she was freed from in November, had power over the singer's finances and career decisions, as well as personal decisions. The singerrecently married Sam Asghariin an intimate ceremony in California in June.

This video can not be played Trump home search: Biden not given a 'heads up' - White House A former FBI special agent has told CNN the Trump investigation shows there is a ""national security threat"". Asha Rangappa says the former president is ""a counter-intelligence nightmare"". She says the large number of visitors to Mar-a-Lago could make it very dangerous if classified documents had been kept there. I think it's important to underscore that because these involve classified documents, this is a national security investigation.  There's an ongoing national security threat. You can imagine the kinds of secrets that make their way to the White House, specifically to the desk of the president.  They can be a threat to our national security, they can get sources killed, they can compromise sources of information that we have if they get into the wrong hands."" Asha Rangappa, Former FBI special agent New York Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik has suggested that the FBI carrying out a search warrant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago property is something that could happen to ordinary Americans. ""If the FBI can raid a US president, imagine what they can do to you,"" she wrote on Twitter. Stefanik is one of a number of Republican opponents of the Biden administration who have vowed to investigate the Justice Department if the Republicans take control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections.

Another Representative, Ohio Republican and close Trump ally Jim Jordan, used a quote from Trump to make a similar point. ""Always remember, they are coming after me because I'm fighting for you,"" he wrote on Twitter. Supporters of Donald Trump have been speaking to the BBC's Chi Chi Izundu in Florida about the search of his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach. One told us ""we feel the FBI is doing a political hit job,"" adding he wanted to show his support for the former president. This video can not be played The FBI is doing a political hit job on Trump - ex-president's supporters say Michelle FleuryReporting from Bedminster, New Jersey The entrance to Donald Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey A day after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Donald Trump has gone to his summer residence in Bedminster, New Jersey. Security at the golf course, accessible via a country road which takes you past several farms, was tight â with some VIP guests expected later today.The former president is to meet with about a dozen House Republicans, a day after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Florida home. The former president will dine with members of the House Republican Study Committee, a conservative caucus group, today at his golf club in Bedminster New Jersey. The dinner had been in the works for weeks but has now taken on an air of soldiers rallying around their general. In a show of solidarity, several Republicans have condemned the investigation and pledged to investigate the Department of Justice if elected in Novemberâs midterm elections. The approach to Trump's estate in Bedminster, New Jersey Nobody at the White House was briefed about or aware of the search warrant carried out at Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate, according to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Jean-Pierre said that President Biden's staff learned of the search through ""public reports"". Despite repeated questions from the gathered press corps, Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the raid and referred questions to the Justice Department. ""The Justice Department conducts investigations independently and we leave any law enforcement matters to them,"" she said. While she declined to comment on what President Biden thinks of the search, she said that he has been ""unequivocal"" in his belief in the rule of law. She also quoted a 7 January 2021 speech in which Biden vowed to ""restore the integrity"" of the Justice Department. Mick Mulvaney acted as Donald Trump's chief of staff from January 2019 until March 2020 Mick Mulvaney, Donald Trump's former Chief of Staff, says the FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago home - where he reportedly took government documents when he left office - is either ""the most egregious political hit job in history or part of the most significant criminal investigation in our history"". Speaking to the BBC, Mulvaney says that during his time at the White House, he was in charge of running the West Wing where he ensured documents were preserved. ""When the law says you have to preserve everything, that's everything - a scratch pad, a newspaper the president had seen, it could be something very serious or something trivial, such as a menu with Boris Johnson, for example,"" he says. ""If that's all they're looking for, technical violations of the law, then this is a tremendous overreach by the department of justice (DoJ). ""If on the other hand, it's somehow tied to a very serious charge of trying to interfere with the transition of authority to the Biden administration, and if the DoJ thinks there might be documents the president retained at Mar-a-Lago that speak to say, conversations with the right wing extremists  and the rioters, then that's very serious."" He said ""complete incompetence"" could explain why Donald Trump reportedly took so many documents from the White House when his presidency ended. ""Is it possible there's something in that stack that is very damning to the president? Yes there is. And if there is, I hope that's what the DoJ was looking for."" This video can not be played WATCH: The State Attorney for Palm Beach Dave Aronberg reflects on the Mar-a-Lago search More comments now from Dave Aronberg, the State Attorney for Palm Beach in Florida. Aronberg says his office had no prior warning about the FBI's search of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. He says such secrecy is normal for ""the Feds"", especially when it involves ""something so sensitive"", such as searching the home of a former president. He pushes back against claims the search was politically motivated. Aronberg thinks the judge who granted the search warrant will have scrutinised it more than ""any other in history"" due to the request being so unprecedented. The FBI carried out a warranted search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida If you're just joining us or need a catch-up, here's a look at the key developments in the FBI search on former President Donald Trumpâs Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. Christopher Wray was appointed as FBI Director in 2017 The FBIâs search of Donald Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago home was kept
firmly under wraps until Trump himself announced it to the world. Even President Joe Biden was given no notice of it
happening, a senior White House official told CBS. So who did know about it? The FBI reports to the US Attorney General, the nationâs top
lawyer, and its activities are overseen by the Director of National
Intelligence. The bureau does not report directly to the White House. Any search warrant like this has to be signed off by a
judge. To do so, investigators must demonstrate that there is probable cause for the search, which essentially boils down to whether it is reasonable to believe that a crime has been or is being committed. But given the explosive ramifications of this search in particular, many political analysts believe the approval would have had to come from the highest level. That would likely include FBI Director Christopher Wray â
who was appointed by Trump when he was president â and also his boss, the
current attorney general Merrick Garland. Supporters and opponents of Donald Trump have held up placards and banners outside Trump Tower in New York. The building on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue serves as the headquarters for the Trump Organization. This video can not be played People have gathered at Trump Tower following the FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago Mike Pence at an event on 3 August Former US Vice President Mike Pence has called on US Attorney General Merrick Garland to give a ""a full accounting"" to the public of why the search warrant was carried out at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. In aseries of Tweets,,externalPence - who has distanced himself from Trump amid speculation he may launch a 2024 presidential run - said that he shares ""a deep concern"" over the ""unprecedented"" search of Trump's property. ""No former President of the United States has ever been subject to a raid of their personal residence in American history,"" he wrote. Additionally, Pence said that the search ""undermines public confidence in our system of justice."" ""Attorney General [Merrick] Garland must give a full accounting to the American people as to why this action was taken and he must do so immediately,"" he added. The lead Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee has called for the director of the FBI to give an ""immediate briefing"" about the information that led to the search warrant conducted at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. In a letter directed to FBI Director Christopher Wray,Rep. Mike Turner,externalcalled the search warrant ""unprecedented"" in US history. Turner also said that as the committee's ranking member, he is ""unaware of any actual or alleged national security threat posed by any information, data, or documents in the possession of former President Trump"". ""Congress deserves immediate answers from you as to the actions you ordered,"" the letter adds. A former US Senator once considered a leading contender to be Joe Biden's attorney general has said that the US ""is not some banana republic"" that conducts searches without cause. In an interview with the BBC, ex-Alabama Senator Doug Jones  - a former US district attorney - said the search warrant on Donald Trump's property at Mar-a-Lago is a sign of the checks and balances that ""the constitution envisions"". ""This is not some banana republic where the government just breaks down the door and barges in,"" he said. ""This is a process that is set up in the constitution of the United States and it appears to be followed to the letter here."" Jones also said that despite mounting pressure on the justice department to be more ""forthcoming"" with any investigation into former President Trump, doing so would be ""inconsistent"" with departmental guidelines. ""I don't believe the Department of Justice will or should succumb to that pressure,"" he said. ""I think it would be a big mistake for the future of that department to break with that long-standing policy."" Chi Chi IzunduReporting from Mar-a-Lago About two dozen Trump supporters are protesting outside Trump's Florida residence Even though Donald Trump isnât here and Mar-a-Lago is closed during the summer months, about two dozen loyal supporters, in the blazing sun of West Palm Beach, have lined the state road outside the property, waving flags and carrying Trump 2020 banners. They've been taking the opportunity to tell the members of press camped here that we are reporting âfake newsâ. One man whispered as we walked past: âThis whole thing is crazy. Itâs all nonsense."" Support for the former president was also reflected by cars beeping their horns as they drove past. Justin, who lives up the road from the complex, was being stopped and asked whether the many flags he was carrying were for sale. âNo,â he replied, âjust supportâ. He called the execution of the FBI warrant âliesâ, while Adrienne, waving her American flag, encouraged âpeople with a voiceâ to show their support. Security guards were seen walking outside Mar-a-Lago today after the Florida home belonging to ex-President Trump was searched by the FBI Guards were also seen patrolling the perimeter of the residence in Palm Beach Some Trump supporters gathered outside to show their support to the former president Supporters of Donald Trump are speaking up today, with many backing the former president's assertion that Monday's FBI search is part of a Democrat strategy to stop him from running for office again in 2024. Among them is Republican strategist Seth Weathers, who calls the operation at Trump's Florida home ""truly, unbelievably outrageous"". Speaking to the BBC, Weathers says a precedent has been set that he thinks is ""going to be very hard to take back"". He claims the legal authorisation of the search warrant was politically motivated, and says the ""overreach"" from Joe Biden's administration has reached levels ""I don't think many people thought would happen"". President Biden has tried to distance himself from the justice department, and a White House official has said he was given no advanced notice of Mondays's FBI search. According to former US district attorney for Idaho, Wendy Olson, granting the FBI a search warrant would not be politically motivated. Olson says the warrant would have been subject to a ârigorous applicationâ, signed off and vetted by those at the âhighest levelsâ of the Department of Justice and the FBI - including the Trump-appointed FBI director Chris Wray. Reality Check The emails date back to when Hillary Clinton was US Secretary of State In Trump's statement about Monday's FBI search, he reacted angrily and compared his situation to that of his former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. âHillary Clinton was allowed to deleteâ¦ 33,000 emails after they were subpoenaed by Congress. Absolutely nothing has happened to hold her accountable,"" he claimed. This claim refers to an investigation into Clintonâs
use of a private email server for government business, which is against
official protocol. In March 2015, after sheâd
left office as secretary of state, the company that maintained her email server
deleted the archive mailbox, erasing about 32,000 emails, including
some from when she was in her official role. This happened after Congress had already asked Clinton to hand over any work-related emails. She did hand over thousands of
other emails, and said she believed the deleted emails were not
work-related. The FBI later investigated and found she was
âextremely carelessâ with government material. But it said
there was no evidence of collusion between her and the company that maintained
the server to improperly delete work-related emails, or that Clinton was âallowedâ to delete these emails as Trump suggests. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Rishi Sunak vows more support for energy costsThe Tory leadership contender is accused of ""another U-turn"" as he pledges more money to ease costs.","Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has vowed to provide more money to help people with their energy bills, if he becomes prime minister. The former chancellor said he would seek government ""efficiency savings"" to fund the support, to limit borrowing. The amount of support is yet to be determined and would depend on the extent to which energy bills rise later this month. Allies of his rival Liz Truss accused Mr Sunak of ""another big U-turn"". ""Three weeks ago he was saying more borrowing was irresponsible and inflationary - has he changed his mind? How can Rishi's borrowing not be inflationary, but Liz's tax cuts are? Intellectually it's as watertight as a sieve,"" a source in the Truss camp said. In a statement, Mr Sunak said he wanted to keep ""any one-off borrowing to an absolute minimum"" and would ""first seek efficiency savings across Whitehall to provide direct support for families to help with the unprecedented situation we face"". PM rules out immediate cost-of-living action Set budget before financial timebomb, says Brown Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? The energy regulator Ofgem is due to announce a rise to the cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers per unit - on 26 August. In a new forecast,external, industry analysts Cornwall Insight estimated the typical household annual energy bill will be Â£3,582 in October and Â£4,266 in January. Mr Sunak said ""there is no doubt in my mind that more support will be needed"", adding ""as soon as we know how much bills will go up by, I will act"". The former chancellor is competing with Ms Truss to be leader of the Conservative party and the next British prime minister. Both Tory leadership candidates, as well as the outgoing prime minister, Boris Johnson, are facing questions about how they will tackle rising costs. Downing Street has said Mr Johnson has no plans to introduce big tax and spending measures to ease the cost of living crisis before he leaves office in early September. The Bank of England has predicted inflation - how fast prices are rising - will hit 13% and the UK will plunge into a recession later this year. Business group leader Tony Danker has urged the prime minister and the Tory leadership candidates to ""agree on the principles"" of support for energy bills. The director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) - which represents British businesses - said civil servants should be ""working with the candidates now"" to draw up options for helping vulnerable people as soon as one of them takes office. ""I just don't think it's responsible government for a prime minister, or future prime ministers, not to give the country reassurance,"" Mr Danker said. This video can not be played Watch: Liz Truss quizzed on 'no handouts' cost of living policy In a campaign dominated by the worsening state of the UK economy, Ms Truss has focused on her pledge to lower taxes, which she argues will help households and boost growth. But Mr Sunak has argued her tax cuts - worth an estimated Â£30bn - would stoke inflation and saddle the UK with debt. Writing in support of Mr Sunak, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said Ms Truss's emergency tax-cutting budget risked becoming an ""electoral suicide note"" for the Conservatives. Mr Raab said the foreign secretary's tax cuts would ""do little for the most vulnerable"" and did not represent ""Conservative politics"". ""It's bad politics,""Mr Raab wrote in the Times,external. Former cabinet minister Sajid Javid told the i newspaper that Ms Truss - whom he backs for the leadership - had the best plan for boosting living standards. But, he said, ""more needs to be done"" to support people on lower incomes, suggesting an uplift in benefits payments as one option. Meanwhile, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon haswritten to Mr Johnsonto request an emergency meeting, telling him only the UK government could access resources ""on the scale required"" to provide the required support. Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has also been calling for immediate action, sayinga meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee,externalshould be convened to address a crisis which, he said, would leave ""millions standing on the edge of a financial precipice"". Labour MP and shadow employment minister Alison McGovern said ""every day counts"" in working on emergency measures to deal with the cost of living crisis. She said the party wanted VAT removed from fuel bills and suggested more targeted help could be introduced too. Ms McGovern told the BBC: ""We do have government ministers who could take responsibility for bringing forward some of these things and making it clear to everyone in the country that we are going to start taking action today. Not waiting."" The Liberal Democratshave calledfor the October energy price cap rise to be scrapped. The party argues that this could be paid for by expanding the windfall tax imposed on energy company profits. Leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Sunak's plans for more support were ""too timid"", and accused the Conservatives of living in a ""parallel universe"". Support that has already been announced by the government includes a Â£650 payment for the eight million lowest-income households, an additional Â£300 for pensioner households, and Â£400 for all households. With the current government ruling out emergency action until next week - there are growing calls for reassurance that ministers will act when the price cap goes up. Rishi Sunak today sets out principles - but not figures. He says he would use the same template as earlier this year, when the government pledged universal support for every household and extra for those on lower incomes. Exactly how much Mr Sunak is promising won't be confirmed until later this month, when the new energy price cap is confirmed. Liz Truss has not yet clarified what she meant when she said she wanted tax cuts, not handouts. Her allies insist nothing has been ruled out. But Dominic Raab - who is backing Mr Sunak - this morning warns Ms Truss that failing to live up to the challenge would be an ""electoral suicide note"" for the Conservatives.
