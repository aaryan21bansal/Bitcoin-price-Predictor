Fallon resigns saying conduct 'fell short',"This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: 'I've fallen below high standards' Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has resigned, saying his behaviour may have ""fallen short"" of the standards expected by the UK military. He told the BBC that what had been ""acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now"". He is the first politician to quit following recently revealed claims of serious sexual abuse in Parliament. The BBC understands fresh claims about his behaviour were raised on Wednesday, but Downing Street refused to comment. Political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that sources close to him do not believe he is ""some kind of predator"", but that he had not felt that he could guarantee that he would be able to account for every encounter in his long ministerial career. Theresa May said she appreciated the ""serious manner"" in which Sir Michael had considered his Cabinet role. She also praised the ""particular example you wish to set servicemen and women and others"". In his resignation letter, Sir Michael said: ""A number of allegations have surfaced about MPs in recent days, including some about my previous conduct. As it happened: Reaction to Fallon's resignation Kuenssberg: Fallon's 'painful' decision to resign Take sex abuse claims to police, May urges ""Many of these have been false but I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent."" This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: ""Not right for me to go on as defence secretary"". Sir Michael told the BBC it ""was right"" for him to resign and said: ""The culture has changed over the years, what might have been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now. ""Parliament now has to look at itself and the prime minister has made very clear that conduct needs to be improved and we need to protect the staff of Westminster against any particular allegations of harassment."" When asked if he thought he should apologise, Mr Fallon said: ""I think we've all got to look back now at the past, there are always things you regret, you would have done differently."" He added that it had been a ""privilege"" to have been defence secretary over the past three and a half years. In response Mrs May accepted his resignation and paid tribute to ""a long and impressive ministerial career - serving in four Departments of State under four prime ministers"". Michael Fallon campaigning in Darlington by-election in March 1983 Sir Michael Fallon had an interrupted parliamentary career that spanned four decades and two constituencies. In March 1983, he lost the Darlington by-election to Labour's Oswald O'Brien, only to win it 77 days later after Margaret Thatcher called a general election. But in 1992 his career in government stalled after he lost his Darlington seat to Labour's Alan Milburn in the General Election. He returned to Westminster in 1997 after being selected as the Conservative candidate for Sevenoaks when MP Mark Wolfson retired. During the coalition government he was appointed minister for business and enterprise, and then minister for energy. He was then appointed minister for Portsmouth in 2014 by David Cameron - a post which was created after the loss of jobs in the local shipyard at arms manufacturer BAE Systems. In the same year he succeeded Philip Hammond as defence secretary. The resignation comes a day after a spokesman for Sir Michael confirmed that he was once rebuked by a journalist, Julia Hartley-Brewer, for putting his hand on her knee during a dinner in 2002. The spokesman said Sir Michael apologised when it happened. Ms Hartley-Brewer, a former political editor of the Sunday Express and regular political commentator, told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""If he has gone because he touched my knee 15 years ago, that is genuinely the most absurd reason for anyone to have lost their job in the history of the universe, so I hope it is not because of that.""

Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said he was sorry to see Sir Michael go, but it showed leadership from the prime minister who ""read the riot act"" to her cabinet. He told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""Theresa May made it very, very clearâ¦ that it was simply unacceptable that people in positions of power over others should then abuse that position to solicit things that otherwise would not be granted to them."" Labour MP Ruth Smeeth told the BBC: ""I think we're all very shocked this evening, however we've got to look at what happens next. For me, it's who is going to replace him, how quickly. ""There's a lot going on and this is not the time for instability at the top of the Ministry of Defence."" General Sir Mike Jackson, former head of the British Army, said members of the armed forces would be ""sad"" to see Sir Michael go. He told the BBC: ""It's clearly a personal decision he's come to, and so be it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Following a range of recent allegations, including claims of a lack of support for those making complaints, Mrs May has written to party leaders calling for the ""serious, swift, cross-party response this issue demands"". The prime minister said a ""common, transparent independent grievance procedure"" for all those who work in Parliament was needed and that it ""cannot be right"" for policies to vary between parties. Labour, meanwhile, has launched an independent investigation into an activist's claim that she was discouraged by a party official fromreporting an alleged rape at a party eventin 2011.

""It was a whirlwind as I had no idea who he was and there was a lot of interaction from people. There were a lot of people who thought he was a hero and a lot thought he was a traitor. ""The communication was contrasting and varied. Twitter remains a good source of information and humour and I would say it's enhanced my enjoyment.""

Free cash machines could be cut back,"Plans to shake-up the UK's ATM network may lead to a ""vast reduction"" in the number of free-access cash machines. Link, the UK's largest ATM network with 70,000 machines, is proposing to overhaul the operation. Under the change, Link would reduce the amount it charges card issuers to allow customers to use the machines. But the move will leave ""ATM deserts"" where communities have no access to cash, warned the ATM Industry Association. On Wednesday, Link published a range of proposals, including a cut in the fees it charges card companies from around 25p to 20p per withdrawal. It said the changes - which would come into effect next April - would help protect the network, which currently includes 55,000 free-to-use machines. Link said it was committed to maintaining an extensive network of free-to-use machines But the ATM Industry Association criticised the plans. The trade body warned that unprofitable machines would be shut down, leaving ""ATM deserts"" where communities have no access to cash and other financial services. ""A unwarranted shake-up of Link will hit the most hard-up the heaviest - particularly the millions of people who rely on cash for day-to-day budgeting,"" said Ron Delnevo, of the association. But Link chief executive John Howells said: ""Free access to cash is vital for UK consumers and Link intends to maintain this for many years to come."" He said Link's financial inclusion programme will help maintain ""extensive free access to cash for all in the UK"".

Rickshaw driver sues star over phone calls,"Shakib Khan is one of the best known actors of his generation in Bangladesh A Bangladeshi auto-rickshaw driver is suing one of the country's best-known film stars, who used his phone number in a movie. The blunder led to Ijajul Mia being deluged with calls from admiring female fans of film star Shakib Khan. ""The use of my number... made my life completely miserable,"" Mr Mia said. He is seeking more than $60,000 (Â£45,000) for the distress caused by the calls, which he argues has nearly ruined his marriage. Mr Mia is estimated to have received nearly 500 calls over a five-day period in July from women hoping to meet Mr Khan. There has been no comment from the actor to the claims. Cycle rickshaws and auto-rickshaws jostle for space and custom in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka - and Mr Mia says his mobile phone is vital for his business Mr Khan is one of the famous and successful actors in Bangladesh, winning numerous awards. The incident involving Mr Mia's mobile phone number took place in the film Rajniti - released in June and produced and directed by Mr Khan. In the film, the movie star is seen and heard reciting Mr Mia's number to his onscreen girlfriend. ""Every day I got hundreds of calls, mostly from female fans of Shakib Khan,"" a frustrated Mr Mia told the AFP news agency. ""They would say 'Hello Shakib, I am your fan. Do you have two minutes to talk to me?'"" Mr Mia said the anxiety caused by the calls had left him questioning whether to sell his family home, and led to his new wife threatening to leave him. He explained that he could not afford to get a different number because he would lose business from long-established clients if he did so. ""I am a newly-married man with one daughter,"" he said. ""When these calls started coming, my wife thought that I was having an affair."" One fan was reported by AFP to have been so enamoured with the idea of meeting Mr Khan that she travelled 500km (300 miles) to see him. Mr Mia's case was filed this week before a district judge, who initially was reported to have been reluctant to hear it. But the judge is reported to have changed his mind after lawyers acting on his behalf submitted evidence showing the personal angst experienced by him because of the phone calls. Another hearing in the case has been fixed for 18 December, local media reported.

New allegations against Kevin Spacey,"New allegations have emerged from a number of men accusing Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct. US filmmaker Tony Montana claims he was groped by the actor in a Los Angeles bar in 2003. Montana says he was left with PTSD for six months after he claims Spacey ""forcefully"" grabbed his crotch. It follows an allegation made by Anthony Rapp that the House of Cards actor tried to ""seduce"" him when he was 14 years old. Kevin Spacey says he has no recollection of that encounter, and was ""beyond horrified"". It's claimed Kevin Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors while he was artistic director at the Old Vic Film director Montana toldRadar Online,externalthat he was in his thirties when the incident took place at the Coronet Bar in LA. He says he removed Spacey's hand from his crotch and walked away, but claims the actor later followed him into the men's toilets. Incidents regarding Spacey are also alleged to have taken place in the UK while the two-time Oscar winner was the artistic director at the Old Vic in London between 2004 and 2015. Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the theatre, claims Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors. ""It seems the only requirement was to be a male under the age of 30 for Mr Spacey to feel free to touch us,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. He said he fended off two ""unpleasant"" advances from Spacey that ""bordered on harassment,"" but that others were afraid to do so. ""There are a lot of us who have a 'Kevin Spacey story',"" says Cavazos. The Old Vic has set up a confidential complaints process for anyone connected to the 200-year-old theatre to come forward. It said in a statement: ""We aim to foster a safe and supportive environment without prejudice, harassment or bullying of any sort, at any level."" Separately, a British man claims Kevin Spacey exposed himself to him in 2010, when he was working at a hotel in West Sussex. Speaking tothe Sun,external, Daniel Beal alleges the Usual Suspects star flashed his private parts, saying: ""It's big, isn't it?"" and tried to get the then 19-year-old to touch him. Netflix suspends production of sixth series of House of Cards Spacey's special Emmy award withdrawn Why are people angry about Kevin Spacey coming out? The former bartender claims Spacey also invited him up to his room, but he rejected the star's advances. Beal says Spacey gave him his Â£5,000 watch later that same evening, and a few weeks later called him asking to meet up. He told the Sun: ""In hindsight, that must have been grooming. He was just like his character in House Of Cards - seedy and a bit weird."" The BBC has also uncovered allegations of sexual misconduct against Spacey by a man who claims he was harassed by the star in the mid-1980s. The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, says he met the star at theatre school before being invited to New York by him, when he was 17 years old. Kevin Spacey holds his Oscar for Best Actor for his role in American Beauty in 2000. Speaking to theVictoria Derbyshireprogramme, the man (who they've called John), says despite sleeping on the star's sofa he woke up fully clothed with Spacey lying on him, in his underwear. John, who still works in the entertainment industry, said Spacey again became ""affectionate"" the second night he was in the city. ""I burst into tears because I couldn't articulate any more what was happening to me. I was scared... To his credit, he backed off and we went to sleep."" Reflecting on his experience, John says: ""It seems he was grooming me. For me, I never let on that that's what I was interested in. I never discussed it, nor did I want it. John points out neither of them drank any alcohol that weekend. ""He was either very stupid or he was predatory - or maybe a little of both. I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst, emotionally. John says he didn't tell the authorities or his parents at the time, although he has since told friends. Robin Wright and Kevin Spacey in Netflix drama House of Cards The BBC has contacted representatives of Kevin Spacey for his response to these allegations. Meanwhile, production of the sixth season of Netflix series House of Cardshas been suspendedfollowing the sexual assault allegations against the actor.

Should I have climbed Uluru?,"Tourist visiting Uluru in 2013 From 2019climbing on Uluru will be bannedin respect of the wishes of Anangu Aboriginal Australians. The rock is a major visitor attraction, and many tourists visit the landmark to scale the rock. Visitors to the site explain why they chose to climb, or not climb, the sacred landmark. Online protests as Iranian Zoroastrian councillor suspended Thousands share their invisible disabilities on Twitter Publisher apologises for 'racist' text in medical book Peter Quinn at the Mutitjulu Waterhole at the base of Uluru in 1988 Peter Quinn worked as a tour guide leading groups of visitors on hikes to the top of Uluru in the 1980s. Peter told the BBC he was ignorant of the cultural sensitivities of Uluru at the time. ""I was a naive kid when I was climbing the rock. It was unbelievably disrespectful for me as a twenty-something boy from Melbourne to be educating tourists about Aboriginal history. ""I remember one time I spotted a 12-year-old boy carving his name into the rock. I asked him to stop, and his mother told me he wasn't doing anything wrong. ""Education is the key to empathy. When I was a tour guide Australians didn't learn about the history of the Aboriginal people. I think that is changing. ""I wish I had spoken to the local Aboriginal community and had them educate people about their culture and history. ""It is a privilege to visit these sites. We don't all have the right to take a selfie wherever we want. ""My advice to my younger self would be not to overestimate your right to do what you want, respect the rights of other people."" Richard Hiller climbed Uluru in 1998 Richard Hiller is pleased he got the opportunity to climb the landmark in 1998 as part of a round-the-world trip. ""I don't buy the idea that you're damaging the rock by climbing it,"" he says. ""I understand it is a spiritual site, but banning people from climbing it is a step too far."" Richard describes his experience of reaching the top of the rock as ""worthwhile"". Richard Hiller's view from the top of Uluru in 1998 ""It wasn't that busy when I visited. If there are lots more visitors, I can see it may be a bit different for the Aboriginal community. ""But I still think that banning people from experiencing climbing to the top is a real shame. ""I worry that banning tourists from walking on the rock will damage the local economy and negatively impact the Aboriginal people in the area."" Zoe Barker exploring the Scottish Highlands Zoe Barker from Leicester visited the giant red rock when she was 18 but chose not to join other members of her tour group in climbing it. Zoe admits she wasn't aware of the significance of the site when she visited. However, after speaking to her tour guide, she decided against scaling the rock. ""I made the educated choice not to climb. I wanted to be respectful to the Aboriginal community. ""The people in the group who did climb were being a bit disrespectful and selfish, but I am not going to tell them off for it."" Zoe thinks visitors can enjoy Uluru without climbing it. ""I walked around the base of the rock, which was really lovely. It had been raining and there were beautiful waterfalls cascading down the rock face.""

NYC attack suspect charged with terrorism,"This video can not be played New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov? The main suspect in the New York truck rampage that killed eight people on Tuesday has told investigators he began planning the attack a year ago. Sayfullo Saipov, 29, said he intended to kill as many people as possible and ""felt good"" about the Halloween attack. The Uzbek immigrant, who faces federal terrorism charges, says he was inspired by so-called Islamic State. He was shot and injured by police at the scene. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he should receive the death penalty. The charges filed against Mr Saipov are federal, which means the government can override New York state's ban on capital punishment. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Saipov appeared in court in a wheelchair 24 hours after mowing down cyclists and pedestrians on a bike lane in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday. Six people died at the scene and two more in hospital. Twelve people were injured, four of whom remain in critical condition. What we know and don't know Prosecutors say Mr Saipov spoke freely to them, waiving his right to avoid self-incrimination while in custody. According to federal court papers, he said: The attack was a year in the planning and he carried out a trial run with a rental truck last month He intentionally chose Halloween because he believed there would be more people in the streets He originally planned to target the Brooklyn Bridge as well He wanted to display Islamic State (IS) flags on the truck, but decided not to draw attention to himself He was inspired by 90 graphic and violent propaganda videos found on his phone - in particular, one in which IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asks what Muslims are doing to avenge deaths in Iraq. Mr Saipov was charged with one count of providing material support and resources to IS and another count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles. Read more on the suspect Why Uzbek migrants are radicalised New York Police's Deputy Commissioner John Miller said the suspect appeared ""to have followed almost exactly to a 'T'"" IS instructions on how to carry out such an attack. The FBI says they have located a second Uzbek man, 32-year-old Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, who was wanted for questioning in connection with the attack. Sayfullo Saipov had reportedly lived in Tampa, Florida, before moving to Paterson, New Jersey. He arrived in America from Uzbekistan in 2010 and is a legal resident of the country. Uber confirmed he had been working as a driver for them. Mr Saipov, who was shot and injured by police, appeared in court in a wheelchair CBS News quotes an intelligence source as saying he was known to US authorities after his name was associated with the subjects of FBI counter-terrorism investigations in 2015. The source says he had some contact with individuals who were considered radicalised extremists, at least one of whom was Uzbek. It is unclear whether those being investigated were in the US or overseas. It is not known if Mr Saipov, who was not the main focus of the investigation, was interviewed at that time by the FBI. New York has increased the police presence at key transport hubs, and there will be additional uniformed and plain-clothes police on duty at Sunday's New York Marathon. President Trump said he was taking steps to end the diversity lottery programme - the immigration system under which the suspect entered the country. What is the diversity green card lottery? How did Trump do in his terror response? But on Thursday, the US president drew back from an earlier call to send the suspect to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, suggesting it would take too long. Allow Twitter content?

The administration says it has not ruled out adding Uzbekistan to a list of countries in the president's proposed travel ban. The mayor of New York City and the governor of New York state have both praised the resilience of New Yorkers - and urged people not to ""politicise"" a tragedy that took eight lives. Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio also suggested New York's strict gun control laws had ensured that high-powered weapons could not get into the hands of terrorists. The attacker rented the truck from a New Jersey branch of retailer Home Depot on Tuesday afternoon before driving to New York City and entering the bike lane, police said. Video cameras show the van driving at very high speed, appearing to target bike riders and pedestrians. After the truck collided with a school bus, the truck driver emerged and brandished what appeared to be two weapons. Mr Saipov was shot and wounded at the scene by an NYPD officer who was alerted to the attack by witnesses.

Arena bomber's brother faces arrest in UK,"Libya's interior ministry issued this photo of Hashem Abedi in May The brother of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi faces arrest in the UK after prosecutors asked for him to be extradited from Libya. Hashem Abedi was arrested in the country shortly after the suicide attack that killed 22 people. The Libyan authorities are considering the UK's formal request, Greater Manchester Police said. Police also revealed 512 people are now known to have been injured in the blast at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. What we know about Manchester bomber Salman Abedi Salman Abedi was born in Manchester on New Year's Eve 1994 Both brothers travelled to Libya in April, before Salman returned alone, carrying out the attack. Hashem Abedi is understood to be currently held by a militia group in Libya. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it had ""applied for and been granted a warrant for the arrest of Hashem Abedi"". The arrest warrant relates to the ""murder of 22 people, the attempted murder of others who were injured and conspiracy to cause an explosion,"" police said. The then 20-year-old was arrested in Tripoliby members of the Rada Special Deterrence Force a day after the attack. The North West Counter Terrorism Unit applied for the warrant at Westminster Magistrates' Court within the last two weeks, GMP said. The force said it was ""grateful"" to the Libyan authorities for considering the extradition request.

A total of 112 people needed hospital treatment after the attack, with 64 suffering ""very serious"" injuries. Physical injuries include paralysis, loss of limbs, internal injuries and very serious facial injuries. Many have had complicated plastic surgery. Two people remain in hospital more than five months later. The force also revealed that: 353 people were in the immediate vicinity of the foyer at the time of the blast Of these, 175 were aged between 10 and 18 23 people have been arrested 30 addresses have been searched 11,000 exhibits have been seized 16 terabytes of data are being examined More than 1,300 statements have been taken, referencing more than 5,000 people Police are working through 16,000 hours of CCTV footage And more than eight million lines of phone data Officers are looking for the blue suitcase that was used by bomber Salman Abedi The investigation into the UK's worst terrorist atrocity since the 7 July 2005 attacks on the London transport system is ""still running a very fast pace"" with 100 officers working on it full time, GMP said. Previously, GMP saidSalman Abedi built the device packed with nuts and bolts alone. Detectives are still looking for a blue suitcase that he was seen using in the days before the attack. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he was ""encouraged"" by the development but said ""there may well be further challenges ahead"". Images released by police showed Salman Abedi on CCTV in Manchester Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""We have been clear from the outset that we are determined to do everything in our power to ensure that those suspected of being responsible for the Manchester attack are brought to justice in the UK. ""That is why the Home Secretary agreed to request the extradition of Hashem Abedi, who has been named as a suspect by Greater Manchester Police, and we continue to work closely with the CPS, police and Libyan authorities to return him to the UK. ""This was a callous and evil act and the victims and their families deserve and demand justice. They must remain our priority and we will therefore not be commenting further so as not to jeopardise the investigation.""

'You have to keep a knife with you...it's a part of life now',"This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime Delivery rider Abla's life changed in an instant in July on his way through Tottenham, north London. After stopping at traffic lights, his moped was surrounded by five other motorbikes, two riding on the road, three on the pavement. With the lights on red, he was pushed off his scooter while being threatened with a knife. In a matter of seconds the bike was gone. ""My money has gone, my bike has gone, my job, everything,"" he said. ""I don't know what I'm going to do."" With only third party insurance, he estimates he's had Â£2,500 stolen from him. He is far from being alone. Across England and Wales an incident involving a blade or sharp object takes place, on average, every 14 minutes. Of the 37,000 incidents in the past 12 months, more than 13,000 offences were committed in London. 'Thousands' of knife crime victims aged 18 or younger The moped and scooter crime wave that has swept London Reality Check: Is crime up or down? We filmed Abla's bike being stolen. What is striking looking back at the footage is how small the robbers look on their mopeds. But the police say this is not a surprise, with the average age ofmoped criminals at just 15. Just weeks later we encounter the aftermath of another attack - this time a woman in a wheelchair assaulted in her local park after a man tried to steal her bag. Her head and arms covered in blood, she is confused and distressed. ""I couldn't see anything"", she said. ""He just said 'give me your bag'... I just don't know why people have to do these things."" The violent robbery was witnessed by a group of teenagers. One of them told us he saw violence every day and now felt hopeless. ""It's scaring people because things are happening so often, to the point where people are fearing for their lives every single day."" The capital has seen a staggering 34% rise in knife crime over the last year. Paul McKenzie has spent all his life in Tottenham. When he was 15 years old he was stabbed in the hand with a machete. Shortly afterwards he decided to start carrying a knife to protect himself. But just months later police caught him with the weapon, and he was sent to a young offender's institute. Paul McKenzie is committed to getting knives off the streets, after police caught him with a weapon Since then he has spent 20 years working with young people to educate them about the dangers of drugs, gangs, knives and guns. He said most of the young people he speaks to in his workshops carry knives for protection. ""What you're finding is - and this has come out of the mouth of a few young people I've spoken to - that teenagers actually know people who can stitch [their wounds] up."" ""A lot of the knife crimes are not reported because nobody wants to be involved with the police."" Mr McKenzie said that as well as the fear of 'snitching' there is a lack of faith that an investigation will lead to a prosecution. The BBC has learnt that police forces across England and Wales are charging fewer people for knife crimes at the same time as offences are rising. Freedom of Information (FOI) responses from 30 out of 43 police forces showed that the number of knife crime offences that led to offenders being charged or summoned to court had fallen by eight per cent between 2015 and 2016. But in Northern Ireland, knife crime is down for the second successive year. Police in Scotland only began collating comprehensive knife crime figures in April. Prior to this, statistics were kept for possession of a knife - this has remained stable for the last few years. Mr McKenzie regularly gets tip-offs about the public places where knives are hidden by people to use when they might need them at short notice. As he walks around a park in Enfield, north London, it takes him just minutes to find what he is looking for. ""That could be the difference between someone living and dying right there, because now I know that's not going to go into somebody's chest."" The Metropolitan Police say people carry knives for many reasons - for some it's because they mistakenly believe it offers them protection. One man the BBC spoke to, who carries a Rambo-style knife and does not want to be identified, said he felt safer when carrying a blade. He admitted to seeing multiple friends injured from knife crime - some of them have died. He added: ""It makes you know that you have to keep a knife with you, because it's a part of life now."" Perhaps the most striking feature of the increase in extreme violence is the number of young people involved. Statistics show a third of all those accused of offences where a gun was fired (237 out of 668) in London since 2012 were aged 19 or under. Forty-five of the offences were committed by people aged under 14. The increase in violent crime does not only involve knives. Gun crime offences still remain below historic highs of March 2007 - when they were 31% higher than today - but the increase over the last three years is marked. Gun crime across England and Wales has increased by 27% over the last year and in London is 42% higher. One-in-six of the victims of gun crime in London in the first eight months of this year was aged 17 or under. The Metropolitan Police is trying to tackle the issue using stop-and-search. In a statement the Met said it regards it as an ""invaluable tool"" that takes several thousand weapons off the streets each year, and has been backed by Commissioner Cressida Dick. The force says it has changed the way they use stop-and-search and complaints have fallen by over 60%. But the tactic can cause tension. Friends ofJordan Malutshi, a 17-year-old stabbed to death in 2012, were stopped and searched at a memorial barbecue at Patmore Estate in Wandsworth, south London. An officer told us there had been three murders locally within a matter of weeks as a result of knife crime. But one of Jordan's friends, calling himself Abs, claimed the search amounted to racial profiling. A stop-and-search was used on a Wandsworth estate for the first time in three years as people began arriving to Jordan Malutshi's memorial He said he thought the group was stopped because the police saw ""four black youths in a car, in a nice car"". The BBC has learned that 65% of all people who face criminal proceedings for knife crime in London are from ethnic minorities, and 42% are black. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said tackling violent crime is her priority. In a statement to the BBC, she expressed her ""anger"" at ""the apparent perception amongst some criminals that they could operate with near impunity"". Recorded crime up 13% in England and Wales Reality Check: Is there more crime?

'I was attacked because of my accent',"This video can not be played Dimitris Legakis recorded the moment he was attacked while calling 999 Greek-born Dimitris Legakis has lived and worked in Wales for 17 years and considers the UK his home. But since he was hurt in a racially motivated attack last year, he fears for the safety of his family. He spoke to BBC Wales after South Wales Police said hate crime was still drastically under-reported. It follows official figures released in October showing the number of hate crimes across England and Wales rose by 29% in 2016-17. A Home Office report said the biggest rise was in disability and transgender hate crimes, but said the increase was mainly due to better crime recording. South Wales Police said it was ""more important than ever"" that communities reported issues. Mr Legakis explained what happened to him. Hate crime 'drastically under-reported' says South Wales Police The truth about hate crime and Brexit Dimitris Legakis is a familiar face to the fans and the players at Swansea City Football Club. As their official photographer he is a regular on the touchline at the Premier League team's home and away matches. His photographs regularly feature in the pages of the national newspapers and, trusted by the players and management, he travels with the team to matches. Last December he was with the team for their away trip to Middlesbrough for the Swans' match at the Riverside Stadium. The night before the match when he was in the city centre he saw a man smash a car window. Mr Legakis, 41, called 999. The man heard his Greek accent and turned on him calling him a ""smelly foreigner"". Dimitris' arms were broken in the attack Mr Legakis was able to photograph the man before he launched a vicious attack which he also recorded on his mobile phone. ""I ended up with two broken arms, my right forearm, the left one a little bone called the scaphoid which hasn't healed yet,"" Mr Legakis said. ""I couldn't work for two months - I calculated it was over Â£10,000 of work that I lost out on."" During the five-minute call to police Mr Legakis can be heard screaming for help as his attacker Daniel Skelton kicked and punched him to the ground. As well as broken bones, Mr Legakis suffered facial injuries, cuts, serious bruising and was left traumatised by the attack. His camera kit was also badly damaged. Skelton was jailed for 28 months for the attack Skelton, 29, from Redcar, Teesside was jailed for 28 months in June after admitting racially aggravated grievous bodily harm, two charges of racially aggravated damage and damaging property, at Teesside Crown Court. The judge described it as a ""sustained and vicious attack"". In a letter to Mr Legakis after the assault, Skelton apologised for his actions. He wrote: ""I am truly sorry. I had no right to touch you or your belongings - I was in a very bad place. ""If I could take it back I would. I hate myself for my actions that night."" Mr Legakis said: ""He said he had separated from his girlfriend and he was trying to have a few drinks to forget about it."" A year on, Mr Legakis said it had changed the way he thinks and feels about other people. ""I'm a bit more concerned, I've always been very open to people, very friendly, I want to believe I am at least, and it's knocked me down a bit in that people may make a comment or say or do something just because of a foreign accent,"" he said. Following the attack and since a reported spike in the number of recorded hate crimes after the Brexit vote, Mr Legakis said he was concerned not just for his safety but for that of his family. ""They do carry a foreign surname with them which at some point may cause some problems for them,"" he said.

The robot lawyers are here and winning,"Amid the dire - and somewhat overhyped - predictions of occupations that will be decimated by artificial intelligence and automation, there is one crumb of comfort. Yes, lorry drivers, translators and shop assistants are all under threat from the rise of the robots, but at least the lawyers are doomed too. (Some of my best friends are lawyers, honest.) That at least may be your conclusion when you hear about a fascinating contest that took place last month. It pitched over 100 lawyers from many of London's ritziest firms against  an artificial intelligenceprogram called Case Cruncher Alpha,external. Both the humans and the AI were given the basic facts of hundreds of PPI (payment protection insurance) mis-selling cases and asked to predict whether the Financial Ombudsman would allow a claim. In all, they submitted 775 predictions and the computer won hands down, with Case Cruncher getting an accuracy rate of 86.6%, compared with 66.3% for the lawyers. Quite a triumph then for a tiny start-up business. For Case Cruncher is not the product of a tech giant but the brainchild of four Cambridge law students. They started out with a simple chatbot that answered legal questions - a bit of a gimmick but it caught on. Jozef Maruscak, Rebecca Agliolo and Ludwig Bull are three of the law students involved Then they turned to something more sophisticated - a program that could predict the outcome of cases. I was surprised to hear that none of the team had a background in computer science, though it seems the chief executive Ludwig Bull has taught himself about AI during his legal studies. Two judges oversaw the competition, Cambridge law lecturer Felix Steffek and Ian Dodd from a company called Premonition, which runs the world's biggest database of legal cases. He says the youthful Case Cruncher team chose the subject for the contest well. ""There's a lot of these cases and the information isn't too complicated,"" he explained. ""For certain things like this you can ask a machine and it will do it far more speedily and efficiently than a human."" So, should lawyers now fear for their jobs? Felix Steffek is cautious about reading too much into this competition. ""Both sides could have achieved better or worse results under different conditions,"" he said. ""The artificial intelligence might have benefited from more computing power. The lawyers' results might have improved if only experts in PPI claims as opposed to commercial lawyers generally participated."" He says the question at this early stage of AI development is whether it will ""remain limited to descriptive analysis or whether it will be capable of evaluating rules and events"", and then whether it will be a tool for junior lawyers to use or something which replaces them. The results of the week-long competition were announced on Friday Ian Dodd thinks AI may replace some of the grunt work done by junior lawyers and paralegals but no machine can talk to a client or argue in front of a High Court judge. He puts it simply: ""The knowledge jobs will go, the wisdom jobs will stay."" And maybe the smartest, wisest lawyers will do what the Case Cruncher team have done - develop new uses for AI in the law.

What we know about New York truck attack suspect,"This video can not be played New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov? Sayfullo Saipov, the main suspect in Tuesday's New York truck attack that killed eight people and injured 12, arrived in the US from Uzbekistan in 2010 and is married with three children. He became a legal permanent resident of the US through a lottery programme that grants green cards annually to foreign nationals, in an effort to diversify the country's immigrant population. A day after the attack, Mr Saipov admitted to investigators that he had been inspired by propaganda from so-called Islamic State (IS). Speaking to the BBC, US-based Uzbek religious activist and blogger Mirrakhmat Muminov, who met Mr Saipov in Ohio soon after he arrived in the US, said the suspect was radicalised online and had become increasingly aggressive. ""He was not well educated and had no knowledge of the Koran before arriving in the US,"" he said. ""At the beginning of his time here he was a normal sort of person."" In pictures: New York truck attack 'He was revving - I saw him hit people' Why Uzbek migrants are radicalised But Mr Muminov said that Mr Saipov had become depressed, separated from his community and more resentful and angry after failing to find work as a driver. ""Because of his radical views he frequently used to argue with other Uzbeks and moved to Florida,"" Mr Muminov said. ""From then onwards I lost contact with him."" He had never been the subject of an NYPD or FBI intelligence investigation, according to John Miller, deputy commissioner for the New York Police Department. However, the New York Times, citing three officials, said the suspect had previously come to the attention of federal authorities via an unrelated probe. The back patio of the apartment building in Florida where Sayfullo Saipov was a resident Born in Uzbekistan in February 1988, Mr Saipov emigrated to the US in 2010 after winning a green card via the lottery and is believed to have lived in Ohio, Florida, and New Jersey since. Mr Muminov said there were about 70,000 people from Uzbekistan now living in the US, with the overwhelming majority in New York City but also smaller populations in Florida - mostly in Orlando - and in Chicago and Ohio. According to the New York Times,Mr Saipov arrived in the country with a poor command of English,externaland sought work as a truck and Uber taxi driver. ""He was a very good person when I knew him,"" Uzbek immigrant Kobiljon Matkarov - who met Mr Saipov in Florida several years ago - told the newspaper. ""He liked the US. He seemed very lucky and all the time he was happy and talking like everything is OK. He did not seem like a terrorist, but I did not know him from the inside."" Sayfullo Saipov appeared in court in a wheelchair Mr Saipov was shot and injured by a police officer and appeared in court in a wheelchair a day after the attack. He told investigators he had been planning the attack for a year, and intentionally chose Halloween because he believed there would be more people in the streets. Authorities found 90 graphic and violent propaganda videos on his phone - one that showed IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi talking about Muslims avenging deaths in Iraq. Officials say a note was found in the truck that referred to IS, but New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said it was likely the suspect had acted alone and there was no evidence to suggest a wider plot. Witnesses said they heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"" - Arabic for ""God is greatest"" - when he emerged from his vehicle after the killings. Federal prosecutors charged Mr Saipov on two counts: providing material support and resources to IS and violence and destruction of motor vehicles. President Donald Trump has denounced him as ""very sick"" and a ""deranged person"". He is reported to have been living most recently in Paterson, New Jersey, about 40km (25 miles) north-west of the scene of the attack. The truck involved was rented from nearby Passaic, a former industrial hub just south of Paterson. About 25,000 to 30,000 Muslims live in the city, the New York Times reported, giving it one of the highest concentrations of Muslims in the New York City area. Uzbekistan has over the last 20 years taken a hard line against Islamic extremism. Mr Saipov is not be the first person from the Central Asian country to be accused of plotting terror attacks in the US. Last montha Brooklyn man of Uzbek origin was sentenced to 15 years in prison,externalfor plotting terrorist attacks, including threats to kill Barack Obama.

Reality Check: What Labour claims about 16-year-olds,"The claim:You're 16. Now you can get married, join the Army, work full-time. Reality Check verdict:You can only join the Army aged 16 or 17 with your parents' permission. At that age you also need your parents' permission to get married unless you do so in Scotland. Since 2013, 16- and 17-year-olds cannot work full-time in England, but can in the other three home nations with some restrictions. The Labour Party is distributing a video as part of its campaign to give 16-year-olds across the UK the right to vote. In Scotland, 16- and 17-year-olds were allowed to vote in the independence referendum and areallowed to vote in local elections and elections to the Scottish Parliamentbut Labour wants this right to be universal. It argues that they should be allowed to vote because they can get married, join the Army or work full-time. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You are also not allowed to work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week and you are entitled to reasonable, paid time off work for education or training. There are various restrictions around selling alcohol or cigarettes and working at night. In Northern Ireland, 16- and 17-year-olds are alsoallowed to work full-time,external. They are limited to eight hours a day and 40 hours a week and there are restrictions around working night shifts.

'I was told bluntly I had no sperm',"Gareth, who now has a son, says male fertility should be treated like any other medical condition Male infertility care can be insensitive and one-sided, says charity Fertility Network UK which has surveyed men seeking help to become fathers. Men can feel excluded, with female partners being the main focus of attention in clinics, it found. The charity says men's needs are too often ignored, which must change. Gareth Down, 31, set up asupport group,externalfor men with fertility problems because he says he had nowhere to turn for help when he needed it. At the age of 20, in a blunt conversation with his GP, he was told tests showed he had no sperm. After eight years, nine cycles of treatment and four miscarriages, he and his wife Nat finally had a baby 17 months ago. He said a men-only space for sharing experiences was important, and would have made him feel much better about his personal situation. ""I just wanted to rant sometimes, but I didn't feel my thoughts were valid. ""Women are the ones having to go through it all and I felt I didn't have a right to talk or complain. ""But now I can say in confidence what other men feel. ""It just makes you feel less alone."" Gareth says the long, agonising wait for a baby ""nearly broke us many times over"". He says male fertility should be treated like any other medical condition. ""It's still quite a taboo subject - made even worse when you're made to feel like you're wasting NHS time and resources."" Fertility Network UK says very little is known about how men cope with infertility - men are often reluctant to share their experiences. Forty-one men responded to its online questionnaire, designed with researchers from Leeds Beckett University. On average, men who responded had been trying for a baby for five years and most had suffered directly from male infertility. Nearly all the men said fertility problems had affected their wellbeing, with many saying they felt worthless or ""less of a man"". Many felt excluded or marginalised. One man said: ""The whole experience has been focused towards my wifeâ¦ even consultants' letters about my genitalia are addressed to my wife. There seems to be no equality."" Another said: ""I now know what it feels like to be identified on official documentationâ¦ as an appendage to one's spouse."" Some said they were treated insensitively: ""A very rude GPâ¦ then on the analysis result, rather than explaining the result, called me at work to ask if I had had a vasectomy."" A lack of emotional support for men going through treatment for infertility was another common complaint. ""There are always women in the media admitting that they have had infertility issues but we do rarely hear about the man. I know it is a big issue for men and the risk of being called 'less of a man' but I feel infertility is something that many men suffer in silence, fearful of being called hurtful names. ""It is a silent problem that many men suffer,"" said one of the men who responded to the anonymous survey. Susan Seenan, chief executive of Fertility Network UK, urged men to speak out and said clinics should pay extra attention to the care needs of the men they see and treat. ""Men are half of the fertility equation; when they cannot create the family they long for without medical help they suffer and struggle physically and mentally just as women do."" There are manyreasons why men can be infertile,external. The most common cause is poor quality semen, the fluid containing sperm, either because there is a low sperm count, the sperm isn't moving properly or it is abnormal. Damaged testicles, ejaculation disorders and low levels of testosterone - the male sex hormone - can also cause infertility. However, 25% of cases of infertility are unexplained in the UK. Tests to find out the causes of male infertility include semen analysis and a urine test. More information on how infertility can be treated is available onNHS Choices,external.

Fallon's 'painful' decision to resign,"This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: ""Not right for me to go on as defence secretary"". ""What might have been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now,"" Sir Michael Fallon told me tonight as he quit the government. Clear to him now, and his departure will make clear to any other politicians in Westminster that behaviour they might have laughed off or treated as part and parcel of the rumbustious life is not acceptable and is not, it seems, acceptable to Number 10. It has plainly for him been a very painful discovery to make. Sources close to him don't believe that he is some kind of predator. He has been known as a reliable minister, but also a sociable and approachable politician. While sources close to him want to underline that they had not been told of any more allegations to come, or anything more serious, they were clearly aware that there could be more to come. He did not feel that he could necessarily account for every event, every encounter in a long ministerial career without being able to guarantee that no more would emerge. But it's also been suggested to the BBC that Number 10 was approached directly by several women with concerns about Sir Michael just this afternoon. And within hours he had therefore taken the decision to go. Number 10 won't deny or confirm what led to the resignation - they won't engage at all in any discussion of the whys and wherefores of the decision making process. And as above, Sir Michael's team say they know of nothing else that was about to break. But some Tory MPs are looking to what happened as potential evidence that when the prime minister said that she would take this harassment scandal seriously, she really meant it. P.S. It also leaves Mrs May with a huge headache about reshaping her Cabinet at a time of political weakness. More of that tomorrow.

Council rejects Muslim foster concerns,"The council responsible for the care of a five-year-old girl who was placed with Muslim foster family has rejected concerns about her treatment. The Times alleged the Christian girl's foster carers stopped her from eating bacon, told her to learn Arabic and removed a crucifix necklace from her. Tower Hamlets Council has rejected the allegations,externalfollowing an investigation. A spokesperson for The Times said it reported concerns raised by the child's mother and a social care worker. The child, who was put into care due to concerns about her biological mother's welfare, now lives with a grandmother. She was placed into the Muslim foster family's care in March by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. In August, the Times newspaper published a story claiming she had been ""forced to live with a niqab-wearing foster carer"". The paper reported the girl had ""sobbed and begged"" not to return to the family because ""they don't speak English"". She also allegedly told her biological mother that ""Christmas and Easter are stupid"" and ""European women are stupid and alcoholic"". However, Tower Hamlets Council -which investigated the claims,external- said the allegations were unsubstantiated and the girl did not know what Europe was. A spokesperson for The Times said: ""The Times reported concerns about the suitability of this foster placement raised by the child's mother and a social care worker who supervised regular meetings between the girl and her birth family ""Tower Hamlets was ordered to investigate the allegations and invited by the judge to publish an 'alternative narrative' in respect of them. ""Its report today rejects the allegations but records that the mother disputes the findings."" Reality Check: Who fosters? 'My Muslim family and our foster kids' A report by a senior social worker said the child had ""expressed no negative views about Christmas, Easter or any religious festival"" when questioned. The five-year-old is currently living with her maternal grandmother, who the council said was ""distressed and angered"" by the ""false"" allegations against the foster carers. ""She has a good relationship with the carers and is grateful for the excellent care she says that they have provided to the child,"" the report added. Lawyers for the child's mother agreed the social worker's findings were ""an accurate representation of the outcome of the council's investigation,"" a Tower Hamlets spokesman added. According to the report, the girl's grandmother wants to take the child to her country of origin, which cannot be named for legal reasons. East London family court previously heardthe girl had a ""warm and appropriate"" relationship with her foster carers, and missed them after she went to live with her grandmother. Judge Khatun Sapnara said: ""The local authority has satisfied itself that the foster carer has not behaved in any way which is inconsistent with their provision of warm and appropriate care for the child."" The judge will decide after a further hearing next month whether the child stays with her maternal grandmother.

NY truck attacker 'inspired by IS',"This video can not be played New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov? The man accused of killing eight people in New York by driving a truck down a cycle lane was inspired by the Islamic State (IS) group, police say. New York Police's Deputy Commissioner John Miller said that notes in Arabic claiming the attack on behalf of IS were recovered from the scene of the attack in Lower Manhattan. The suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant, was shot and injured by police. He is in hospital and under arrest. Mr Miller said: ""Based on the investigation overnight, it appears that Mr Saipov had been planning this for a number of weeks. ""He did this in the name of Isis [an alternative name for IS], and along with the other items recovered at the scene was some notes that further indicate that. ""He appears to have followed almost exactly to a 'T' the instructions that Isis has put out in its social media channels before, with instructions to their followers on how to carry out such an attack."" What we know and don't One of the notes said ""the Islamic State would endure forever"", the deputy commissioner added. Police have sealed off Mr Saipov's home in Paterson, New Jersey, and are searching the premises. IS has suffered a series of military setbacks in Syria and Iraq in recent months as US-backed forces take back territory the group considers its ""caliphate"". New York has increased the police presence at key transport hubs, and there will be additional uniformed and plain-clothes police on duty at Sunday's New York Marathon. This video can not be played Trump on New York terror suspect: 'Send him to Gitmo' President Donald Trump said he was taking steps to end the diversity lottery programme - the immigration system under which the suspect entered the country. He also attacked the US justice system, and said he would consider sending the suspect to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Trump backs Guantanamo for NY suspect What is the diversity green card lottery? How did Trump do in his terror response? ""We also have to come up with punishment that's far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now,"" he said. The mayor of New York City and the governor of New York state have both praised the resilience of New Yorkers - and urged people not to ""politicise"" a tragedy that took eight lives. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the attacker was believed to have acted alone, telling reporters: ""He is a depraved coward, is what he is, and he was associated with Isis, and he was radicalised domestically."" Mr Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio also suggested New York's strict gun control laws had ensured that high-powered weapons could not get into the hands of terrorists. The attacker rented the truck from a New Jersey branch of retailer Home Depot on Tuesday afternoon before driving to New York City and entering the bike lane, police said. Video cameras show the van driving at very high speed, appearing to target bike riders and pedestrians. After the van collided with a school bus, its driver emerged and brandished what appeared to be two weapons. Mr Saipov was shot and wounded at the scene by police officer Ryan Nash, 28, one of three NYPD officers who attended the scene after being alerted by witnesses. He is currently being treated at Bellevue hospital, where he has been interviewed by officers. This video can not be played Babtunde Ogunnyi describes the moment a truck hit people on a cycle path in Lower Manhattan Knives, a paint gun and a pellet gun were recovered from the scene. Twelve people were injured in the attack. Three have subsequently been released and nine remain in hospital, five of them in a serious condition. It was the deadliest terror attack in the city since 11 September, 2001, when nearly 3,000 people died at the hands of al-Qaeda attackers who flew hijacked aircraft into the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Sayfullo Saipov had reportedly lived in Tampa, Florida, before moving to Paterson, New Jersey. He arrived in America from Uzbekistan in 2010 and is a legal resident in the country. Uber confirmed he had been working as a driver for them. CBS News quotes an intelligence source as saying he was known to US authorities after his name was associated with the subjects of FBI counter-terrorism investigations in 2015. The source says he had some contact with individuals who were considered radicalised extremists, at least one of whom was Uzbek. It is unclear whether those being investigated were in the US or overseas. It is unclear if Mr Saipov, who was not the main focus of the investigation, was interviewed at that time by the FBI. Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev told President Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the attack. Uzbek officials have not yet confirmed the identity or nationality of the attacker.

Man jailed over Navy officer murder,"Ryan Gibbons (left) was earlier convicted of murder and Raymond Davies was found guilty of manslaughter A burglar who killed a former Royal Navy officer by running him over with his own car has been ordered to serve a minimum of 27 years in prison. Ryan Gibbons, 29, was found guilty of murdering Mike Samwell, 35, after breaking into his home in Chorlton, Manchester and stealing his car. Gibbons admitted the theft but denied deliberately driving over Mr Samwell. Mr Samwell's wife said the image of her husband injured and in pain will stay with her forever. Mike Samwell, who was a nuclear engineer, was woken by the sound of a burglary Raymond Davies, 21, of Castlefield Walk, Manchester, who collected Gibbons, of Steven Court, after he crashed and dumped the Audi S3 sports car was sentenced to eight years after being found guilty of manslaughter. In a victim statement read in court, Mr Samwell's wife Jessica said: ""He was a loving and caring husband. Patient and kind."" The image of her husband lying injured and groaning with pain will be with her for the rest of her life, she said. The couple's house was meant to be their ""forever home"" but she said should could not bear to go back there. ""I feel overwhelming grief for the future we will never have,"" she added. The stolen car was later found dumped The court had earlier heard Mr Samwell, a nuclear engineer, and his wife woke to the sound of burglars breaking into their home on Cranbourne Road, on 23 April, taking the keys to the car from the kitchen table. Mr Samwell ran downstairs in his boxer shorts to confront Gibbons as he was driving off, shouting ""Get out of the car"" but was run over. His wife followed him out of the house and found her husband on his back with tyre marks on his chest and ""blood coming out of his head"". She held his hand and told him she loved him as he lay dying from ""catastrophic"" chest and heart injuries. Mr Samwell's wife Jessica said he was a ""caring husband"" Passing sentence at Manchester Crown Court Mr Justice William Davis said: ""You knew you were running over Mr Samwell, you did it deliberately. ""You are a dangerous young man, you are a regular burglar and on this occasion, to get what you wanted, you quite ruthlessly killed a man."" Gibbons gave no reaction to his sentence but there were gasps from his family in the public gallery and one said ""You're joking"", before his father shouted ""Love you, son"". Det Ch Insp Lewis Hughes said: ""How many of us would have done the same thing in Mike's position, protecting our home and our loved ones from people like Gibbons and Davies?"" He said the thieves ""actively chose to evade police"". ""The word tragedy is used too often these days, but no other word seems right to describe the utter devastation this pair left behind in their determination to steal from the Samwells,"" he added.

Former MP 'assaulted Commons intern',"This video can not be played James Greenhalgh speaks to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. A former parliamentary intern has told the BBC that he was sexually assaulted by a former MP in 2012. James Greenhalgh, who didn't know the MP, said he felt violated. He said when he tried to report the assault a couple of months later, he was told by the MP's party that he couldn't make a complaint anonymously so did not proceed. The party concerned said it took ""any allegation of this nature extremely seriously"". Mr Greenhalgh told the BBC he was approached outside one of the bars in the House of Commons by the man who put his arm around him and then went on to assault him. Take sex abuse claims to police, May urges ""He literally put his arm around me, very close, stinking of alcohol I remember and pointing out different things on the canvas [painting],"" he said. ""I was interested to hear what he had to say, but I was thinking, 'This is very, this is very touchy-feely here - what's he doing?' ""And suddenly his arm slipped down towards my buttocks, and he had a good feel round there and went a bit further in between my legs. ""It wasn't very pleasant at all. I just didn't know what to do, I didn't know what to do at all."" The disclosure follows a range of recent allegations in Westminster, including claims of a lack of support for those making complaints. Earlier, at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said any allegations about serious sexual abuse in Parliament should go to the police, as she promised a new ""independent"" process to handle complaints. The PM said she was ""deeply concerned"" by recent reports about alleged harassment and abuse at Westminster. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said trade unions should be involved to support staff. Mr Corbyn said he was happy to meet the PM to discuss it, with a meeting scheduled for Monday evening. The PM said a ""common, transparent independent grievance procedure"" for all those who work in Parliament was needed and that it ""cannot be right"" for policies to vary between parties. A dedicated support team should be available to all staff, she said, and it should recommend all criminal allegations be reported to the police.

Fallon resigns over behaviour claims,"This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: 'I've fallen below high standards' Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has resigned, saying his behaviour may have ""fallen short"" of the standards expected by the UK military. He told the BBC that what had been ""acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now"". He is the first politician to quit following recently revealed claims of serious sexual abuse in Parliament. The BBC understands fresh claims about his behaviour were raised on Wednesday, but Downing Street refused to comment. Political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that sources close to him do not believe he is ""some kind of predator"", but that he had not felt that he could guarantee that he would be able to account for every encounter in his long ministerial career. Theresa May said she appreciated the ""serious manner"" in which Sir Michael had considered his Cabinet role. She also praised the ""particular example you wish to set servicemen and women and others"". In his resignation letter, Sir Michael said: ""A number of allegations have surfaced about MPs in recent days, including some about my previous conduct. As it happened: Reaction to Fallon's resignation Kuenssberg: Fallon's 'painful' decision to resign Take sex abuse claims to police, May urges ""Many of these have been false but I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent."" This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: ""Not right for me to go on as defence secretary"". Sir Michael told the BBC it ""was right"" for him to resign and said: ""The culture has changed over the years, what might have been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now. ""Parliament now has to look at itself and the prime minister has made very clear that conduct needs to be improved and we need to protect the staff of Westminster against any particular allegations of harassment."" When asked if he thought he should apologise, Mr Fallon said: ""I think we've all got to look back now at the past, there are always things you regret, you would have done differently."" He added that it had been a ""privilege"" to have been defence secretary over the past three and a half years. In response Mrs May accepted his resignation and paid tribute to ""a long and impressive ministerial career - serving in four Departments of State under four prime ministers"". Michael Fallon campaigning in Darlington by-election in March 1983 Sir Michael Fallon had an interrupted parliamentary career that spanned four decades and two constituencies. In March 1983, he lost the Darlington by-election to Labour's Oswald O'Brien, only to win it 77 days later after Margaret Thatcher called a general election. But in 1992 his career in government stalled after he lost his Darlington seat to Labour's Alan Milburn in the General Election. He returned to Westminster in 1997 after being selected as the Conservative candidate for Sevenoaks when MP Mark Wolfson retired. During the coalition government he was appointed minister for business and enterprise, and then minister for energy. He was then appointed minister for Portsmouth in 2014 by David Cameron - a post which was created after the loss of jobs in the local shipyard at arms manufacturer BAE Systems. In the same year he succeeded Philip Hammond as defence secretary. The resignation comes a day after a spokesman for Sir Michael confirmed that he was once rebuked by a journalist, Julia Hartley-Brewer, for putting his hand on her knee during a dinner in 2002. The spokesman said Sir Michael apologised when it happened. Ms Hartley-Brewer, a former political editor of the Sunday Express and regular political commentator, told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""If he has gone because he touched my knee 15 years ago, that is genuinely the most absurd reason for anyone to have lost their job in the history of the universe, so I hope it is not because of that.""

Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said he was sorry to see Sir Michael go, but it showed leadership from the prime minister who ""read the riot act"" to her cabinet. He told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""Theresa May made it very, very clearâ¦ that it was simply unacceptable that people in positions of power over others should then abuse that position to solicit things that otherwise would not be granted to them."" Labour MP Ruth Smeeth told the BBC: ""I think we're all very shocked this evening, however we've got to look at what happens next. For me, it's who is going to replace him, how quickly. ""There's a lot going on and this is not the time for instability at the top of the Ministry of Defence."" General Sir Mike Jackson, former head of the British Army, said members of the armed forces would be ""sad"" to see Sir Michael go.

Amsterdam bans beer bikes amid complaints,"Amsterdam has banned beer bikes amid complaints about rowdy tourists being drunk and disorderly. Acourt ruling,externalon Tuesday allowed officials to prohibit their use in the centre of the Dutch city, calling the contraptions a ""public order problem"". The bicycles are a popular way for tourists celebrating group events, such as stag parties, to travel around Amsterdam. Critics say they have become an example of the problems caused by mass tourism. The beer bikes are small carts that have been modified with bicycle seats arranged around a bar table. Patrons power the bike as they pedal beside the city's famous canals, while drinking beer. The ban came into force on Wednesday. A spokesman for the City Hall said operators were no longer allowed to rent out the bikes. It comes after the Amsterdam District Court said ""the beer bicycle may be banned from the city centre to stop it from being a nuisance"". Last year, about 6,000 locals signed a petition calling on the council to ban the bikes, calling them a ""terrible phenomenon"". At the time, one resident told NOS news: ""Our city has become a giant attraction park."" By Anna Holligan, BBC News You normally hear them before you see them. For some tourists these cumbersome contraptions offer the perfect way to see the city. Combining two of its attractions - alcohol and cycling. They're especially popular with stag dos. Drunken men spilling beer while trying to navigate the narrow streets on wheels have become a familiar sight in the historic heart of the city. For many residents they've become a symbol of the trouble associated with 'the wrong type of tourism'. The council recently announced plans to increase hotel taxes to try to reduce the number of budget travellers. The Dutch are famous for their cycling culture but few will miss the inebriated foreigners who commandeer these novelty vehicles, sometimes at the expense of those who use bikes as a practical and sensible way to get on with life. Amsterdam's late mayor, Eberhard van der Laan - who died last month - agreed with the residents and instituted a ban on the bikes. This was challenged in court last year by four beer bike operators, who said that the city was ""imposing on people's freedom"". Judges struck down the mayor's ban at the time, saying that it was not properly motivated. In a ruling on Tuesday, however, the judges at the Amsterdam District Court agreed with the ban. ""The combination of traffic disruptions, anti-social behaviour and the busy city centre justifies a ban,"" they said.

Signs of pancreatic cancer may be missed,"Nikki is having chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer from returning One in three adults might ignore potential symptoms of pancreatic cancer, according to a charity. Stomach ache, indigestion, unexplained weight loss and faeces that float rather than sink in the lavatory can be warning signs of the potentially deadly disease, says Pancreatic Cancer UK. Early detection and treatment are vital to save lives. Nikki Davies was diagnosed in March, aged 51. Her tumour was caught early, meaning a surgeon could remove it. ""I have been incredibly lucky that mine could be operated on and hadn't spread, as far as we can tell. ""My message to others would be that no-one knows your body like you do. ""Know what the symptoms are and talk to your GP if you notice anything that's unusual for you. ""Deep down, I think you know something is wrong. ""For me, it was the pain. It felt like an animal was eating me from the inside.  It was in my back too, between my shoulder blades. And I'd lost a lot of weight very quickly. ""I didn't know anything about pancreatic cancer before my diagnosis, and I certainly wouldn't have known what the symptoms were."" Currently, about one in 10 people diagnosed with the condition survives beyond five years. Hollywood actor Patrick Swayze died from advanced pancreatic cancer aged 57 This is in large part due to most patients being diagnosed at a late stage, when treatment options are very limited, says Pancreatic Cancer UK.

'Despicable' fraud costs NHS Â£1bn a year,"More will be done to protect the NHS in England from ""despicable"" acts of fraud, the head of the health service's new anti-fraud body has said. Sue Frith promised a crackdown as she released figures suggesting the yearly bill for fraud in the NHS topped Â£1bn. Cases include patients falsely claiming for exemptions on dental and prescription fees, and dentists charging for work they had not done. Ms Frith said the fraud takes vital funds from front line care. Ms Frith, the chief executive of the NHS Counter Fraud Authority, said it would be looking at new ways to fight the crime. The analysis by her team estimated that Â£1.25bn of fraud is being committed each year by patients, staff and contractors - the first time the health service has put a figure on total fraud committed itself. The sum represents about 1% of the NHS budget.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The two biggest single areas of fraud were related to patients and procurement of good and services, both of which was likely to cost the NHS in excess of Â£200m a year each, according to Ms Frith. She said patient fraud included cases where people wrongly claimed for exemptions for the cost of things like prescriptions and dental fees. Meanwhile, payroll fraud was thought to be costing Â£90m a year, while dentists were said to be claiming around Â£70m in work on NHS patients that has not been done. Ms Frith said: ""People may think it is just a small amount, but in large volumes it adds up and has an impact. It is criminal behaviour. ""It is despicable people would even claim things they are not entitled to. This is money that should be spent on front line patient care."" She acknowledged the NHS must do better at detecting and preventing fraud. Last year investigators successfully pursued cases worth Â£9.6m, although another Â£30m of cases are pending. But this is only a small fraction of what she suspects is out there. Ms Frith said the Â£1.25bn was probably on the conservative side - previous estimates by experts have put it even higher. She believes the new organisation, which is officially formed on Wednesday, will be able to improve on this detection rate. It has been given independent status and allowed to focus solely on fraud. Its predecessor organisation, NHS Protect, also covered security. Responsibility for security has now been devolved down to local NHS trusts and the budget for tackling fraud increased by over 10%. This will also mean more field officers to be appointed to gather evidence, as well as a greater effort on fraud prevention by reviewing contracts and systems put in place to safeguard against fraud, she said.

Five friends killed in New York attack,"This video can not be played New York terror attack: How the events unfolded Five friends from Argentina were among those killed in a truck attack in New York on Tuesday. Eight people were killed and 12 injured when the driver of the truck hit people on a cycle path in Lower Manhattan. Suspect Sayfullo Saipov, 29, an Uzbek immigrant, was shot and injured by police. He is in hospital and under arrest, and police have spoken to him. Notes in Arabic claiming the attack on behalf of the Islamic State (IS) group were recovered from the scene. New York Police Department (NYPD) Deputy Commissioner John Miller said the attacker had closely followed IS instructions from social media on how to carry out such an assault, and had been planning it for a number of weeks. It was the deadliest terror attack in the city since 11 September, 2001. From L to R: victims Alejandro DamiÃ¡n Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and HernÃ¡n Ferrucci The deaths of five Argentines were confirmed by the country's foreign ministry. They were part of a group of nine friends in New York to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their graduation from a polytechnic college in the central city of Rosario, Argentine media said. One of the men who died, steel firm owner Ariel Erlij, helped pay for the friends' trip,La NaciÃ³n newspaper reported,external(in Spanish). What we know and don't Read more on the victims Trump calls for end of green card lottery The men - all aged 48 or 49 - were named as HernÃ¡n Diego Mendoza, Diego Enrique Angelini, Alejandro DamiÃ¡n Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and HernÃ¡n Ferrucci. Another of the friends, MartÃ­n Ludovico Marro, is being treated in hospital. Three days of mourning have been declared in Rosario. Belgian officials said Anne-Laure Decadt, a 31-year-old from Staden in Flanders, was also killed. Three Belgians were wounded. Two other victims, both Americans, have not yet been named. The attacker rented the truck from a New Jersey branch of retailer Home Depot on Tuesday afternoon before driving to New York City and entering the bike lane, police said. Video cameras show the van driving at very high speed, appearing to target bike riders and pedestrians. After the van collided with a school bus, its driver emerged and brandished what appeared to be two weapons. A suspect was shot and wounded by police officer Ryan Nash, 28, one of three NYPD officers who attended the scene after being alerted by witnesses. Police say the suspect is currently being treated at Bellevue hospital, where he has been interviewed by officers. Knives, a paint gun and a pellet gun were recovered from the scene.

This image of Sayfullo Saipov was taken by police in Missouri in 2016 He arrived in America from Uzbekistan in 2010 and is a legal resident in the country. Uber confirmed he had been working as a driver for them. In pictures: New York truck attack Who is the suspect? What witnesses saw and heard Three officials said Mr Saipov had previously come to the federal authorities' attention because of an unrelated investigation, the New York Times reported. Police records show he was arrested in Missouri last year over a traffic fine. Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev told President Donald Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the attack. Uzbek officials have not yet confirmed the identity or nationality of the attacker. President Trump took to Twitter to call the attacker ""a very sick and deranged person"", adding: ""We must not allow ISIS [Islamic State] to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!"" He also announced he had ordered extreme vetting to be stepped up, without elaborating further. Mr Trump first said he wanted ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants during his presidential campaign last August. As president, he introduced a ban on arrivals to the US from a number of mainly-Muslim countries - a move that has been challenged legally and is due before the Supreme Court in the coming weeks. The American Civil Liberties Union civil rights group said the term extreme vetting was a ""euphemism for discriminating against Muslims"". Early on Monday,he called for a ""merit-based"" visa systemand attacked Democrat rival Chuck Schumer for having pushed for the creation of a diversity visa - or green card lottery - in the early 1990s.

Mr Schumer responded to Mr Trump on Twitter,external, saying: ""Always believed & cont. to believe that immigration is good for America. President Trump, instead of politicizing & dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should focus on anti-terrorism funding which he proposed cutting in his budget."" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the incident was a ""cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians"". ""We know that this action was intended to break our spirit. But we also know that New Yorkers are strong, New Yorkers are resilient and our spirit will never be moved by an act of violence and an act meant to intimidate us,"" he said.

"Take sex abuse claims to police, May urges","This video can not be played The prime minister said all staff at Westminster should be ""treated with respect"". Theresa May said any allegations about serious sexual abuse in Parliament should go to the police, as she promised a new ""independent"" process to handle complaints. The PM said she was ""deeply concerned"" by recent reports about alleged harassment and abuse at Westminster. She invited Labour's Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders to a meeting to agree a new grievance procedure. Mr Corbyn said trade unions should be involved to support staff. Two ministers, meanwhile, have denied claims on a list, thought to have been drawn up by Westminster staff and researchers, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs. Former MP 'assaulted Commons intern' Damian Green rejects 'completely false' claims Kuenssberg: Calls for change Activist 'warned' about pursuing rape claim Following a range of recent allegations, including claims of a lack of support for those making complaints, Mrs May has written to party leaders calling for the ""serious, swift, cross-party response this issue demands"". The PM said a ""common, transparent independent grievance procedure"" for all those who work in Parliament was needed and that it ""cannot be right"" for policies to vary between parties. A dedicated support team should be available to all staff, she said, and it should recommend all criminal allegations be reported to the police. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn said he was happy to meet the PM to discuss it, with a meeting scheduled for Monday evening. The SNP's Ian Blackford said his party would also work with the government ""to ensure that we have a system we can be proud of"". During PMQs, Labour's Lisa Nandy said that three years ago she had raised concerns with Mrs May that party whips' offices - whose job is to keep the party's MPs in line and voting a certain way - had used sexual abuse allegations to demand loyalty from MPs. She later tweeted the exchange in question, which related to events in the 1970s and was raised at the time the inquiry into historical child abuse was being launched. Responding at the time in 2014 Mrs May, who was home secretary, said political parties would be included in the inquiry and that ""every area where it is possible that people have been guilty of abuse"" would be looked at. Responding to Ms Nandy in PMQs, she said she would look back at the questions raised, adding: ""I will say to her that I am very clear, that the whips' office - I hope this goes for all whips' offices across this House - should make clear to people that where there are any sexual abuse allegations that could be of a criminal nature that people should go to the police. ""It is not appropriate for those to be dealt with by whips' offices; those should go to the police - that continues to be the case."" Ahead of PMQs, Mrs May's deputy, Damian Green, said allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a female activist were ""completely false"" and he said he had instructed libel lawyers. Tory activist Kate Maltby had written in the Times that he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message. Former Conservative minister Anna Soubry said Mr Green should stand down while the allegations are investigated, but Small Business Minister Margot James told BBC 5 live: ""I've read the article in the Times today, and I certainly don't think that it warrants anyone's resignation, temporary or otherwise, in my opinion."" Two other ministers, Dominic Raab and Rory Stewart, hit out at the list of unproven allegations about Tory MPs. Justice minister Mr Raab said he had sought legal advice over the ""false allegations"", which he described as a ""form of harassment"". In anarticle on his website,external, he added: ""I appreciate the Westminster list will encourage a further media feeding frenzy against MPs. I also recognise that there are undoubtedly some very disturbing allegations out there, which need to be taken seriously. ""At the same time, for anonymous individuals to compile and publish, or allow to be published, a list of vague, unsubstantiated and - in my case - false allegations is wrong. ""It is also a form of harassment and intimidation, although of course I am not suggesting it is the same or equivalent. Still, accountability should mean properly investigating any reports of abuse, without irresponsibly smearing those who have done nothing wrong."" Mr Stewart said claims about his behaviour towards a female member of staff were ""completely untrue"". The researcher publicly backed this up, saying the aid minister was ""never anything other than completely professional and an excellent employer"". Labour, meanwhile, has launched an independent investigation into an activist's claim that she was discouraged by a party official from reporting an alleged rape at a party event in 2011.

'I woke up with Kevin Spacey lying on me',"This video can not be played The man, who did not want to be identified, says he woke up with Spacey's head on his stomach A man has said he was left traumatised after waking up to find Hollywood star Kevin Spacey lying on him when he was a teenager in the 1980s. The mantold Victoria DerbyshireSpacey invited him to spend the weekend in New York but it became clear he was interested in ""a way I wasn't"". He said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but he slept on the sofa and woke up with the actor's arms around him. The BBC has contacted Spacey for a comment. John, not his real name, added he didn't believe anything sexual took place, but said: ""I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst."" Kevin Spacey is a double Oscar winner and was artistic director at London's Old Vic for 11 years The latest allegation follows Spacey's apology after US actor Anthony Rapp accused him of making a sexual advance towards him when he was 14. Rapp told how Spacey laid down on top of him in a bedroom during a party at the older man's flat in 1986. The Double Oscar-winner said he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear the story and did not remember the encounter. Other men have now come forward, accusing Spacey of sexual harassment. US filmmaker Tony Montana toldRadar Online,externalhe suffered from PTSD for six months after Spacey allegedly grabbed his crotch in a Los Angeles bar in 2003. And Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the Old Vic, claimed in a Facebook post Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors. Speaking to the programme, John said he first met the Broadway actor in 1984 at a summer theatre when he was 16. The pair exchanged letters and, a year later, when John was 17, Spacey invited him to spend a weekend at his home in New York City. John told how a ""charming and brotherly"" Spacey showed him around the city, took him out for dinner and introduced him to famous friends on their weekend together. On the first evening, Spacey talked a lot about his work and became affectionate ""in a way I certainly wasn't interested in"", he said. He put his hand on John's thigh, an arm around his shoulder and rubbed his arm. At bedtime, John said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but John insisted on sleeping on the sofa. ""It was an icy 'goodnight' with the lights off. I thought I was going to be kicked out in the morning,"" he said. ""As we went to sleep, he was sobbing from his bed,"" said John. He said he felt it was attention-seeking behaviour in an attempt to get him to respond. The following morning, John said he woke up with Spacey's head on his stomach and his arms wrapped around him. ""He was in his underwear, I was fully clothed. I supposed it was some sort of New York theatre actor 'good morning,'"" he said. After a second day enjoying New York, John said once back at the flat, Spacey became affectionate again and told him he felt ""misunderstood"". ""I burst into tears because I couldn't articulate any more what was happening to me. I was scared,"" said John. ""To his credit, he backed off and we went to sleep."" John said he is telling his story now after reading about Rapp's similar experience and he wants young people to know they should be vigilant and speak out. ""It seems he was grooming me,"" John said. ""For me, I never let on that that's what I was interested in. I never discussed it, nor did I want it. ""I was uncomfortable at best, traumatised at worst. ""He was either very stupid or predatory - or maybe a little of both."" John points out that neither of them drank any alcohol that weekend. Anthony Rapp, now 46, appeared in Star Trek: Discovery He said he didn't tell his parents or the authorities at the time because he thought Spacey's behaviour might have been ""permissible"" and worried he might have ""given off a vibe"" that he was interested in Spacey. The BBC is seeking a response from Spacey. In light of Rapp's allegations, Netflix has suspended production of political drama, House of Cards, in which Spacey stars. Meanwhile, the Old Vic, a London theatre where Spacey worked for 11 years, has set up a confidential complaints process for people involved with the theatre.

On a knife edge: Rising violence in London,"This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime Delivery rider Abla's life changed in an instant in July on his way through Tottenham, north London. After stopping at traffic lights, his moped was surrounded by five other motorbikes, two riding on the road, three on the pavement. With the lights on red, he was pushed off his scooter while being threatened with a knife. In a matter of seconds the bike was gone. ""My money has gone, my bike has gone, my job, everything,"" he said. ""I don't know what I'm going to do."" With only third party insurance, he estimates he's had Â£2,500 stolen from him. He is far from being alone. Across England and Wales an incident involving a blade or sharp object takes place, on average, every 14 minutes. Of the 37,000 incidents in the past 12 months, more than 13,000 offences were committed in London. 'Thousands' of knife crime victims aged 18 or younger The moped and scooter crime wave that has swept London Reality Check: Is crime up or down? We filmed Abla's bike being stolen. What is striking looking back at the footage is how small the robbers look on their mopeds. But the police say this is not a surprise, with the average age ofmoped criminals at just 15. Just weeks later we encounter the aftermath of another attack - this time a woman in a wheelchair assaulted in her local park after a man tried to steal her bag. Her head and arms covered in blood, she is confused and distressed. ""I couldn't see anything"", she said. ""He just said 'give me your bag'... I just don't know why people have to do these things."" The violent robbery was witnessed by a group of teenagers. One of them told us he saw violence every day and now felt hopeless. ""It's scaring people because things are happening so often, to the point where people are fearing for their lives every single day."" The capital has seen a staggering 34% rise in knife crime over the last year. Paul McKenzie has spent all his life in Tottenham. When he was 15 years old he was stabbed in the hand with a machete. Shortly afterwards he decided to start carrying a knife to protect himself. But just months later police caught him with the weapon, and he was sent to a young offender's institute. Paul McKenzie is committed to getting knives off the streets, after police caught him with a weapon Since then he has spent 20 years working with young people to educate them about the dangers of drugs, gangs, knives and guns. He said most of the young people he speaks to in his workshops carry knives for protection. ""What you're finding is - and this has come out of the mouth of a few young people I've spoken to - that teenagers actually know people who can stitch [their wounds] up."" ""A lot of the knife crimes are not reported because nobody wants to be involved with the police."" Mr McKenzie said that as well as the fear of 'snitching' there is a lack of faith that an investigation will lead to a prosecution. The BBC has learnt that police forces across England and Wales are charging fewer people for knife crimes at the same time as offences are rising. Freedom of Information (FOI) responses from 30 out of 43 police forces showed that the number of knife crime offences that led to offenders being charged or summoned to court had fallen by eight per cent between 2015 and 2016. But in Northern Ireland, knife crime is down for the second successive year. Police in Scotland only began collating comprehensive knife crime figures in April. Prior to this, statistics were kept for possession of a knife - this has remained stable for the last few years. Mr McKenzie regularly gets tip-offs about the public places where knives are hidden by people to use when they might need them at short notice. As he walks around a park in Enfield, north London, it takes him just minutes to find what he is looking for. ""That could be the difference between someone living and dying right there, because now I know that's not going to go into somebody's chest."" The Metropolitan Police say people carry knives for many reasons - for some it's because they mistakenly believe it offers them protection. One man the BBC spoke to, who carries a Rambo-style knife and does not want to be identified, said he felt safer when carrying a blade. He admitted to seeing multiple friends injured from knife crime - some of them have died. He added: ""It makes you know that you have to keep a knife with you, because it's a part of life now."" Perhaps the most striking feature of the increase in extreme violence is the number of young people involved. Statistics show a third of all those accused of offences where a gun was fired (237 out of 668) in London since 2012 were aged 19 or under. Forty-five of the offences were committed by people aged under 14. The increase in violent crime does not only involve knives. Gun crime offences still remain below historic highs of March 2007 - when they were 31% higher than today - but the increase over the last three years is marked. Gun crime across England and Wales has increased by 27% over the last year and in London is 42% higher. One-in-six of the victims of gun crime in London in the first eight months of this year was aged 17 or under. The Metropolitan Police is trying to tackle the issue using stop-and-search. In a statement the Met said it regards it as an ""invaluable tool"" that takes several thousand weapons off the streets each year, and has been backed by Commissioner Cressida Dick. The force says it has changed the way they use stop-and-search and complaints have fallen by over 60%. But the tactic can cause tension. Friends ofJordan Malutshi, a 17-year-old stabbed to death in 2012, were stopped and searched at a memorial barbecue at Patmore Estate in Wandsworth, south London. An officer told us there had been three murders locally within a matter of weeks as a result of knife crime. But one of Jordan's friends, calling himself Abs, claimed the search amounted to racial profiling. A stop-and-search was used on a Wandsworth estate for the first time in three years as people began arriving to Jordan Malutshi's memorial He said he thought the group was stopped because the police saw ""four black youths in a car, in a nice car"". The BBC has learned that 65% of all people who face criminal proceedings for knife crime in London are from ethnic minorities, and 42% are black. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said tackling violent crime is her priority. In a statement to the BBC, she expressed her ""anger"" at ""the apparent perception amongst some criminals that they could operate with near impunity"".

Rate rise impact on homeowners 'modest',"The impact of a small rise in interest rates is likely to be modest for most UK households, according to mortgage lender Nationwide. The Bank of England has been widely tipped to increase rates for the first time in a decade on Thursday. If rates do go up from 0.25% to 0.5%, the effect will be smaller than in the past because more homeowners are on fixed mortgages, Nationwide said. It comes as house prices rose by 0.2% in October,according to Nationwide.,external The average price of a house in the UK rose by Â£284 to Â£211,085. Annual house price growth edged up to 2.5% from 2.3% in September. Is now the time to raise rates? How would a rate rise affect me? Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said the share of mortgages on variable rates - and so likely to see higher payments if the Bank Rate is increased - has fallen to a record low of about 40%, down from a peak of 70% in 2001. ""Moreover, a 0.25% increase in rates is likely to have a modest impact on most borrowers who are on variable rates,"" Mr Gardner said. He estimated such a rate rise would increase monthly payments by Â£15 to Â£665 for the average mortgage, or an extra Â£180 a year. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club consultancy, said a rate rise could weigh on the housing market. ""Housing market activity remains under pressure from squeezed consumer purchasing power, fragile confidence and appreciable caution over engaging in major transactions,"" he said. In its latest update on the housing market, the Nationwide also said the UK's departure from the European Union could affect demand. ""With the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and the rights of EU citizens once the UK leaves the EU, we may see a slowing in housing demand (and particularly rental demand) in the years ahead,"" Mr Gardner said. Population growth has fuelled housing demand in recent years, the building society said, with international migration accounting for almost two-thirds of the 11% increase in England's population rise between 2001 and 2015. That has affected the number of residents privately renting properties.  ""Recent migrants are more likely to privately rent than live in social housing or their own home,"" said Mr Gardner. The biggest impact has been in London. ""There is a regional dynamic, with migrants accounting for a much higher proportion of the private renting population in London than elsewhere in England,"" he said.

Woman jailed over tram push death,"Charissa Brown-Wellington was sentenced to five years in prison A woman who killed a stranger by pushing him into the path of a tram during a drunken row has been jailed. Charissa Brown-Wellington, 31, shoved Philip Carter, 30, between two carriages at Manchester Victoria stationon 11 June. Mr Carter, from Blackley, was crushed by the tram and died at the scene. Brown-Wellington, from Chadderton, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was given a five-year prison term at Manchester Crown Court. The court heard that Brown-Wellington was drunk and under the influence of drugs when she became involved in an argument with Mr Carter, who had also been drinking, at the station. She admitted pushing him but denied intending to cause him serious harm. The court heard she had a lengthy criminal record of 65 offences, many of which involved violence. In sentencing, Mr Justice William Davis told Brown-Wellington that although her actions were not unprovoked they were ""completely unnecessary"" and ""aggressive"". ""There was more than one victim in this case because the effect of what you did was so dreadful. ""It is merely yet another example of you reacting violently when faced with something you did not like very much,"" he said. Philip Carter was crushed to death by a tram Mr Carter's family said he was ""missed every minute of every day"". ""We can try to repair our heartache although no matter how long the sentence is, it will not bring Phil back or make our loss any easier,"" they said. On her release, Brown-Wellington will be subject to an extended licence period of three years as a dangerous offender. Bob Tonge, senior investigating officer at Greater Manchester Police, said Mr Carter died in ""the most horrific circumstances"". ""He suffered a brutal death all because she lost her temper and she will now have to live with that as she carries out her prison sentence,"" he said.

A few nights of bad sleep upsets brain,"Thanks to the clocks going back, many of us managed to grab a little bit of extra shut-eye over the weekend. And that's no bad thing because, as a country, we seem to be chronically sleep-deprived. According to the Sleep Council, the average Briton gets six-and-a-half hours sleep a night, which for most people is not enough. Lots of studies have shown that cutting back on sleep, deliberately or otherwise, can have a serious impact on our bodies. A few nights of bad sleep can really mess with our blood sugar control and encourage us to overeat. It even messes with our DNA. A few years ago,Trust Me I'm a Doctor did an experiment with Surrey University, asking volunteers to cut down on their sleep by an hour a night for a week. Dr Simon Archer, who helped run the experiment, found that getting an hour's less sleep a night affected the activity of a wide range of our volunteers' genes (around 500 in all) including some which are associated with inflammation and diabetes. So the negative effects on our bodies of sleep deprivation are clear. But what effect does lack of sleep have on our mental health? To find out Trust Me teamed up with sleep scientists at the University of Oxford to run a small experiment. This time, we recruited four volunteers who normally sleep soundly. We fitted them with devices to accurately monitor their sleep and then, for the first three nights of our study, let them get a full, undisturbed eight hours. For the next three nights, however, we restricted their sleep to just four hours. Each day our volunteers filled in a psychological questionnaire designed to reveal any changes in their mood or emotions. They also kept video diaries. So what happened? Sarah  Reeve, a doctoral student who ran the experiment for us was surprised by how quickly their mood changed. ""There were increases in anxiety, depression and stress, also increases in paranoia and feelings of mistrust about other people"", she said. ""Given that this happened after only three nights of sleep deprivation, that is pretty impressive."" Three of our four volunteers found the experience unpleasant, but one of them - Josh - claimed to be largely unaffected. ""This week probably hasn't taken as much of a toll as I thought it would on me,"" he said. ""I feel perfectly fine - not happy, sad, stressed or anything."" Yet the tests we did on him showed something very different. His positive emotions fell sharply after two nights of disturbed sleep, while negative emotions began to rise. So even though he felt OK there were signs that he was, mentally, beginning to suffer. The outcome of our small test reflects the results ofa much bigger study looking at the impact of sleep deprivation on the mental health of students,external. Researchers recruited more than 3,700 university students from across the UK who had reported problems sleeping and randomised them into two groups. One group received six sessions of online CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) aimed at improving their sleep; the other group got standard advice. Ten weeks into the study, the students who received CBT reported a halving in rates of insomnia, accompanied by significant improvements in scores for depression and anxiety, plus big reductions in paranoia and hallucinations. This is thought to be the largest ever randomised controlled trial of a psychological treatment for mental health, and it strongly suggests that insomnia can cause mental health problems rather than simply be a consequence of them. Daniel Freeman, professor of clinical psychology at Oxford University, who led that study thinks one of the reasons why sleep deprivation is so bad for our brains is because it encourages repetitive negative thinking. ""We have more negative thoughts when we're sleep-deprived and we get stuck in them,"" he said. Reassuringly he doesn't think a few nights of bad sleep means you will become mentally ill. But he does think it increases the risk. ""It's certainly not inevitable,"" he said. ""In any one night, one in three people is having difficulty sleeping, perhaps 5% to 10% of the general population has insomnia, and many people get on with their lives and they cope with it. But it does raise the risk of a whole range of mental health difficulties."" The positive side of this research is it implies that helping people get a good night's sleep will go a long way to helping improve our sense of well-being. Norbert Schwarz, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, has even put a figure on it. He claims: ""Making $60,000 (Â£48,400) more in annual income has less of an effect on your daily happiness than getting one extra hour of sleep a night."" So, sleep well.

Arron Banks faces referendum finance probe,"The Electoral Commission says it is investigating whether ex-UKIP donor Arron Banks  broke donation rules during the EU referendum. The probe will look at whether the Leave.EU chairman broke the rules over donations or loans made to campaigners. It will also look at Better for the Country Ltd, a company of which Mr Banks is a registered director. Mr Banks said that a judge-led inquiry was needed ""to clear this nonsense up once and for all"". The commission said it launched investigations where there were ""reasonable grounds"" to believe offences had been committed. It is already carrying out separate probes into the spending returns submitted by the official Remain and Leave campaigns. Announcing the latest investigation, the commission said Better for the Country Ltd (BFTC) had made donations totalling Â£2.3m to campaigners in June 2016's referendum, while Mr Banks had given Leave.EU loans totalling Â£6m. The commission said its investigation would look at: Whether BFTC was the ""true source of donations made to referendum campaigners in its name, or if it was acting as an agent"". Whether recipients of the donations were given the required information about the donor What steps the recipients took to verify BFTC's ""identity and permissibility"" Whether or not Mr Banks was the ""true source"" of loans reported in his name Whether the recipients of the loans acted within the rules Whether any individual ""facilitated a transaction with a non-qualifying person"" Bob Posner of the Electoral Commission said: ""Interest in the funding of the EU referendum campaigns remains widespread. ""Questions over the legitimacy of funding provided to campaigners at the referendum risks causing harm to voters' confidence. ""It is therefore in the public interest that the Electoral Commission seeks to ascertain whether or not impermissible donations were given to referendum campaigners and if any other related offences have taken place."" In a statement issued by Leave.EU, Mr Banks said: ""We believe that a judge-led inquiry reporting to Parliament that investigates the main campaign groups, Vote Leave, Britain Stronger In Europe and Leave.EU would be the best way to clear this nonsense up once and for all."" He said it should also cover why the Electoral Commission allowed a leaflet to be sent by the government to each home in the UK just before the referendum spending cut-off date. Mr Banks added: ""The 'Remain' Electoral Commission isn't up to the job and consists of political placemen from all main parties. ""This is the Remain establishment once again trying to discredit the result and it's all starting to get rather boring.""

Who is New York attack suspect?,"This video can not be played New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov? Sayfullo Saipov, the main suspect in Tuesday's New York truck attack that killed eight people and injured 12, arrived in the US from Uzbekistan in 2010 and is married with three children. He became a legal permanent resident of the US through a lottery programme that grants green cards annually to foreign nationals, in an effort to diversify the country's immigrant population. A day after the attack, Mr Saipov admitted to investigators that he had been inspired by propaganda from so-called Islamic State (IS). Speaking to the BBC, US-based Uzbek religious activist and blogger Mirrakhmat Muminov, who met Mr Saipov in Ohio soon after he arrived in the US, said the suspect was radicalised online and had become increasingly aggressive. ""He was not well educated and had no knowledge of the Koran before arriving in the US,"" he said. ""At the beginning of his time here he was a normal sort of person."" In pictures: New York truck attack 'He was revving - I saw him hit people' Why Uzbek migrants are radicalised But Mr Muminov said that Mr Saipov had become depressed, separated from his community and more resentful and angry after failing to find work as a driver. ""Because of his radical views he frequently used to argue with other Uzbeks and moved to Florida,"" Mr Muminov said. ""From then onwards I lost contact with him."" He had never been the subject of an NYPD or FBI intelligence investigation, according to John Miller, deputy commissioner for the New York Police Department. However, the New York Times, citing three officials, said the suspect had previously come to the attention of federal authorities via an unrelated probe. The back patio of the apartment building in Florida where Sayfullo Saipov was a resident Born in Uzbekistan in February 1988, Mr Saipov emigrated to the US in 2010 after winning a green card via the lottery and is believed to have lived in Ohio, Florida, and New Jersey since. Mr Muminov said there were about 70,000 people from Uzbekistan now living in the US, with the overwhelming majority in New York City but also smaller populations in Florida - mostly in Orlando - and in Chicago and Ohio. According to the New York Times,Mr Saipov arrived in the country with a poor command of English,externaland sought work as a truck and Uber taxi driver. ""He was a very good person when I knew him,"" Uzbek immigrant Kobiljon Matkarov - who met Mr Saipov in Florida several years ago - told the newspaper. ""He liked the US. He seemed very lucky and all the time he was happy and talking like everything is OK. He did not seem like a terrorist, but I did not know him from the inside."" Sayfullo Saipov appeared in court in a wheelchair Mr Saipov was shot and injured by a police officer and appeared in court in a wheelchair a day after the attack. He told investigators he had been planning the attack for a year, and intentionally chose Halloween because he believed there would be more people in the streets. Authorities found 90 graphic and violent propaganda videos on his phone - one that showed IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi talking about Muslims avenging deaths in Iraq. Officials say a note was found in the truck that referred to IS, but New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said it was likely the suspect had acted alone and there was no evidence to suggest a wider plot. Witnesses said they heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"" - Arabic for ""God is greatest"" - when he emerged from his vehicle after the killings. Federal prosecutors charged Mr Saipov on two counts: providing material support and resources to IS and violence and destruction of motor vehicles. President Donald Trump has denounced him as ""very sick"" and a ""deranged person"". He is reported to have been living most recently in Paterson, New Jersey, about 40km (25 miles) north-west of the scene of the attack. The truck involved was rented from nearby Passaic, a former industrial hub just south of Paterson. About 25,000 to 30,000 Muslims live in the city, the New York Times reported, giving it one of the highest concentrations of Muslims in the New York City area. Uzbekistan has over the last 20 years taken a hard line against Islamic extremism. Mr Saipov is not be the first person from the Central Asian country to be accused of plotting terror attacks in the US. Last montha Brooklyn man of Uzbek origin was sentenced to 15 years in prison,externalfor plotting terrorist attacks, including threats to kill Barack Obama.

Allegations 'completely false' - Green,"Prime Minister Theresa May's deputy, Damian Green, has said allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a female activist are ""completely false"". Mr Green has instructed libel lawyers over the claims, the BBC understands. Tory activist Kate Maltby wrote in the Times that he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message. The cabinet secretary is to investigate whether Mr Green broke the ministerial code. Ms Maltby, 31, a writer and academic, said Mr Green, 61, said he had sent her the text message after she posed in a corset for the Times. Laura Kuenssberg: Calls for change in Westminster culture MPs speak out about Westminster harassment claims PM vows to tackle Westminster abuse According to her article in the paper, it read: ""Long time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favourite tabloid I felt impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?"" The encounters left her feeling ""awkward, embarrassed and professionally compromised"", she wrote. Mr Green, now first secretary of state, and Theresa May's effective deputy, said he had known Ms Maltby since 2014 and the pair ""had a drink as friends twice-yearly"". ""The text I sent after she appeared in a newspaper article was sent in that spirit - as two friends agreeing to meet for a regular catch up - and nothing more,"" he said. ""This untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful, especially from someone I considered a personal friend."" He also denied the claim he put his hand on Ms Maltby's knee. Asked about the claims in the Times as he left his home on Wednesday morning, Mr Green told reporters: ""All these allegations are completely false."" Theministerial code,externalrequires ministers to ""behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety"". Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, Small Business Minister Margot James said there was no need for Mr Green to resign during the cabinet secretary's investigation. ""I've read the article in the Times today, and I certainly don't think that it warrants anyone's resignation, temporary or otherwise, in my opinion,"" she said. This video can not be played William Hague tells Today he hopes Westminster is entering an era of greater accountability It comes as allegations and rumours relating to sexual harassment and abuse by MPs swirl around Westminster. On Tuesday, Labour confirmed it had launched an independent inquiry into claims that activist Bex Bailey, 25, was discouraged by a party official from reporting an alleged rape at a Labour event in 2011. She told the BBC she had waived her anonymity to urge changes to the way such cases are handled. In a separate case, an anonymous woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by an MP on a foreign work trip last year told the Guardianher allegations were not taken seriously,external. Earlier this week, a spokesman for Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon confirmed he was once rebuked by a journalist for putting his hand on her knee during dinner. Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a list, thought to have been compiled by staff and researchers at Westminster, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs and ministers. Among the claims are a number of serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour with junior members of staff, the use of prostitutes and affairs between MPs. The government has promised urgent action to improve the handling of complaints about the way MPs' staff are treated.

The mysterious 'braid choppers' of Kashmir,"Tasleema Rouf, 35, was on the top storey of her house in Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, when she says she saw a man's shadow. Before she could react, she says, she was attacked. When she tried to scream for help, he tried to strangle her. She fell unconscious. That's how her husband found her - lying on the floor, with some of her hair chopped off. At least 40 instances of hair chopping have been reported in the state of Jammu and Kashmir since 6 September, sparking off hysteria and protests. The situation is so volatile that even schools and colleges were shut briefly. This isn't the first time that ""braid chopping"" attacks have made headlines in India. More than 50 women in the northern states of Haryana and Rajasthan had reported in August that their braids werechopped offwhile they were unconscious. But given Kashmir'svolatile relationshipwith India's federal government, the attacks here have led to violence, vigilantism and allegations against both Indian security forces and separatists. Tasleema Rouf is seen crying after she was attacked and her hair chopped off Little is known about who is behind the attacks. Most of the women said they were knocked unconscious and woke up to find that their hair had been cut. Some said their attackers wore masks. None of the women saw the culprits. This woman, who didn't want to be identified, agreed to be photographed for this article lying next to her cut hair. She says she was attacked outside her home early in the morning. Her gold chain was snatched, but the attacker did not take the braid that had been cut - as in every other incident, it was left behind. The so-called ""braid chopping"" has set off panic in the state, sparking several protests. India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which shares power with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in Jammu and Kashmir, has alleged that the ""braid chopping"" attacks are being used as a ""new tool by separatists and anti-nationals to vitiate peace"". It has demanded a judicial inquiry. Activist Ahsan Antoo protested against the attacks, which are being seen as a ""humiliation"" of Kashmiri women. The opposition National Conference party accused the state government of failing to protect the ""dignity"" of their ""mothers, daughters and sisters.""  Even militant group Hizbul Mujahideen has weighed in, alleging that this is a ""ploy"" by the Indian government to ""counter militant attacks"" as paranoid locals are now more likely to report militants passing through their village. Protests have often ended in clashes between security forces and civilians. Amid the increasing pressure, Kashmir police have created a ""special investigative team"" to catch the attackers. They also announced a 600,000 rupee ($9,228; Â£7,000) award. But separatists accuse Indian security forces of planning these attacks to ""intimidate"" Kashmiris who are demanding independence from India. Young men across the state have also formed vigilante groups, with sometimes tragic results. Vigilantes killed a 70-year-old man who they mistook for a ""braid chopper"". Six foreign tourists, including a British national, were also threatened by a mob in Srinagar. Waseem Ahmad was brutally beaten by a vigilante mob in north Kashmir because they suspected him of being a ""braid chopper"". He says they tried to burn him alive but he was rescued by the police. This elderly man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, installed a CCTV camera in his home after he says his daughter-in-law's hair was chopped off on two different occasions over three days.

Play it again: The firm saving vinyl,"This video can not be played How a small company in the Czech Republic became the world's largest maker of vinyl records Whether gathering dust in your loft or currently spinning on your turntable, it's a fair bet that at least some of your vinyl records came from a small factory in the Czech Republic. The facility in question is the headquarters of GZ Media, based in the small town of Lodenice, 25km (16 miles) west of the Czech capital, Prague. GZ is today the world's largest producer of vinyl records, of which it expects to press 30 million this year, for everyone from the Rolling Stones and U2, to Lady Gaga and Madonna. The success of the company is a far cry from the early 1990s, when vinyl records appeared to be on the way out, with music fans having switched en masse to compact discs. Back in the early 1970s more than three-quarters of album sales were on vinyl, but by the 1990s that had plunged to just 1.5%. Producing vinyl records is a multi-step process ""In 1993 our output was at its lowest, vinyl was almost dead,"" says GZ's chief executive Michal Sterba. ""If we'd have stayed as a vinyl-only producer in the 90s, GZ would be no more."" The operation had only become a private company two years earlier after the fall of communism. Prior to that it had been a state-run enterprise called Gramofonove Zavody (Gramophone Record Factory) which had started in 1951, and had pressed records for the world's largest music companies. With demand for vinyl having dwindled, GZ realised that it had to diversify to survive, so it branched out into printing and making packaging for consumer goods. Michal Sterba is now expanding GZ, with new sister factories in the US and Canada Crucially though, it kept pressing vinyl to satisfy what little demand there was. At the lowest point in 1993 it made just 350,000 discs. ""We wanted to be the last company standing in the field of vinyl record production,"" says Mr Sterba. So when the resurgence of vinyl began around 2010, GZ was in a position to take advantage of it. Unlike most rivals, GZ still had the vinyl-making equipment and the expertise. Its successful diversification also gave it the cash to invest. The company has also seen a rising demand for picture discs Mr Sterba says: ""Our competitors could buy machinery and materials, but the know-how is very hard to acquire."" The firm's printing and packing capabilities give it another advantage over its rivals, he adds: ""As well as producing the actual vinyl discs, GZ also makes the packaging, prints the artwork and any extras such as posters or booklet."" One particularly tough job, he recalls, was producing a real metal zip on the cover of the reissued Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers album. The original music, on tape or a digital file, is transferred to a diamond-tipped cutter This cuts a groove of the music into a steel disc coated in a layer of copper just 100 microns thick This master disc is then placed into a solution of nickel salt though which an electric current flows. This forms a layer of nickel on top of the copper The nickel layer is then peeled off, and has ridges that are a mirror image of the grooves on the master disk. This nickel plate forms the ""stamper"" that will imprint the vinyl Next the vinyl compound (a type of plastic) is heated to 160C, and the stamper is pressed into it with the weight of more than 100 tonnes, to produce one side of a vinyl record To keep up with demand, GZ Media's Czech factory now runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and employs 1,600 permanent workers. It's a fast-paced operation at every stage of the production process; from the initial stamping to the high-speed ballet of forklifts loading trucks for delivery. The company has invested $20m in equipment, building 12 new presses, but the old still runs alongside the new. GZ's Czech factory has a permanent workforce of 1,600 plus 400 seasonal workers Bright white, computer-controlled stations sit next to their huge, pale-green iron counterparts, still dripping oil into trays and buckets. GZ's revenues this year are expected to total $110m (Â£83m), and are growing by 9-10% per year. Meanwhile, its vinyl output has tripled since 2010. For the industry as a whole, globalsales of vinyl records are expected to reach $1bn in value this year.,externalThis may be just 6% of total music industry revenues butvinyl sales are now at a 25-year high. With most of its customers in North America, GZ recently bought a vinyl plant in Memphis, Tennessee, to supplement its Czech production. It has also opened a production facility in Ontario, Canada. Staff at the factory listen to the records to test them GZ still makes albums for small indie bands - the punk and metal bands that kept the company going in the 1990s, but now it also works with massive global stars. ""We'll still press 100 records for a small metal band,"" says Mr Sterba, ""but we're also pressing 100,000 for U2."" ""As for the future,"" he says, ""we're concentrating on making a success of our plants in North America. But in the longer term, we think manufacturing in Asia and preferably Japan [as well], is the right thing to do."" This is the third story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market. Click here for more Connected Commerce features Yet, while vinyl sales are growing, some who buy the records don't actually play them. Last yeara BBC/ICM poll found 48% of those questioned said they'd never played the vinyl they'd boughtand 7% said they didn't even own a turntable. These fans buy a vinyl album for the ""feel"" of owning a physical object and for the artwork that often comes with it - but they never actually play it. Staff at GZ had to add a real metal zip to the cover of the Rolling Stones album Sticky Fingers While vinyl sales are growing, they remain tiny compared with their 1980s heyday, says Paul Lee, a music industry expert at accountancy group Deloitte. ""Vinyl's first and biggest peak was back in the 80s when a billion records, just albums were sold per year. This year we're expecting about 40 million, so it's about one 25th... so it is nothing like that we had back in the 80s."" The company can make vinyl records in any colour Mr Lee adds: ""The reality is vinyl is a lovely product, it's also very difficult to consume compared to just tapping in the name of a song on a smart phone... so we would expect the market to be approaching a peak."" Yet with music giant Sony announcing earlier this year that it was to re-open its vinyl manufacturing plant in Japan for the first time since 1989, it doesn't look like the vinyl revival is coming to an end any time soon.

Royal Navy ships 'cannibalised for parts',"The building of third Astute submarine, HMS Artful, was delayed because parts were taken during its construction A shortage of spares for Royal Navy warships and submarines has forced the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to strip parts from the rest of the fleet, the National Audit Office (NAO) has found. An NAO investigation found equipment ""cannibalisation"" had increased by 49% over the past five years. The spending watchdog warned that the practice was costing the MoD millions of pounds and delayed construction. The MoD said components were only swapped when ""absolutely necessary"". Currently, the Navy has 19 frigates and destroyers and seven attack submarines - but at times they lack the spare parts they need to go to sea. The NAO said building thethird Astute class submarine, HMS Artful, was delayed by 42 days because parts were taken during its construction - adding nearly Â£5m to the overall cost. The vessel, built in Barrow in Cumbria,completed its maiden dive in 2014. The NAO found that, last year, there were 795 instances when spare parts had to be removed from one vessel and given to another - the equivalent of 66 a month, up from 30 a month in 2005. Between April 2012 and March 2017, there were 3,230 instances involving 6,378 parts, their investigation found. The NAO report noted that in some circumstances, such as during high-intensity operations, cannibalisation could be the most effective way to keep vessels at sea. But it said it also increased costs. The NAO said the MoD itself had identified that cannibalisation had affected submarines currently in production ""leading to an estimated Â£40m cost increase"". The watchdog said cuts to the maritime support budget, along with the MoD's failure to monitor the practice, had exacerbated the problem. ""In the past two years, the Navy has removed an estimated Â£92m from its maritime support in-year budgets,"" the report said. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""Less than 0.5% of parts we use come from swapping components, and we only do this when it's absolutely necessary to get ships out of port and back on to operations more quickly. ""We continue to make improvements to how we manage this long-established practice.""

Australia to ban Uluru climb from 2019,"Uluru is a sacred site for Aboriginal Australians Climbing on Australia's iconic Uluru landmark will be banned from October 2019, local authorities have confirmed. The board of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park voted unanimously to end the climb because of indigenous sensitivities. The giant red monolith in the Northern Territory is a sacred site for Aboriginal Australians. Local people have long asked visitors not to climb the outcrop, which was known for many years as Ayers Rock. Signs at the start of the climb ask people to abstain from going up in respect to the traditional law of the Anangu Aboriginal people, the custodians of the land. ""It is an extremely important place, not a playground or theme park like Disneyland,"" board chairman and Anangu man Sammy Wilson said on Wednesday. ""If I travel to another country and there is a sacred site, an area of restricted access, I don't enter or climb it, I respect it. "" Tourists climbing Uluru in 2005 He said the Anangu people had felt intimidation over the years to keep the climb open because it was a top tourist attraction. However the group had consistently wanted to close the site, a sacred men's area, because of its cultural significance. ""Closing the climb is not something to feel upset about but a cause for celebration. Let's come together; let's close it together,"" he said. The board was made up of eight traditional owners as well as four government officials. Stunning vision of Uluru Only 16% of visitors made the climb between 2011 to 2015, according to the board's data. The Unesco World Heritage-listed monolith was handed back to its traditional owners in 1985. The ban will commence on 26 October, 2019 - the 34th anniversary of the handover. Tourism Central Australia said it supported the decision, pointing out that the public could still access much of the site respectfully. However, not all have supported the idea of a ban. Last year, Northern TerritoryChief Minister Adam Giles sparked debatewhen he described the suggestion as ""ludicrous. ""We should explore the idea of creating a climb with stringent safety conditions and rules enforcing spiritual respect,"" said Mr Giles, who is Aboriginal. However weather and safety concerns have also led to the climb being frequently closed over the past 12 months. Since the 1950s, at least 35 people have died on the trek. This recent push for the climb's ban was outlined in the park's 2010-2020 management plan, where it was proposed the climb be closed if attendance numbers dropped under 20% and other visitor activities were successfully established. More than 250,000 people visit Uluru each year, according to the national park's website. Drone captures stunning view of Uluru.

Bake Off winner is named (officially),"Kate, Steven and Sophie did battle in the Bake Off final Warning: This story contains spoilers This year's Great British Bake Off winner has been revealed on Channel 4 - 11 hours after judge Prue Leith accidentally let it slip on Twitter. Sophie Faldo triumphed over Kate Lyon and Steven Carter-Bailey in the final after wowing the judges with her seven-layered, honey bee-themed entremet showstopper. However the outcome had been spoiled for some fans when Prue earlier mistakenly tweeted: ""Bravo Sophie"". She apologised and explained that she had been confused by the time difference because she was in Bhutan. Leith accidentally reveals Bake Off winner Channel 4's Bake Off risk has paid off Meet the Great British Bake Off finalists Sophie described her victory as ""pretty mega"" and ""beyond anything I'd thought or dreamed of"". The former Army officer said her time in the tent had been ""very surreal"", adding: ""I hadn't allowed myself to think that I could win it up to that moment in time when they said my name and then the enormity of it hit me."" After 10 weeks, the contest all came down to the showstoppers after the first two rounds of the final were pretty close. The entremet - a fiendish multi-layered creation using at least five elements - was ""the most unforgiving showstopper in Bake Off history"", we were told. Sophie's was titled ""ode to the honey bee"" and was described as ""amazing"" by Prue, who complimented her choice of flavours. ""Lemon and lavender has got to be THE new taste"", she declared. Before that, Sophie had been sandwiched between Steven and Kate when the signature and technical rounds were judged. In the signature, her 12 small loaves were passable enough - even if Paul reckoned her ciabatta looked more like naan bread. And in the technical, she came second with her ginger biscuits. The only thing that fell totally flat - literally - was the yoga pose she attempted on the kitchen floor. Kate impressed in the signature and showstopper but the fact she didn't have time to finish icing her biscuits in the technical might have cost her the title. However it did save her from having to cartwheel naked through the tent, as she promised Noel she would if she won. Her mini loaves were the most impressive in the first round, with her coconut kala chana tasting ""divine"", according to Paul, who said he might copy her filling. And her striking white chocolate, yuzu and lychee entremet showstopper was ""a little stroke of genius"", according to Prue. ""I'd eat that all day,"" Paul drooled. After looking like he might run away with the contest early in the series, Steven's final was as uneven as a badly-baked Battenberg. In the signature, his roasted garlic and fontina loaves tasted ""disappointing"", Prue said, and Paul said they looked awful. His spelt and rye bread was also underproved. Steven looked like he had turned things around with the ginger biscuits in the technical, which were iced and shaped more impressively than his rivals'. But his yin and yang showstopper, featuring 14 elements, proved too testing. He tried to stay calm, taking time out to do deep breathing and have his brow mopped by Sandi Toksvig. But it wasn't enough to get him back on track. The way the layers bled into each other ""upset"" Paul, who added: ""This all comes down to timing - as I've said before."" At the end of the final, viewers were given updates on what all 12 contestants had done since the show was filmed, and were told that Sophie and Steven were BBFFs (best baking friends forever).

'You have to keep a knife with you.. it's a part of life now',"This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime Delivery rider Abla's life changed in an instant in July on his way through Tottenham, north London. After stopping at traffic lights, his moped was surrounded by five other motorbikes, two riding on the road, three on the pavement. With the lights on red, he was pushed off his scooter while being threatened with a knife. In a matter of seconds the bike was gone. ""My money has gone, my bike has gone, my job, everything,"" he said. ""I don't know what I'm going to do."" With only third party insurance, he estimates he's had Â£2,500 stolen from him. He is far from being alone. Across England and Wales an incident involving a blade or sharp object takes place, on average, every 14 minutes. Of the 37,000 incidents in the past 12 months, more than 13,000 offences were committed in London. 'Thousands' of knife crime victims aged 18 or younger The moped and scooter crime wave that has swept London Reality Check: Is crime up or down? We filmed Abla's bike being stolen. What is striking looking back at the footage is how small the robbers look on their mopeds. But the police say this is not a surprise, with the average age ofmoped criminals at just 15. Just weeks later we encounter the aftermath of another attack - this time a woman in a wheelchair assaulted in her local park after a man tried to steal her bag. Her head and arms covered in blood, she is confused and distressed. ""I couldn't see anything"", she said. ""He just said 'give me your bag'... I just don't know why people have to do these things."" The violent robbery was witnessed by a group of teenagers. One of them told us he saw violence every day and now felt hopeless. ""It's scaring people because things are happening so often, to the point where people are fearing for their lives every single day."" The capital has seen a staggering 34% rise in knife crime over the last year. Paul McKenzie has spent all his life in Tottenham. When he was 15 years old he was stabbed in the hand with a machete. Shortly afterwards he decided to start carrying a knife to protect himself. But just months later police caught him with the weapon, and he was sent to a young offender's institute. Paul McKenzie is committed to getting knives off the streets, after police caught him with a weapon Since then he has spent 20 years working with young people to educate them about the dangers of drugs, gangs, knives and guns. He said most of the young people he speaks to in his workshops carry knives for protection. ""What you're finding is - and this has come out of the mouth of a few young people I've spoken to - that teenagers actually know people who can stitch [their wounds] up."" ""A lot of the knife crimes are not reported because nobody wants to be involved with the police."" Mr McKenzie said that as well as the fear of 'snitching' there is a lack of faith that an investigation will lead to a prosecution. The BBC has learnt that police forces across England and Wales are charging fewer people for knife crimes at the same time as offences are rising. Freedom of Information (FOI) responses from 30 out of 43 police forces showed that the number of knife crime offences that led to offenders being charged or summoned to court had fallen by eight per cent between 2015 and 2016. But in Northern Ireland, knife crime is down for the second successive year. Police in Scotland only began collating comprehensive knife crime figures in April. Prior to this, statistics were kept for possession of a knife - this has remained stable for the last few years. Mr McKenzie regularly gets tip-offs about the public places where knives are hidden by people to use when they might need them at short notice. As he walks around a park in Enfield, north London, it takes him just minutes to find what he is looking for. ""That could be the difference between someone living and dying right there, because now I know that's not going to go into somebody's chest."" The Metropolitan Police say people carry knives for many reasons - for some it's because they mistakenly believe it offers them protection. One man the BBC spoke to, who carries a Rambo-style knife and does not want to be identified, said he felt safer when carrying a blade. He admitted to seeing multiple friends injured from knife crime - some of them have died. He added: ""It makes you know that you have to keep a knife with you, because it's a part of life now."" Perhaps the most striking feature of the increase in extreme violence is the number of young people involved. Statistics show a third of all those accused of offences where a gun was fired (237 out of 668) in London since 2012 were aged 19 or under. Forty-five of the offences were committed by people aged under 14. The increase in violent crime does not only involve knives. Gun crime offences still remain below historic highs of March 2007 - when they were 31% higher than today - but the increase over the last three years is marked. Gun crime across England and Wales has increased by 27% over the last year and in London is 42% higher. One-in-six of the victims of gun crime in London in the first eight months of this year was aged 17 or under. The Metropolitan Police is trying to tackle the issue using stop-and-search. In a statement the Met said it regards it as an ""invaluable tool"" that takes several thousand weapons off the streets each year, and has been backed by Commissioner Cressida Dick. The force says it has changed the way they use stop-and-search and complaints have fallen by over 60%. But the tactic can cause tension. Friends ofJordan Malutshi, a 17-year-old stabbed to death in 2012, were stopped and searched at a memorial barbecue at Patmore Estate in Wandsworth, south London. An officer told us there had been three murders locally within a matter of weeks as a result of knife crime. But one of Jordan's friends, calling himself Abs, claimed the search amounted to racial profiling. A stop-and-search was used on a Wandsworth estate for the first time in three years as people began arriving to Jordan Malutshi's memorial He said he thought the group was stopped because the police saw ""four black youths in a car, in a nice car"". The BBC has learned that 65% of all people who face criminal proceedings for knife crime in London are from ethnic minorities, and 42% are black. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said tackling violent crime is her priority. In a statement to the BBC, she expressed her ""anger"" at ""the apparent perception amongst some criminals that they could operate with near impunity"".

PM's deputy investigated over 'suggestive' text,"Prime Minister Theresa May's deputy, Damian Green, has said allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a female activist are ""completely false"". Mr Green has instructed libel lawyers over the claims, the BBC understands. Tory activist Kate Maltby wrote in the Times that he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message. The cabinet secretary is to investigate whether Mr Green broke the ministerial code. Ms Maltby, 31, a writer and academic, said Mr Green, 61, said he had sent her the text message after she posed in a corset for the Times. Laura Kuenssberg: Calls for change in Westminster culture MPs speak out about Westminster harassment claims PM vows to tackle Westminster abuse According to her article in the paper, it read: ""Long time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favourite tabloid I felt impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?"" The encounters left her feeling ""awkward, embarrassed and professionally compromised"", she wrote. Mr Green, now first secretary of state, and Theresa May's effective deputy, said he had known Ms Maltby since 2014 and the pair ""had a drink as friends twice-yearly"". ""The text I sent after she appeared in a newspaper article was sent in that spirit - as two friends agreeing to meet for a regular catch up - and nothing more,"" he said. ""This untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful, especially from someone I considered a personal friend."" He also denied the claim he put his hand on Ms Maltby's knee. Asked about the claims in the Times as he left his home on Wednesday morning, Mr Green told reporters: ""All these allegations are completely false."" Theministerial code,externalrequires ministers to ""behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety"". Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, Small Business Minister Margot James said there was no need for Mr Green to resign during the cabinet secretary's investigation. ""I've read the article in the Times today, and I certainly don't think that it warrants anyone's resignation, temporary or otherwise, in my opinion,"" she said. This video can not be played William Hague tells Today he hopes Westminster is entering an era of greater accountability It comes as allegations and rumours relating to sexual harassment and abuse by MPs swirl around Westminster. On Tuesday, Labour confirmed it had launched an independent inquiry into claims that activist Bex Bailey, 25, was discouraged by a party official from reporting an alleged rape at a Labour event in 2011. She told the BBC she had waived her anonymity to urge changes to the way such cases are handled. In a separate case, an anonymous woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by an MP on a foreign work trip last year told the Guardianher allegations were not taken seriously,external. Earlier this week, a spokesman for Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon confirmed he was once rebuked by a journalist for putting his hand on her knee during dinner. Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a list, thought to have been compiled by staff and researchers at Westminster, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs and ministers. Among the claims are a number of serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour with junior members of staff, the use of prostitutes and affairs between MPs. The government has promised urgent action to improve the handling of complaints about the way MPs' staff are treated.

Signs of pancreatic cancer often missed,"Nikki is having chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer from returning One in three adults might ignore potential symptoms of pancreatic cancer, according to a charity. Stomach ache, indigestion, unexplained weight loss and faeces that float rather than sink in the lavatory can be warning signs of the potentially deadly disease, says Pancreatic Cancer UK. Early detection and treatment are vital to save lives. Nikki Davies was diagnosed in March, aged 51. Her tumour was caught early, meaning a surgeon could remove it. ""I have been incredibly lucky that mine could be operated on and hadn't spread, as far as we can tell. ""My message to others would be that no-one knows your body like you do. ""Know what the symptoms are and talk to your GP if you notice anything that's unusual for you. ""Deep down, I think you know something is wrong. ""For me, it was the pain. It felt like an animal was eating me from the inside.  It was in my back too, between my shoulder blades. And I'd lost a lot of weight very quickly. ""I didn't know anything about pancreatic cancer before my diagnosis, and I certainly wouldn't have known what the symptoms were."" Currently, about one in 10 people diagnosed with the condition survives beyond five years. Hollywood actor Patrick Swayze died from advanced pancreatic cancer aged 57 This is in large part due to most patients being diagnosed at a late stage, when treatment options are very limited, says Pancreatic Cancer UK. Its survey of 4,000 UK adults suggests awareness of the symptoms is still too low. Alex Ford, chief executive at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said: ""We do not want people to panic if they have some or all of these symptoms, because most people who have them will not have pancreatic cancer. ""But it is vital that people know more about this disease, and talk to their GP if they have any concerns. ""The earlier people are diagnosed, the more likely they are to be able to have surgery, which is the one treatment which can save lives."" stomach and back ache unexplained weight loss indigestion changes to bowel habits, including floating faeces loss of appetite jaundice (yellow skin or eyes or itchy skin) feeling and being sick difficulty swallowing recently diagnosed diabetes Terminal cancer dad on charity mission Speed boosts pancreas cancer op success Selfie app 'spots early signs of cancer' - BBC News Pancreatic Cancer UK Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

News Daily: New York attack and Damian Green 'text' claim,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: An attacker has driven a pick-up truck along a cycle path in New York,killing eight people. A further 11 people were seriously injured as the hired vehicle struck cyclists and pedestrians, continuing several blocks along the West St-Houston St path, in Lower Manhattan, before coming to a halt as it hit a school bus. Officials described the incident as a terror attack, with a note referring to so-called Islamic State reportedly found in the truck. The suspect has been arrested, and named in local media as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek national who came to the US in 2010. President Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to ""step up"" vetting measures for visitors to the US following the attack. Footage shows the suspect being tackled by police.""We are just trying to work out why a person would want to mow down some people, to drive into a school bus,""said one eyewitness.""It doesn't really make sense.

New York attack: Trump to tighten vetting,"This video can not be played New York terror attack: How the events unfolded Five friends from Argentina were among those killed in a truck attack in New York on Tuesday. Eight people were killed and 12 injured when the driver of the truck hit people on a cycle path in Lower Manhattan. Suspect Sayfullo Saipov, 29, an Uzbek immigrant, was shot and injured by police. He is in hospital and under arrest, and police have spoken to him. Notes in Arabic claiming the attack on behalf of the Islamic State (IS) group were recovered from the scene. New York Police Department (NYPD) Deputy Commissioner John Miller said the attacker had closely followed IS instructions from social media on how to carry out such an assault, and had been planning it for a number of weeks. It was the deadliest terror attack in the city since 11 September, 2001. From L to R: victims Alejandro DamiÃ¡n Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and HernÃ¡n Ferrucci The deaths of five Argentines were confirmed by the country's foreign ministry. They were part of a group of nine friends in New York to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their graduation from a polytechnic college in the central city of Rosario, Argentine media said. One of the men who died, steel firm owner Ariel Erlij, helped pay for the friends' trip,La NaciÃ³n newspaper reported,external(in Spanish). What we know and don't Read more on the victims Trump calls for end of green card lottery The men - all aged 48 or 49 - were named as HernÃ¡n Diego Mendoza, Diego Enrique Angelini, Alejandro DamiÃ¡n Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij and HernÃ¡n Ferrucci. Another of the friends, MartÃ­n Ludovico Marro, is being treated in hospital. Three days of mourning have been declared in Rosario. Belgian officials said Anne-Laure Decadt, a 31-year-old from Staden in Flanders, was also killed. Three Belgians were wounded. Two other victims, both Americans, have not yet been named. The attacker rented the truck from a New Jersey branch of retailer Home Depot on Tuesday afternoon before driving to New York City and entering the bike lane, police said. Video cameras show the van driving at very high speed, appearing to target bike riders and pedestrians. After the van collided with a school bus, its driver emerged and brandished what appeared to be two weapons. A suspect was shot and wounded by police officer Ryan Nash, 28, one of three NYPD officers who attended the scene after being alerted by witnesses. Police say the suspect is currently being treated at Bellevue hospital, where he has been interviewed by officers. Knives, a paint gun and a pellet gun were recovered from the scene.

What witnesses saw and heard Three officials said Mr Saipov had previously come to the federal authorities' attention because of an unrelated investigation, the New York Times reported. Police records show he was arrested in Missouri last year over a traffic fine. Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev told President Donald Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate the attack. Uzbek officials have not yet confirmed the identity or nationality of the attacker. President Trump took to Twitter to call the attacker ""a very sick and deranged person"", adding: ""We must not allow ISIS [Islamic State] to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!"" He also announced he had ordered extreme vetting to be stepped up, without elaborating further. Mr Trump first said he wanted ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants during his presidential campaign last August. As president, he introduced a ban on arrivals to the US from a number of mainly-Muslim countries - a move that has been challenged legally and is due before the Supreme Court in the coming weeks. The American Civil Liberties Union civil rights group said the term extreme vetting was a ""euphemism for discriminating against Muslims"".

Simon's Cat game app served up adult ad,"The Simon's Cat game requires players to connect matching coloured treats The UK's advertising watchdog has intervened after an adult advert was shown within a video game app popular with children. The pop-up ad featured a ""temporary tattoo"" that looked like a deep bite mark, placed on a woman's shoulder. The imagery appeared in the match-puzzle title Simon's Cat Crunch Time in July. Wish.com, the retailer responsible for creating the ad, failed to respond to the complaint. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it was concerned by the San Francisco-based company'slack of response and ordered the business,externalto ensure its adverts were properly targeted in the future. Although the body does not have the power to impose fines itself, it can refer repeat offenders to Trading Standards, which can take further action. The game's publisher has also banned Wish.com from serving ads to its products in the future. The Simon's Cat game has a Pegi 3 rating - meaning it has been judged to be suitable for anyone above the age of three - and has been installed more than one million times on Android and iOS devices. As with many titles, adverts are automatically placed within the software by algorithms, which are supposed to screen out adult content. This Wish.com ad was spotted within the game app on 24 July The publisher, Strawdog Studios, told the ASA that it also had the power to remove ads manually. But it added that it relied on customer reports to flag unsuitable content, and had not been alerted to the tattoo image before the watchdog had become involved. ""We considered the app was likely to have strong appeal to children and therefore children were likely to have seen the ad,"" said the ASA in its ruling. ""We noted that it was not clear from the ad that the product shown was a fake tattoo and we considered that the image... which was red and bloody, might cause distress."" The authority added that Wish.com was obliged to ensure the ad was not promoted again in an untargeted manner. The company - which describes itself as the world's sixth biggest e-commerce business - sent an automated response to the BBC when asked for comment but has yet to address the problem. ""The ASA has a growing problem with non-UK online businesses, who will sometimes take the view that a self-regulatory body can be ignored,"" said Andy Milmore, a partner at the law firm Harbottle & Lewis. ""This is especially so where the complaints relate to 'inappropriate' marketing, where the ultimate backstop of enforcement action under criminal statute is unlikely to apply.""

Spain court summons sacked Catalan leader,"This video can not be played Carles Puigdemont: Spain has a 'democratic deficit' Spain's high court has summoned sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and 13 other members of his dismissed government to appear later this week. It also gave them three days to pay a deposit of â¬6.2m ($7.2m) to cover potential liabilities. The summons comes after Spain's chief prosecutor on Monday said he would press charges including rebellion. Mr Puigdemont is in Belgium with several former ministers. He earlier said he was not there to seek asylum. Carles Puigdemont triggered a crisis in Spain by holding an independence referendum in early October in the semi-autonomous region despite Madrid's opposition and the Constitutional Court declaring the vote illegal. Spain's central government has now taken direct control of Catalonia. Mr Puigdemont turned up in Brussels on Monday as Spanish Attorney-General JosÃ© Manuel Maza called for Catalan leaders to face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? The Audiencia National has now summoned the sacked Catalan officials - who are yet to be formally charged - to testify on Thursday and Friday. If they do not appear, prosecutors could order their arrest. Meanwhile, the speaker of Catalan's dissolved parliament Carme Forcadell and other former lawmakers have been summoned to the Supreme Court because they still have parliamentary immunity. Mr Puigdemont earlier said he would return to Spain if guaranteed a fair hearing. Several of Mr Puigdemont's former colleagues who remain inside the country may decide to accept the summons and appear in court, reports the BBC's James Reynolds from Barcelona. Prosecutors' arguments against the group were ""serious, rational and logical"", Judge Carmen Lamela said in a ruling, according to the AFP news agency. The charge of rebellion carries a maximum 30-year jail term. Speaking at a press conference earlier on Tuesday, Mr Puigdemont said he was not trying to escape justice by travelling to Belgium but wanted to be able to speak freely. His comments came as Spain's constitutional court suspended the declaration of independence made by the Catalan parliament on Friday.

Tech firms questioned over 'meddling',"This video can not be played Facebook says hundreds of accounts backed by Russian trolls filled news feeds with inflammatory messages Facebook, Twitter and Google lawyers defended themselves to US lawmakers probing whether Russia used social media to influence the 2016 election. The three firms faced hard questions at a Senate panel on crime and terrorism about why they missed political ads bought with Russian money. Lawmakers are eyeing new regulations for social media firms in the wake of Russia's alleged meddling in 2016. The firms said they would tighten advertising policies and guidelines. Senator Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, asked Facebook - which absorbed much of the heat from lawmakers - why payment in Russian rubles did not tip off the firm to suspicious activity. ""In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens,"" said Colin Stretch, general counsel for Facebook. ""There are signals we missed."" A day earlierFacebook said as many as 126m US users may have seen Russia-backed contentover the last two years. Lawyers for the three firms are facing two days of congressional hearings as lawmakers consider legislation that would extend regulations for television, radio and satellite to also cover social media platforms. The firms said they are increasing efforts to identify bots and spam, as well as make political advertising more transparent. Facebook, for example, said it expects to have 20,000 people working on ""safety and security"" by the end of 2018 - double the current number. Reality Check: When 126m isn't 126m on Facebook Facebook uncovers 'Russian-funded' misinformation campaign ""I do appreciate these efforts, but I don't think it's enough,"" said Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota. Ms Klobuchar has proposed legislation that she says would make social media firms subject to the same disclosure rules for political and issue pages as print, radio and television companies. The companies said they would work with her on the bill, but did not say they would support it. Facebook's Colin Stretch (L), Twitter's Sean Edgett, and Google's Richard Salgado testify before a Senate panel Senators questioned whether the firms are up to the task of weighing free speech and privacy rights against concerns over terrorism and state-sponsored propaganda. ""I think you do enormous good, but your power sometimes scares me,"" said Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana. Russia has repeatedly denied allegations that it attempted to influence the last US presidential election, in which Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton. But Facebook revealed as many as 126m American users may have seen content uploaded by Russia-based operatives. The social media company said about 80,000 posts published between June 2015 and August 2017 and were seen by about 29m Americans directly. Twitter's Russia briefings 'inadequate' Can US election hack be traced to Russia? LISTEN: Russian-backed Facebook post row in a minute These posts, which Facebook says were created by a Kremlin-linked company, were amplified through likes, shares and comments, and spread to tens of millions of people. That company, Internet Research Agency, was also linked to about 2750 Twitter accounts, which have been suspended, Twitter said. The firm also said it had identified more than 36,000 Russian bots that generated 1.4m automated, election-related Tweets, which may have been viewed as many as 288m times. Google also revealed on Monday thatRussian trolls had uploaded more than 1,000 political videos on YouTube on 18 different channels,external. The company said they had very low view counts and there was no evidence they had been targeting American viewers. Most of the posts focused on sowing political and social divisions, the firms have said. The companies said they used a combination of staff and big data to police that content, disabling fake and spam accounts.

Male infertility treatment âinsensitiveâ,"Gareth, who now has a son, says male fertility should be treated like any other medical condition Male infertility care can be insensitive and one-sided, says charity Fertility Network UK which has surveyed men seeking help to become fathers. Men can feel excluded, with female partners being the main focus of attention in clinics, it found. The charity says men's needs are too often ignored, which must change. Gareth Down, 31, set up asupport group,externalfor men with fertility problems because he says he had nowhere to turn for help when he needed it. At the age of 20, in a blunt conversation with his GP, he was told tests showed he had no sperm. After eight years, nine cycles of treatment and four miscarriages, he and his wife Nat finally had a baby 17 months ago. He said a men-only space for sharing experiences was important, and would have made him feel much better about his personal situation. ""I just wanted to rant sometimes, but I didn't feel my thoughts were valid. ""Women are the ones having to go through it all and I felt I didn't have a right to talk or complain. ""But now I can say in confidence what other men feel. ""It just makes you feel less alone."" Gareth says the long, agonising wait for a baby ""nearly broke us many times over"". He says male fertility should be treated like any other medical condition. ""It's still quite a taboo subject - made even worse when you're made to feel like you're wasting NHS time and resources."" Fertility Network UK says very little is known about how men cope with infertility - men are often reluctant to share their experiences. Forty-one men responded to its online questionnaire, designed with researchers from Leeds Beckett University. On average, men who responded had been trying for a baby for five years and most had suffered directly from male infertility. Nearly all the men said fertility problems had affected their wellbeing, with many saying they felt worthless or ""less of a man"". Many felt excluded or marginalised. One man said: ""The whole experience has been focused towards my wifeâ¦ even consultants' letters about my genitalia are addressed to my wife. There seems to be no equality."" Another said: ""I now know what it feels like to be identified on official documentationâ¦ as an appendage to one's spouse."" Some said they were treated insensitively: ""A very rude GPâ¦ then on the analysis result, rather than explaining the result, called me at work to ask if I had had a vasectomy."" A lack of emotional support for men going through treatment for infertility was another common complaint. ""There are always women in the media admitting that they have had infertility issues but we do rarely hear about the man. I know it is a big issue for men and the risk of being called 'less of a man' but I feel infertility is something that many men suffer in silence, fearful of being called hurtful names. ""It is a silent problem that many men suffer,"" said one of the men who responded to the anonymous survey. Susan Seenan, chief executive of Fertility Network UK, urged men to speak out and said clinics should pay extra attention to the care needs of the men they see and treat. ""Men are half of the fertility equation; when they cannot create the family they long for without medical help they suffer and struggle physically and mentally just as women do."" There are manyreasons why men can be infertile,external. The most common cause is poor quality semen, the fluid containing sperm, either because there is a low sperm count, the sperm isn't moving properly or it is abnormal. Damaged testicles, ejaculation disorders and low levels of testosterone - the male sex hormone - can also cause infertility. However, 25% of cases of infertility are unexplained in the UK. Tests to find out the causes of male infertility include semen analysis and a urine test. More information on how infertility can be treated is available onNHS Choices,external.
