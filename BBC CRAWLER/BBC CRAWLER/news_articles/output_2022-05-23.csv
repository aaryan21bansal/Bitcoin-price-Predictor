Russian diplomat quits over Putin's 'witless' war,"Boris Bondarev has released a scathing public statement after quitting in protest at the war A Russian diplomat has quit his job in protest at the ""bloody, witless"" war ""unleashed by Putin against Ukraine"". Boris Bondarev, whose LinkedIn says he worked at the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, told the BBC he knew his decision to speak out may mean the Kremlin now considers him a traitor. But he stood by his statement which described the war as ""a crime against the Ukrainian people"" and ""the people of Russia"". Moscow has not yet commented. Russia has cracked down on those who are critical of or veer from the official narrative surrounding the war, which it refers to only as ""a special military operation"". In the letter posted on social media and shared with fellow diplomats, Mr Bondarev explained he had chosen to end his 20-year career in the service because he could no ""longer share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy"". ""Those who conceived of this war want only one thing - to stay in power forever,"" he wrote. ""To achieve that, they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes,"" he continued. ""Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this."" The letter does not hold back over his former employer either, accusing Russia's Foreign Ministry of being more interested in ""lies and hatred"" than diplomacy. As resignation letters go, this one was scathing. Diplomat Boris Bondarev didn't hold back in his criticism of President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Russian offensive in Ukraine. ""The aggressive warâ¦ the most serious crimeâ¦ warmongering, lies and hatredâ¦"" It's rare to hear such words from a Russian official. In the three months since Vladimir Putin launched what he's still calling his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine (what most of the world calls Russia's war) there have been few signs of open dissent in Russian state institutions. Embarrassing for the Russian authorities? Absolutely. They like to make out that the state machine here is fully behind President Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. But one resignation does not automatically mean that many more will follow. Mr Bondarev admitted to me that he's in the minority. He believes that, for now, most officials in the Russian Foreign Ministry back the official line and support the Kremlin's 'special operation.' Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bondarev said he had ""not seen any alternative"" than to resign: ""I don't think it will change a lot, frankly, but I think it may be one little brick into the bigger wall which would eventually be built. I hope so."" Mr Bondarev revealed that the invasion had initially been met by colleagues with ""happiness, delight, euphoria"" at the fact Russia had ""taken some radical steps"". ""Now they're less happy with that, because we're facing some problems, with the economy first of all,"" he told the BBC. ""But I don't see that many of them would repent and change their views. ""They may become a little bit less radical, less aggressive quite a bit. But not peaceful.,"" he said. In contrast, Mr Bondarev said in his open letter he had ""never been so ashamed of my country"" as he was on 24 February, the day the invasion began. It is unclear if he is the first diplomat to resign from the mission, although no one else has spoken out publicly. Mr Bondarev is under no illusions that Moscow will now see him as a traitor, but notes he hasn't ""done anything illegal"". ""I just resigned and spoke my mind,"" he said. ""But I think I have to be concerned about my safety of course."" MILITARY STATUS:What might swing the Ukraine war?

Gene-edited tomatoes could soon be sold in England,"Gene-edited tomatoes that boost vitamin D are among the foods that could be commercially developed Tomatoes that boost the body's vitamin D could be among the first gene-edited crops allowed on sale in England. Researchers in Norwich created the plants by turning off a specific molecule in their genetic code. A bill will be introduced on Wednesday to allow commercial growing of gene-edited crops in England. The technique is currently not used for food production in the UK because of rules set by the EU butBrexit has enabled the UK to set its own rules. One in six people in the UK are deficient in vitamin D, which is vital to strong bones and muscles and helps reduce risk of cancer. Prof Cathie Martin, who led the research at the John Innes Centre, said that the development,published in Nature Plants,external, could be hugely beneficial. ""With humans, half an hour in the sunshine every day is enough to make enough vitamin D. But a lot of people don't have that time outside and that's why they need supplements. The tomatoes themselves could provide another source of vitamin D in their diet."" If government legislation gets through Parliament successfully, the vitamin-boosting fruits could be among the first gene-edited crops allowed on supermarket shelves in England. Gene editing is a relatively recent technology. It involves switching genes on and off by snipping out a small section of the plant's DNA. The older technique of genetic modification involves putting genes in, sometimes from a completely different species. EU restrictions mean both methods have been effectively banned in Europe for a quarter century. Both methods are used in other countries, to produce food. But the EU set stringent regulations on GM crops 25 years ago because of safety concerns and public opposition to the technology. Gene-edited crops are covered by the same regulations. The UK currently follows European Union regulations on both technologies. Any new GM or GE crop must undergo a scientific safety assessment, which can take around five years. Plant breeders believe that to be too onerous and expensive and so do not invest in the technology in Europe. In addition, any new variety that passes the EU's safety tests must then be approved by a majority at the European Parliament. Plant breeders believe that political opposition is too strong for the approval of new GM or GE varieties. The regulations, say the plant industry, effectively prevented the commercial production of GM foods in Europe. The UK government has decided that gene editing is safe to use and is to introduce a bill on Wednesday to allow its commercial development in England. The regulations on GM crops will not be relaxed at this stage. The Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC News that the change in the law was necessary to combat the impact of climate change. ''The reality is  we're going to need more drought resistant plants and as we try and reduce the use of chemical pesticides, we need to breed in the natural resistance of plants to diseases and this precision breeding technology gives you the ability to do that; it gives you the ability to change traits in a plant faster than you could by conventional breeding but it's not the same as genetic modification''. A new variety of barley being tested by KWS plant breeders in Hertfordshire will take twelve years to come to market using conventional breeding techniques. The firm claims that gene editing will significantly reduce that time. The development has been welcomed by Nigel Moore, of KWS, a plant-breeding firm in Hertfordshire which produces wheat and barley. ""With the varieties we see in England, it generally takes us 12 years to produce those new ones. With gene-editing, we can respond to changing farmers' much faster."" KWS has been developing new varieties of wheat and barley for farmers for 150 years using traditional cross-breeding techniques. Mr Moore says that the firm needs to use gene-editing to produce the new varieties farmers are asking for. ""If we think about the pace of change: climate change, the need to reduce nitrogen fertilizer, need to use less pesticides; the faster we get the genetic changes we need, the faster we are able to adapt to all of that changing world around us"". Critics of the technology, such as Liz O'Neill, who is the director of the campaign group, GM Freeze, says that the government is being too hasty in lifting restrictions for gene-edited crops. Protestors trampling a GM crop trial in 1988 over safety concerns about the technology. ""Mistakes happen. Other changes can get made. Genetics is not like Lego. It is a new set of techniques, and it has developed very quickly which means that there is an awful lot that could go wrong. The process does involve putting genetic material in, in order to take it out, and there is a deliberate oversimplification in the description of the process in order to make people feel comfortable about it."" Ms O'Neill also wonders how the relaxation of regulations, which apply to England only, won't happen in other parts of the UK, which will make their own decisions about the use of the technology. ""The food chain doesn't operate only in England. It operates across the UK. Who is going to keep gene-edited food out of the food in Scotland and Wales? Customers want informed choice and can only get that if GMOs in the food chain are traceable"". Nigel Moore from KWS responds by saying that new gene-edited crop varieties are analysed to ensure that there is no new DNA in them before they are approved for use and that a number of scientific assessments have judged gene-editing technology to be safe. He also believes that English-grown GE foods won't find their way to other parts of the UK. ""Agricultural supply chains are already very competent in delivering brand requirements such as gluten free and organic foods to very high standards."" The Scottish Government has a long standing opposition to GM crops. Their argument is that they want to protect the ""purity"" of Scotland's food and drinks sector. But this is now is direct opposition to NFU Scotland which says it puts Scottish farmers at a competitive disadvantage. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We have no plans to revise the existing GMO Deliberate Release Regulations in Wales and will maintain our precautionary approach towards genetic modification. GM crop growing in Northern Ireland was banned at the same time as in Scotland and Wales, back in 2015, and it was said then that that decision would hold for the foreseeable future.

Starbucks to quit Russia but pay six months' wages,"Starbucks is leaving Russia after 15 years, the latest Western corporation to quit the country after the war in Ukraine. The coffee chain will now retreat entirely from the Russian market, after suspending trading there in March. It said it would continue to pay nearly 2,000 staff working at its shops in the country for six months. Starbucks joins firms such as McDonald's and Renault in permanently exiting the country. US and Western allies responded to the war by hitting Russia with wide ranging economic sanctions aimed at isolating it economically and cutting it off from the global financial system. The rules make it difficult for Western companies to operate there. Starbucks entered Russia in 2007 and had grown to include 130 coffee shops, owned and operated by a licensee. The company had stopped shipments to Russia in March. It said it had now ""made the decision to exit and no longer have a brand presence in the market"". It did not give details of the financial impact of the decision, but said it would provide assistance to its staff ""to transition to new opportunities outside of Starbucks"". A spokeswoman for Starbucks said the stores would close. Russian McDonald's buyer to rebrand restaurants Russia nationalises Renault's Moscow plant The Kuwait-based Alshaya Group, which owns and operates the Starbucks stores, said the decision to leave was a ""Starbucks announcement"" and referred questions to the coffee chain.  It did not say whether it would seek to sell its stores or reopen under a new brand. Last week,McDonald's announced thatit was selling its nearly 850 restaurants in Russia to a current licensee, Russian businessman Alexander Govor, who is expected to rebrand the restaurants. Earlier this month,French carmaker Renaultalso said its business had been nationalised and would be run by Russian government entities, who said they hoped to revive production under a Soviet-era car brand. The mayor of Moscow last month estimated that about 200,000 people in that city alone risked losing their jobs as Western companies left the country.

ScotRail and drivers' union return to pay talksHundreds of services were cut on Monday in a temporary timetable to cope with driver shortages.Scotland,"Timetable changes mean the last train on many routes departs before 20:00 ScotRail and the train drivers' union Aslef have said they will return to talks in an ongoing dispute over pay. About 700 daily services were cut on Monday after the train operator issued a temporary timetable to cope with driver shortages. Aslef said informal talks would take place on Tuesday ahead of formal negotiations on Thursday. Drivers have refused to work overtime and on rest days, after the union rejected a 2.2% pay offer. Both sides had been in deadlock after the union said it was balloting members for strike action over the pay offer. The RMT union, whose members include other railway workers who have beenballoted over strike action,will also be part of the talks. ScotRail's scaled-back timetable comes into force Minister urges people to be 'sensible' over pay Earlier, Aslef's Scottish organiser Kevin Lindsay called on ScotRail to get back to the negotiating table so the ""ridiculous timetable cuts"" could be withdrawn. He toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""I need somebody from ScotRail or Transport Scotland to come along with the authority to make a deal so we can move forward because this is damaging Scotland's economy. He added: ""I appreciate other sectors and other workers may not be on the same salaries or may not be making the same demands, but this isn't a race to the bottom, my job is to protect the terms and conditions of train drivers. ""Train drivers are telling me quite clearly they are looking for a sensible settlement that we can actually move forward on to deliver for the passengers of Scotland."" Timetable changes mean the last train on many routes departs before 20:00 Mr Lindsay said he had also written to the first minister asking her to provide ""positive political intervention"" in bringing the recently nationalised train operator back to talks. ScotRail began cancelling trains earlier this month amid the pay dispute, after many drivers chose not to work overtime or on rest days. Due to delays in training new staff during the pandemic, it relied on drivers working extra hours in order to run normal services. Why has ScotRail cancelled hundreds of trains? ScotRail's original Summer 2022 timetable had about 2,150 weekday services. This has now been reduced to 1,456 in the temporary timetable. The changes also mean the last train on many routes departs before 20:00. A typical ScotRail driver salary is more than Â£50,000. With drivers being offered a 2.2% pay rise and the opportunity to participate in a revenue share arrangement, the Scottish government says this would take the total package to 5%. ScotRail's service delivery director David Simpson told BBC Scotland the operator was ""always open to negotiation"". He said: ""Both sides need to find a way to move this forward, to find a way to recognise the difficult financial position the industry is in after the pandemic, with a large gap between cost and revenue that the tax payer is currently filling. ""We all share the wish to get round the table, to find a way to compromise and move forward and start returning the railway to normal."" On Monday evening both ScotRail and Aslef confirmed they would meet again for further talks. The union said it would be making no further comment until after formal negotiations on Thursday. The RMT union, which had agreed a backdated pay rise of 2.5% in October, also declined the year's deal and is balloting members over strike action.

Last week,McDonald's announced thatit was selling its nearly 850 restaurants in Russia to a current licensee, Russian businessman Alexander Govor, who is expected to rebrand the restaurants. Earlier this month,French carmaker Renaultalso said its business had been nationalised and would be run by Russian government entities, who said they hoped to revive production under a Soviet-era car brand. The mayor of Moscow last month estimated that about 200,000 people in that city alone risked losing their jobs as Western companies left the country.

"LiveLiveJohnny Depp returns to stand in defamation caseThe US actor, who is suing ex-wife Amber Heard for defamation, faces a grilling by her defence.US & Canada","Johnny Depp had appeared on a list of potential witnesses compiled by lawyers defending his ex-wife Amber Heard But Heard's team decided not to call the US actor to the stand as the defamation case entered its sixth, and final week Depp sued Heard for $50m (Â£40m) over a Washington Post article, where she claimed she was an abuse victim Heard is countersuing Depp, saying he smeared her by calling her a liar Depp denies abusing Heard and says she was the aggressor in the relationship But Heard's lawyers portray Depp as a physically and sexually abusive partner prone to drug binges Warning: This page contains accusations of physical and verbal abuse - you can visit bbc.co.uk/actionline for support Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral Amber Heard's legal team has called their next witness to the stand: Kathryn Arnold, an entertainment consultant. A source close to Amber Heard has confirmed that her team will no longer call Johnny Depp to the witness stand so we are pausing our live coverage. Want to catch up on the latest? Here's some of our coverage of the Depp and Heard trial:  Monday kicks off what is likely to be the final week of testimony in the blockbuster legal battle between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Here's a look at what the former couple have said about each other on the witness stand. This video can not be played Depp v Heard: The trial so far, in their own words The trial has resumed after a one-hour lunch break. Dr David Spiegel - a psychiatrist called to the stand by Amber Heard's attorneys - will continue his testimony. Johnny Depp is expected to take the stand next. At the start of the trial, many big names - including billionaire Elon Musk, and actors James Franco and Paul Bettany - had been rumoured to testify. But none showed. Now, a source close to Johnny Depp says British supermodel Kate Moss will testify on Wednesday. Moss, 48, dated Depp from 1994 to 1997. Earlier in the trial, Amber Heard shared with the court a rumour that Depp had pushed Moss down a flight of stairs. Moss - who is known to be fiercely private - will appear via video link on behalf of Depp's team. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We'll be back with continued coverage at 13:55 local time (18:55 BST). Psychiatrist David Spiegel is now facing questions from Johnny Depp's team. The exchanges are almost immediately combative as lawyer Wayne Dennison works to undermine Dr Spiegel's assessment of Depp as having substance abuse disorder. Judge Penny Azcarte asks Dr Spiegel twice ""to just answer the questions"" after some heated exchanges between Spiegel and Dennison. ""I'm not sure why we're arguing about psychology - I'm telling you what it is,"" Dr Spiegel says at one point. Depp's lawyer accuses the psychiatrist of using Depp's acting in films to make his diagnosis of the actor, as Spiegel has never met him in person. ""Willy Wonka doesn't matter do you?"" Dennison quips at one point - referring to a film starring Depp. Spiegel looks baffled and asks the judge if he has to answer the question. Heard's team requested two medical reviews of Depp leading up to the trial but both motions were denied. When Amber Heard took the stand, jurors heard a wildly different account of her relationship with Depp than offered by his team. Heard, like her ex-husband, described an intense and immediate connection between the pair. ""I felt like butterflies. I couldn't see straight,"" she said. But that connection was marred, Heard testified, by a sudden transformation. Depp would disappear for days, she claimed, and return drunk, high and angry. She described a variety of violent outbursts - slaps, head butts and sharp kicks to the head - and disturbing episodes of sexual assault throughout their relationship. ""I was so scared that it was going to end really badly for me,"" Heard told the jury of her decision to file for divorce in 2016. ""I had to leave him,"" she said. ""I knew I wouldn't survive if I didn't. Depp has denied all allegations of assault. Throughout the trial, Depp has portrayed his ex-wife as a volatile spouse who abused and demeaned him. After the romance of their first year together soured, the pair argued regularly, Depp said. Heard frequently issued a ""sarcastic, demeaning, aggressive, violent, toxic spew"", and occasionally resorted to violence, he said. Depp told the jury: ""She has a need for conflict. She has a need for violence."" Heard has admitted to striking her former partner on several occasions, after ""years of not defending myself"". But Heard said she was never ""abusive"" to Depp. Right now, the jury is hearing from Dr David Spiegel, a psychiatrist. Spiegel - an expert witness called by Amber Heard's team - tells the court he has treated thousands of patients - the majority of whom have had substance abuse problems. Depp, he says, ""has behaviours that are consistent with someone that both has substance use disorder as well as behaviours of someone who is a perpetrator of intimate partner violence"". Depp's drug and alcohol use has been a frequent theme of the trial so far. Depp says he was sober for much of his relationship with Heard after detoxing from opioids in 2014. But Heard's team has described a different Depp - one prone to alcohol and drug binges despite her repeated pleas for him to get clean. The sequel to Johnny Depp and ex-wife Amber Heard's bitter legal battle has come to Virginia - just minutes from the nation's capital. After losing the first round - a libel trial set in the UK - Depp, 58, sued Heard, 35, for $50m (Â£38m) over an op-ed she wrote in The Washington Post in which she described her experience as a ""public figure representing domestic abuse"". ""I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out,"" she wrote. ""I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse."" She did not mention Depp or any other alleged perpetrator by name. But according to Depp's complaint, these three sentences amount to defamation anyway, derailing his career and ""incalculably"" damaging his reputation. ""The op-ed's clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser is categorically and demonstrably false,"" the star's lawyer wrote in the complaint. ""Her allegationsâ¦ are part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms Heard and advance her career."" Heard has sued back, with a counterclaim of $100m. Good morning from Washington DC. Johnny Depp is set to be called back to the stand for a second time in his high-profile defamation case against ex-wife, Amber Heard. The trial, which is scheduled to come to a close this week, has already involved graphic accusations of verbal and physical assault - in both directions. Depp and Heard have each denied any abuse. Readers should be aware that the trial has, to date, contained graphic descriptions of physical, sexual, and verbal abuse, and our live coverage may cover some of those topics. Weâll have updates and analysis from our reporters watching the trial. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Millionaires at Davos say 'tax us more',"Millionaires Marlene Engelhorn and Phil White joined a Davos protest calling for higher taxes on the wealthy A handful of wealthy attendees gathered in Davos are calling on world leaders to tackle the cost of living crisis by pushing up taxes for people like them. They took to the streets on Sunday alongside left-wing activists to call for fairer tax systems worldwide. Political and business leaders are at the first in-person World Economic Forum (WEF) since the pandemic began. But criticisms are mounting over the way the wealthy have profited in the last two years. UK millionaire Phil White said: ""While the rest of the world is collapsing under the weight of an economic crisis, billionaires and world leaders meet in this private compound to discuss turning points in history. ""It's outrageous that our political leaders listen to those who have the most, know the least about the economic impact of this crisis, and many of whom pay infamously little in taxes. The only credible outcome from this conference is to tax the richest and tax us now."" Millionaires ask to pay more tax Disney heir among millionaires urging higher taxes Pay gap between bosses and staff set to widen Mr White, who represents a group called Patriotic Millionaires, made his money as a business consultant. He said he was joining left-wing and anti-poverty campaigners calling for change at the annual meeting of influential business people and political leaders because the current economic system was failing. Over the past decade, a growing number of millionaires and billionaires in the US and Europe have spoken out, calling for governments to impose higher taxes, including wealth levies on the richest. While only a small number of millionaires were in Davos to attend the protest, the campaigners have sent an open letter to all Davos delegates, signed by more than 150 millionaires in several countries. New signatories to the letter, which was initially sent in January, include the American actor Mark Ruffalo. Among the earlier supporters of the movement are  Disney heiress Abigail Disney, Nick Hanauer, a US entrepreneur and early investor in online giant Amazon, and Morris Pearl, a former managing director at investment firm BlackRock. Marlene Engelhorn, another millionaire at the protest, said: ""As someone who has enjoyed the benefits of wealth my whole life, I know how skewed our economy is and I cannot continue to sit back and wait for someone, somewhere, to do something. ""We have hit the end of the line when another quarter of a billion people will be pushed into extreme poverty this year."" The charity Oxfam, which issues a report on inequality during the Davos forum each year, claims that over the last two years a new billionaire had been created every 30 hours. At the other end of the income spectrum, Oxfam expects around one million people to fall into extreme poverty every 33 hours this year, the charity's international executive director Gabriela Bucher told the BBC. ""Inequality between countries had been reducing over the last couple of decades,"" she said. ""During the pandemic it had increased and with the rates we're seeing now it looks like it's going in extreme directions that are creating these catastrophic conditions and they reflect in people's lives."" Energy prices began to rise towards the end of last year, but grew more steeply following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prices for food and other goods are also sharply higher. Geopolitical tensions are making it harder resolve tensions over trade, and growth has slowed in much of the world. The world's richer countries collectively grew by just 0.1% in the first three months of this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the US, Italy and Japan shrinking in the quarter, and France experiencing zero growth. The UK's economy grew by 0.8%. Ahead of the WEF meeting, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said the global economy was facing a ""confluence of calamities"" with trade fragmenting. This WEF meeting is taking place later in the year than usual, meaning the 2,000 leaders, experts and business people attending will not be able to enjoy skiing in their spare time in the Swiss resort. Topics on the agenda include the war in Ukraine, pandemic recovery and climate change.

Village gets its station back after 58 years,"The 06:16 service from Edinburgh became the first passenger train to stop at Reston for more than 50 years Passenger rail services are stopping at a Borders village for the first time in 58 years. A new multi-million pound station will help link Reston north to Edinburgh and south towards Newcastle. It is the conclusion of a lengthy battle to secure the stop on the East Coast Main Line. Villagers in Reston - which has about 200 homes - said it would provide a major boost for connectivity from the south-east of Scotland. Anne Barrett says the station could encourage more people to come and live in the area Anne Barrett, 70, has lived in the area for 26 years and is chairperson of the village hall trustees. Now retired, she said the new station would transform daily life and encourage more people of all ages to come and live in the area. ""As I get older, like many, I am aware that I may not wish to drive into Edinburgh or Newcastle, so look forward to being able to use the train,"" she said. ""Having the station open is going to allow people in Reston and the area the opportunity of remaining in the area and travelling outwith to work and socialise. ""We now have more young families moving into the village."" Better transport links to jobs and education will be a boost, according to Dawn Inglis Dawn Inglis, 56, is a supply teacher at Eyemouth High School and a relief librarian. She has also lived in Reston for more than 20 years and said the new station would let her visit relatives more easily. ""I'm really excited about the station reopening,"" she said. ""It means I will be able to travel south to Berwick-upon-Tweed and Newcastle, where I have family, without the need for using the busy and often dangerous A1. ""Also, my daughter is off to university in Edinburgh after the summer, so I will be able to visit her directly by train."" Ms Inglis said she believed the reopening of the station would also benefit others. ""For the wider community it will mean better transport links to jobs, both locally at Berwick and further afield,"" she said. ""The young people will benefit from access to further education by using the train service. ""The local area - particularly Coldingham and St Abbs - are very popular tourist destinations and if the bus service links up with the trains, holidaymakers could access these beauty spots without using a car."" An investment of about Â£20m has been made in constructing the station The return of passenger services comes after a lengthy battle to improve rail services in the area. More than a decade ago a feasibility study looked at the possibility of reopening a station on the East Coast Main Line. A funding package for the project has since been put together with backing from Scottish Borders Council and the Scottish government. Network Rail said the Â£20m facility could cater for 10-carriage trains and the footbridge was the first of its kind to be fitted on the UK rail network. Network Rail said the station would serve the wider Berwickshire area ""Reston station is an investment in transport but also in our economy, communities and our environment,"" it said in a statement. ""It will deliver significant benefits by enhancing the public transport network, improving active travel networks and developing economic, leisure and tourism potential. ""It will serve the village and wider Berwickshire area and will enable easy access to Edinburgh and Newcastle and onwards across the national rail network. ""As well as improving transport connectivity, it will help transform the economic outlook of the area it will serve."" The station will be served by both LNER and TransPennine Express services Transport minister Jenny Gilruth, who travelled on one of the first services to stop at the station, said she was delighted to see it open. ""We know that reconnecting communities to rail isn't just about transport,"" she said. ""It's opening up employment opportunities, it's driving investment and it's creating opportunity for future generations. ""This investment will change the lives of the people of Reston for the better.""  1,512cubic metres of concrete used 9.9kilometres of drainage and ducting 123footbridge weight in tonnes 5.5kilometres of electrification wiring There has been some criticism ahead of the reopening of the number of services stopping at the station and the timing of them. Network Rail said it would be served by eight trains per weekday in each direction - mainly run by TransPennine Express but one by London North Eastern Railways. The first of those services called shortly after 06:00 on Monday. It was a moment they have long waited for in this corner of south east Scotland.

We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow.

""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveRussian diplomat quits over Putin's 'witless' war23 minutes ago,"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing.""

PM pictured drinking at No 10 lockdown event,"Boris Johnson has been pictured drinking at an event in Downing Street during lockdown. ITV News has published four photos,external, saying they were taken on 13 November 2020 at a leaving do for the PM's director of communications, Lee Cain. The Metropolitan Police have issued fines relating to No 10 gatherings on that date. A No 10 spokeswoman said the Cabinet Office and the police had had access to information, including photographs. The BBC has been told that at least one person who attended has been fined by the police. Mr Johnson himself was not. After the leaked pictures were published, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the PM had ""demeaned his office"" and ""the British people deserve better"". The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held What did Boris Johnson tell Parliament about parties? She added: ""Boris Johnson said repeatedly that he knew nothing about law-breaking - there's no doubt now, he lied. Boris Johnson made the rules, and then broke them."" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the images show Mr Johnson ""has taken the British people for fools"" while the SNP's Ian Blackford called him a ""charlatan and a liar"" Both called on Conservatives MPs to remove Mr Johnson from office. The former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, said the prime minister's position was untenable, while veteran Tory MP Sir Roger Gale said the new images were ""damning"" and suggested Mr Johnson should quit. Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross, who had previously urged Mr Johnson to quit over the party controversy, said: ""The prime minister must outline why he believes this behaviour was acceptable."" A No 10 spokeswoman said that with the Met's investigation concluded, senior civil servant Sue Gray would be publishing her report into the gatherings ""in the coming days, at which point the prime minister will address Parliament in full"". The pictures obtained by ITV News show Mr Johnson toasting colleagues, while standing by a table on which wine bottles, wine glasses and what appears to be a hand sanitiser container can be seen. A second lockdown was in force in England at the time the picture was taken, and the rules prohibited indoor gatherings of two or more people. An exception was allowed if the gathering ""was reasonably necessary"" for work purposes. ITV published four photos from the event, including this one showing the PM's red box, used for official papers A raft of allegations about gatherings held in Downing Street and Whitehall throughout the pandemic led to a Metropolitan Police investigation into 12 events. The inquiry concluded last week, with a total of 126 fixed penalty notices being issued to 83 individuals for parties held over eight separate dates. Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak all received one fine each for attending a birthday party thrown in the PM's honour in June 2020. But No 10 confirmed the PM was not facing any additional fines from the police. The Liberal Democrats have written to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, questioning why the prime minister had not received more fines and asking them to examine the police's original investigation. On 8 December 2020, Labour MP Catherine West asked Mr Johnson in the Commons if a party had taken place in Downing Street on 13 November - though it is not clear if she was referring to the event photographed. This video can not be played Angela Rayner on PM drinking images: ""I think they are appalling."" He replied: ""No - but I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times."" The prime minister faces a further inquiry by the Commons' Privileges Committee about whether he deliberately misled MPs when he previously told them no Covid rules had been broken in Downing Street. Under government guidelines, ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament are expected to resign. MPs are also awaitingthe outcome of an investigationby Durham Police into a gathering in the city on 30 April 2021 attended by Labour leader Keir Starmer and his deputy Ms Rayner. Sir Keir has said he will resign if he is fined for attending the event. There have always been two big questions at the heart of 'Partygate': Did the prime minister himself break the law and has he been completely candid about what he knew about law-breaking in Downing Street? Responding to these latest pictures, No 10 is pretty bullish. It says that the police would have seen these photos and didn't fine him. On the second point though, things may get a little trickier for Boris Johnson. These pictures show him at an event for which somebody else was fined so can his insistence that he thought all the rules had been followed hold? And there are two big audiences which really matter: MPs and the public. There will be huge scrutiny of exactly what the prime minister said to Parliament about this and whether or not it was misleading. The outcome of that could have a very swift impact on his prime ministerial future. Beyond that though, pictures like these pose a potentially longer-term issue.

LiveLiveRussian diplomat quits over Putin's 'witless' war6 minutes ago,"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

Change needed to stop thousands more kids going in to care,"Henrietta, in care from 14, says her life would have been different if her mother had been offered help earlier Tens of thousands more children could end up in care without radical changes to child protection, a ""once-in a generation"" review has warned. Thereview,externalof England's council-run children's services says struggling families need early intervention to ensure they do not reach crisis point. The recommendations include phasing out young offender institutions and a drive to recruit more foster parents. Ministers promised ""ambitious and detailed"" plans before the end of 2022. But Labour and the British Association of Social Workers both blamed government austerity measures since 2010 for stripping away services for vulnerable families. And the Independent Children's Homes Association, representing private providers of residential care, accused the review of ""overreaching"". The Independent Review of Children's Social Care's lead Josh MacAlister called for Â£2.6bn over five years to transform the system and prevent the number of children in care - already at record levels - rising above 100,000. It follows the killing of toddlersArthur Labinjo-HughesandStar Hobson,who died in separate incidents in 2020. The trials of their killers highlighted the inadequacies of the social system meant to protect at-risk children. A separate report on the failings in both cases is expected soon. Huge profits made from children's care - report Children in care 'seen as criminals not victims' Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' The landmark review's recommendations have also called for: new child-protection experts to ensure senior staff are directly involved in frontline decisions a recruitment drive to increase the number of foster parents who can care for children a new law protecting care leavers from discrimination young offender institutions, described as ""wholly unsuitable for children"", to be phased out ""I was always walking with a black bin bag,"" says Henrietta Imoreh, of being moved from placement to placement five times during her first weeks in care at the age of 14. Youth worker Henrietta, now 27, says the sort of early intervention recommended in the report could have transformed her life. Being in care ""felt like a never-ending storm"", she says. It disrupted her education, she was bullied and got into fights. ""Where is the support for families right at the start, when they're struggling?"" she asks. She says: ""There were so many moments in my childhood where my mum was suffering and nobody offered support... Maybe we wouldn't have gone into care and maybe our stories would have been different."" Mr MacAlister, a former teacher who led the government-commissioned review, told the BBC: ""I've walked away from this feeling a mixture of inspiration at times - seeing what families have been able to do and where children have been able to get despite the circumstances - but also rage. ""Some of the things going on in the system are outrageous and are not acceptable."" He said Â£2.6bn was needed for a five-year programme to change the system fundamentally, and improve the lives of children and their families. Without that, he said, the number of children in care - already at a record 80,000 - would grow. ""Carry on as we are and we'll have nearly 100,000 children in care by this time next decade, and the costs per year will be Â£15bn [up from Â£10bn]... and it won't be achieving better outcomes for anybody."" He suggested some of the money could be raised by a windfall tax on the 15 largest providers of residential children's care and foster care, who he said had ""done very well out of market failure"" by capitalising on demand. Mr MacAlister said: ""What we found is that this is a system - the children social care system - that needs a radical reset, because at the moment it is in a cycle where problems escalate, costs rise, outcomes continue to be too poor, and that's getting worse and worse over time."" Mr MacAlister (centre) and his team spoke to more than 2,000 people with personal experience of the care system Another key recommendation is extra financial support for relatives taking on the care of a child to avoid them going into children's homes, or being fostered. ""Children have told us, having been in care, that they desperately would have liked to stay with their grandparents or that uncle or family friend,"" Mr MacAlister said. But too often relatives' housing is unsuitable or budgets won't stretch to the cost of taking on an extra child, says the report, which argues for kinship carers to be paid the same amount as foster carers. Lisa, whose baby granddaughter was adopted last year, wishes she could have taken her in instead - but she says the social workers who handled the case were ""negative and nit-picking"" and not on her side. She already has a special guardianship order for the baby's older brother, but when she applied for the second child, she was told that a condition was giving up her job to focus on her granddaughter's emotional wellbeing. Lisa says she had no choice but to allow her granddaughter to be adopted Losing her income would have plunged the whole family into poverty, so Lisa felt she had no choice. ""It was the hardest decision I've ever made... I think I will take to my grave whether it was the right one or not."" Lisa says special guardians need better help. ""We are an afterthought. We don't get the support that foster carers get. We don't get the support adopters get - and yet we're the most successful placements for a child. It doesn't make sense."" In a statement, ministers said they were committed to ""major reforms to improve the lives of England's most vulnerable children and families"". Initial measures set out by the government include: family hubs for ""essential early support"" an expert National Implementation Board to oversee ""transformational change"" a foster carer recruitment drive more funding for councils to keep vulnerable children in education ""This is the start of a journey to change the culture and dramatically reform the children's social care system,"" said Education Secretary Nadim Zahawi, who pledged detailed plans for ""bold and ambitious change"" within months. Labour called the poor outcomes for children in care ""a source of shame for our country and our government"". ""A decade of Conservative governments have stripped away the early help services that children and families rely on,"" said Helen Hayes, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years. The British Association of Social Workers said: ""Public service austerity has not only driven social care services to breaking point, it has fundamentally undermined social protection for the poorest and most marginalised. ""While tackling poverty and funding cuts are in the review report, it needs to be unequivocal in asking government to act on poverty and structural underfunding of preventive and universal services, which is increasing demand on social services and inequalities between areas."" The Independent Children's Homes Association said it was ""stunned"" at the review's call for ""the destruction of more than 30 years in the children's social care sector, work that has produced one of the leading care systems in the world, while demonstrating an alarming lack of knowledge of the sector, poor examination of evidence, and misleading interpretation of critical data"".

Read up on what monkeypox is and how it spreadshere.  Downing Street has said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans. Asked about travel restrictions from affected countries before the 36 new UK cases were announced, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""No, no considerations of that kind. What we're seeing at the moment is community transmission not linked to travel."" He said vaccines were being offered to close contacts but there were no plans for an ""at scale"" vaccination programme. ""We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers but given the nature of this and how we know it's spreading, it's thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign,"" he said. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News It is tempting to treat this outbreak of monkeypox as though
weâre in the early days of the Covid pandemic - but this is not Covid-Two. We should expect cases to continue to rise beyond the 57 now recorded across the UK. But remember monkeypox and coronavirus are different viruses that spread in a different
ways and will need different tools to control them. There are urgent questions that need answering:  Covid was a highly contagious disease that spread through
the air we breathe and could spread even if you had no symptoms. Monkeypox mainly spreads through close skin to skin contact and
its blistering rash is hard to miss. We should have the tools to deal with it. More now on the rise in monkeypox cases in the UK, with 36 new cases in England bringing the UK total to 57. In a statement, the UKHSA said the outbreak is ""significant and concerning"" but the ""risk to the UK population remains low"". Its chief medical adviser, Dr Susan Hopkins, urged people to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms, as the virus spreads through close contact. âA notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.â She thanked those who have come forward for monkeypox testing so far and who have supported contact tracing efforts. ""You are helping us limit the spread of this infection in the UK,"" she said. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said it has detected 36 additional cases of monkeypox in England. The latest cases bring the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England since 7 May to 56. Adding in the new case in Scotland, that brings the UK total to 57. Laura FosterBBC Scotland senior health reporter Not much is known about Scotland's first monkeypox case, but some details are now starting to emerge. We now know that the person is in isolation in a Scottish hospital in an area which specialises in infectious diseases. They were exposed to the virus in the UK and their close contacts are already being contacted and offered the smallpox vaccine. Dr Nick Phin from Public Health Scotland says youâd expect to have between 10 and 20 contacts for each case of monkeypox and says a ""more than sufficient"" number of vaccine doses have been ordered for this case ""plus a buffer"". He could not confirm whether everyone who has been offered the vaccine has accepted the jab â but admits there has been some reluctance in England as can typically happen with vaccination programmes. But Dr Phin stresses that ""weâre not in a scenario like covid where weâre going to be vaccinating large swathes of the population"". Lauren MossLGBT+ & Identity Correspondent Alex Sparrowhawk from Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV and sexual health charity, says anyone with new symptoms â that can include a rash â should call their local sexual health clinic or 111 before going anywhere in person. Theyâre also monitoring the cases alongside the NHS and UK Health Security Agency. Alex said: âWe absolutely donât want to stigmatise gay and bisexual men and know the importance of being proactive in guarding against that. ""But we also know that to date a disproportionate number of monkeypox cases are among gay and bisexual men and want to play our role in reaching this community with the most up-to-date information including symptoms and what do."" Countries should review their availability of the smallpox vaccines used for monkeypox, as well as stocks of antivirals and personal protective equipment, an EU disease expert says. Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the EU's European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, is also urging countries to swap their contact tracing mechanisms and their capacity to diagnose the disease. She says those who are infected with monkeypox should remain isolated until their lesions heal completely. ""For the broader population, the likelihood of spread is very low,"" Dr Ammon says. ""However the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example during sexual activities amongst persons with multiple sexual partners, is considered to be high."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Experts at the World Health Organization know a huge amount about monkeypox already. But there's a suggestion that perhaps not enough research has been carried out to keep pace with this current outbreak. What's puzzling them is why it has spread so widely outside of Africa. Is it simply the result of a 'superspreader event'? That would mean lots of people mixing closely together  passing the virus on to others wherever they travel to next. No one is sure what particular event could have been the cause. There have been warnings that summer festivals could spread the virus even more. Infection control experts from Europe have issued their advice and thoughts on the monkeypox situation. They agree that while the disease is usually mild, some people can get more seriously ill. That includes young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Further investigations are needed to accurately estimate that level of
threat,says the European Centre forDisease Prevention and Control,external. And it warns that humans may be able to spread the virus to animals, including pets or wildlife. If so, there is a risk that
the disease could become endemic in Europe. Lauren MossLGBT and Identity Correspondent Monkeypox is prompting questions among the gay community, with the latest health data indicating a proportion of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been in gay and bisexual men. Itâs important to stress that this is not an illness that affects one community more than any other, and itâs not a sexually transmitted disease. Itâs spread through close contact. These latest infections are new and, as we learn more about them, more information will become clear about who is becoming infected. WHO expert Andy Seale has suggested it could be due to an increased awareness of sexual health amongst the gay community; meaning more infections among that group are coming to light. For now though, itâs early days and too soon to say why. UNAids has urged caution in the language used when we discuss monkeypox and to make sure that it doesnât reinforce any homophobic or racist stereotypes. Any stigma around the disease could seriously undermine any response to the outbreak. Getting the balance between informing groups who might need to be vigilant, but not stigmatising them, will be key to targeting the right public health message to the right people. US President Joe Biden has said the US has enough smallpox vaccine to deal with an outbreak of monkeypox. A smallpox jab offers some good protection against monkeypox since the two viruses are quite similar. Biden urged people to be careful, but said the situation did not warrant the same emergency response seen worldwide during the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of smallpox vaccine and drugmakers including SIGA
Technologies and GeoVax Labs jumped between 7%
and 40% after the US identified its third suspected
case of monkeypox. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Sexual health doctors in the UK are warning monkeypox could have a major impact on access to sexual health services. Staff at clinics who have seen patients infected with the virus are being told to stay at home and isolate for 21 days. That means there are fewer doctors available to treat people coming in with other infections. And in London, where most of the UK's 20 confirmed cases have been found, sexual health clinics want everyone to phone or email ahead, rather than walk in for an appointment. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said it was concerned about the pressure this was already putting on the workforce. It warned that sexually-transmitted infections could be missed while access to sexual health clinics is restricted. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online We've just heard from experts at the World Health Organization and they say nations should be prepared to see more cases of monkeypox in the coming weeks. That doesn't mean the situation is necessarily getting worse though, or that the disease is out of control. Health officials say they are confident that the spread can be contained. Why? Although the outbreak we are seeing is unusual, the virus is not so easy to catch as some other diseases, such as Covid. We know it takes very close physical contact - often skin-on-skin - to spread monkeypox between people. And unlike Covid, which is often asymptomatic, people with monkeypox will usually feel unwell and notice a rash. Drugs and vaccines are already available that can help control and treat monkeypox. As the WHO discussion draws to a close, one member of the public has shared concerns with the panel that the response to this virus could fuel discrimination. Andy Seale, a WHO adviser on HIV, hepatitis and STIs programmes, says while some media reporting on monkeypox has been very good, sometimes it ""does come sadly with some misinformation, stigma and discrimination"". He says has not just been the case for men who have sex with men, ""but perhaps also unintentionally suggesting this is an African disease by only using images of black skin, for example"". Seale says the WHO wants to learn from the decades of experience tackling stigma and discrimination around HIV. And he says they want to make sure communities are helping inform messaging and surveillance around monkeypox. We're following experts from the World Health Organization answering questions from the public about monkeypox.On vaccines, Dr Rosamund Lewis says that, although smallpox has now been eradicated, studies from the time showed that smallpox vaccines were effective against monkeypox around 85% of the time. The viruses, she says, are closely related to each other. Monkeypox vaccines exist but are relatively new and not widely available. But the WHO experts said they were working to enhance availability. ""This is not something that everybody needs - it is only spreading  between close contacts [of] those who are cases,"" Dr
Maria Van Kerkhove adds. A notable proportion of UK cases of monkeypox are in gay or bisexual men, which has prompted the UK Health Security Agency to encourage men who have sex with men to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions. The WHO's Andy Seale says it's early days, but this demographic is generally one which really takes care of health screening when it comes to potential STIs. The fact this demographic has been proactive about responding to unusual symptoms might be part of the story, he says. Some of the early symptoms are fever, headache, lethargy, backache and this usually lasts for a day or two, says Dr Rosamund Lewis. Following this, a rash begins and it starts with red areas on the skin, then it progresses to papules which are raised, then to vesicles or blisters, and then to pustules. After that they begin to dry and scab, and the scab falls off, she says. In terms of the body, the classic progression is face, then to limbs, palms of the hands, soles of the feet and then to the body itself, the says. Swollen lymph nodes are also a common symptom, and Dr Lewis says an important distinction between monkeypox and smallpox - which was eradicated in 1980 - was that if a child had swollen lymph nodes it was more likely to be monkeypox than smallpox. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Moving away from the WHO for a moment, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that monkeypox is ""rare"" and ""so far the consequences don't seem to be very serious"". Speaking at a primary school in south-east London, the PM told reporters ""it's important that we keep an eye on it and that's exactly what the new UK Health Security Agency is doing"". Johnson also said health officials were closely examining how the infection was being spread. High-risk close contacts, such as doctors who've diagnosed people with the virus,are being advised to isolate for 21 days. Some are also being offered a smallpox vaccine which is known to provide good protection against the similar monkeypox virus. We don't really know, says Dr Rosamund Lewis, the head of the WHO smallpox secretariat. ""It's a very stable virus,"" she says, explaining that smallpox is a DNA virus and the mutation rate is much lower than for RNA viruses, which include coronavirus. We don't yet have evidence that there's a mutation in the virus itself, she says, but experts are beginning to collect information on this. Virologists will soon begin discussing if the virus has changed based on the sequence of the genome of some of the cases that are being detected, she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveUK monkeypox cases rise to 579 minutes ago,"The number of confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK has risen to 57, with an additional 36 cases reported in England More than 100 cases have now been confirmed outside Africa - in Europe, the US, Canada and Australia Monkeypox is a viral infection usually found in West and Central Africa and the illness is usually mild UK PM Boris Johnson says that so far the consequences ""don't seem to be very serious but it's important that we keep an eye on it"" World Health Organization experts say the outbreak can be contained and they do not have evidence the virus has mutated Anyone at the highest risk of having caught monkeypox should isolate for 21 days, says official UK guidance Experts say that while this is the biggest outbreak outside Africa in 50 years, this isn't another Covid-type situation Edited by Heather Sharp, Dulcie Lee and Emily McGarvey We're going to wrap up our live coverage now, but here's a recap what we've heard today:  Three facts to remember:  Want more? Read up on what monkeypox is and how it spreadshere.  Downing Street has said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans. Asked about travel restrictions from affected countries before the 36 new UK cases were announced, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""No, no considerations of that kind. What we're seeing at the moment is community transmission not linked to travel."" He said vaccines were being offered to close contacts but there were no plans for an ""at scale"" vaccination programme. ""We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers but given the nature of this and how we know it's spreading, it's thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign,"" he said. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News It is tempting to treat this outbreak of monkeypox as though
weâre in the early days of the Covid pandemic - but this is not Covid-Two. We should expect cases to continue to rise beyond the 57 now recorded across the UK. But remember monkeypox and coronavirus are different viruses that spread in a different
ways and will need different tools to control them. There are urgent questions that need answering:  Covid was a highly contagious disease that spread through
the air we breathe and could spread even if you had no symptoms. Monkeypox mainly spreads through close skin to skin contact and
its blistering rash is hard to miss. We should have the tools to deal with it. More now on the rise in monkeypox cases in the UK, with 36 new cases in England bringing the UK total to 57. In a statement, the UKHSA said the outbreak is ""significant and concerning"" but the ""risk to the UK population remains low"". Its chief medical adviser, Dr Susan Hopkins, urged people to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms, as the virus spreads through close contact. âA notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.â She thanked those who have come forward for monkeypox testing so far and who have supported contact tracing efforts. ""You are helping us limit the spread of this infection in the UK,"" she said. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said it has detected 36 additional cases of monkeypox in England. The latest cases bring the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England since 7 May to 56. Adding in the new case in Scotland, that brings the UK total to 57. Laura FosterBBC Scotland senior health reporter Not much is known about Scotland's first monkeypox case, but some details are now starting to emerge. We now know that the person is in isolation in a Scottish hospital in an area which specialises in infectious diseases. They were exposed to the virus in the UK and their close contacts are already being contacted and offered the smallpox vaccine. Dr Nick Phin from Public Health Scotland says youâd expect to have between 10 and 20 contacts for each case of monkeypox and says a ""more than sufficient"" number of vaccine doses have been ordered for this case ""plus a buffer"". He could not confirm whether everyone who has been offered the vaccine has accepted the jab â but admits there has been some reluctance in England as can typically happen with vaccination programmes. But Dr Phin stresses that ""weâre not in a scenario like covid where weâre going to be vaccinating large swathes of the population"". Lauren MossLGBT+ & Identity Correspondent Alex Sparrowhawk from Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV and sexual health charity, says anyone with new symptoms â that can include a rash â should call their local sexual health clinic or 111 before going anywhere in person.

LiveLiveRussian diplomat quits over Putin's 'witless' war13 minutes ago,"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands.

It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

ScotRail's scaled-back timetable comes into force,"ScotRail's new timetable, which will see almost 700 fewer train services a day, has been rolled out as the deadlock over driver pay continues. The move, which will see the last train on many routes departing before 20:00, follows a third Sunday of disruption. Drivers' union Aslef has argued a 2.2% pay rise is not acceptable at a time of soaring inflation. Employment minister Richard Lochhead said he understood the pressures but urged ""sensible"" pay claims. Hundreds of trains have been cancelled since 8 May when many drivers opted not to work overtime. Why has ScotRail cancelled hundreds of trains? Minister urges people to be 'sensible' over pay Anger over 'devastating' cuts to ScotRail services Aslef and the RMT union are both balloting members for strike action after rejecting the pay offer. Ministers insist that scaling back the number of services under thenew temporary timetable,externalwill reduce the need for cancellations. But hospitality and entertainment businesses have warned the transport situation will affect their income, while some commuters have also raised concerns. The original May 2022 timetable had approximately 2,150 weekday services, but from Monday this will be reduced temporarily by a third to 1,456. Opposition politicians have criticised the move which comes after a Scottish government owned company took over the running of ScotRail last month. The previous operator Abellio had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service. More than 300 services were cancelled on Sunday before the temporary timetable came into place. ScotRail's service delivery director David Simpson conceded that the temporary timetable would see a reduction in service but said it would also provide customers with ""a level of certainty and reliability"". ""I hope we have this in place for as short a time as possible because we recognise the disruption it is causing to people,"" he told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme. ""We need to sit down and talk against the background where everyone is clear that we need to compromise. The demands of 10, 11% are just not sustainable in the current economic climate of the railway. We need to find a way round that."" He said ScotRail needed to demonstrate ""taxpayer value"" in the way the company operated. ""We think the offer we have made is a strong one,"" Mr Simpson added. ""It's 2.2% on basic plus 5% through the revenue share. We think that reflects the current economic position of the industry but also offers good package for drivers and other grades that allows them to share in the success of ScotRail as they move forward."" The operator has been dependent on drivers working extra hours, following delays in training new staff during the Covid pandemic. Mr Simpson said ScotRail could return to a full timetable if drivers returned to the previous level of rest-day working, but added that its training scheme for new drivers was ""going very well"" with 130 new drivers currently going through the programme. The Scottish government has said a train driver in Scotland typically earns more than Â£50,000 a year, and has urged the rail unions to negotiate with ScotRail. But Aslef has said it was ""not sensible"" to offer a 2.2% pay increase with inflation running at the current levels. Scottish organiser Kevin Lindsay has now written to the first minister asking her to provide ""positive political intervention"" in bringing ScotRail back to the negotiating table to end an impasse over wages. He said: ""We urgently need to see progress and a de-escalation of this situation. The Scottish public demand it. They need to get to and from work, leisure, and important cultural and sporting events satisfactorily and this needs a full service that is invested in, not cut. ""We have said repeatedly we want to return to talks - we stand ready whenever they are called to meet with ScotRail and the Scottish government anytime, anyplace and anywhere."" He added: ""Sadly, up until now there has been negative political interference, it is now time for positive political intervention and leadership from you with an instruction to ScotRail to enter as a matter of urgency meaningful pay talks with the full intention to sensibly settle these pay negotiations."" Asked on the BBC'sThe Sunday Showif the unions were making reasonable demands, Employment Minister Richard Lochhead said: ""My message to all workers in Scotland, in all these sectors, is that we have to sensible. ""Everything has to be affordable because the country is in a very precarious position at the moment and if we take wrong decisions we could end up with a recession."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said last week she hoped the timetable would get back to normal ""as quickly as possible"". Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth has said she expects 38 new drivers to be qualified by the end of the summer, 55 by the end of the year, and 100 by June 2023. She has previously described the practice of rest day working as ""outdated"" and that the Scottish government was looking to phase it out. ""I would encourage both partners to sit round the table today,"" she said on Monday. ""We need to see negotiations move on and that means compromise on both sides."" She added: ""We need to make nationalisation a success. I want the railway unions to be part of that success."" Graham Simpson, the Scottish Conservatives transport spokesman, said there were ""serious questions to answer"" about why negotiations were not taking place on Monday. ""Jenny Gilruth might have the luxury of her ministerial car to get around, but others do not,"" he added. ""She needs to start showing leadership and ensure that passengers do not continue to suffer this miserable and disastrous service on our trains.""

PM: No option is off the table on cost of living,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: I'm not attracted intrinsically to new taxes Boris Johnson says ""no option is off the table"" to tackle rising living costs as pressure grows to impose a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. The policy, as proposed by opposition parties, would see a one-off levy on company profits, with proceeds used to support hard-hit households facing surging bills. The prime minister said he was ""not attracted intrinsically to new taxes"". But he said the government was ""going to put our arms round people"" to help. Mr Johnson told reporters: ""There is more that we are going to do... you'll just have to wait a little bit longer."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said part of the answer to tackling the cost of living was a windfall tax and it was ""staring the prime minister in the face"". He said ministers needed to address the situation, adding: ""Every day they dither and delay, more people are struggling, really struggling, with their bills."" Earlier, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was not ""philosophically attracted"" to a windfall tax, but he could not rule it out. He insisted the government would be pragmatic, and added that it was ""looking at the situation with real urgency and intent"". How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Two-child families paying Â£400 a month more Why are prices rising so quickly? Cost of living: What are Rishi Sunak's options? A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company or group of companies - the idea being is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP have all called for a such a levy on oil and gas firms, which have seen record profits since the economy restarted after the pandemic. The parties said the money could be used to support those worse affected by the rising cost of living, with bills for food, fuel and energy rocketing, and inflation hitting a 40-year high. The government had initially rejected the idea, warning it could deter investment from energy companies into the UK. But as costs continue to rise - and another energy price hike looms in the autumn - the language from Downing Street has softened, with both the prime minister and chancellor leaving the policy on the table. A number of Conservative backbenchers have also come out in favour of a windfall tax, increasing pressure on the government to act - with former Treasury minister Jesse Norman telling Today it was needed in these ""extraordinary times"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Government needs to ""get a grip"" and bring in a windfall tax Asked if a windfall tax went against Conservative values, Mr Johnson said: ""I don't like new taxes."" He added: ""No option is off the table, let's be absolutely clear about that. ""I'm not attracted, intrinsically, to new taxes. ""But as I have said throughout, we have got to do what we can - and we will - to look after people through the aftershocks of Covid, through the current pressures on energy prices that we are seeing post-Covid and with what's going on in Russia and we are going to put our arms round people, just as we did during the pandemic."" The PM pointed to support on offer already, including Â£9bn of funding targeted at energy bills, saying the government was providing a ""continuing stream of effort to shield people"". After that once in a century pandemic and the colossal economic intervention that followed, now the question is about this almighty economic crunch and what to do about it. What we are seeing in public - and it rages in private too - is philosophy and ideology smashing into reality. In other words Conservatives instinctively don't like windfall taxes appropriating the profits of a sector that has just happened to do very well. But the energy companies have had a genuine windfall, and senior figures in government are pretty grumpy that in various meetings with the oil companies, they just don't seem to get it - they have raked in enormous profits and not really helped themselves, as someone put it to me last night. So this U-turn looks increasingly likely, but there is some hesitation in grabbing the handbrake - there is a discussion on whether to do it, how to do it, when to do it and then what to do with the money that's raised. Plus there is a nervousness too that it is it not a panacea - that if it happened, people would be back at the government's door next week saying, 'what are you going to do next?'. There is a battle going on internally between pain relief, as it is described - short-term fixes that can help people right now; and what is seen as surgery - boosting the economy for years to come, with an argument that if you spend a pound now, you can't spend that pound again on a new train line or power station later. The government is also facing calls from a former Conservative Party leader to increase universal credit in line with inflation. Sir Iain Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4 that the biggest problem the country faced was a recession which would ""hit the poorest the hardest"". And he criticised the Treasury's ""group think"" for delaying the support that was needed. Senior Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin went even further, calling for a Â£13.5bn package of support to ease the cost of living crisis - including reviving the Â£20 a week uplift to universal credit that was introduced in the pandemic. He told BBC Essex on BBC Essex that he did not believe ""the Labour party or the Treasury yet get how serious this crisis is"". Treasury minister Mr Clarke said the government had already taken ""decisive action"" on universal credit by changing the taper rate - the amount lost by working claimants if they earn more money. But he ruled out the return of the Â£20 uplift.

Starbucks withdraws name from Russia after 15 years,"Starbucks is leaving Russia after 15 years, the latest Western corporation to quit the country after the war in Ukraine. The coffee chain will now retreat entirely from the Russian market, after suspending trading there in March. It said it would continue to pay nearly 2,000 staff working at its shops in the country for six months. Starbucks joins firms such as McDonald's and Renault in permanently exiting the country. US and Western allies responded to the war by hitting Russia with wide ranging economic sanctions aimed at isolating it economically and cutting it off from the global financial system. The rules make it difficult for Western companies to operate there. Starbucks entered Russia in 2007 and had grown to include 130 coffee shops, owned and operated by a licensee. The company had stopped shipments to Russia in March. It said it had now ""made the decision to exit and no longer have a brand presence in the market"". It did not give details of the financial impact of the decision, but said it would provide assistance to its staff ""to transition to new opportunities outside of Starbucks"". A spokeswoman for Starbucks said the stores would close. Russian McDonald's buyer to rebrand restaurants Russia nationalises Renault's Moscow plant The Kuwait-based Alshaya Group, which owns and operates the Starbucks stores, said the decision to leave was a ""Starbucks announcement"" and referred questions to the coffee chain.  It did not say whether it would seek to sell its stores or reopen under a new brand. Last week,McDonald's announced thatit was selling its nearly 850 restaurants in Russia to a current licensee, Russian businessman Alexander Govor, who is expected to rebrand the restaurants. Earlier this month,French carmaker Renaultalso said its business had been nationalised and would be run by Russian government entities, who said they hoped to revive production under a Soviet-era car brand. The mayor of Moscow last month estimated that about 200,000 people in that city alone risked losing their jobs as Western companies left the country.

We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

We can't let brute force rule the world - Zelensky,"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country.

More countries report monkeypox cases as outbreak spreads,"The number of confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK has risen to 57, with an additional 36 cases reported in England More than 100 cases have now been confirmed outside Africa - in Europe, the US, Canada and Australia Monkeypox is a viral infection usually found in West and Central Africa and the illness is usually mild UK PM Boris Johnson says that so far the consequences ""don't seem to be very serious but it's important that we keep an eye on it"" World Health Organization experts say the outbreak can be contained and they do not have evidence the virus has mutated Anyone at the highest risk of having caught monkeypox should isolate for 21 days, says official UK guidance Experts say that while this is the biggest outbreak outside Africa in 50 years, this isn't another Covid-type situation Edited by Heather Sharp, Dulcie Lee and Emily McGarvey We're going to wrap up our live coverage now, but here's a recap what we've heard today:  Three facts to remember:  Want more? Read up on what monkeypox is and how it spreadshere.  Downing Street has said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans. Asked about travel restrictions from affected countries before the 36 new UK cases were announced, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""No, no considerations of that kind. What we're seeing at the moment is community transmission not linked to travel."" He said vaccines were being offered to close contacts but there were no plans for an ""at scale"" vaccination programme. ""We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers but given the nature of this and how we know it's spreading, it's thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign,"" he said. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News It is tempting to treat this outbreak of monkeypox as though
weâre in the early days of the Covid pandemic - but this is not Covid-Two. We should expect cases to continue to rise beyond the 57 now recorded across the UK. But remember monkeypox and coronavirus are different viruses that spread in a different
ways and will need different tools to control them. There are urgent questions that need answering:  Covid was a highly contagious disease that spread through
the air we breathe and could spread even if you had no symptoms. Monkeypox mainly spreads through close skin to skin contact and
its blistering rash is hard to miss. We should have the tools to deal with it. More now on the rise in monkeypox cases in the UK, with 36 new cases in England bringing the UK total to 57. In a statement, the UKHSA said the outbreak is ""significant and concerning"" but the ""risk to the UK population remains low"". Its chief medical adviser, Dr Susan Hopkins, urged people to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms, as the virus spreads through close contact. âA notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.â She thanked those who have come forward for monkeypox testing so far and who have supported contact tracing efforts. ""You are helping us limit the spread of this infection in the UK,"" she said. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said it has detected 36 additional cases of monkeypox in England. The latest cases bring the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England since 7 May to 56. Adding in the new case in Scotland, that brings the UK total to 57. Laura FosterBBC Scotland senior health reporter Not much is known about Scotland's first monkeypox case, but some details are now starting to emerge. We now know that the person is in isolation in a Scottish hospital in an area which specialises in infectious diseases. They were exposed to the virus in the UK and their close contacts are already being contacted and offered the smallpox vaccine. Dr Nick Phin from Public Health Scotland says youâd expect to have between 10 and 20 contacts for each case of monkeypox and says a ""more than sufficient"" number of vaccine doses have been ordered for this case ""plus a buffer"". He could not confirm whether everyone who has been offered the vaccine has accepted the jab â but admits there has been some reluctance in England as can typically happen with vaccination programmes. But Dr Phin stresses that ""weâre not in a scenario like covid where weâre going to be vaccinating large swathes of the population"". Lauren MossLGBT+ & Identity Correspondent Alex Sparrowhawk from Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV and sexual health charity, says anyone with new symptoms â that can include a rash â should call their local sexual health clinic or 111 before going anywhere in person. Theyâre also monitoring the cases alongside the NHS and UK Health Security Agency. Alex said: âWe absolutely donât want to stigmatise gay and bisexual men and know the importance of being proactive in guarding against that. ""But we also know that to date a disproportionate number of monkeypox cases are among gay and bisexual men and want to play our role in reaching this community with the most up-to-date information including symptoms and what do."" Countries should review their availability of the smallpox vaccines used for monkeypox, as well as stocks of antivirals and personal protective equipment, an EU disease expert says. Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the EU's European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, is also urging countries to swap their contact tracing mechanisms and their capacity to diagnose the disease. She says those who are infected with monkeypox should remain isolated until their lesions heal completely. ""For the broader population, the likelihood of spread is very low,"" Dr Ammon says. ""However the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example during sexual activities amongst persons with multiple sexual partners, is considered to be high."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Experts at the World Health Organization know a huge amount about monkeypox already. But there's a suggestion that perhaps not enough research has been carried out to keep pace with this current outbreak. What's puzzling them is why it has spread so widely outside of Africa. Is it simply the result of a 'superspreader event'? That would mean lots of people mixing closely together  passing the virus on to others wherever they travel to next. No one is sure what particular event could have been the cause. There have been warnings that summer festivals could spread the virus even more. Infection control experts from Europe have issued their advice and thoughts on the monkeypox situation. They agree that while the disease is usually mild, some people can get more seriously ill. That includes young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Further investigations are needed to accurately estimate that level of
threat,says the European Centre forDisease Prevention and Control,external. And it warns that humans may be able to spread the virus to animals, including pets or wildlife. If so, there is a risk that
the disease could become endemic in Europe. Lauren MossLGBT and Identity Correspondent Monkeypox is prompting questions among the gay community, with the latest health data indicating a proportion of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been in gay and bisexual men. Itâs important to stress that this is not an illness that affects one community more than any other, and itâs not a sexually transmitted disease. Itâs spread through close contact. These latest infections are new and, as we learn more about them, more information will become clear about who is becoming infected. WHO expert Andy Seale has suggested it could be due to an increased awareness of sexual health amongst the gay community; meaning more infections among that group are coming to light. For now though, itâs early days and too soon to say why. UNAids has urged caution in the language used when we discuss monkeypox and to make sure that it doesnât reinforce any homophobic or racist stereotypes. Any stigma around the disease could seriously undermine any response to the outbreak. Getting the balance between informing groups who might need to be vigilant, but not stigmatising them, will be key to targeting the right public health message to the right people. US President Joe Biden has said the US has enough smallpox vaccine to deal with an outbreak of monkeypox. A smallpox jab offers some good protection against monkeypox since the two viruses are quite similar. Biden urged people to be careful, but said the situation did not warrant the same emergency response seen worldwide during the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of smallpox vaccine and drugmakers including SIGA
Technologies and GeoVax Labs jumped between 7%
and 40% after the US identified its third suspected
case of monkeypox. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Sexual health doctors in the UK are warning monkeypox could have a major impact on access to sexual health services. Staff at clinics who have seen patients infected with the virus are being told to stay at home and isolate for 21 days. That means there are fewer doctors available to treat people coming in with other infections. And in London, where most of the UK's 20 confirmed cases have been found, sexual health clinics want everyone to phone or email ahead, rather than walk in for an appointment. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said it was concerned about the pressure this was already putting on the workforce. It warned that sexually-transmitted infections could be missed while access to sexual health clinics is restricted. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online We've just heard from experts at the World Health Organization and they say nations should be prepared to see more cases of monkeypox in the coming weeks. That doesn't mean the situation is necessarily getting worse though, or that the disease is out of control. Health officials say they are confident that the spread can be contained. Why? Although the outbreak we are seeing is unusual, the virus is not so easy to catch as some other diseases, such as Covid. We know it takes very close physical contact - often skin-on-skin - to spread monkeypox between people. And unlike Covid, which is often asymptomatic, people with monkeypox will usually feel unwell and notice a rash. Drugs and vaccines are already available that can help control and treat monkeypox. As the WHO discussion draws to a close, one member of the public has shared concerns with the panel that the response to this virus could fuel discrimination. Andy Seale, a WHO adviser on HIV, hepatitis and STIs programmes, says while some media reporting on monkeypox has been very good, sometimes it ""does come sadly with some misinformation, stigma and discrimination"". He says has not just been the case for men who have sex with men, ""but perhaps also unintentionally suggesting this is an African disease by only using images of black skin, for example"". Seale says the WHO wants to learn from the decades of experience tackling stigma and discrimination around HIV. And he says they want to make sure communities are helping inform messaging and surveillance around monkeypox. We're following experts from the World Health Organization answering questions from the public about monkeypox.On vaccines, Dr Rosamund Lewis says that, although smallpox has now been eradicated, studies from the time showed that smallpox vaccines were effective against monkeypox around 85% of the time. The viruses, she says, are closely related to each other. Monkeypox vaccines exist but are relatively new and not widely available. But the WHO experts said they were working to enhance availability. ""This is not something that everybody needs - it is only spreading  between close contacts [of] those who are cases,"" Dr
Maria Van Kerkhove adds. A notable proportion of UK cases of monkeypox are in gay or bisexual men, which has prompted the UK Health Security Agency to encourage men who have sex with men to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions. The WHO's Andy Seale says it's early days, but this demographic is generally one which really takes care of health screening when it comes to potential STIs. The fact this demographic has been proactive about responding to unusual symptoms might be part of the story, he says. Some of the early symptoms are fever, headache, lethargy, backache and this usually lasts for a day or two, says Dr Rosamund Lewis. Following this, a rash begins and it starts with red areas on the skin, then it progresses to papules which are raised, then to vesicles or blisters, and then to pustules. After that they begin to dry and scab, and the scab falls off, she says. In terms of the body, the classic progression is face, then to limbs, palms of the hands, soles of the feet and then to the body itself, the says. Swollen lymph nodes are also a common symptom, and Dr Lewis says an important distinction between monkeypox and smallpox - which was eradicated in 1980 - was that if a child had swollen lymph nodes it was more likely to be monkeypox than smallpox. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Moving away from the WHO for a moment, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that monkeypox is ""rare"" and ""so far the consequences don't seem to be very serious"". Speaking at a primary school in south-east London, the PM told reporters ""it's important that we keep an eye on it and that's exactly what the new UK Health Security Agency is doing"". Johnson also said health officials were closely examining how the infection was being spread. High-risk close contacts, such as doctors who've diagnosed people with the virus,are being advised to isolate for 21 days. Some are also being offered a smallpox vaccine which is known to provide good protection against the similar monkeypox virus. We don't really know, says Dr Rosamund Lewis, the head of the WHO smallpox secretariat. ""It's a very stable virus,"" she says, explaining that smallpox is a DNA virus and the mutation rate is much lower than for RNA viruses, which include coronavirus. We don't yet have evidence that there's a mutation in the virus itself, she says, but experts are beginning to collect information on this. Virologists will soon begin discussing if the virus has changed based on the sequence of the genome of some of the cases that are being detected, she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Read up on what monkeypox is and how it spreadshere.  Downing Street has said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans. Asked about travel restrictions from affected countries before the 36 new UK cases were announced, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""No, no considerations of that kind. What we're seeing at the moment is community transmission not linked to travel."" He said vaccines were being offered to close contacts but there were no plans for an ""at scale"" vaccination programme. ""We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers but given the nature of this and how we know it's spreading, it's thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign,"" he said. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News It is tempting to treat this outbreak of monkeypox as though
weâre in the early days of the Covid pandemic - but this is not Covid-Two. We should expect cases to continue to rise beyond the 57 now recorded across the UK. But remember monkeypox and coronavirus are different viruses that spread in a different
ways and will need different tools to control them. There are urgent questions that need answering:  Covid was a highly contagious disease that spread through
the air we breathe and could spread even if you had no symptoms. Monkeypox mainly spreads through close skin to skin contact and
its blistering rash is hard to miss. We should have the tools to deal with it. More now on the rise in monkeypox cases in the UK, with 36 new cases in England bringing the UK total to 57. In a statement, the UKHSA said the outbreak is ""significant and concerning"" but the ""risk to the UK population remains low"". Its chief medical adviser, Dr Susan Hopkins, urged people to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms, as the virus spreads through close contact. âA notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.â She thanked those who have come forward for monkeypox testing so far and who have supported contact tracing efforts. ""You are helping us limit the spread of this infection in the UK,"" she said. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said it has detected 36 additional cases of monkeypox in England. The latest cases bring the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England since 7 May to 56. Adding in the new case in Scotland, that brings the UK total to 57. Laura FosterBBC Scotland senior health reporter Not much is known about Scotland's first monkeypox case, but some details are now starting to emerge. We now know that the person is in isolation in a Scottish hospital in an area which specialises in infectious diseases. They were exposed to the virus in the UK and their close contacts are already being contacted and offered the smallpox vaccine. Dr Nick Phin from Public Health Scotland says youâd expect to have between 10 and 20 contacts for each case of monkeypox and says a ""more than sufficient"" number of vaccine doses have been ordered for this case ""plus a buffer"". He could not confirm whether everyone who has been offered the vaccine has accepted the jab â but admits there has been some reluctance in England as can typically happen with vaccination programmes. But Dr Phin stresses that ""weâre not in a scenario like covid where weâre going to be vaccinating large swathes of the population"". Lauren MossLGBT+ & Identity Correspondent Alex Sparrowhawk from Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV and sexual health charity, says anyone with new symptoms â that can include a rash â should call their local sexual health clinic or 111 before going anywhere in person. Theyâre also monitoring the cases alongside the NHS and UK Health Security Agency. Alex said: âWe absolutely donât want to stigmatise gay and bisexual men and know the importance of being proactive in guarding against that. ""But we also know that to date a disproportionate number of monkeypox cases are among gay and bisexual men and want to play our role in reaching this community with the most up-to-date information including symptoms and what do."" Countries should review their availability of the smallpox vaccines used for monkeypox, as well as stocks of antivirals and personal protective equipment, an EU disease expert says. Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the EU's European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, is also urging countries to swap their contact tracing mechanisms and their capacity to diagnose the disease. She says those who are infected with monkeypox should remain isolated until their lesions heal completely. ""For the broader population, the likelihood of spread is very low,"" Dr Ammon says. ""However the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example during sexual activities amongst persons with multiple sexual partners, is considered to be high."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Experts at the World Health Organization know a huge amount about monkeypox already. But there's a suggestion that perhaps not enough research has been carried out to keep pace with this current outbreak. What's puzzling them is why it has spread so widely outside of Africa. Is it simply the result of a 'superspreader event'? That would mean lots of people mixing closely together  passing the virus on to others wherever they travel to next. No one is sure what particular event could have been the cause. There have been warnings that summer festivals could spread the virus even more. Infection control experts from Europe have issued their advice and thoughts on the monkeypox situation. They agree that while the disease is usually mild, some people can get more seriously ill. That includes young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Further investigations are needed to accurately estimate that level of
threat,says the European Centre forDisease Prevention and Control,external. And it warns that humans may be able to spread the virus to animals, including pets or wildlife. If so, there is a risk that
the disease could become endemic in Europe.

LiveLiveMore countries report monkeypox cases as outbreak spreads1 minute ago,"The number of confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK has risen to 57, with an additional 36 cases reported in England More than 100 cases have now been confirmed outside Africa - in Europe, the US, Canada and Australia Monkeypox is a viral infection usually found in West and Central Africa and the illness is usually mild UK PM Boris Johnson says that so far the consequences ""don't seem to be very serious but it's important that we keep an eye on it"" World Health Organization experts say the outbreak can be contained and they do not have evidence the virus has mutated Anyone at the highest risk of having caught monkeypox should isolate for 21 days, says official UK guidance Experts say that while this is the biggest outbreak outside Africa in 50 years, this isn't another Covid-type situation Edited by Heather Sharp, Dulcie Lee and Emily McGarvey We're going to wrap up our live coverage now, but here's a recap what we've heard today:  Three facts to remember:  Want more? Read up on what monkeypox is and how it spreadshere.  Downing Street has said there are no plans to hold a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee over monkeypox, or to impose any travel bans. Asked about travel restrictions from affected countries before the 36 new UK cases were announced, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""No, no considerations of that kind. What we're seeing at the moment is community transmission not linked to travel."" He said vaccines were being offered to close contacts but there were no plans for an ""at scale"" vaccination programme. ""We do have vaccines procured at significant numbers but given the nature of this and how we know it's spreading, it's thought to be no clinical requirement for that sort of at scale campaign,"" he said. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News It is tempting to treat this outbreak of monkeypox as though
weâre in the early days of the Covid pandemic - but this is not Covid-Two. We should expect cases to continue to rise beyond the 57 now recorded across the UK. But remember monkeypox and coronavirus are different viruses that spread in a different
ways and will need different tools to control them. There are urgent questions that need answering:  Covid was a highly contagious disease that spread through
the air we breathe and could spread even if you had no symptoms. Monkeypox mainly spreads through close skin to skin contact and
its blistering rash is hard to miss. We should have the tools to deal with it. More now on the rise in monkeypox cases in the UK, with 36 new cases in England bringing the UK total to 57. In a statement, the UKHSA said the outbreak is ""significant and concerning"" but the ""risk to the UK population remains low"". Its chief medical adviser, Dr Susan Hopkins, urged people to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms, as the virus spreads through close contact. âA notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.â She thanked those who have come forward for monkeypox testing so far and who have supported contact tracing efforts. ""You are helping us limit the spread of this infection in the UK,"" she said. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said it has detected 36 additional cases of monkeypox in England. The latest cases bring the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England since 7 May to 56. Adding in the new case in Scotland, that brings the UK total to 57. Laura FosterBBC Scotland senior health reporter Not much is known about Scotland's first monkeypox case, but some details are now starting to emerge. We now know that the person is in isolation in a Scottish hospital in an area which specialises in infectious diseases. They were exposed to the virus in the UK and their close contacts are already being contacted and offered the smallpox vaccine. Dr Nick Phin from Public Health Scotland says youâd expect to have between 10 and 20 contacts for each case of monkeypox and says a ""more than sufficient"" number of vaccine doses have been ordered for this case ""plus a buffer"". He could not confirm whether everyone who has been offered the vaccine has accepted the jab â but admits there has been some reluctance in England as can typically happen with vaccination programmes. But Dr Phin stresses that ""weâre not in a scenario like covid where weâre going to be vaccinating large swathes of the population"". Lauren MossLGBT+ & Identity Correspondent Alex Sparrowhawk from Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV and sexual health charity, says anyone with new symptoms â that can include a rash â should call their local sexual health clinic or 111 before going anywhere in person. Theyâre also monitoring the cases alongside the NHS and UK Health Security Agency. Alex said: âWe absolutely donât want to stigmatise gay and bisexual men and know the importance of being proactive in guarding against that. ""But we also know that to date a disproportionate number of monkeypox cases are among gay and bisexual men and want to play our role in reaching this community with the most up-to-date information including symptoms and what do."" Countries should review their availability of the smallpox vaccines used for monkeypox, as well as stocks of antivirals and personal protective equipment, an EU disease expert says. Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the EU's European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, is also urging countries to swap their contact tracing mechanisms and their capacity to diagnose the disease. She says those who are infected with monkeypox should remain isolated until their lesions heal completely. ""For the broader population, the likelihood of spread is very low,"" Dr Ammon says. ""However the likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example during sexual activities amongst persons with multiple sexual partners, is considered to be high."" Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Experts at the World Health Organization know a huge amount about monkeypox already. But there's a suggestion that perhaps not enough research has been carried out to keep pace with this current outbreak. What's puzzling them is why it has spread so widely outside of Africa. Is it simply the result of a 'superspreader event'? That would mean lots of people mixing closely together  passing the virus on to others wherever they travel to next. No one is sure what particular event could have been the cause. There have been warnings that summer festivals could spread the virus even more. Infection control experts from Europe have issued their advice and thoughts on the monkeypox situation. They agree that while the disease is usually mild, some people can get more seriously ill. That includes young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Further investigations are needed to accurately estimate that level of
threat,says the European Centre forDisease Prevention and Control,external. And it warns that humans may be able to spread the virus to animals, including pets or wildlife. If so, there is a risk that
the disease could become endemic in Europe. Lauren MossLGBT and Identity Correspondent Monkeypox is prompting questions among the gay community, with the latest health data indicating a proportion of the recent cases in the UK and Europe have been in gay and bisexual men. Itâs important to stress that this is not an illness that affects one community more than any other, and itâs not a sexually transmitted disease. Itâs spread through close contact. These latest infections are new and, as we learn more about them, more information will become clear about who is becoming infected. WHO expert Andy Seale has suggested it could be due to an increased awareness of sexual health amongst the gay community; meaning more infections among that group are coming to light. For now though, itâs early days and too soon to say why. UNAids has urged caution in the language used when we discuss monkeypox and to make sure that it doesnât reinforce any homophobic or racist stereotypes. Any stigma around the disease could seriously undermine any response to the outbreak. Getting the balance between informing groups who might need to be vigilant, but not stigmatising them, will be key to targeting the right public health message to the right people. US President Joe Biden has said the US has enough smallpox vaccine to deal with an outbreak of monkeypox. A smallpox jab offers some good protection against monkeypox since the two viruses are quite similar. Biden urged people to be careful, but said the situation did not warrant the same emergency response seen worldwide during the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of smallpox vaccine and drugmakers including SIGA
Technologies and GeoVax Labs jumped between 7%
and 40% after the US identified its third suspected
case of monkeypox. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Sexual health doctors in the UK are warning monkeypox could have a major impact on access to sexual health services. Staff at clinics who have seen patients infected with the virus are being told to stay at home and isolate for 21 days. That means there are fewer doctors available to treat people coming in with other infections. And in London, where most of the UK's 20 confirmed cases have been found, sexual health clinics want everyone to phone or email ahead, rather than walk in for an appointment. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said it was concerned about the pressure this was already putting on the workforce. It warned that sexually-transmitted infections could be missed while access to sexual health clinics is restricted. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online We've just heard from experts at the World Health Organization and they say nations should be prepared to see more cases of monkeypox in the coming weeks. That doesn't mean the situation is necessarily getting worse though, or that the disease is out of control. Health officials say they are confident that the spread can be contained. Why? Although the outbreak we are seeing is unusual, the virus is not so easy to catch as some other diseases, such as Covid. We know it takes very close physical contact - often skin-on-skin - to spread monkeypox between people. And unlike Covid, which is often asymptomatic, people with monkeypox will usually feel unwell and notice a rash. Drugs and vaccines are already available that can help control and treat monkeypox. As the WHO discussion draws to a close, one member of the public has shared concerns with the panel that the response to this virus could fuel discrimination. Andy Seale, a WHO adviser on HIV, hepatitis and STIs programmes, says while some media reporting on monkeypox has been very good, sometimes it ""does come sadly with some misinformation, stigma and discrimination"". He says has not just been the case for men who have sex with men, ""but perhaps also unintentionally suggesting this is an African disease by only using images of black skin, for example"". Seale says the WHO wants to learn from the decades of experience tackling stigma and discrimination around HIV. And he says they want to make sure communities are helping inform messaging and surveillance around monkeypox. We're following experts from the World Health Organization answering questions from the public about monkeypox.On vaccines, Dr Rosamund Lewis says that, although smallpox has now been eradicated, studies from the time showed that smallpox vaccines were effective against monkeypox around 85% of the time. The viruses, she says, are closely related to each other. Monkeypox vaccines exist but are relatively new and not widely available. But the WHO experts said they were working to enhance availability. ""This is not something that everybody needs - it is only spreading  between close contacts [of] those who are cases,"" Dr
Maria Van Kerkhove adds. A notable proportion of UK cases of monkeypox are in gay or bisexual men, which has prompted the UK Health Security Agency to encourage men who have sex with men to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions. The WHO's Andy Seale says it's early days, but this demographic is generally one which really takes care of health screening when it comes to potential STIs. The fact this demographic has been proactive about responding to unusual symptoms might be part of the story, he says. Some of the early symptoms are fever, headache, lethargy, backache and this usually lasts for a day or two, says Dr Rosamund Lewis. Following this, a rash begins and it starts with red areas on the skin, then it progresses to papules which are raised, then to vesicles or blisters, and then to pustules. After that they begin to dry and scab, and the scab falls off, she says. In terms of the body, the classic progression is face, then to limbs, palms of the hands, soles of the feet and then to the body itself, the says. Swollen lymph nodes are also a common symptom, and Dr Lewis says an important distinction between monkeypox and smallpox - which was eradicated in 1980 - was that if a child had swollen lymph nodes it was more likely to be monkeypox than smallpox. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Moving away from the WHO for a moment, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that monkeypox is ""rare"" and ""so far the consequences don't seem to be very serious"". Speaking at a primary school in south-east London, the PM told reporters ""it's important that we keep an eye on it and that's exactly what the new UK Health Security Agency is doing"". Johnson also said health officials were closely examining how the infection was being spread. High-risk close contacts, such as doctors who've diagnosed people with the virus,are being advised to isolate for 21 days. Some are also being offered a smallpox vaccine which is known to provide good protection against the similar monkeypox virus. We don't really know, says Dr Rosamund Lewis, the head of the WHO smallpox secretariat. ""It's a very stable virus,"" she says, explaining that smallpox is a DNA virus and the mutation rate is much lower than for RNA viruses, which include coronavirus. We don't yet have evidence that there's a mutation in the virus itself, she says, but experts are beginning to collect information on this. Virologists will soon begin discussing if the virus has changed based on the sequence of the genome of some of the cases that are being detected, she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

High-risk monkeypox contacts advised to isolate,"Monkeypox virus particle Anyone at the highest risk of having caught monkeypox should isolate for 21 days, official guidance says. The UK Health Security Agency advice,externalis for anyone who has direct or household contact with a confirmed case. Contacts are advised to provide their details for contact tracing, forgo travel, and avoid contact with immunosuppressed people, pregnant women, and children under 12. The UK has confirmed 21 cases, with thefirst case in Scotlandon Monday. More than 80have also been identifiedacross Europe, the US, Canada, Israel, and Australia. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""As things stand the judgement is that it's rare. I think we're looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission. ""It hasn't yet proved fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country. ""The UK Health Security Agency - a new body - is obviously following it very closely."" Monkeypox is a rare viral infection most common in remote parts of central and west Africa. The disease, first found in monkeys, does not tend to spread easily between people but can be transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual intercourse. Symptoms, which include a high temperature, aches, and a rash of raised spots that later turn into blisters, are typically mild and for most people clear up within two to four weeks. A person is considered at high risk of having caught the infection if they have had household or sexual contact with, or have changed the bedding of an infected person without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Other people who may have come into contact with a case do not need to stay at home and isolate, but should watch out for symptoms such as fever and a rash. Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles. Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Although there has been a small number of deaths attributed to the virus in west and central Africa since December, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, none have beenreported by the World Health Organisation,externalin other countries where cases have been found. Monkeypox detected in three more countries What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore? Speaking to the BBC, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said community transmission was occurring in the UK. ""We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we've seen previously in this country,"" she said. The UKHSA has said a notable proportion of early cases has been detected in gay and bisexual men and has urged members of those communities in particular to be alert. The cases have also been largely concentrated in urban areas. ""We would recommend to anyone who is having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don't know, to come forward if they develop a rash,"" said Dr Hopkins. Dr Hopkins added close contacts of cases were being given an established smallpox vaccine that can help protect against monkeypox. ""We're not using [the vaccine] in the general population,"" she said. ""We're using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms, and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms. ""For contacts, [this] reduces your risk of developing disease, so that's how we're focusing our vaccination efforts at this point."" Smallpox vaccines are about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox infection, and several countries have said they have begun stockpiling them. Dr Susan Hopkins of the UKHSA encouraged anyone who developed symptoms of monkeypox to come forward It is not yet clear why this unexpected outbreak is happening now. One possibility is the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant. Another explanation could be the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. Director of the Wellcome Trust Sir Jeremy Farrar told the BBC there may have been a ""superspreader"" event where people gathered and picked up the infection and then took it home with them to different countries. Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used. Prof Tom Solomon, from the University of Liverpool's Pandemic Institute, said scientists were ""not too alarmed"" by the number of cases, adding he was not aware of there ever being a monkeypox death in the UK. The public health expert told BBC Breakfast he would not be surprised if infections were to double when new figures were released later on Monday - because they are now being actively looked for. Prof Solomon said: ""This is a very mild disease, if you didn't look for it you probably wouldn't even know that it had been occurring. So the numbers will go up. ""But the important thing is by identifying those cases we can isolate them, and isolate their contacts to stop the spread."" This monkeypox outbreak is undoubtedly unusual as this kind of spread has not been seen before. But that does not mean we are repeating Covid. Monkeypox is a known virus rather than the completely new coronavirus and we already have tools to help control it. The big challenge at the moment is we have no idea how many cases are out there. We know we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg because many of the new cases appear unconnected to each other. So we should expect the numbers of confirmed cases to continue to rise. Monkeypox: How worried should we be? The World Health Organization has said it is ""working with the affected countries and others to expand disease surveillance to find and support people who may be affected"". Its head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also saidthe world was facing ""formidable"" challenges,including Covid, the war in Ukraine and monkeypox. Asked about the outbreak on Sunday, US President Joe Biden said the spread of the virus was ""something that everybody should be concerned about"" and the US was ""working hard"" on its response.

âI ration my ADHD medication to save money',"Nicole Nadler pays about Â£130 a month for her ADHD medication A woman with adult ADHD is rationing her medicine to save money while she waits for the diagnosis to be recognised by the health service. Symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) include inattentiveness and anxiety. Nicole Nadler got a private diagnosis of the condition after learning some adults could take years to be assessed on the NHS. But her GP wants the diagnosis to come from an NHS assessment, meaning Nicole can't get her prescription for free. 'More than medication needed to treat ADHD Why women may wait decades for an ADHD diagnosis The good things about ADHD: 'It's my superpower' Waiting times across most of the NHS have been lengthened as a result of the Covid pandemic and NHS Lothian said its mental health services were facing ""unprecedented pressure"". The Scottish government said consultations with an NHS specialists were needed to ""ensure safe and effective prescribing"". But campaign groups say it is a mixed picture across Scotland with some private ADHD diagnosis provided by a General Medical Council-registered clinicians accepted by GPs and others finding themselves in the same position as Nicole. Nicole, from Edinburgh, is paying between Â£130 and Â£140 a month for her medicine and has appealed against the decision by her GP to NHS Lothian. The 32-year-old said the medication allows her to work, function and maintain relationships but she is now having to make it ""stretch a little bit further"" as she deals with the rising cost of living. She explained: ""By missing it on the weekends it obviously doesn't disrupt my work life, which is most important to me, the thing I'm most concerned about. ""I'm now paying for it every five or six weeks instead of every four."" Nicole says she was often described as ""unorganised or easily distracted"" when she was younger Nicole paid Â£350 for her private ADHD assessment with a view to getting a ""shared care"" agreement where a private diagnosis is accepted by the NHS which then funds prescription medication. She continued: ""They said they would be denying me shared care on the basis that I did not see an NHS doctor. I was caught off guard. ""If I'd been seen by an NHS doctor, I wouldn't need to apply for shared care because everything would've been done under the NHS."" Mrs Nadler expressed concern for people in her position but on lower incomes. ""There are so many people who couldn't come up with Â£140 a month. I mean it's not life saving in that it keeps your heart beating but, but it is life saving in the sense that a lot of people feel if they can get their life back and they can just function,"" she said. ""They can do things and they have the ability to regulate themselves, if you're really struggling medication gives you the ability to just function."" Dr Tony Lloyd, chief executive of the charity The ADHD Foundation, said they have been contacted by many people who are in the same position as Nicole and described the situation as ""very alarming and very concerning"". He added: ""A private diagnosis is not an excuse or a way of bypassing the NHS, it is about people who have a desperate need for help and support so that they can lead happy, healthier, successful lives."" There is no national collection of waiting times for adult diagnosis of ADHD. Jenny Long, director of primary care at NHS Lothian, said she was unable to discuss the care of individual patients but it was reviewing Nicole's complaint. She added: ""As a result of the Covid pandemic, our mental health services have come under unprecedented pressure. ""We would reassure patients that we are actively redesigning processes, recruiting more clinicians and increasing our clinical capacity to boost support and the numbers of assessments and appointments available for those patients most in need."" ADHD can be treated with medicine and therapy Dr Catriona Morton, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ""In the case of ADHD, we know that some patients are, understandably, turning to private providers when the alternative can often be long waiting lists for diagnosis and treatment. ""We recognise that in some cases, patients who seek a diagnosis from a private service can then experience delays when they then seek a prescription from their GP."" Kevin Stewart, minister for mental wellbeing, said four health boards in Scotland were piloting a ""single diagnostic pathway"" for ADHD diagnosis as part of a bid to improve the system. He added: ""We want patients to get the help they need, when they need it, and we understand how important a timely ADHD diagnosis is for individuals. ""Recommendations from specialists for ongoing prescribing on the NHS must be made at an NHS consultation with an NHS specialist to ensure safe and effective prescribing."" A Scottish government spokesman added that although some health boards have shared care policies it was ""at individual GPs' clinical discretion to decide what is in the best interest of their patients"".

'I was ignored' - report finds maternity racism,"This video can not be played WATCH: Hiral Varsani says she was traumatised by her treatment during the birth of her first child Black and Asian women are being harmed by racial discrimination in maternity care, according to an inquiry. The year-long investigation into ""racial injustice"" was conducted by the charity Birthrights. Women reported feeling unsafe, being denied pain relief, facing racial stereotyping about their pain tolerance, and microaggressions. The government has set up a taskforce to tackle racial disparities in maternity care. Hiral Varsani says she was traumatised by her treatment during the birth of her first child. The 31-year-old from north London developed sepsis - a potentially life-threatening reaction to an infection - after her labour was induced, which she says was only spotted after a long delay. ""I was shivering, my whole body was aching, my heart was beating really fast and I felt terrible. But everyone kept saying everything was normal,"" she says. ""It was almost 24 hours later before a doctor took my bloods for the first time and realised I was seriously ill."" Hiral had an emergency C-section and her daughter was taken into intensive care after also contracting sepsis. Why are black mothers at more risk of dying? Miscarriage: 'I was in pain - they did not listen' She believes her race played a role in her care: ""I experienced microaggressions and was stereotyped because of the colour of my skin. ""The staff would say 'hello princess', and while I was having contractions in a corridor a midwife walked past and said, 'Oh, you're definitely going to need an epidural'. I had never even met her before. ""I was repeatedly ignored, they just thought I was a weak little Indian girl, who was unable to take pain."" While death in pregnancy or childbirth is very rare in the UK,there are stark racial disparities in maternal mortality rates.,external Black women are more than four times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women in the UK, while women from Asian backgrounds face almost twice the risk. Tinu Alikor was terrified she would become one of those statistics when she gave birth to her daughter 14 months ago. Tinu Alikor feared she might die while pregnant with her daughter The mother-of-three from Kent says she was ""mistreated and unheard"" during her maternity care each time, but says her most recent experience was perhaps the worst. During Tinu's second trimester, she had heavy, unexplained bleeding, and said she begged for an examination. ""The blood was getting worse, I was scared, I thought I was losing my baby. I've have had two miscarriages before. ""The doctors refused to examine me and just said I had a UTI. I was told I still had four days till the end of my antibiotics course, and I remember saying, 'four days to what - till I bleed to death'?"" When Tinu was eventually examined, she was immediately taken to hospital because of a serious bleed coming from her bladder, and she needed several blood transfusions. ""If I had not have been hospitalised, I don't think I'd be sitting here right now. And I don't think my daughter would be. I've met some amazing midwives and doctors but I think all my experiences in my pregnancies and labour have been tainted by my race. ""With all three of my labours, I wasn't given any pain relief. I had to beg for it during my first two births, and even then, I was only ever given gas and air. ""Racial stereotyping has got a lot to do with it. There is an assumption that black women have a higher pain tolerance. I don't know where this comes from. It doesn't hurt any less because I'm black."" The Birthrights investigation - supported by the law firm Leigh Day - found common themes across the testimony it heard. These included: Black and brown women reported feeling physically and psychologically unsafe during their care Health care professionals failed to recognise serious medical conditions such as jaundice in black babies because ""white bodies"" were considered the norm Women described racial stereotyping, microaggressions and assumptions - leading to distress and trauma. One of the most common experiences was that of black, brown and mixed ethnicity women reporting pain relief being denied or delayed because of racist stereotypes, including black women's perceived ability to tolerate pain and Asian women's perceived inability to cope with pain There were many accounts of women and staff hearing Asian women being referred to as ""princesses"" or ""precious"" and black women as ""aggressive"" or ""angry"" Some women and health care professionals shared examples of overt racism, such as hearing staff saying that black women and babies have ""thick, tough skin"", that the ward ""smells of curry"" when south Asian families were being cared for, and that Chinese people are ""dirty"" Melissa Brown, a midwife and officer for Birthrights, said maternity services were facing immense challenges. ""We did hear positive examples of maternity care, but there is racism and racial discrimination at a structural and individual level which is putting black, brown and mixed ethnicity women at harm. There are many complex reasons for poorer health outcomes for ethnic minorities, and racism and discrimination is definitely playing a role."" The Birthrights report - which will be sent to MPs - highlights the need for urgent action, including training for health care professionals which highlights diversity. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the Maternity Disparities Taskforce would ""level up maternity care for all women"". ""It will address factors linked to unacceptable disparities in quality of care, experiences and outcomes.""

"We cannot rule out a windfall tax, says minister","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: I'm not attracted intrinsically to new taxes Boris Johnson says ""no option is off the table"" to tackle rising living costs as pressure grows to impose a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. The policy, as proposed by opposition parties, would see a one-off levy on company profits, with proceeds used to support hard-hit households facing surging bills. The prime minister said he was ""not attracted intrinsically to new taxes"". But he said the government was ""going to put our arms round people"" to help. Mr Johnson told reporters: ""There is more that we are going to do... you'll just have to wait a little bit longer."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said part of the answer to tackling the cost of living was a windfall tax and it was ""staring the prime minister in the face"". He said ministers needed to address the situation, adding: ""Every day they dither and delay, more people are struggling, really struggling, with their bills."" Earlier, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was not ""philosophically attracted"" to a windfall tax, but he could not rule it out. He insisted the government would be pragmatic, and added that it was ""looking at the situation with real urgency and intent"". How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Two-child families paying Â£400 a month more Why are prices rising so quickly? Cost of living: What are Rishi Sunak's options? A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company or group of companies - the idea being is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP have all called for a such a levy on oil and gas firms, which have seen record profits since the economy restarted after the pandemic. The parties said the money could be used to support those worse affected by the rising cost of living, with bills for food, fuel and energy rocketing, and inflation hitting a 40-year high. The government had initially rejected the idea, warning it could deter investment from energy companies into the UK. But as costs continue to rise - and another energy price hike looms in the autumn - the language from Downing Street has softened, with both the prime minister and chancellor leaving the policy on the table. A number of Conservative backbenchers have also come out in favour of a windfall tax, increasing pressure on the government to act - with former Treasury minister Jesse Norman telling Today it was needed in these ""extraordinary times"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Government needs to ""get a grip"" and bring in a windfall tax Asked if a windfall tax went against Conservative values, Mr Johnson said: ""I don't like new taxes."" He added: ""No option is off the table, let's be absolutely clear about that. ""I'm not attracted, intrinsically, to new taxes. ""But as I have said throughout, we have got to do what we can - and we will - to look after people through the aftershocks of Covid, through the current pressures on energy prices that we are seeing post-Covid and with what's going on in Russia and we are going to put our arms round people, just as we did during the pandemic."" The PM pointed to support on offer already, including Â£9bn of funding targeted at energy bills, saying the government was providing a ""continuing stream of effort to shield people"". After that once in a century pandemic and the colossal economic intervention that followed, now the question is about this almighty economic crunch and what to do about it. What we are seeing in public - and it rages in private too - is philosophy and ideology smashing into reality. In other words Conservatives instinctively don't like windfall taxes appropriating the profits of a sector that has just happened to do very well. But the energy companies have had a genuine windfall, and senior figures in government are pretty grumpy that in various meetings with the oil companies, they just don't seem to get it - they have raked in enormous profits and not really helped themselves, as someone put it to me last night. So this U-turn looks increasingly likely, but there is some hesitation in grabbing the handbrake - there is a discussion on whether to do it, how to do it, when to do it and then what to do with the money that's raised. Plus there is a nervousness too that it is it not a panacea - that if it happened, people would be back at the government's door next week saying, 'what are you going to do next?'. There is a battle going on internally between pain relief, as it is described - short-term fixes that can help people right now; and what is seen as surgery - boosting the economy for years to come, with an argument that if you spend a pound now, you can't spend that pound again on a new train line or power station later. The government is also facing calls from a former Conservative Party leader to increase universal credit in line with inflation. Sir Iain Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4 that the biggest problem the country faced was a recession which would ""hit the poorest the hardest"". And he criticised the Treasury's ""group think"" for delaying the support that was needed. Senior Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin went even further, calling for a Â£13.5bn package of support to ease the cost of living crisis - including reviving the Â£20 a week uplift to universal credit that was introduced in the pandemic. He told BBC Essex on BBC Essex that he did not believe ""the Labour party or the Treasury yet get how serious this crisis is"". Treasury minister Mr Clarke said the government had already taken ""decisive action"" on universal credit by changing the taper rate - the amount lost by working claimants if they earn more money. But he ruled out the return of the Â£20 uplift.

Early help for families urged to avoid kids' care crisis,"Henrietta, in care from 14, says her life would have been different if her mother had been offered help earlier Tens of thousands more children could end up in care without radical changes to child protection, a ""once-in a generation"" review has warned. Thereview,externalof England's council-run children's services says struggling families need early intervention to ensure they do not reach crisis point. The recommendations include phasing out young offender institutions and a drive to recruit more foster parents. Ministers promised ""ambitious and detailed"" plans before the end of 2022. But Labour and the British Association of Social Workers both blamed government austerity measures since 2010 for stripping away services for vulnerable families. And the Independent Children's Homes Association, representing private providers of residential care, accused the review of ""overreaching"". The Independent Review of Children's Social Care's lead Josh MacAlister called for Â£2.6bn over five years to transform the system and prevent the number of children in care - already at record levels - rising above 100,000. It follows the killing of toddlersArthur Labinjo-HughesandStar Hobson,who died in separate incidents in 2020. The trials of their killers highlighted the inadequacies of the social system meant to protect at-risk children. A separate report on the failings in both cases is expected soon. Huge profits made from children's care - report Children in care 'seen as criminals not victims' Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' The landmark review's recommendations have also called for: new child-protection experts to ensure senior staff are directly involved in frontline decisions a recruitment drive to increase the number of foster parents who can care for children a new law protecting care leavers from discrimination young offender institutions, described as ""wholly unsuitable for children"", to be phased out ""I was always walking with a black bin bag,"" says Henrietta Imoreh, of being moved from placement to placement five times during her first weeks in care at the age of 14. Youth worker Henrietta, now 27, says the sort of early intervention recommended in the report could have transformed her life. Being in care ""felt like a never-ending storm"", she says. It disrupted her education, she was bullied and got into fights. ""Where is the support for families right at the start, when they're struggling?"" she asks. She says: ""There were so many moments in my childhood where my mum was suffering and nobody offered support... Maybe we wouldn't have gone into care and maybe our stories would have been different."" Mr MacAlister, a former teacher who led the government-commissioned review, told the BBC: ""I've walked away from this feeling a mixture of inspiration at times - seeing what families have been able to do and where children have been able to get despite the circumstances - but also rage. ""Some of the things going on in the system are outrageous and are not acceptable."" He said Â£2.6bn was needed for a five-year programme to change the system fundamentally, and improve the lives of children and their families. Without that, he said, the number of children in care - already at a record 80,000 - would grow. ""Carry on as we are and we'll have nearly 100,000 children in care by this time next decade, and the costs per year will be Â£15bn [up from Â£10bn]... and it won't be achieving better outcomes for anybody."" He suggested some of the money could be raised by a windfall tax on the 15 largest providers of residential children's care and foster care, who he said had ""done very well out of market failure"" by capitalising on demand. Mr MacAlister said: ""What we found is that this is a system - the children social care system - that needs a radical reset, because at the moment it is in a cycle where problems escalate, costs rise, outcomes continue to be too poor, and that's getting worse and worse over time."" Mr MacAlister (centre) and his team spoke to more than 2,000 people with personal experience of the care system Another key recommendation is extra financial support for relatives taking on the care of a child to avoid them going into children's homes, or being fostered. ""Children have told us, having been in care, that they desperately would have liked to stay with their grandparents or that uncle or family friend,"" Mr MacAlister said. But too often relatives' housing is unsuitable or budgets won't stretch to the cost of taking on an extra child, says the report, which argues for kinship carers to be paid the same amount as foster carers. Lisa, whose baby granddaughter was adopted last year, wishes she could have taken her in instead - but she says the social workers who handled the case were ""negative and nit-picking"" and not on her side. She already has a special guardianship order for the baby's older brother, but when she applied for the second child, she was told that a condition was giving up her job to focus on her granddaughter's emotional wellbeing. Lisa says she had no choice but to allow her granddaughter to be adopted Losing her income would have plunged the whole family into poverty, so Lisa felt she had no choice. ""It was the hardest decision I've ever made... I think I will take to my grave whether it was the right one or not."" Lisa says special guardians need better help. ""We are an afterthought. We don't get the support that foster carers get. We don't get the support adopters get - and yet we're the most successful placements for a child. It doesn't make sense."" In a statement, ministers said they were committed to ""major reforms to improve the lives of England's most vulnerable children and families"". Initial measures set out by the government include: family hubs for ""essential early support"" an expert National Implementation Board to oversee ""transformational change"" a foster carer recruitment drive more funding for councils to keep vulnerable children in education ""This is the start of a journey to change the culture and dramatically reform the children's social care system,"" said Education Secretary Nadim Zahawi, who pledged detailed plans for ""bold and ambitious change"" within months. Labour called the poor outcomes for children in care ""a source of shame for our country and our government"". ""A decade of Conservative governments have stripped away the early help services that children and families rely on,"" said Helen Hayes, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years. The British Association of Social Workers said: ""Public service austerity has not only driven social care services to breaking point, it has fundamentally undermined social protection for the poorest and most marginalised. ""While tackling poverty and funding cuts are in the review report, it needs to be unequivocal in asking government to act on poverty and structural underfunding of preventive and universal services, which is increasing demand on social services and inequalities between areas."" The Independent Children's Homes Association said it was ""stunned"" at the review's call for ""the destruction of more than 30 years in the children's social care sector, work that has produced one of the leading care systems in the world, while demonstrating an alarming lack of knowledge of the sector, poor examination of evidence, and misleading interpretation of critical data"".

Record-equalling Thomas wins second US PGA title,"Justin Thomas trailed leader Mito Pereira by seven shots heading into the final round US PGA Championship final leaderboard -5J Thomas (US)*, W Zalatoris (US);-4M Pereira (Chi);-3T Fleetwood (Eng), M Fitzpatrick (Eng), C Kirk (US);-2R McIlroy (NI) Selected: LevelJ Rose (Eng), T Hatton (Eng);+2S Lowry (Ire);+3B Watson (US);+4J Spieth (US) * denotes winner after three-hole play-off American Justin Thomas staged a record-equalling fightback before beating Will Zalatoris in a play-off to win the US PGA Championship at Southern Hills. Thomas trailed by seven at the start of the day but posted a three-under 67 to set the clubhouse target at five under. Chile's Mito Pereira looked set to win a first major title but double-bogeyed the 18th after hitting his tee shot into a creek to finish at four under. England's Matt Fitzpatrick (73) and Tommy Fleetwood (67) ended three under. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, who led the tournament after a five-under-par 65 on the opening day, closed with a 68 to finish eighth at two under in Oklahoma. Thomas was one over after six holes on Sunday but had four birdies in his final 10 holes to fire his way to the top of the leaderboard, with Zalatoris hanging on to also finish on five under and capitalise on Pereira's capitulation. But it was the world number nine who prevailed in the three-hole shootout, making a decisive birdie on the 17th to claim his second major after also winning this event in 2017. ""It was a bizarre day,"" said Thomas, who equalled John Mahaffey's record of coming from seven behind to win the 1978 US PGA title, also in a play-off, at Oakmont. ""Bones [Thomas' caddie] did an unbelievable job of just keeping me in the moment. We just tried to play the golf course for what it is.. ""It's funny, I was asked earlier in the week about what lead is safe, and I said, 'no lead'. This place is so tough. But if you hit the fairways you can make birdies and I stayed so patient, I just couldn't believe I found myself in a play-off."" Mito Pereira was hoping to become the first South American to win the Wanamaker Trophy The nerve-shredding moments that will define this major for Pereira came on the 17th green and 18th tee. A birdie putt that would have handed him a two-shot lead going down the last pulled up a couple of centimetres short before his drive a few moments later found water, ultimately sinking the world number one hundred's hopes of becoming the first Chilean to win a major title. ""I don't know what happened. I thought I hit it really good,"" the 27-year-old said of his last tee shot. ""On Monday, I just wanted to make the cut. On Sunday, I just wanted to win."" As his ball was settling in the creek, Zalatoris was on the 18th green rolling in a gutsy par putt to match Thomas on five under, while the former champion immediately headed to the driving range in preparation for a play-off. Pereira only made the switch from the PGA Tour's feeder Korn Ferry Tour last summer and his best finish of 2022 before this event was a share of 13th at last month's Texas Open, but he started the day with a three-stroke lead over Fitzpatrick on just his second major start. Zalatoris, also a relative newcomer but now with five top-10s in eight major starts, had wiped that out by the time he reached the sixth tee, only to bogey the tricky par-three hole in bizarre circumstances. An errant tee shot led to a 15-minute discussion with a rules official over where to drop his ball and he eventually made a superb up-and-down from a cart path. From there it became a grind for the leaders, with Pereira just about keeping his nose in front despite Cameron Young briefly joining the lead and Thomas appearing on the horizon thanks to his bogey-free back nine. That was until the par-four 18th, where Pereira's unravelling led to a six that saw him miss out on the play-off, leaving Zalatoris and Thomas to scrap it out over three holes. Both birdied the par-five 13th before Thomas drove the green at the 302-yard 17th and two-putted for a birdie that Zalatoris could not match, before holding his nerve with a par on the 18th to clinch his second Wanamaker Trophy. ""I've been knocking on the door in these majors for a little while and one's going to come soon,"" said Zalatoris. ""To come up one short, it stings, but I know we're going to get one soon."" Fitzpatrick, playing in the final pairing, began the day with genuine hope he could become the first Englishman to win this championship since Jim Barnes in 1919. That was dampened when the 27-year-old bogeyed his opening hole and despite cancelling that out with a birdie at the fourth, he played himself out of the mix with further dropped shots at six, 10 and 11. With those ahead of him toiling, Fitzpatrick greeted a birdie on the 15th with a huge fist pump in the knowledge he was once again two strokes off the lead, only for a bogey at 17 to kill off his chances as the Yorkshireman signed for a three-over 73 that took him to three under for the tournament. ""It's tough to take,"" said Fitzpatrick. ""I just didn't hit very well, wasn't a good day. It's disappointing knowing that you're two shots outside of a play-off and you feel like you've got the game to make the play-off and go on to win. ""I shoot level par and I win it outright. If someone had said that before the round, I'd have fully prepared myself to do that. You know your target and get it around. It wasn't the day that I wanted and it is what it is unfortunately."" Compatriot Fleetwood also finished at three under and McIlroy was one further back but they left Southern Hills in very different moods - Fleetwood buoyant after five birdies in his final seven holes and saying he was ""happy wherever I finish"", McIlroy rueing another missed opportunity. McIlroy had ended round one with a one-stroke lead, bucking his recent trend in majors of starting slow, but the damage for the four-time major champion was done with a one-over 71 on Friday, followed by a 74 on Saturday. When the world number seven holed four successive birdies from the second, it looked like he might be putting together a similar final round to the one he compiled at the Masters in April, but that run ended with a bogey at the par-three sixth - which he had double-bogeyed 24 hours earlier. The 33-year-old failed to card another birdie in a two-under 68 and left the course without speaking to the media. Fleetwood, meanwhile, made seven birdies in a final-day 67 that also included four straight bogeys through the turn to climb into a surprise share of fifth.

High risk monkeypox contacts advised to isolateOfficial guidance recommends quarantining for those who have had unprotected direct contact with the virus.UK,"Monkeypox virus particle Anyone at the highest risk of having caught monkeypox should isolate for 21 days, official guidance says. The UK Health Security Agency advice,externalis for anyone who has direct or household contact with a confirmed case. Contacts are advised to provide their details for contact tracing, forgo travel, and avoid contact with immunosuppressed people, pregnant women, and children under 12. The UK has confirmed 21 cases, with thefirst case in Scotlandon Monday. More than 80have also been identifiedacross Europe, the US, Canada, Israel, and Australia. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""As things stand the judgement is that it's rare. I think we're looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission. ""It hasn't yet proved fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country. ""The UK Health Security Agency - a new body - is obviously following it very closely."" Monkeypox is a rare viral infection most common in remote parts of central and west Africa. The disease, first found in monkeys, does not tend to spread easily between people but can be transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual intercourse. Symptoms, which include a high temperature, aches, and a rash of raised spots that later turn into blisters, are typically mild and for most people clear up within two to four weeks. A person is considered at high risk of having caught the infection if they have had household or sexual contact with, or have changed the bedding of an infected person without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Other people who may have come into contact with a case do not need to stay at home and isolate, but should watch out for symptoms such as fever and a rash. Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles. Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Although there has been a small number of deaths attributed to the virus in west and central Africa since December, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, none have beenreported by the World Health Organisation,externalin other countries where cases have been found. Monkeypox detected in three more countries What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore? Speaking to the BBC, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said community transmission was occurring in the UK. ""We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we've seen previously in this country,"" she said. The UKHSA has said a notable proportion of early cases has been detected in gay and bisexual men and has urged members of those communities in particular to be alert. The cases have also been largely concentrated in urban areas. ""We would recommend to anyone who is having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don't know, to come forward if they develop a rash,"" said Dr Hopkins. Dr Hopkins added close contacts of cases were being given an established smallpox vaccine that can help protect against monkeypox. ""We're not using [the vaccine] in the general population,"" she said. ""We're using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms, and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms. ""For contacts, [this] reduces your risk of developing disease, so that's how we're focusing our vaccination efforts at this point."" Smallpox vaccines are about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox infection, and several countries have said they have begun stockpiling them. Dr Susan Hopkins of the UKHSA encouraged anyone who developed symptoms of monkeypox to come forward It is not yet clear why this unexpected outbreak is happening now. One possibility is the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant. Another explanation could be the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. Director of the Wellcome Trust Sir Jeremy Farrar told the BBC there may have been a ""superspreader"" event where people gathered and picked up the infection and then took it home with them to different countries. Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used. Prof Tom Solomon, from the University of Liverpool's Pandemic Institute, said scientists were ""not too alarmed"" by the number of cases, adding he was not aware of there ever being a monkeypox death in the UK. The public health expert told BBC Breakfast he would not be surprised if infections were to double when new figures were released later on Monday - because they are now being actively looked for. Prof Solomon said: ""This is a very mild disease, if you didn't look for it you probably wouldn't even know that it had been occurring. So the numbers will go up. ""But the important thing is by identifying those cases we can isolate them, and isolate their contacts to stop the spread."" This monkeypox outbreak is undoubtedly unusual as this kind of spread has not been seen before. But that does not mean we are repeating Covid. Monkeypox is a known virus rather than the completely new coronavirus and we already have tools to help control it. The big challenge at the moment is we have no idea how many cases are out there. We know we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg because many of the new cases appear unconnected to each other. So we should expect the numbers of confirmed cases to continue to rise. Monkeypox: How worried should we be? The World Health Organization has said it is ""working with the affected countries and others to expand disease surveillance to find and support people who may be affected"". Its head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also saidthe world was facing ""formidable"" challenges,including Covid, the war in Ukraine and monkeypox. Asked about the outbreak on Sunday, US President Joe Biden said the spread of the virus was ""something that everybody should be concerned about"" and the US was ""working hard"" on its response.

We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the

Children's social care needs radical reset - review,"Henrietta, in care from 14, says her life would have been different if her mother had been offered help earlier Tens of thousands more children could end up in care without radical changes to child protection, a ""once-in a generation"" review has warned. Thereview,externalof England's council-run children's services says struggling families need early intervention to ensure they do not reach crisis point. The recommendations include phasing out young offender institutions and a drive to recruit more foster parents. Ministers promised ""ambitious and detailed"" plans before the end of 2022. But Labour and the British Association of Social Workers both blamed government austerity measures since 2010 for stripping away services for vulnerable families. And the Independent Children's Homes Association, representing private providers of residential care, accused the review of ""overreaching"". The Independent Review of Children's Social Care's lead Josh MacAlister called for Â£2.6bn over five years to transform the system and prevent the number of children in care - already at record levels - rising above 100,000. It follows the killing of toddlersArthur Labinjo-HughesandStar Hobson,who died in separate incidents in 2020. The trials of their killers highlighted the inadequacies of the social system meant to protect at-risk children. A separate report on the failings in both cases is expected soon. Huge profits made from children's care - report Children in care 'seen as criminals not victims' Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' The landmark review's recommendations have also called for: new child-protection experts to ensure senior staff are directly involved in frontline decisions a recruitment drive to increase the number of foster parents who can care for children a new law protecting care leavers from discrimination young offender institutions, described as ""wholly unsuitable for children"", to be phased out ""I was always walking with a black bin bag,"" says Henrietta Imoreh, of being moved from placement to placement five times during her first weeks in care at the age of 14. Youth worker Henrietta, now 27, says the sort of early intervention recommended in the report could have transformed her life. Being in care ""felt like a never-ending storm"", she says. It disrupted her education, she was bullied and got into fights. ""Where is the support for families right at the start, when they're struggling?"" she asks. She says: ""There were so many moments in my childhood where my mum was suffering and nobody offered support... Maybe we wouldn't have gone into care and maybe our stories would have been different."" Mr MacAlister, a former teacher who led the government-commissioned review, told the BBC: ""I've walked away from this feeling a mixture of inspiration at times - seeing what families have been able to do and where children have been able to get despite the circumstances - but also rage. ""Some of the things going on in the system are outrageous and are not acceptable."" He said Â£2.6bn was needed for a five-year programme to change the system fundamentally, and improve the lives of children and their families. Without that, he said, the number of children in care - already at a record 80,000 - would grow. ""Carry on as we are and we'll have nearly 100,000 children in care by this time next decade, and the costs per year will be Â£15bn [up from Â£10bn]... and it won't be achieving better outcomes for anybody."" He suggested some of the money could be raised by a windfall tax on the 15 largest providers of residential children's care and foster care, who he said had ""done very well out of market failure"" by capitalising on demand. Mr MacAlister said: ""What we found is that this is a system - the children social care system - that needs a radical reset, because at the moment it is in a cycle where problems escalate, costs rise, outcomes continue to be too poor, and that's getting worse and worse over time."" Mr MacAlister (centre) and his team spoke to more than 2,000 people with personal experience of the care system Another key recommendation is extra financial support for relatives taking on the care of a child to avoid them going into children's homes, or being fostered. ""Children have told us, having been in care, that they desperately would have liked to stay with their grandparents or that uncle or family friend,"" Mr MacAlister said. But too often relatives' housing is unsuitable or budgets won't stretch to the cost of taking on an extra child, says the report, which argues for kinship carers to be paid the same amount as foster carers. Lisa, whose baby granddaughter was adopted last year, wishes she could have taken her in instead - but she says the social workers who handled the case were ""negative and nit-picking"" and not on her side. She already has a special guardianship order for the baby's older brother, but when she applied for the second child, she was told that a condition was giving up her job to focus on her granddaughter's emotional wellbeing. Lisa says she had no choice but to allow her granddaughter to be adopted Losing her income would have plunged the whole family into poverty, so Lisa felt she had no choice. ""It was the hardest decision I've ever made... I think I will take to my grave whether it was the right one or not."" Lisa says special guardians need better help. ""We are an afterthought. We don't get the support that foster carers get. We don't get the support adopters get - and yet we're the most successful placements for a child. It doesn't make sense."" In a statement, ministers said they were committed to ""major reforms to improve the lives of England's most vulnerable children and families"". Initial measures set out by the government include: family hubs for ""essential early support"" an expert National Implementation Board to oversee ""transformational change"" a foster carer recruitment drive more funding for councils to keep vulnerable children in education ""This is the start of a journey to change the culture and dramatically reform the children's social care system,"" said Education Secretary Nadim Zahawi, who pledged detailed plans for ""bold and ambitious change"" within months. Labour called the poor outcomes for children in care ""a source of shame for our country and our government"". ""A decade of Conservative governments have stripped away the early help services that children and families rely on,"" said Helen Hayes, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years. The British Association of Social Workers said: ""Public service austerity has not only driven social care services to breaking point, it has fundamentally undermined social protection for the poorest and most marginalised. ""While tackling poverty and funding cuts are in the review report, it needs to be unequivocal in asking government to act on poverty and structural underfunding of preventive and universal services, which is increasing demand on social services and inequalities between areas."" The Independent Children's Homes Association said it was ""stunned"" at the review's call for ""the destruction of more than 30 years in the children's social care sector, work that has produced one of the leading care systems in the world, while demonstrating an alarming lack of knowledge of the sector, poor examination of evidence, and misleading interpretation of critical data"".

Monkeypox contacts advised to isolate for 21 days,"Monkeypox virus particle Anyone at the highest risk of having caught monkeypox should isolate for 21 days, official guidance says. The UK Health Security Agency advice,externalis for anyone who has direct or household contact with a confirmed case. Contacts are advised to provide their details for contact tracing, forgo travel, and avoid contact with immunosuppressed people, pregnant women, and children under 12. The UK has confirmed 21 cases, with thefirst case in Scotlandon Monday. More than 80have also been identifiedacross Europe, the US, Canada, Israel, and Australia. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""As things stand the judgement is that it's rare. I think we're looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission. ""It hasn't yet proved fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country. ""The UK Health Security Agency - a new body - is obviously following it very closely."" Monkeypox is a rare viral infection most common in remote parts of central and west Africa. The disease, first found in monkeys, does not tend to spread easily between people but can be transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual intercourse. Symptoms, which include a high temperature, aches, and a rash of raised spots that later turn into blisters, are typically mild and for most people clear up within two to four weeks. A person is considered at high risk of having caught the infection if they have had household or sexual contact with, or have changed the bedding of an infected person without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Other people who may have come into contact with a case do not need to stay at home and isolate, but should watch out for symptoms such as fever and a rash. Initial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles. Once the fever breaks a rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Although there has been a small number of deaths attributed to the virus in west and central Africa since December, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, none have beenreported by the World Health Organisation,externalin other countries where cases have been found. Monkeypox detected in three more countries What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? Monkeypox: Time to worry or one to ignore? Speaking to the BBC, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said community transmission was occurring in the UK. ""We are finding cases that have no identified contact with an individual from west Africa, which is what we've seen previously in this country,"" she said. The UKHSA has said a notable proportion of early cases has been detected in gay and bisexual men and has urged members of those communities in particular to be alert. The cases have also been largely concentrated in urban areas. ""We would recommend to anyone who is having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don't know, to come forward if they develop a rash,"" said Dr Hopkins. Dr Hopkins added close contacts of cases were being given an established smallpox vaccine that can help protect against monkeypox. ""We're not using [the vaccine] in the general population,"" she said. ""We're using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms, and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms. ""For contacts, [this] reduces your risk of developing disease, so that's how we're focusing our vaccination efforts at this point."" Smallpox vaccines are about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox infection, and several countries have said they have begun stockpiling them. Dr Susan Hopkins of the UKHSA encouraged anyone who developed symptoms of monkeypox to come forward It is not yet clear why this unexpected outbreak is happening now. One possibility is the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant. Another explanation could be the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. Director of the Wellcome Trust Sir Jeremy Farrar told the BBC there may have been a ""superspreader"" event where people gathered and picked up the infection and then took it home with them to different countries. Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used. Prof Tom Solomon, from the University of Liverpool's Pandemic Institute, said scientists were ""not too alarmed"" by the number of cases, adding he was not aware of there ever being a monkeypox death in the UK. The public health expert told BBC Breakfast he would not be surprised if infections were to double when new figures were released later on Monday - because they are now being actively looked for. Prof Solomon said: ""This is a very mild disease, if you didn't look for it you probably wouldn't even know that it had been occurring. So the numbers will go up. ""But the important thing is by identifying those cases we can isolate them, and isolate their contacts to stop the spread."" This monkeypox outbreak is undoubtedly unusual as this kind of spread has not been seen before. But that does not mean we are repeating Covid. Monkeypox is a known virus rather than the completely new coronavirus and we already have tools to help control it. The big challenge at the moment is we have no idea how many cases are out there. We know we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg because many of the new cases appear unconnected to each other. So we should expect the numbers of confirmed cases to continue to rise. Monkeypox: How worried should we be? The World Health Organization has said it is ""working with the affected countries and others to expand disease surveillance to find and support people who may be affected"". Its head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also saidthe world was facing ""formidable"" challenges,including Covid, the war in Ukraine and monkeypox. Asked about the outbreak on Sunday, US President Joe Biden said the spread of the virus was ""something that everybody should be concerned about"" and the US was ""working hard"" on its response.

"""I was ignored"" - report finds maternity racism","This video can not be played WATCH: Hiral Varsani says she was traumatised by her treatment during the birth of her first child Black and Asian women are being harmed by racial discrimination in maternity care, according to an inquiry. The year-long investigation into ""racial injustice"" was conducted by the charity Birthrights. Women reported feeling unsafe, being denied pain relief, facing racial stereotyping about their pain tolerance, and microaggressions. The government has set up a taskforce to tackle racial disparities in maternity care. Hiral Varsani says she was traumatised by her treatment during the birth of her first child. The 31-year-old from north London developed sepsis - a potentially life-threatening reaction to an infection - after her labour was induced, which she says was only spotted after a long delay. ""I was shivering, my whole body was aching, my heart was beating really fast and I felt terrible. But everyone kept saying everything was normal,"" she says. ""It was almost 24 hours later before a doctor took my bloods for the first time and realised I was seriously ill."" Hiral had an emergency C-section and her daughter was taken into intensive care after also contracting sepsis. Why are black mothers at more risk of dying? Miscarriage: 'I was in pain - they did not listen' She believes her race played a role in her care: ""I experienced microaggressions and was stereotyped because of the colour of my skin. ""The staff would say 'hello princess', and while I was having contractions in a corridor a midwife walked past and said, 'Oh, you're definitely going to need an epidural'. I had never even met her before. ""I was repeatedly ignored, they just thought I was a weak little Indian girl, who was unable to take pain."" While death in pregnancy or childbirth is very rare in the UK,there are stark racial disparities in maternal mortality rates.,external Black women are more than four times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women in the UK, while women from Asian backgrounds face almost twice the risk. Tinu Alikor was terrified she would become one of those statistics when she gave birth to her daughter 14 months ago. Tinu Alikor feared she might die while pregnant with her daughter The mother-of-three from Kent says she was ""mistreated and unheard"" during her maternity care each time, but says her most recent experience was perhaps the worst. During Tinu's second trimester, she had heavy, unexplained bleeding, and said she begged for an examination. ""The blood was getting worse, I was scared, I thought I was losing my baby. I've have had two miscarriages before. ""The doctors refused to examine me and just said I had a UTI. I was told I still had four days till the end of my antibiotics course, and I remember saying, 'four days to what - till I bleed to death'?"" When Tinu was eventually examined, she was immediately taken to hospital because of a serious bleed coming from her bladder, and she needed several blood transfusions. ""If I had not have been hospitalised, I don't think I'd be sitting here right now. And I don't think my daughter would be. I've met some amazing midwives and doctors but I think all my experiences in my pregnancies and labour have been tainted by my race. ""With all three of my labours, I wasn't given any pain relief. I had to beg for it during my first two births, and even then, I was only ever given gas and air. ""Racial stereotyping has got a lot to do with it. There is an assumption that black women have a higher pain tolerance. I don't know where this comes from. It doesn't hurt any less because I'm black."" The Birthrights investigation - supported by the law firm Leigh Day - found common themes across the testimony it heard. These included: Black and brown women reported feeling physically and psychologically unsafe during their care Health care professionals failed to recognise serious medical conditions such as jaundice in black babies because ""white bodies"" were considered the norm Women described racial stereotyping, microaggressions and assumptions - leading to distress and trauma. One of the most common experiences was that of black, brown and mixed ethnicity women reporting pain relief being denied or delayed because of racist stereotypes, including black women's perceived ability to tolerate pain and Asian women's perceived inability to cope with pain There were many accounts of women and staff hearing Asian women being referred to as ""princesses"" or ""precious"" and black women as ""aggressive"" or ""angry"" Some women and health care professionals shared examples of overt racism, such as hearing staff saying that black women and babies have ""thick, tough skin"", that the ward ""smells of curry"" when south Asian families were being cared for, and that Chinese people are ""dirty"" Melissa Brown, a midwife and officer for Birthrights, said maternity services were facing immense challenges. ""We did hear positive examples of maternity care, but there is racism and racial discrimination at a structural and individual level which is putting black, brown and mixed ethnicity women at harm. There are many complex reasons for poorer health outcomes for ethnic minorities, and racism and discrimination is definitely playing a role."" The Birthrights report - which will be sent to MPs - highlights the need for urgent action, including training for health care professionals which highlights diversity. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the Maternity Disparities Taskforce would ""level up maternity care for all women"". ""It will address factors linked to unacceptable disparities in quality of care, experiences and outcomes.""

Australia's new PM sworn in ahead of Quad summit,"Anthony Albanese (centre) was sworn in alongside key cabinet members (from left) Jim Chalmers, Penny Wong, Katy Gallagher and Richard Marles Anthony Albanese has been sworn in as Australia's new leader and will fly immediately to an international summit. Mr Albanese's Labor Party defeated Scott Morrison's conservative government in an election on Saturday. It remains unclear whether Mr Albanese will form a majority or govern with the support of crossbenchers. The prime minister left for Tokyo on Monday to meet the leaders of the so-called Quad nations - the US, India and Japan. Earlier in the day, he was sworn in with four key cabinet members, including new Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who is travelling with him to Japan. Richard Marles is the new deputy prime minister and employment minister, Jim Chalmers is treasurer, and Katy Gallagher is attorney-general and finance minister. It is Australia's first Labor government in almost a decade. The party has won 74 lower house seats but counting continues to determine whether they can get the 76 needed to form a majority. But the primary vote for both major parties fell - almost a third of Australians put the Greens, independents and other minor parties as their first preference. The Quad group is seen as largely aiming to counter growing Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region. It will meet on Tuesday following recent diplomatic tensions in the Pacific, after the Solomon Islands last month signed a security pact with China. The US and Australia hold fears the deal could allow China to build a naval base there. The moment that changes Australia Meet Australia's new prime minister In a statement ahead of the meeting, Mr Albanese said: ""The Quad Leaders' Summit brings together four leaders of great liberal democracies - Australia, Japan, India, and the United States of America - in support of a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific."" Ms Wong signalled that they would bring ""new energy and much more to the table"" on climate action, after ""a lost decade"". Climate change played a huge role in the election result, with a surge in support for candidates wanting urgent action. Mr Morrison's government had committed to a 2030 emissions reduction target of 26%-28% - about half that of the UK and US. Mr Albanese's government has a target of 43%. The Greens have picked up seats in Queensland, usually considered a conservative heartland The Greens are expected to pick up four lower seats, adding to seven climate-focused independents. They could put pressure on Labor to take even stronger action, especially if it fails to reach a majority. Mr Morrison's unpopularity and his party's stance on climate have been blamed by some Liberal MPs for wiping out their vote. Losses included senior party figures, including deputy leader Josh Frydenberg, in traditional Liberal strongholds. Mr Morrison stepped down as party leader on Saturday and former defence minister Peter Dutton is the favourite to succeed him. Mr Dutton - from the party's right - has been a controversial figure at times. Some question whether he could rebuild Liberal support in more progressive, metropolitan areas. It's been a busy few days for Mr Albanese. Since Saturday he has won an election, been sworn in as PM, and is now on his way to the Quad. It's fitting that Australia's new leader would hit the ground running. There's a lot to get to domestically and globally. Mr Albanese has said the Quad alliance is an absolute priority for Australia. This meeting comes at a crucial and tense time in the region with a growing Chinese influence that's making Australia and its allies nervous. The recent China defence deal with the Solomon Islands is seen as a threat to Australia's status as a strategic partner to Pacific nations. But there's a fine balance Mr Albanese needs to strike. He needs to address China's expansion in the Indo-Pacific while also repairing a relationship with Beijing that's fractured significantly since the beginning of the pandemic when Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the Covid virus. China is now a very angry strategic trade partner. And the other Quad members will need to be reassured that Mr Albanese has a plan to manage the complicated relationship. The prime minister says this trip is a chance for Australia to send a message globally that it is changing its approach on crucial policies such as climate change. This is now being called the climate election. Mr Albanese wants to tell his allies and the world that under his leadership they'll be dealing with a new and more globally-engaged Australia.

'Formidable' challenges as monkeypox spreads - WHO,"The palms of a patient with skin lesions due to monkeypox The world is facing ""formidable"" challenges, including Covid, the war in Ukraine and monkeypox, the head of the World Health Organization has warned. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was speaking in Geneva, where the UN health agency's experts were discussing the monkeypox outbreak in 15 nations outside Africa. More than 80 cases have been confirmed in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and Israel. However, the risk to the wider public is said to be low. Monkeypox - the virus that is most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa - does not tend to spread easily between people and the illness is usually mild. Most people who catch the virus recover within a few weeks, according tothe UK's National Health Service,external. The outbreak has taken scientists by surprise, and UK health officials have issued new advice,saying high-risk contacts of cases should self-isolate for three weeks. Belgium became the first country to announce a three-week quarantine for infected persons on Friday. More confirmed cases are expected to be announced in the UK on Monday, the Guardian newspaper reports. EXPLAINER:What is monkeypox? ANALYSIS:Time to worry or one to ignore? Speaking at Sunday's opening of his agency's World Health Assembly, Dr Tedros said: ""Of course the [Covid] pandemic is not the only crisis in our world. ""As we speak our colleagues around the world are responding to outbreaks of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, monkeypox and hepatitis of unknown cause and complex humanitarian crises in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine and Yemen. ""We face a formidable convergence of disease, drought, famine and war, fuelled by climate change, inequity and geopolitical rivalry,"" the WHO head added. The WHO earlier said that a number of other suspected monkeypox cases were being investigated - without naming the countries involved - and warned that more infections were likely to be confirmed. After the outbreak was first identified in the UK, the virus began to be detected across Europe - with public health agencies in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden all confirming cases. Further cases were confirmed in Austria and Switzerland on Sunday. The UK Health Security Agency has identified 20 cases so far and its chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""We are detecting more cases on a daily basis."" She said the virus was now spreading in the community - with cases detected which have had no contact with anyone who has visited West Africa, where the disease is endemic. But the risk to the general population remains ""extremely low"", with cases so far mostly found in some urban areas and among gay or bisexual men, Dr Hopkins said. Although there is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, several countries have said they are stocking smallpox vaccines, which are about 85% effective in preventing infection because the two viruses are quite similar. It is not yet clear why this unexpected outbreak is happening now. One possibility is that the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant. Another explanation is that the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used.

"Monkeypox detected in three more countriesScientists are still unsure what is causing the outbreak, which has now spread to 15 countries.Health","Israel, Switzerland and Austria are the latest countries to confirm cases of monkeypox, bringing the total number of nations reporting outbreaks to 15. Israel and Switzerland both said they identified one infected person who had recently travelled abroad. Israel is investigating other suspected cases. Monkeypox does not tend to spread easily between people and the illness is usually mild. The virus is most common in remote parts of Central and West Africa. More than 80 cases have been confirmed in the recent outbreak in Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. This outbreak has taken scientists by surprise, but the risk to the wider public is said to be low. Most people who catch the virus recover within a few weeks, according tothe UK's National Health Service,external. EXPLAINER:What is monkeypox? ANALYSIS:Time to worry or one to ignore? The World Health Organization has said a number of other suspected cases are being investigated - without naming the countries involved - and warned that more infections are likely to be confirmed. Asked about the outbreak as he finished a visit to South Korea, US President Joe Biden said that if the virus were to spread more widely it would be ""consequential"", adding that ""it is something that everybody should be concerned about"". He said the US was ""working hard"" on its response and what vaccines in might use. After the outbreak was first identified in the UK, the virus began to be detected across Europe - with public health agencies in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden all confirming cases. The UK Health Security Agency has identified 20 cases so far and its chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""We are detecting more cases on a daily basis."" She said the virus is now spreading in the community - with cases detected which have no contact with anyone who has visited West Africa, where the disease is endemic. But the risk to the general population remains ""extremely low"", with cases so far mostly found in some urban areas and among gay or bisexual men, Dr Hopkins said. Although there is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, several countries have said they are stocking smallpox vaccines, which are about 85% effective in preventing infection because the two viruses are quite similar. In a statement on Friday,external, the WHO said that the recent outbreaks were unusual in that they were occurring in countries where the disease was not endemic. It is not yet clear why this unexpected outbreak is happening now. One possibility is that the virus has changed in some way, although currently there is little evidence to suggest this is a new variant. Another explanation is that the virus has found itself in the right place at the right time to thrive. Monkeypox may also spread more easily than it did in the past, when the smallpox vaccine was widely used. The WHO's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, has warned that ""transmission could accelerate"" during the summer season, as people gather for festivals and parties. In addition to the European cases, Australia has confirmed that one man who had travelled to the UK contracted the virus. In North America,health authorities in the US state of Massachusetts,externalsaid one man who recently travelled to Canada had tested positive for the virus. Canada's Public Health Agency said it had identifiedtwo cases in Quebec,external, but said it was not clear if the US traveller had been infected before or during his visit to Montreal.

Rail unions vow to fight government strike threatTransport Secretary Grant Shapps claims a new law would protect shipments from disruption.Business,"Rail unions have reacted with fury to a government threat to make strike action illegal unless a minimum number of train staff work during a walkout. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said a law would protect freight shipments of goods such as food and fuel. But unions vowed ""fierce resistance"" to any curb on the right to strike, calling the move ""authoritarian"" and ""desperate nonsense"". Some 40,000 rail workers are being balloted over taking industrial action. The ballot of National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) members closes on Tuesday and the results are likely to be known the following day. The RMT claims that the strike - involving members of 15 train operating companies and Network Rail - could be the biggest ""in modern history"" and bring the country ""to a standstill"". Mr Shappstold The Sunday Telegraph,externalthat unions were using strikes as a first resort rather than a last measure. He cited a promise thatthe Conservative Party made in its 2019 manifesto,externalthat it ""will require that a minimum service operates during transport strikes"". He told the newspaper: ""We had a pledge in there about minimum service levels. If they really got to that point then minimum service levels would be a way to work towards protecting those freight routes and those sorts of things. ""We very much hope they will wake up and smell the coffee."" However, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said ""any attempt"" by Mr Shapps to ""make effective strike action illegal on the railways will be met with the fiercest resistance from RMT and the wider trade union movement"". He was joined by Unite general secretary Sharon Graham who said the union ""will confront head-on and by whatever means necessary, any further attacks on the right to strike"". She called it ""a cynical, authoritarian move"", adding: ""A worker's right to withdraw their labour is inalienable in any democracy worth its name."" Meanwhile, Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, said: ""What we are seeing here is desperate nonsense from the Tories who have chosen to attack working people in our union who kept the railways running every single day of the pandemic."" In its manifesto, the Conservatives said: ""Rail workers deserve a fair deal, but it is not fair to let the trade unions undermine the livelihoods of others."" The RMT said the strike is over pay, terms and conditions as well as planned job cuts. It said its members are facing  ""pay freezes, threats to jobs and attacks on their terms and conditions"". Network Rail plans to shed 2,500 maintenance jobs in order to make Â£2bn worth of savings. Network Rail - which maintains the railways and carries out vital functions such as signalling - has not been involved in a national strike since 1994. There are concerns a walkout by its workers could affect both passengers and the movement of goods by train, such as fuel and food. Although rail makes up a relatively small proportion of all freight, this has been increasing because of the lorry driver shortage, and environmental considerations.
