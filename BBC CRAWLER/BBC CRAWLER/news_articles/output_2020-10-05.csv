Welsh quarantine considered for UK Covid hotspots,"This video can not be played Vaughan Gething said English hotspots would face Welsh quarantine rules if they were countries People travelling to Wales from Covid hotspots elsewhere in the UK could face quarantine under measures being considered by the Welsh Government. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was looking at how powers could be used to protect areas with lower cases. It comes after the prime minister rejectedcalls from Welsh ministers for a travel ban. Currently people in lockdown areas in England can go on holiday in parts of Wales not subject to restrictions. It is illegal for people to leave or enter lockdown counties Wales except for a limited set of reasons, like work or education. But a similar law does not exist for areas under local restrictions in England. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Westminster government felt it was more ""appropriate"" to put ""travel restrictions in guidance rather than in law"".  What can I do during local lockdowns? Mr Gething said if some English areas were countries Wales ""would have quarantine regulations for them"". But he said there was ""no good reason"" to prevent someone from a low incidence area like Devon from travelling to Pembrokeshire. ""We're having to consider how we use our powers to protect lower-prevalence areas of Wales but at the same time, we don't want to take a whole-nation approach,"" Mr Gething said. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he did not want to impose travel restrictions First Minister Mark Drakefordhad written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week, asking for travel restrictions to prevent people visiting Wales from areas under lockdown in England. But Mr Johnson told BBC Wales: ""We are all one country, people should exercise their common sense."" Mr Gething said it was ""disappointing"" Mr Johnson did not respond to the letter. He added that if people travelled from an area like Liverpool there was a risk of ""spreading events"". The Conservative health spokesman in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said bringing in quarantine restrictions for people travelling to Wales from Covid hotspots in England was a ""dangerous slope"" for the Welsh Government to go down. ""If you start introducing such quarantine restrictions in Wales does that mean then there's a quid pro-quo that England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will start doing the same for Welsh residents? ""There are all sorts of questions to be answered before you even entertain implementing such dramatic action."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said he had called for measures to limit travel with Mark Drakeford for ""two weeks running"". ""At a time when we need to act quicker and smarter to eliminate the virus, it's regrettable that it took the UK government's negligent dismissal of travel restrictions to bounce the Welsh Government into action,"" he said. Could visitors to Wales face quarantine when they arrive? In Wales it is illegal to enter or leave the 15 locked-down council areas, and the the town of Llanelli, without a ""reasonable excuse"". That can include: For work, if you cannot work from home For education To seek medical assistance To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation, and to access or receive public services Travelling through the areas is legal, but breaches can be punished with fines, with a fixed penalty notice of Â£60 for a first offence. There is no similar legal restriction in England, although people in areas likeMerseyside, Halton and Warrington,externalhave been asked to avoid non-essential travel. The way lockdown restrictions work differs between England and Wales In the Commons the Labour MP for Swansea West, Geraint Davies, asked Mr Hancock if people travelling from England should quarantine when arriving in Wales. Mr Hancock said in response: ""The primary transmission of the disease is between households and between households mixing with each other"". ""And the approach that we've taken thus far in England since we came out of the initial full blown lockdown has been to put travel restrictions in guidance, rather than in law, because we felt that's the most appropriate thing to do. ""I know that's not the approach that they're taking in Wales, but that's how we are currently handling it in England"". James Davies, Conservative Vale of Clwyd MP, said the travel restrictions in north Wales have caused ""huge disruption"" to half a million people. Mr Davies said people had not been allowed to cross ""often meaningless county council boundaries."" The health secretary added that he had shared proposals for a ""simplified"" approach to local lockdowns with the devolved governments. The UK government is understood to be planning a new three-tier approach to local coronavirus restrictions in England. Mr Hancock said he had discussed these plans with Mr Gething and that it would ""simplify further if it were undertaken across the UK."" A UK government Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We work closely with local leaders and public health teams to inform decisions on local interventions, taking into account a range of factors."" Public Health England, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and NHS Test and Trace ""are constantly monitoring the levels of infection across the country,"" the spokesperson added. ""We discuss measures with local directors of public health and local authorities, constantly reviewing the evidence and we will take swift targeted action where necessary."" A data glitch that has delayed test results in England has not impacted Wales, an official has said. An investigation is under way after nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases went unreported in England, delaying contact tracing efforts. Giri Shankar, incident director at Public Health Wales, said: ""Preliminary findings from a Department of Health and Social Care analysis have indicated that this issue has not affected Wales, either in terms of data reporting, or in terms of contact tracing under Test, Trace, Protect. We continue to stay in close contact with the DHSC about this,"" he said.

State pension age hits 66 and set to rise further,"The age at which most people start to receive the state pension has now officially hit 66 after steady rises in the qualifying age in recent years. Men and women born between 6 October, 1954, and 5 April, 1960, will start receiving their pension on their 66th birthday. For those born after that, there will be a phased increase in state pension age to 67, and eventually 68. It comes as the chancellor vowed the ""triple lock"" pledge is safe. Use the government's calculator to find out your state pension age,external Under this pledge, the state pension increases each year in line with the highest of average earnings, prices (as measured by inflation) or 2.5%. Coronavirus and the furlough scheme is set to distort the calculations for average wages and could mean one bumper year of pension increases. This has ledMPs and economists to discuss how this could be smoothed out. But, when asked by LBC radio whether the triple lock was safe, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Yes, our manifesto commitments are there and that is very much the legislative position. ""We care very much about pensioners and making sure they have security and that's indeed our policy."" The full state pension for new recipients is worth Â£175.20 a week. To receive the full amount, various criteria including 35 qualifying years of national insurance must be satisfied. The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and the government has plans for theincrease to 68 to be brought forward. However, the increases have been controversial, particularly for women who have seen the most significant rise. Campaigners took their fight to court Campaigners claim women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected. Some of those involved in the campaignrecently lost a legal challenge, claiming the move was unlawful discrimination. The coronavirus crisis has led many people to reconsider retirement plans, especially those who feel they are more at risk from the outbreak. Former pensions minister Ros Altmann argued that the crisis meant there was a ""strong case"" for people to be given early access to their state pension, even if it were at a reduced rate. She also pointed out the large differences in life expectancy in different areas of the UK. Millions of people who will rely on their state pension in retirement need to know two things: how much will they receive, and when. The future for both is not entirely clear. Firstly, the age at which the state pension begins has been rising, and will continue to do so. MPs will decide on how quickly this happens, fully aware of the strength of feeling from the WASPI (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaign over how this has been handled in the past. Secondly, there is always plenty of debate over the future of the triple lock - the pledge to ensure the state pension rises by a minimum of 2.5% each year. And if young workers think this has nothing to do with them, they should think again. How long we work before we receive state financial support in retirement is a vital issue for long-term financial planning. Younger workers have also been urged by pension providers to consider their retirement options, with a strong likelihood of state pension age rising further as time passes. ""As people live longer, it's clear many will also have to work for longer,"" said Pete Glancy, head of policy at Scottish Widows. ""The increase to the state pension age provides a timely reminder to everyone to check your pension pots and ask yourself whether the savings you've built up are enough for the kind of life you want in retirement."" Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""As average life expectancy continues to increase, the state pension age will inevitably follow suit. ""This means younger savers probably need to plan assuming they might not reach their state pension age until 70 or even beyond. Anyone who aspires to more than the bare minimum in retirement needs to take responsibility as early as possible to build their own retirement pot.""

Test error 'should never have happened' - Hancock,"The health secretary has said a technical glitch that saw nearly 16,000 Covid-19 cases go unreported in England ""should never have happened"". The error meant that although those who tested positive were told about their results, their close contacts were not traced. By Monday afternoon, around half of those who tested positive had yet to be asked about their close contacts. Labour said the missing results were ""putting lives at risk"". Experts advise that ideally contacts should be tracked down within 48 hours. How many cases are there in your area? What are the Covid rules where you live? How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? The technical error was caused by some Microsoft Excel data files exceeding the maximum size after they were sent from NHS Test and Trace to Public Health England. It meant 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were left out of the UK daily case figures. PHE said the error itself, discovered overnight on Friday, has been fixed, and outstanding cases had been passed on to tracers by 01:00 BST on Saturday. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the incident as a whole had not yet been resolved - with only 51% of those whose positive results were caught up in the glitch now reached by contact tracers. He said it had ""not substantially changed"" the government's assessment of the epidemic, however, and had ""not impacted the basis on which decisions about local action were taken"". He also said outbreak control in care homes, schools and hospitals had not been directly affected, as they do not rely on the data in question. ""This incident should never have happened. But the team have acted swiftly to minimise its impact,"" he added. The BBC has confirmed the missing Covid-19 test data was caused by the ill-thought-out use of Microsoft's Excel software. Furthermore, PHE was to blame, rather than a third-party contractor. The issue was caused by the way the agency brought together logs produced by the commercial firms paid to carry out swab tests for the virus. They filed their results in the form of text-based lists, without issue. PHE had set up an automatic process to pull this data together into Excel templates so that it could then be uploaded to a central system and made available to the NHS Test and Trace team as well as other government computer dashboards. The problem is that the PHE developers picked an old file format to do this - known as XLS. As a consequence, each template could handle only about 65,000 rows of data rather than the one million-plus rows that Excel is actually capable of. And since each test result created several rows of data, in practice it meant that each template was limited to about 1,400 cases. When that total was reached, further cases were simply left off. Read more from Leo here Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the missing results were ""putting lives at risk"". He said the unreported cases meant as many as 48,000 contacts had not been traced and therefore not been isolating, with ""thousands blissfully unaware they've been exposed to Covid, potentially spreading this deadly virus"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock tells MPs the late reporting of test results was a âserious issue that is being investigated fullyâ. Paul Wells said the NHS Covid-19 app allowed him to ""carry on as normal"" even after his husband had uploaded a positive test result and been told to self-isolate. ""It's very frustrating to hear that processes or systems are not working correctly, especially with something that is high risk,"" he told BBC News. ""The knock-on effect is damaging to not only myself and my husband, but the ripple effect it has to family and friends and our neighbours."" On Monday afternoon, the government's coronavirus dashboard announced a further 12,594 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 515,571. Another 19 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. The earlier technical error meant the daily case totals reported on the government's coronavirus dashboard over the past week have been lower than the true number. Why using Excel caused Covid-19 tests to be lost What's the danger of the missing 16,000 Covid cases? Daily figures for the end of the week were about 10,000 rather than the roughly 7,000 that had been reported. BBC analysis found the number of cases reported for the week to 1 October increased by 92.6% in the North West after taking in the missing tests - with similar rises reflected across England. The increase, of 8,348 cases, is mostly down to the missing tests, but the figures also included some results which came back after 2 October. You can look at the case numbers two ways: we normally count them on the date they're reported, which today would be 12,594. But today's news has shown how reporting lags can skew those trends. If you arrange the figures by the date the tests were taken, you can get a clearer picture. In that analysis, we reached an average of 10,000 new cases a day towards the end of last week. That's about double what it was a fortnight ago. It's hard to say for sure what's happened since then, since it takes a few days for tests to be reported and for these figures to settle down. But that pattern is consistent with other data: the number of people going into hospital, or official surveys and symptom trackers. They all paint a picture of an epidemic that's growing - not doubling every week, but growing. There's hope in some parts of the data that the pace of growth may be slowing slightly, but there's no evidence that it's shrinking. Mr Hancock suggested that the error did not impact the introduction of local restrictions last week. However, Liverpool Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram said the measures brought in there were ""predicated on"" figures that were ""underestimated by a considerable sum"". ""We understand that there needed to be further restrictions because of those increases in transmission rates, but we've not received any of the scientific evidence that backs that up,"" he told the BBC. ""It seems that the restrictions were predicated on a false promise that the figures that we were provided with were the basis for the announcement."" In full: Andrew Marr's interview with Boris Johnson Ministers have 'lost control of virus' - Starmer PHE data shows Liverpool has the second highest rate of infection in England, at 456.4 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 1 October, from 287.1 the week before. Knowsley in Merseyside, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leeds and Sheffield have also seen sharp rises. Manchester has the highest rate of infection, at 495.6 cases per 100,000 people, from 223.2 the week before. The BBC's Danny Savage said the head of public health in Manchester estimates the infection rate among the city's student population is as high as 3,000 cases per 100,000. ""We'll have to watch closely at what those figures are like in student populations across the country in areas with a high number of infection,"" he said. PHE said NHS Test and Trace has made sure there are enough contact tracers working, and is working with local teams to ensure they also have sufficient resources to be urgently able to contact all cases.

Surgeons fear 'tsunami of cancelled operations',"There could be a ""tsunami"" of cancelled operations this winter as the NHS copes with rising numbers of coronavirus patients, leading surgeons are warning. Members of the Royal College of Surgeons of England say they doubt the NHS can meet targets to restore surgery back to near pre-pandemic levels. Planned procedures such as hip replacements were paused to free up beds during lockdown in the spring. And hospitals have since been dealing with a backlog. In July, NHS England bossSir Simon Stevens told trusts,externalhospitals should by September 2020 be performing at least 80% of their September 2019 rates of: overnight planned procedures outpatient or day-case procedures And by October, this proportion should rise to 90%. But data suggestsmore than two million people have been waiting longer than 18 weeks for routine operations, with 83,000 waiting more than a year - up from 2,000 before the pandemic. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? More than 140,000 operations such as knee and hip replacements were performed in July 2020, up from 41,000 in April. But that is less than half the level seen in July 2019. The Royal College of Surgeons of England surveyed nearly 1,000 members in September and found: only 14% were now able to treat the same number of patients as before the pandemic 48% said planned operations were currently running at just 50-80% of 2019 levels President of the college Prof Neil Mortensen said: ""This is a national crisis requiring a truly national effort across all hospitals - private and NHS alike. ""As the virus becomes more prevalent again, there is a real risk of a tsunami of cancelled operations unless surgical beds are funded and protected. ""That means building up theatre capacity and designating beds exclusively for those who need an operation."" The poll also found: 22% were unable to access ""Covid-light"" hubs, which keep surgical patients separate from Covid-19 patients, particularly in Wales, Northern Ireland and north-east England 59% said their trust or health board was not routinely testing asymptomatic staff, to keep coronavirus off surgical wards An NHS spokesman said the survey underestimated the amount of surgery now happening in the NHS, adding that goals for the end of August were met. ""The NHS has flexed its hospital capacity and community services as needed throughout the pandemic, treating over 110,000 severely ill people for Covid-19, and doubling the number of non-urgent operations since April. More people are set to benefit from the deal struck with independent hospitals also to make use of their bed capacity. ""Covid inpatient numbers are rising and much depends on keeping the virus under control through continued public action on hands-face-space, Test and Trace service, and rapid action to control local outbreaks,"" he said.

'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering?,"For most people, Covid-19 is a brief and mild disease but some are left struggling with symptoms including lasting fatigue, persistent pain and breathlessness for months. The condition known as ""long Covid"" is having a debilitating effect on people's lives, and stories of being left exhausted after even a short walk are now common. So far, the focus has been on saving lives during the pandemic, but there is now a growing recognition that people are facing long-term consequences of a Covid infection. Yet even basic questions - such as why people get long Covid or whether everyone will fully recover - are riddled with uncertainty. There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include: breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. It can utterly destroy people's quality of life. ""My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before,""said one sufferer Jade Gray-Christie, Long Covid: 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' Long Covid: 'I donât have a life, I currently have an existence' Coronavirus patient unable to work six months on Long Covid is not just people taking time to recover from a stay in intensive care. Even people with relatively mild infections can be left with lasting and severe health problems. ""We've got no doubt long Covid exists,"" Prof David Strain, from the University of Exeter, who is already seeing long-Covid patients at his Chronic Fatigue Syndrome clinic, told the BBC. A study of 143 people in Rome's biggest hospital,published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,external, followed hospital patients after they were discharged. It showed 87% had at least one symptom nearly two months later and more than half still had fatigue. However, such studies focus only on the minority of people who end up needing hospital treatment. TheCovid Symptom Tracker App,external- used by around four million people in the UK - found 12% of people still had symptoms after 30 days. Its latest, unpublished data, suggests as many as one in 50 (2%) of all people infected have long-Covid symptoms after 90 days. It appears not. Half of peoplein a study in Dublin,externalstill had fatigue 10 weeks after being infected with coronavirus. A third were physically unable to return to work. Crucially, doctors found no link between the severity of the infection and fatigue. However, extreme exhaustion is only one symptom of long Covid. Prof Chris Brightling, from the University of Leicester and the chief investigator in the PHOSP-Covid projectwhich is tracking people's recovery,external, believes people who developed pneumonia may have more problems because of damage to the lungs. Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia There are lots of ideas, but no definitive answers. The virus may have been cleared from most of the body, but continues to linger in some small pockets. ""If there's long-term diarrhoea then you find the virus in the gut, if there's loss of smell it is in the nerves - so that could be what's causing the problem,"" says Prof Tim Spector, from King's College London. The coronavirus can directly infect a wide variety of cells in the body and trigger an overactive immune response which also causes damage throughout the body. One thought is the immune systemdoes not return to normal,externalafter Covid and this causes ill-health. The infection may also alter how people's organs function. This is most obvious with the lungs if they become scarred - long-term problems have been seenafter infection with Sars or Mers,external, which are both types of coronavirus. But Covid may also alter people's metabolism. There have been cases of people struggling to control their blood sugar levels afterdeveloping diabetes as a result of Covid,external, and Sars led to changes in the way the body processed fatsfor at least 12 years,external. There are early signs ofchanges to brain structure,external, but these are still being investigated. And Covid-19 also does strange things to the blood, including abnormal clotting, and damaging the network of tubes that carry blood around the body. Inside Health: Sticky Blood and Covid 19 Prof Strain told the BBC: ""The theory I'm working on is a premature ageing of the small blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues."" But he warned that until we figure out what is causing long Covid ""it is difficult to figure out treatments."" Post-viral fatigue or a post-viral cough are well documented and common - we've probably all had an infection that has taken ages to fully recover from. Around one in 10 people withglandular fever,externalhas fatigue which lasts for months. And there have even been suggestions that flu, particularly after the 1918 pandemic, may be linked toParkinson's-like symptoms,external. ""With Covid there seem to be more far-reaching symptoms and the number of people seems to be much greater,"" says Prof Brightling. The emphasis though is on the word ""seems"" as until we have a true picture of how many people have been infected we won't know exactly how common these symptoms are, he says. He told the BBC: ""The uniqueness of the way the virus attacks the host and the different ways it then alters the way cells behave seem to be both giving people more severe infection than other viruses and persistent symptoms."" SYMPTOMS:85% of patients have one of these three symptoms IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The number of people with long-Covid appears to be falling with time. However, the virus emerged only at the end of 2019 before going global earlier this year so there is a lack of long-term data. ""We've asked, deliberately, to follow people for 25 years, I certainly hope only a very small number will have problems going beyond a year, but I could be wrong,"" said Prof Brightling. However, there are concerns that even if people appear to recover now, they could face lifelong risks. People who have had chronic fatigue syndrome are more likely to have it again and the concern is that future infections may cause more flare-ups. ""If long Covid follows the same pattern I'd expect some recovery, but if it takes just another coronavirus infection to react then this could be every winter,"" said Prof Strain. It is still possible more problems could emerge in the future. The World Health Organization has warned that widespread inflammation caused by coronavirus could lead to people having heart problems at a much younger age. The NHS has a""Your Covid Recovery Plan"",externalwhich has advice, particularly for those who needed hospital treatment. It recommends the ""three Ps"" in order to conserve energy: Pace yourself so you don't push yourself too hard, and make sure you have plenty of rest Plan your days so your most tiring activities are spread out across the week Prioritise - think about what you need to do and what can be put off It advises speaking to either your hospital team or your GP if you are not recovering as quickly as you might expect. Some have raised concerns thatthere is not enough supportfor people with long-Covid.

Terror threat 'not adequately assessed' at arena,"Top row (left to right): Alison Howe, Martyn Hett, Lisa Lees, Courtney Boyle, Eilidh MacLeod, Elaine McIver, Georgina Callander, Jane Tweddle - Middle row (left to right): John Atkinson, Kelly Brewster, Liam Curry, Chloe Rutherford, Marcin Klis, Angelika Klis, Megan Hurley, Michelle Kiss - Bottom row (left to right): Nell Jones, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Philip Tron, Saffie-Rose Roussos, Sorrell Leczkowski, Wendy Fawell Four risk assessments carried out prior to Manchester Arena attack ""failed to adequately assess"" the terror threat at the venue, an inquiry has heard. Security expert Colonel Richard Latham said the risk of a suicide bombing at a venue like the Manchester Arena should have been ""crystal clear"". The terror threat level at the time of the 2017 bombing was classed as severe. The public inquiry, scheduled to last into next spring, is looking at events before, during and after the attack. Twenty two people were killed and many more injured when Salman Abedi detonated an explosive as fans left the Ariana Grande concert. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? The inquiry, which is taking place at Manchester Magistrates' Court, heard how Mr Latham along with Dr David BaMaung have jointly analysed more than 1,000 documents relating to the Manchester Arena attack. This has accumulated in three reports, which review the adequacy and effectiveness of security at the arena, what lessons ought to be learned and what changes need to be made. Salman Abedi was caught on CCTV in the City Room just seconds before he blew himself up The operators of the arena, SMG, had responsibility for safety and security in the City Room, where the bombing happened on the evening of 22 May 2017. But as the City Room was classed as ""public space,"" this meant arena security staff could interact with people but did not have the power to eject an individual and would need to escalate any suspicions to the police, the inquiry heard. At the time of the explosion, there was not a single police officer in the City Room. The inquiry was told if SMG wanted specific policing resources for the arena then they could have paid the police for this service. The public inquiry follows a trial in which a jury found Hashem Abediguilty of helping his older sibling to plan the atrocity. The inquiry continues.

"Led Zep's Stairway To Heaven battle finally endsThe US Supreme Court refuses to hear an appeal, meaning the long-running copyright case is over.","Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Jimmy Page gave evidence at a 2016 trial The final possible legal challenge to Led Zeppelin's ownership of Stairway To Heaven has been defeated. The band were sued for copyright in 2014 over claims they had stolen the song's opening riff from Taurus, by a US band called Spirit. Led Zeppelin won the case in 2016, but it was revived on appeal in 2018. A court of appeals upheld the original verdict earlier this year. Now, the US Supreme Court has declined to hear the case, definitively ending it. Stairway To Heaven regularly appears on lists of the greatest rock songs ever written, and the case has been one of the music industry's most closely-watched disputes. Millions of dollars were potentially at stake, with the song estimated to have earned $3.4m (Â£2.6m) in the five-year period that was at issue during the trial. Allow YouTube content?

The copyright dispute was originally lodged by journalist Michael Skidmore in 2014 on behalf of the estate of Randy Wolfe, the late frontman of Spirit. Lawyers for Wolfe's estate argued that Led Zeppelin became familiar with Spirit's song after singer Robert Plant saw them play at a club in Birmingham in 1970, a year before Stairway to Heaven was released. In the original trial, Spirit's bassist Mark Andes testified that he met Plant at the show and played snooker with him afterwards. Plant insisted he had no memory of the night, partially attributing his lack of memory to a bad car crash on his way home. Both he and his wife suffered head injuries in the accident, he told the court, after the windscreen of his Jaguar was left ""buried"" in his face. Guitarist Jimmy Page testified he had been unaware of Spirit's song until people started posting online comparisons in the early 2010s. ""I knew I had never heard that before,"" he said. ""It was totally alien to me."" Led Zeppelin win Stairway copyright case Katy Perry wins reversal of plagiarism verdict Final $5m verdict in Blurred Lines trial The jury rejected Page and Plant's argument that they would not have been familiar with Taurus, saying they had ""access"" to it. However, they found evidence from musicologists more convincing. Experts who testified said the descending musical pattern shared by both songs had been a common musical device for centuries. One example cited was Chim Chim Cher-ee, from the 1964 Disney musical Mary Poppins. The jury, which concluded the two songs were ""not intrinsically similar"", were not allowed to listen to Taurus during the trial. This and other alleged errors led to an appeal. But in March, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the original verdict, saying the errors did not warrant a new trial.

LiveLiveTrump returns to White House from hospital1 minute ago,"US President Donald Trump is discharged from the Walter Reed medical centre following three days of Covid treatment His doctors say he is safe to return to the White House but ""may not be entirely out of the woods yet"" In a tweet, he said we was feeling ""really good"", and added: ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" Questions remain about the seriousness of the president's illness after conflicting statements In the UK, a technical glitch which meant nearly 16,000 cases went unreported has caused delays to its track and trace system UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will ""always balance the books"" as coronavirus costs rise All bars in the French capital Paris will shut from Tuesday as the city's coronavirus alert is raised to maximum More than 35.1 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with over one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Henri Astier and Lauren Turner Marine One delivers US President Donald Trump to the White House We're pausing our live coverage for now. We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".   President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn on 26 September Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Test error 'should never have happened' - HancockThe error meant that although those who tested positive were told about their results, their close contacts were not traced.","The health secretary has said a technical glitch that saw nearly 16,000 Covid-19 cases go unreported in England ""should never have happened"". The error meant that although those who tested positive were told about their results, their close contacts were not traced. By Monday afternoon, around half of those who tested positive had yet to be asked about their close contacts. Labour said the missing results were ""putting lives at risk"". Experts advise that ideally contacts should be tracked down within 48 hours. How many cases are there in your area? What are the Covid rules where you live? How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? The technical error was caused by some Microsoft Excel data files exceeding the maximum size after they were sent from NHS Test and Trace to Public Health England. It meant 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were left out of the UK daily case figures. PHE said the error itself, discovered overnight on Friday, has been fixed, and outstanding cases had been passed on to tracers by 01:00 BST on Saturday. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the incident as a whole had not yet been resolved - with only 51% of those whose positive results were caught up in the glitch now reached by contact tracers. He said it had ""not substantially changed"" the government's assessment of the epidemic, however, and had ""not impacted the basis on which decisions about local action were taken"". He also said outbreak control in care homes, schools and hospitals had not been directly affected, as they do not rely on the data in question. ""This incident should never have happened. But the team have acted swiftly to minimise its impact,"" he added. The BBC has confirmed the missing Covid-19 test data was caused by the ill-thought-out use of Microsoft's Excel software. Furthermore, PHE was to blame, rather than a third-party contractor. The issue was caused by the way the agency brought together logs produced by the commercial firms paid to carry out swab tests for the virus. They filed their results in the form of text-based lists, without issue. PHE had set up an automatic process to pull this data together into Excel templates so that it could then be uploaded to a central system and made available to the NHS Test and Trace team as well as other government computer dashboards. The problem is that the PHE developers picked an old file format to do this - known as XLS. As a consequence, each template could handle only about 65,000 rows of data rather than the one million-plus rows that Excel is actually capable of. And since each test result created several rows of data, in practice it meant that each template was limited to about 1,400 cases. When that total was reached, further cases were simply left off. Read more from Leo here Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the missing results were ""putting lives at risk"". He said the unreported cases meant as many as 48,000 contacts had not been traced and therefore not been isolating, with ""thousands blissfully unaware they've been exposed to Covid, potentially spreading this deadly virus"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock tells MPs the late reporting of test results was a âserious issue that is being investigated fullyâ. Paul Wells said the NHS Covid-19 app allowed him to ""carry on as normal"" even after his husband had uploaded a positive test result and been told to self-isolate. ""It's very frustrating to hear that processes or systems are not working correctly, especially with something that is high risk,"" he told BBC News. ""The knock-on effect is damaging to not only myself and my husband, but the ripple effect it has to family and friends and our neighbours."" On Monday afternoon, the government's coronavirus dashboard announced a further 12,594 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 515,571. Another 19 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. The earlier technical error meant the daily case totals reported on the government's coronavirus dashboard over the past week have been lower than the true number. Why using Excel caused Covid-19 tests to be lost What's the danger of the missing 16,000 Covid cases? Daily figures for the end of the week were about 10,000 rather than the roughly 7,000 that had been reported. BBC analysis found the number of cases reported for the week to 1 October increased by 92.6% in the North West after taking in the missing tests - with similar rises reflected across England. The increase, of 8,348 cases, is mostly down to the missing tests, but the figures also included some results which came back after 2 October. You can look at the case numbers two ways: we normally count them on the date they're reported, which today would be 12,594. But today's news has shown how reporting lags can skew those trends. If you arrange the figures by the date the tests were taken, you can get a clearer picture. In that analysis, we reached an average of 10,000 new cases a day towards the end of last week. That's about double what it was a fortnight ago. It's hard to say for sure what's happened since then, since it takes a few days for tests to be reported and for these figures to settle down. But that pattern is consistent with other data: the number of people going into hospital, or official surveys and symptom trackers. They all paint a picture of an epidemic that's growing - not doubling every week, but growing. There's hope in some parts of the data that the pace of growth may be slowing slightly, but there's no evidence that it's shrinking. Mr Hancock suggested that the error did not impact the introduction of local restrictions last week. However, Liverpool Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram said the measures brought in there were ""predicated on"" figures that were ""underestimated by a considerable sum"". ""We understand that there needed to be further restrictions because of those increases in transmission rates, but we've not received any of the scientific evidence that backs that up,"" he told the BBC. ""It seems that the restrictions were predicated on a false promise that the figures that we were provided with were the basis for the announcement."" In full: Andrew Marr's interview with Boris Johnson Ministers have 'lost control of virus' - Starmer PHE data shows Liverpool has the second highest rate of infection in England, at 456.4 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 1 October, from 287.1 the week before. Knowsley in Merseyside, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leeds and Sheffield have also seen sharp rises. Manchester has the highest rate of infection, at 495.6 cases per 100,000 people, from 223.2 the week before. The BBC's Danny Savage said the head of public health in Manchester estimates the infection rate among the city's student population is as high as 3,000 cases per 100,000. ""We'll have to watch closely at what those figures are like in student populations across the country in areas with a high number of infection,"" he said. PHE said NHS Test and Trace has made sure there are enough contact tracers working, and is working with local teams to ensure they also have sufficient resources to be urgently able to contact all cases.

Soft play owners 'angry' at continued lockdown,"This video can not be played Craig Meikle: ""I feel angry when I wake up in the morning, angry when I go to bed at night and angry every hour in between."" The owners of soft play and indoor sports facilities have warned they face financial ruin. While such businesses opened in England in mid-August they remain closed in Scotland. Many soft play centres, theatres and nightclubs had hoped to open on Monday but some fear they now never will. Last week First MinisterNicola Sturgeon confirmed that the date of their reopeninghad been postponed until at least 15 October. She said it would not be sensible to ease restrictions while infection rates were rising. The sectors had previously been given indicative reopening dates of 14 September and 5 October. Craig Meikle, who owns Saltire soft play and football centre in Dalkeith, has run out of patience. ""I feel angry when I wake up in the morning, angry when I go to bed at night and angry every hour in between,"" he said. ""My wife and I have spent six years building this business up to be a sustainable business. ""We're not going to get rich from this but our staff would have said they were in a stable secure job."" Saltire Soft Play in Dalkeith is close to financial disaster He says the business is six to eight weeks away from collapse. In six months of closure, he says Â£166,000 has left his business bank account with just Â£49,000 in furlough payments coming in. His business took a Â£100,000 loan to survive which is almost gone. Reopening postponed for theatres, live music venues and soft play Nightclub and festival job losses are ""unavoidable"" Mr Meikle says he is now at the mercy of his creditors but thanks to an understanding landlord, he is still hopeful for his business. He told BBC Scotland: ""So when you hear the chancellor talking aboutsupport packages for viable businessesit drives me absolutely nuts. ""When I think we have got a viable business that offers an important service to the community and it's not a business that either the Scottish government or the UK government are seeing fit to support financially, rage is probably the best feeling I could explain."" Saltire has had no financial help outside the job retention scheme and the business did not qualify for any grants. Mr Meikle has seen other businesses receive awards of up to Â£25,000 which have been allowed to reopen and earn money. The Saltire cafe sits empty His frustration is in getting no financial help and still being unable to earn. He is not alone. Mike Ferguson runs Forfar Indoor Sports. He says his phone never stops ringing asking if they are open. And he has had to watch his customers go elsewhere to venues that can open. He said: ""We are praying that on the 15th we get going. Heading towards something and not getting there is demoralising. ""The furlough scheme has been excellent for staff but we now have to think seriously about letting staff go. ""We can't carry on paying even a share of staff wages and the new rules don't assist."" Mr Ferguson says he is now trying to plan for reopening without a date. Cancellation of the 15 September deadline hit hard with training completed, deep cleans paid for and food wasted. He said: ""If they are not coming to us they are going somewhere else. That's the most frustrating point of all of this."" Frosty's Fun centre in Forfar has not seen customers since Lockdown began on 23 March A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said it understood the severe impact of the pandemic, but that Scotland was at a ""critical point"" as the virus continues to rise. She said: ""Our absolute focus has been to help businesses survive and retain as much employment as possible - using the limited powers available to us and we have repeatedly urged the UK government to transfer to us the financial powers needed to fully respond to the pandemic. ""Throughout this unprecedented economic crisis we have listened to businesses and business organisations and acted quickly to offer support which now exceeds Â£2.3bn. ""Our support for businesses includes almost Â£900m of non-domestic rates relief for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses including soft play centres; the small business grant fund and the retail, hospitality and leisure grant fund worth over Â£1bn; the culture organisations and venues recovery fund which includes nightclubs.

"Led Zep's Stairway To Heaven battle finally endsThe US Supreme Court refuses to hear an appeal, meaning the long-running copyright case is over.Entertainment & Arts","Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant and Jimmy Page gave evidence at a 2016 trial The final possible legal challenge to Led Zeppelin's ownership of Stairway To Heaven has been defeated. The band were sued for copyright in 2014 over claims they had stolen the song's opening riff from Taurus, by a US band called Spirit. Led Zeppelin won the case in 2016, but it was revived on appeal in 2018. A court of appeals upheld the original verdict earlier this year. Now, the US Supreme Court has declined to hear the case, definitively ending it. Stairway To Heaven regularly appears on lists of the greatest rock songs ever written, and the case has been one of the music industry's most closely-watched disputes. Millions of dollars were potentially at stake, with the song estimated to have earned $3.4m (Â£2.6m) in the five-year period that was at issue during the trial. Allow YouTube content?

The copyright dispute was originally lodged by journalist Michael Skidmore in 2014 on behalf of the estate of Randy Wolfe, the late frontman of Spirit. Lawyers for Wolfe's estate argued that Led Zeppelin became familiar with Spirit's song after singer Robert Plant saw them play at a club in Birmingham in 1970, a year before Stairway to Heaven was released. In the original trial, Spirit's bassist Mark Andes testified that he met Plant at the show and played snooker with him afterwards. Plant insisted he had no memory of the night, partially attributing his lack of memory to a bad car crash on his way home. Both he and his wife suffered head injuries in the accident, he told the court, after the windscreen of his Jaguar was left ""buried"" in his face. Guitarist Jimmy Page testified he had been unaware of Spirit's song until people started posting online comparisons in the early 2010s. ""I knew I had never heard that before,"" he said. ""It was totally alien to me."" Led Zeppelin win Stairway copyright case Katy Perry wins reversal of plagiarism verdict Final $5m verdict in Blurred Lines trial The jury rejected Page and Plant's argument that they would not have been familiar with Taurus, saying they had ""access"" to it. However, they found evidence from musicologists more convincing. Experts who testified said the descending musical pattern shared by both songs had been a common musical device for centuries. One example cited was Chim Chim Cher-ee, from the 1964 Disney musical Mary Poppins. The jury, which concluded the two songs were ""not intrinsically similar"", were not allowed to listen to Taurus during the trial. This and other alleged errors led to an appeal. But in March, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the original verdict, saying the errors did not warrant a new trial.

Lessons from Johnson's illness,"Boris Johnson (L) and Donald Trump Donald Trump and Boris Johnson have a lot in common - distinctive hairstyles, larger-than-life personalities and a habit of creating controversy. And now they share the unwanted experience of being leaders taken to hospital with coronavirus. The US president is currently being treated for the disease, six months after UK Prime Minister Mr Johnson fell victim to the same virus. But how do their experiences compare - and what, if anything, can the US learn from the UK's experience? Unanswered questions about Trump's Covid crisis Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50? 'We're here to tell him that we love him' On 27 March, the UK Prime Minister announced he had tested positive for Covid. It was not hugely unexpected given the virus had ripped its way through the top levels of UK government - infecting ministers and senior advisers. In a Twitter video Mr Johnson said he had experienced ""mild symptoms"" but insisted he was - ""thanks to the wizardry of modern technology"" - still leading the government's response despite self-isolating. One week later he announced that a persistent temperature meant he would have to continue self-isolating. Boris Johnson looked noticeably unwell when he appeared outside Downing Street a few days before going into hospital Two days later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his boss had ""very much got his hand on the tiller"". But that evening Mr Johnson was admitted to hospital - although Downing Street stressed this was ""a precautionary step"". Twenty-four hours later the shocking news came that his condition had ""worsened"" and the prime minister had been moved to the intensive care unit. There are parallels between Mr Johnson's experience and Mr Trump's. Like the prime minister, Mr Trump has been keen to emphasise that he is still at work, posting pictures of himself at a desk with documents. Both their visits to hospital were described as precautionary - Mr Trump's team said it had been motivated by an ""abundance of caution"". And both leaders - being male, over 50 and overweight - are in an at-risk category. However, there are also differences. Updates on Mr Johnson's condition came solely from the Downing Street spokesperson, rather than the hospital or his doctor, whereas in the US, the president's doctors have held press conferences. In some ways this caused confusion - particularly when Dr Sean Conley's account conflicted with briefings from White House staff. This video can not be played Dr Sean Conley said he was trying to ""reflect the upbeat attitude"" of his team by not revealing the president received oxygen But unlike in the UK, US journalists were able to question the medical team - and perhaps as a result Americans got a broader picture of their leader's health. It speaks to a wider difference between the two countries. In America, a whole medical unit based in the White House is devoted to the care of the president and candidates to the presidency are now expected to release medical records No such set-up exists in Downing Street and if you Google medical records plus Jeremy Corbyn (the former leader of the opposition) you are more likely to get hits for stories about the National Health Service, than any personal information. Two blonde leaders get Covid and end up in hospital. But that's where the similarities end. There are vast constitutional and cultural differences between British and American politics. The cultural first: men in white coats in front of a microphone. We've seen that in Washington. Updates from the doctors, in front of the cameras. Updates with detail too: the drugs the president's on, the days he's getting them. There is no way medics at St Thomas's Hospital in London were ever going to offer a running, public commentary on the prime minister's health, let alone the content of their syringes. Oh, and an American president has a medical team and facilities on hand at the White House. In contrast, Boris Johnson was holed up on his own, upstairs in Downing Street, his tea left at the door of his flat. And now the constitutional: in short, America has one, the UK doesn't. So while the question of who takes over isn't easily answered in the UK, there's a long established plan in the US. Once the prime minister was admitted into intensive care, his Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, was asked to deputise ""where necessary"". In the US, the 25th Amendment sets out the conditions for a vice-president assuming power from his boss, but in the UK, with its unwritten constitution and enthusiasm for precedents over codified rules, there is no formal power that allows for such a transfer of responsibility. We knew very little about the exact extent of Mr Raab's authority - and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested Mr Raab, was ""reluctant"" to take decisions, leaving the government in a kind of limbo while the Prime Minister recuperated. Constitutional expert Dr Catherine Haddon of the Institute for Government said at the time: ""The lack of a plan for who can take over when the prime minister is incapacitated looks extraordinary to many in the country and abroad."" Dominic Raab deputised for the prime minister as he was moved to intensive care. Since his admission to hospital, there has been speculation about how Mr Trump's poll ratings will be affected - particularly with the presidential election one month away. Looking at the UK example - not much is the answer. BBC political analyst Peter Barnes says Boris Johnson's personal approval ratings went up - hitting 50% and above - when government introduced measures to tackle coronavirus. The high ratings continued throughout the period that the prime minister was ill, and into May, before starting to fall back. Mr Johnson came out of hospital on 12 April and returned to work after a two-week break. Yet six months on, there has been some speculation over whether the Prime Minister is fully recovered. However, when asked if he was suffering from long Covid, Mr Johnson insisted he was ""as fit as several butchers' dogs"". His spell in hospital has prompted at least one change in his behaviour. The prime minister has acknowledged he was ""too fat"" when he caught the virus and has hired a personal trainer to get him fit. So in a few months' time, Americans may get used to seeing pictures of Mr Trump running laps round the Rose Garden. What if Trump became too ill to be president? Why won't White House say when Trump had last test? Whoâs in charge if the PM is ill? Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50?

"What's the danger of the missing 16,000 Covid cases?","An IT failure has caused almost 16,000 coronavirus cases to go missing from official data in England. The infected individuals themselves were notified, and would hopefully have isolated to prevent spreading the infection, but the glitch meant none of their contacts were notified at the time. A BBC analysis suggests this could mean at least 34,000 contacts were left in the dark about having been exposed to the virus. And those missed contacts, who tracers are now urgently trying to reach, may have been unknowingly spreading the virus on to others for days. Speed is of the essence when it comes to contact-tracing. Every missed day represents an opportunity for the infection to travel. At the moment, about 60% of people who are reached by a contact tracer will provide contacts - and they hand over the names of five people on average. Of those contacts, 72% are reached and told to self-isolate. Applying that performance to the 15,841 cases missed due to the IT glitch, we can estimate that almost10,000would have provided just under50,000contacts, of whom about34,000would be reached. That's a conservative estimate, since the original 15,841 cases could have had as many as 80,000 close contacts, although the test-and-trace system would have been unlikely to reach all of them. Based on NHS Test and Trace findings so far, most of the contacts would be what experts call ""non-complex"" cases - people living in the community rather than in care homes, for example. Around 60% would be people living in the same household as the infected person who tested positive. So, a big chunk of them may already be aware of the positive result. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament 51% of the missed cases had been contacted since the weekend. Analysis by the BBC's Data Journalism team shows that while all parts of England are affected, some areas make up a bigger share: The North West had the most ""missed"" cases added to its testing figures over the weekend, almost doubling its infections from 9,012 to 17,360 But, because the North West has the largest number of cases overall, you'd expect it to have the most missed proportionally In relative terms, the East Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber saw the biggest increases in cases once the missed tests were added in The North East and the South West also saw their testing figures for the last week more than double The hotspots have become hotter A breakdown of the lost cases has shown that while all parts of England are affected, most of them are in the North West, the area of the country that already had the highest rates of infection. The two biggest cities - Liverpool and Manchester - had infection rates around 10 times the national average last week. The rates reported previously - at just below 300 cases per 100,000 people - have now increased significantly, to between 400 and 500 cases per 100,000. The government says it would not have altered the decisions ministers have taken - last week tougher rules were brought in on households mixing - but it does mean there is even more pressure to bring down infection levels in that part of the country.

Trump criticised over car ride with Covid-19,"This video can not be played President Trump pays ""surprise visit"" to supporters outside hospital Medical experts are questioning Donald Trump's decision to greet supporters in a drive-past outside the hospital where he is being treated for Covid-19. There are concerns the US president, who wore a mask, may have endangered Secret Service staff inside the car. White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the trip on Sunday had been ""cleared by the medical team as safe"". Questions remain over the seriousness of Mr Trump's illness after conflicting statements over the weekend. The doctors treating the president in hospital are expected to provide an update on his condition at 15:00 local time (19:00 GMT). Speaking on Fox News, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said doctors would decide later whether the president could be discharged from Walter Reed hospital, near Washington, on Monday. Mr Meadows said he had spoken with Mr Trump earlier, and that his condition appeared to have improved overnight. The president was taken to hospital on Friday evening, hours after announcing he had tested positive for the virus. Read the latest updates here Unanswered questions about Trump's Covid crisis Leaders with Covid: The US vs UK experience All the medication Trump is taking, explained President Trump's diagnosis has upended his election campaign, as he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden on 3 November. A growing number of people around the president, including his wife Melania, senior aides and Republican senators, have tested positive with the virus. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary,became the latest to report a positive result on Monday.,external Covid-19 has infected nearly 7.4 million and killed nearly 210,000 people across the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. Mr Trump waved to well-wishers from behind the glass of a sealed car after tweeting that he would pay a ""surprise visit"" to ""patriots"" outside the hospital. Inside the car, at least two people could be seen wearing protective gear in the front seats, with Mr Trump sat in the back. Who Trump met - and who's tested positive 'We're here to tell him that we love him' False coronavirus claims and rumours about Trump Experts say the president's short car trip broke public health advice to quarantine when seeking treatment for the virus, and may have put Secret Service agents inside the vehicle at risk of infection. ""That Presidential SUV is not only bulletproof, but hermetically sealed against chemical attack. The risk of Covid-19 transmission inside is as high as it gets outside of medical procedures,"" tweetedDr James Philips, a doctor at the same hospital where the president is being treated.,external Two Secret Service agents could be seen wearing protective gear in the front seats of an SUV Those inside the president's car would now need to quarantine for 14 days, he said. Democrats have also criticised the trip, with House of Representatives Hakeem Jeffries tweeting: ""We need leadership. Not photo ops."" But the White House's Judd Deere defended the move, saying ""appropriate precautions were taken in the execution of this movement to protect the president and all those supporting it, including PPE [personal protective equipment]"". Walter Reed is one of America's largest and most renowned military medical centres It emerged the president's condition was more serious than previously reported when he went to hospital on Friday evening. The White House had said Mr Trump was experiencing ""mild symptoms"" of Covid-19, but then it was confirmed that he had received extra oxygen after his levels dipped twice in two days. He was also given the steroid dexamethasone, which is normally reserved for serious cases, according to experts. On Sunday, White House Physician Dr Sean Conley addressedwidespread confusion over the state of Mr Trump's health, after conflicting accounts from him and Mr Meadows. This video can not be played Dr Sean Conley said he was trying to ""reflect the upbeat attitude"" of his team by not revealing the president received oxygen Dr Conley had offered an upbeat prognosis on Saturday, which was later contradicted by Mr Meadows who said the president's vital signs the previous 24 hours had been ""very concerning"". ""I was trying to reflect an upbeat attitude of the team and the president about the course his illness has had,"" Dr Conley told reporters on Sunday. ""I didn't want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction."" There is scepticism over the prospect - raised by doctors earlier - that Donald Trump could leave hospital as early as Monday. It has been three days since the shocking revelation that Donald and Melania Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. As it now stands, there are a number of important questions that remain unanswered. When did Trump last receive a negative test? Do we know all the facts about his health? Should Vice-President Mike Pence be isolating? Why has the White House been so slow to contact-trace? How these questions are resolved could hold the key to understanding how much damage the virus will do to this president - to his health, his reputation and his political standing. Read more about these unknowns and why they matter The president, being 74, a man and someone categorised as obese, is in a higher-risk category for Covid-19. On Friday he was given an experimental drug cocktail injection and started a five-day course of the antiviral medication remdesivir. In pictures: Trump supporters hold rallies The Trump doctor in the eye of the storm However, Mr Trump sought to project an image of strength, tweeting images of himself appearing to work from the hospital and a video message teasing his surprise drive-past on Sunday. This video can not be played Speaking from the Walter Reed Medical Center, President Trump described his treatment as the ""real school"" How significant is it that Donald Trump has been given dexamethasone? The steroid saves lives by calming the immune system, which can become dangerously overactive in Covid, but needs to be used at the right time. Give it too early and the drug could make things worse by impairing the body's ability to fight off the virus. This is not a drug you would usually give in the ""mild"" stage of the disease. The Recovery Trial, which took place in the UK,showed the benefit kicked in at the point people need oxygen,external- which Mr Trump briefly did. The World Health Organization translated those findings to adviseusing the steroid in ""severe and critical"" cases.,external Mr Trump's blood oxygen levels did dip below 94%, which is one of the National Institutes of Health criteria for ""severe illness"". However, those low oxygen levels were not sustained and the gap between someone needing transient oxygen support and end-stage Covid-19 is massive. We do not know the full details of Mr Trump's condition, but it is hard to imagine you or I would be discharged from hospital while taking dexamethasone and remdesivir and after being given an experimental antibody therapy.  However, we do not have the medical support at the US president's disposal. The first lady, who is 50, has been isolating at the White House since Friday, when she described having ""mild symptoms"". In a tweet on Monday she said:""I am feeling good [and] will continue to rest at home"",external. US media reported that she would not visit the president at the hospital as that would expose her staff as well as medical workers. Many of the people who have tested positive around Mr Trump attendeda meeting at the White House on 26 Septemberthat is being scrutinised as a possible ""super-spreader event"". The president's campaignÂ team said on Saturday it would move forward ""at full speed""Â until Mr Trump could return to the campaignÂ trail.Â It is calling on top ""surrogates"", including Mr Trump's sons Donald Jr and Eric, and Vice-President Mike Pence toÂ ""carry the campaign forward"" for the time being. No White House events are scheduled for Monday. Thousands of empty chairs were laid out behind the White House at the weekend to represent America's large death toll Meanwhile, Mr Pence is due to debate Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Wednesday. Mr Pence and his wife Karen both tested negative on Monday morning. Joe Biden, who has continuedÂ his campaign, is due to appear in Miami, Florida on Monday - despite having shared a stage with Mr Trump in a debate last Tuesday, when the president may have already contracted the virus. Mr Biden's campaign said he had tested negative for the virus on Sunday evening. Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Kamala Harris will take the stage on Wednesday for the lone debate between the two vice-presidential candidates. In a race where both presidential nominees are over 70, people have been paying particular attention to their running mates.

False coronavirus claims and rumours about Trump,"President Trump's treatment for Covid-19 has spawned baseless rumours and conspiracy theories - about body doubles, oxygen tanks and more. Many appear to be politically motivated and conflicting information from the White House over the weekend hasn't helped. Officials gave varying answers on when the president had been given oxygen.Unanswered questions remainover when Mr Trump last tested negative for the virus. This left the internet to fill in the gaps with unfounded speculation. Here are some of the most viral rumours - and what we know about them. Republican supporters - in some cases tweeting from verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers - have spread a baseless rumour that the president was somehow deliberately infected with Covid-19 at some point during last week's debate. This goes well against the tide of early evidence showing that several top officials who have been infected, all attended a White House event announcing Mr Trump's supreme court nominee, held several days before the debate. Meanwhile, the suggestion that Mr Trump tested positive earlier than was originally suggested has led to rumours that he's more ill than doctors have let on - and even that his most recent public appearances were staged with a body double. Tweets to this effect from accounts mostly supporting the Democratic Party accumulated thousands of retweets. ""Body double"" conspiracy theories are fairly common - in 2016, similar allegationswere hurled at the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. A video which claims to show bikers praying for President Donald Trump outside the Walter Reed Medical Center in suburban Washington isn't from this weekend, and wasn't even filmed in the United States. The clip, shared more than 25,000 times on Twitter and viewed over 1.3 million times, was uploaded onto video-sharing platform TikTok on Friday. However,detective work by fact-checking website Lead Stories,external, verified by the BBC, reveals that the video was actually shot in South Africa and shows bikers protesting against farm murders. The original clip wasuploaded to TikTok,externalon 29 August, and comparison with Google Street View shows it was shot outside the Union Building in Pretoria. Another rumour being spread suggested that the president was wearing a secret oxygen tank when he was seen leaving the White House on Friday. A number of accounts supporting the Democrats circled close-up images of Trump claiming they could see he was hooked up to some kind of device - and using it as evidence that the White House was downplaying how ill the President really is. President Donald Trump waves to supporters as he briefly rides in front of Walter Reed Medical Center Like the baseless claim that Joe Biden was wearing an ear piece to help him during last week's debate -which was used by Trump's campaign in a series of Facebook adverts- this particular rumour appears to have been started by people getting overly excited by folds and creases. But even if he wasn't toting a hidden tank, we do now know that the president was given supplemental oxygen at several points over the weekend. Rumours that the President is pretending to be ill for votes continue to spread online, pushed by somehigh-profile opponents,externalof Mr Trump. And at the extreme fringes, some QAnon supporters have gathered outside the hospital. They are pushing the baseless conspiracy that Trump is ""pretending"" to have Covid-19 in a bid to trick the ""deep state"" and have powerful people arrested. What is QAnon? How can you spot disinformation on your social media feed when there are conflicting messages coming from the top and various political agendas online? 1) Think about bias. Why was a post shared? Remember, this is happening during a hotly contested election. 2) How does it make you feel? Big news events can lead to worry, confusion, panic and anger - especially when those we would expect to inform us are not doing so. Pause before sharing. 3) Interrogate the source. Where has a post come from? If something is unconfirmed or there's no evidence to support it, it's often better not to share potential misinformation. Coins commemorating ""Donald Trump defeating Covid"" on sale from an online outlet called the White House Gift Shop have no connection with the US President. Much-shared but false posts on social media suggest that President Trump is selling the $100 (Â£77) coins to make money on the back of his diagnosis. In fact, the White House Gift Shop has nothing to do with the President nor the Trump family. The website came to our attention in May when it sold coins ""commemorating"" the Covid-19 outbreak, anda BBC Reality Check investigation foundit was not an official product. The store was set up in 1946 by President Harry S Truman in the basement of the White House, but it was subsequently transferred to a private company which now holds the ""White House Gift Shop"" trademark.

Odeon to open weekends-only at some cinemas,"Odeon is cutting the opening hours for some of its cinemas in the UK and Ireland to weekends only because of delays to new film releases. The chain, which operates 120 theatres, said it will affect a quarter of its cinemas, which will now open between Friday and Sunday. Odeon, which employs 5,500 people, declined to comment on job cuts. It comes as Cineworld said it will temporarily close its UK and US venues, affecting 45,000 jobs. According to movie magazine Film Stories,external, Odeon emailed customers to tell them that from Friday 9 October it was temporarily reducing hours at some cinemas ""in light of the ongoing delays to the release of many new films"". The changes announced by Odeon and Cineworld come afterthe release of the new James Bond film was delayed again. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to return to cinemas. He said would ""encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support"" movie theatres. However, the cinema industry has been hit by an absence of blockbuster movie to lure in customers. Cineworld employs around 5,500 people in the UK and its chief executive Mooky Greidinger, said: ""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets."" No Time to Die, starring Daniel Craig as James Bond, will now be released in 2021 The company did not give a date for reopening its 663 cinemas, which include 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theatres in the UK. Mr Greidinger said the company ""cannot underscore enough how difficult this decision was"" to close the sites. ""Cineworld will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time, when key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen,"" he said. Rosalyn Lloyd has worked at Cineworld for nearly two years Rosalyn Lloyd, 30, found out that her job at a Cineworld theatre in Wolverhampton was under threat from social media at the weekend. And she still doesn't know if she'll get a wage this month. ""We've been told nothing at all,"" Ms Lloyd told the BBC. ""When I went to work yesterday, everyone had seen it on social media [and] everyone was down in the dumps which is understandable. ""One woman was crying because she'd been there for nine years."" Ms Lloyd has worked at Cineworld for nearly two years and was placed on furlough earlier this year, though she says because she is on a zero-hour contract the pay was ""very low"". Her immediate problem is a lack of information from Cineworld. ""Are they still going to pay us at the end of October? We just haven't heard anything at the moment. We all are waiting for a call - it is a waiting game."" ""No Time to Die"", which is reportedly actor Daniel Craig's final outing as 007, is a key movie release that had been due in cinemas in April this year, but was then postponed until November because of the coronavirus pandemic. The release date has now been moved to April next year. ""I think the Bond movie is the straw that broke the camel's back to be honest,"" said Robert Mitchell, director of theatrical insights at Gower Street Analytics. ""A lot of films have been moving for some time now and ultimately the cinemas need a pipeline of regular content to draw cinema goers in,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Operates in 11 countries: US, UK, Canada, Ireland, Poland, Romania, Israel, Hungary, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia 2ndbiggest cinema chain in the world 663cinemas closing in the US (536) and the UK (127) 45,000jobs at risk, 5,500 in the UK 27%fall in share price at London stock market opening 007The delay of the new Bond film release triggered decision While Christopher Nolan's film Tenet opened at the end of August, Mr Mitchell said there had not been a major release since. ""Bond was really the one that UK exhibitors were really relying on more than any,"" he said. Shares in Cineworld plunged in early trading, down 27% at 28.74p each. Tim Richards, founder and chief executive of the Vue cinema chain, said the company had put safety measures in place at its theatres and noted there was ""pent up demand like we haven't seen ever before"" among customers to go out. However, he added: ""Our problem right now is we have no movies and this [the delay to the Bond film] was a big blow for us."" ""We are likely going to make it through,"" Mr Richards said, adding that Vue's goal is to try to keep as many of its 5,500 workers as possible. Tenet, a film by British director Christopher Nolan, was the most recent big box office release Mr Mitchell said he had forecast previously that UK box office takings would reach Â£500m this year. ""The Bond move obviously shaves a lot off that,"" he said. ""And now that Cineworld is closing and we don't know when it will be reopening, it might be a struggle to get over Â£400m."" Mr Richards said that outside the US, many cinemas had now re-opened. ""Looking globally right now, 75% of screens, maybe as high as 80% of screens are open. ""Even if you look at the numbers that Tenet generated in the UK it is going to get very close to Christopher Nolan's previous film Interstellar, maybe 80-90% of what it did. ""The audience is there and I think what we are seeing is the US studios in particular are taking a very US-centric view and forgetting that 80% of global box office comes offshore from North America.""

How does test-and-trace work?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

Who is Kayleigh McEnany?,"White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany says she has tested positive for Covid-19. What do we know about the former Trump campaign spokeswoman? After taking the job in April, she immediately made the White House press secretary job more visible by holding regular briefings. Her predecessor, Stephanie Grisham, did not conduct a single press briefing during her nine-month tenure. Before she took the role, Ms McEnany, 31, was a seasoned defender of the president. She made frequent television appearances to promote his policies, some of which made headlines for the Harvard Law School graduate. As the nation grappled with Covid-19, she came under fire for her early statements on the virus, including suggesting opposition Democrats were ""rooting"" for the pandemic to ""take this President down"". In a February appearance on a Fox Business show, she said: ""We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here, we will not see terrorism come here, and isn't that refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?"" Ms McEnany also previously worked as a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee and in 2018 published a book on the movement behind Mr Trump's 2016 election win. She has been criticised for her past support of the ""birther"" conspiracy theory questioning former President Barack Obama's birthplace. After her appointment, former President Bill Clinton's press secretary Joe Lockhart shared a 2012 tweet from McEnany where she said Mr Obama's brother was in ""that hut in Kenya"".

It is unclear whether Ms McEnany will continue to defend the president from behind the press secretary podium, or if she will opt for Ms Grisham's approach of communicating through tweets and interviews. In the days after Trump's diagnosis, many staffers who work at the White House began to wear a mask consistently - a departure from how it had been before the president was infected. Kayleigh McEnany was not one of them. She spoke with me and others on the day of Trump's Covid-19 announcement outside of the West Wing, and she chose not to wear a mask in that moment. She was following the example of Larry Kudlow, the director of Trump's National Economic Council, who had spoken with us earlier in the day, also without a mask. In this way, they were conveying the president's upbeat assessment of the virus and how it was nearly under control. Both McEnany and Kudlow stood two metres from us, following guidelines on social distancing. Yet it was striking to see them go about their daily lives in a way that seemed largely unaffected by the virus. The fact that she has tested positive is a reminder of just how dangerous - and contagious - the virus is. It is also a reminder that conveying the president's message through words and actions - whether about the virus or other matters - is a risky undertaking Ms McEnany works alongside Alyssa Farah, the White House's director of strategic communications and Ben Williamson, senior communications adviser. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who filled the press secretary post before Ms Grisham, has described Ms McEnany and Ms Farah as ""smart and capable women who have been loyal fighters"" for Mr Trump. ""Their promotions are another example of the president empowering strong women to senior roles in his administration,"" she said.

Leaders with Covid: The US vs UK experience,"Boris Johnson (L) and Donald Trump Donald Trump and Boris Johnson have a lot in common - distinctive hairstyles, larger-than-life personalities and a habit of creating controversy. And now they share the unwanted experience of being leaders taken to hospital with coronavirus. The US president is currently being treated for the disease, six months after UK Prime Minister Mr Johnson fell victim to the same virus. But how do their experiences compare - and what, if anything, can the US learn from the UK's experience? Unanswered questions about Trump's Covid crisis Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50? 'We're here to tell him that we love him' On 27 March, the UK Prime Minister announced he had tested positive for Covid. It was not hugely unexpected given the virus had ripped its way through the top levels of UK government - infecting ministers and senior advisers. In a Twitter video Mr Johnson said he had experienced ""mild symptoms"" but insisted he was - ""thanks to the wizardry of modern technology"" - still leading the government's response despite self-isolating. One week later he announced that a persistent temperature meant he would have to continue self-isolating. Boris Johnson looked noticeably unwell when he appeared outside Downing Street a few days before going into hospital Two days later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his boss had ""very much got his hand on the tiller"". But that evening Mr Johnson was admitted to hospital - although Downing Street stressed this was ""a precautionary step"". Twenty-four hours later the shocking news came that his condition had ""worsened"" and the prime minister had been moved to the intensive care unit. There are parallels between Mr Johnson's experience and Mr Trump's. Like the prime minister, Mr Trump has been keen to emphasise that he is still at work, posting pictures of himself at a desk with documents. Both their visits to hospital were described as precautionary - Mr Trump's team said it had been motivated by an ""abundance of caution"". And both leaders - being male, over 50 and overweight - are in an at-risk category. However, there are also differences. Updates on Mr Johnson's condition came solely from the Downing Street spokesperson, rather than the hospital or his doctor, whereas in the US, the president's doctors have held press conferences. In some ways this caused confusion - particularly when Dr Sean Conley's account conflicted with briefings from White House staff. This video can not be played Dr Sean Conley said he was trying to ""reflect the upbeat attitude"" of his team by not revealing the president received oxygen But unlike in the UK, US journalists were able to question the medical team - and perhaps as a result Americans got a broader picture of their leader's health. It speaks to a wider difference between the two countries. In America, a whole medical unit based in the White House is devoted to the care of the president and candidates to the presidency are now expected to release medical records No such set-up exists in Downing Street and if you Google medical records plus Jeremy Corbyn (the former leader of the opposition) you are more likely to get hits for stories about the National Health Service, than any personal information. Two blonde leaders get Covid and end up in hospital. But that's where the similarities end. There are vast constitutional and cultural differences between British and American politics. The cultural first: men in white coats in front of a microphone. We've seen that in Washington. Updates from the doctors, in front of the cameras. Updates with detail too: the drugs the president's on, the days he's getting them. There is no way medics at St Thomas's Hospital in London were ever going to offer a running, public commentary on the prime minister's health, let alone the content of their syringes. Oh, and an American president has a medical team and facilities on hand at the White House. In contrast, Boris Johnson was holed up on his own, upstairs in Downing Street, his tea left at the door of his flat. And now the constitutional: in short, America has one, the UK doesn't. So while the question of who takes over isn't easily answered in the UK, there's a long established plan in the US. Once the prime minister was admitted into intensive care, his Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, was asked to deputise ""where necessary"". In the US, the 25th Amendment sets out the conditions for a vice-president assuming power from his boss, but in the UK, with its unwritten constitution and enthusiasm for precedents over codified rules, there is no formal power that allows for such a transfer of responsibility. We knew very little about the exact extent of Mr Raab's authority - and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested Mr Raab, was ""reluctant"" to take decisions, leaving the government in a kind of limbo while the Prime Minister recuperated. Constitutional expert Dr Catherine Haddon of the Institute for Government said at the time: ""The lack of a plan for who can take over when the prime minister is incapacitated looks extraordinary to many in the country and abroad."" Dominic Raab deputised for the prime minister as he was moved to intensive care. Since his admission to hospital, there has been speculation about how Mr Trump's poll ratings will be affected - particularly with the presidential election one month away. Looking at the UK example - not much is the answer. BBC political analyst Peter Barnes says Boris Johnson's personal approval ratings went up - hitting 50% and above - when government introduced measures to tackle coronavirus. The high ratings continued throughout the period that the prime minister was ill, and into May, before starting to fall back. Mr Johnson came out of hospital on 12 April and returned to work after a two-week break. Yet six months on, there has been some speculation over whether the Prime Minister is fully recovered. However, when asked if he was suffering from long Covid, Mr Johnson insisted he was ""as fit as several butchers' dogs"". His spell in hospital has prompted at least one change in his behaviour. The prime minister has acknowledged he was ""too fat"" when he caught the virus and has hired a personal trainer to get him fit. So in a few months' time, Americans may get used to seeing pictures of Mr Trump running laps round the Rose Garden. What if Trump became too ill to be president?

How do pandemics normally end?," We are in the grip of a pandemic like none other in living memory. While people are pinning their hopes on a vaccine to wipe it out, the fact is most of the infections faced by our ancestors are still with us. Scroll down ↓ to find out how some of those pandemics came to an end, giving us clues as to how our future may unfold. This is Jasmine. Just like us, her ancestors survived a number of pandemics.  Take a journey back in time to see what diseases they faced. Back in the Dark Ages, about 60 generations ago, Jasmine's relatives lived through a series of outbreaks of the bubonic plague. The disease, caused by bacteria transmitted by fleas on rats and via respiratory droplets from infected people, was devastating. It killed hundreds of millions of people over a period of 2,000 years. The Black Death of 1346-1353 is considered the deadliest outbreak of all. It is believed the disease, which causes swollen and infected lymph nodes, called buboes, was finally brought under control by strict quarantining and improved sanitation, among other things. But none of this could have happened without an understanding of how transmission occurred, says Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London. This is something that still applies today. ""Once you have the knowledge, and you share the knowledge, then you are able to take measures to push transmission much lower,"" he says. Yet cases of the plague still occur - for example, in Inner Mongolia in July this year - and, in theory, Jasmine could still catch it. Numbers are low though, and the disease can now be successfully treated with antibiotics. Hundreds of years later, Jasmine's ancestors faced the spectre of smallpox. The disease, caused by the virus variola minor, is one of the deadliest known to humans. It caused fluid-filled pustules to develop all over the body and at its height, about three out of every 10 people with the disease died. It could be spread via droplets from an infected person's nose or mouth or via their sores. Like the plague, smallpox killed hundreds of millions of people - 300 million in the 20th Century alone. But, thanks to a vaccine developed in 1796 by British doctor Edward Jenner and the efforts of the scientific community, the disease has been completely erased - although it took nearly two centuries to do so. Smallpox remains the only human disease to have been eradicated this way. Prof Riley regards this feat as one of the greatest achievements of mankind - rivalling the Moon landings. ""It could be seen as the greatest return on a public investment ever,"" he says, referencing the annual savings the world has enjoyed thanks to the absence of the disease. Because of this achievement of science, we, and Jasmine, are no longer at risk. Then, just eight generations ago, Jasmine's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents faced the threat of cholera. The disease, caused by contaminated food or drinking water, has killed millions of people in seven pandemics, according to the World Health Organization. But while improved hygiene and sanitation in the West has removed the threat of the disease, it remains endemic - or common -  in many low-income countries and kills between 100,000 and 140,000 people every year, according to the WHO. ""You plumb your way out of cholera,"" says Prof Riley. ""If the plumbing goes wrong, it can spread very quickly."" Because of this, depending on where Jasmine calls home, she could still be at risk of catching it and dying, despite the availability of a vaccine and the disease's easy treatment. Jasmine's family would also have lived through a number of flu pandemics. The biggest recorded was in the early 20th century, around the time of her great-great grandparents. The 1918 Influenza pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Spanish flu, was the most severe outbreak in recent history, killing 50-100 million people worldwide. Much like with the new coronavirus today, isolation and quarantine slowed transmission. After two waves between 1918 and 1920, that particular H1N1 strain of flu faded away to become a more benign version that still circulates every year. But other flu pandemics followed. The Hong Kong flu of 1968 killed one million people and also still circulates as a seasonal flu. As does Swine Flu - a version of the H1N1 virus - which infected about 21% of the world's population in 2009. Flu continues to pose ""a pandemic threat"", says Prof Riley, and Jasmine, and us, remain at risk of experiencing another pandemic caused by such viruses. We are also at risk of catching seasonal flu, which continues to kill hundreds of thousands every year. Then, about four decades ago, Jasmine's parents lived through the spread of HIV/Aids - regarded by some as a pandemic but described as a ""global epidemic"" by the WHO. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) - transmitted through bodily fluids - has claimed more than 32 million lives across the globe so far. HIV could be regarded as an ""worst case scenario virus"", says Prof Riley, because of the length of time it takes to develop symptoms and its high fatality rate. It spreads fast because people don't necessarily know they have it. However, advances in diagnostic techniques and global public health campaigns - which have changed sexual behaviour and increased the availability of safe injections for drug users - have helped slow the growth in infections. Despite this, an estimated 690,000 people died from Aids in 2019, according to WHO figures. Although there is no cure for HIV, if Jasmine lived in a country with good healthcare and access to antiretroviral drugs, she could now lead a long and healthy life. However, if she lived in a low-income country and did not have such provision, she may well still be at risk. Two and three decades later - during Jasmine's own lifetime - came the threat of Sars and Mers. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) - the first deadly epidemic caused by a coronavirus - killed more than 800 between 2002 and 2003, according to the WHO. But by late July 2003, no new cases were being reported, and the WHO declared the global outbreak to be over. A little later came Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), also a coronavirus, which has killed 912 people. Most cases have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula. While the risk of contracting the virus, known as Mers-CoV, in the UK, for example, is regarded as very low, it remains higher in the Middle East - with humans usually infected by camels. As such, while Jasmine could still catch Mers, the risk is low in most countries. Now, in Jasmine's and our lifetimes, we are facing the spectre of the new Sars coronavirus, which triggers the respiratory disease Covid-19. Sars-Cov-2, as it is known, is an evolved version of the 2003 Sars virus and is regarded by disease specialists as unique, thanks to its range of symptoms - from none to deadly - and high levels of transmission by people without symptoms or before they develop them. ""Because of that, many populations have not been able to control it,"" says Prof Riley. More than a million people have died with the virus so far - but the overall toll is likely to become much higher. While the hunt for a vaccine and effective treatments continues, the risk remains real for the vast majority of the global population. Jasmine, like us, is still at risk. So the coronavirus now circulating in our communities is just the latest in a long line of pandemics caused by emerging pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. Increased knowledge about transmission, public health campaigns, new treatments and vaccines have all played their part in bringing previous crises to an end. The end-game for the current pandemic is also likely to come from a combination of similar measures. Although a ""safe, highly-effective"" vaccine could bring about its conclusion, says Prof Riley, finding one is ""by no means a given"". Instead, we may have to get better at living with it while developing a level of resistance to the disease. ""Definitely by five years, hopefully much sooner, we'll either have a really good vaccine that is being used throughout the world or we'll have muddled on long enough that we've accumulated enough immunity and learned how to live with small resurgent outbreaks,"" he says. And as the eradication of smallpox proved, when the world's scientific community comes together, great things are possible. Although the new coronavirus is a much trickier challenge, because of its high levels of asymptomatic transmission, Prof Riley is optimistic the ""incredible"" global quest for a solution will win through. ""The world has never had a shared project like this before,"" he says. ""Hopefully it becomes a shared success at some point."" However, it may serve us well to remember that most of the pathogens that rampaged through societies in pandemics in the past are still around. While the crises ended, the viruses and bacteria - and their resulting infections - remain.

Hepatitis C discovery wins the Nobel PrizeThe virus is a major cause of liver cancer and can lead to people needing a liver transplant.Health,"The announcement was made at a press conference at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden Three scientists who discovered the virus Hepatitis C have won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology. The winners are British scientist Michael Houghton and US researchers Harvey Alter and Charles Rice. The Nobel Prize committee said their discoveries ultimately ""saved millions of lives"". The virus is a common cause of liver cancer and a major reason why people need a liver transplant. In the 1960s, there was huge concern that people receiving donated blood were getting chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation) from an unknown, mysterious disease. The Nobel Prize committee said a blood transfusion at the time was like ""Russian roulette"". Highly sensitive blood tests mean such cases have now been eliminated in many parts of the world, and effective anti-viral drugs have also been developed. ""For the first time in history, the disease can now be cured, raising hopes of eradicating Hepatitis C virus from the world,"" the prize committee said. However, there are 70 million people currently living with the virus, which still kills around 400,000 a year. The viruses Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B had been discovered by the mid-1960s. But Prof Harvey Alter, while studying transfusion patients at the US National Institutes of Health in 1972, showed there wasanother, mystery, infection at work,external. Patients were still getting sick after receiving donated blood. He showed that giving blood from infected patients to chimpanzees led to them developing the disease. The mysterious illness became known as ""non-A, non-B"" hepatitis and the hunt was now on. Prof Michael Houghton, while at the pharmaceutical firm Chiron, managed to isolated the genetic sequenceof the virus in 1989,external. This showed it was a type of flavivirus and it was named Hepatitis C. And Prof Charles Rice, while at Washington University in St. Louis, appliedthe finishing touches in 1997,external. He injected a genetically engineered Hepatitis C virus into the liver of chimpanzees and showed this could lead to hepatitis. Prof Houghton, now at the University of Alberta in Canada, told the BBC: ""We had limited tools available to us then, so it was rather like searching for a needle in a haystack. ""The amount of virus present in the liver and the blood was very low, and the sensitivity of our techniques was not high enough, so we were sailing very close to the wind all the time. ""We tried a lot of methods, probably 30 or 40 different methodological approaches over seven years, and eventually one worked."" Commenting on the announcement, Dr Claire Bayntun, a clinical consultant in global public health and vice-president of Royal Society of Medicine, said the discovery was an ""extraordinary achievement"". She said: ""[In] unlocking the door to the development of effective treatment and screening of blood transfusions, and protecting populations in many regions of the world, millions of lives have been saved.""

Welsh quarantine considered for UK Covid hotspotsQuarantine restrictions are considered after the prime minister declined to impose a travel ban.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Vaughan Gething said English hotspots would face Welsh quarantine rules if they were countries People travelling to Wales from Covid hotspots elsewhere in the UK could face quarantine under measures being considered by the Welsh Government. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he was looking at how powers could be used to protect areas with lower cases. It comes after the prime minister rejectedcalls from Welsh ministers for a travel ban. Currently people in lockdown areas in England can go on holiday in parts of Wales not subject to restrictions. It is illegal for people to leave or enter lockdown counties Wales except for a limited set of reasons, like work or education. But a similar law does not exist for areas under local restrictions in England. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Westminster government felt it was more ""appropriate"" to put ""travel restrictions in guidance rather than in law"".  What can I do during local lockdowns? Mr Gething said if some English areas were countries Wales ""would have quarantine regulations for them"". But he said there was ""no good reason"" to prevent someone from a low incidence area like Devon from travelling to Pembrokeshire. ""We're having to consider how we use our powers to protect lower-prevalence areas of Wales but at the same time, we don't want to take a whole-nation approach,"" Mr Gething said. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he did not want to impose travel restrictions First Minister Mark Drakefordhad written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week, asking for travel restrictions to prevent people visiting Wales from areas under lockdown in England. But Mr Johnson told BBC Wales: ""We are all one country, people should exercise their common sense."" Mr Gething said it was ""disappointing"" Mr Johnson did not respond to the letter. He added that if people travelled from an area like Liverpool there was a risk of ""spreading events"". The Conservative health spokesman in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said bringing in quarantine restrictions for people travelling to Wales from Covid hotspots in England was a ""dangerous slope"" for the Welsh Government to go down. ""If you start introducing such quarantine restrictions in Wales does that mean then there's a quid pro-quo that England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will start doing the same for Welsh residents? ""There are all sorts of questions to be answered before you even entertain implementing such dramatic action."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said he had called for measures to limit travel with Mark Drakeford for ""two weeks running"". ""At a time when we need to act quicker and smarter to eliminate the virus, it's regrettable that it took the UK government's negligent dismissal of travel restrictions to bounce the Welsh Government into action,"" he said. Could visitors to Wales face quarantine when they arrive? In Wales it is illegal to enter or leave the 15 locked-down council areas, and the the town of Llanelli, without a ""reasonable excuse"". That can include: For work, if you cannot work from home For education To seek medical assistance To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation, and to access or receive public services Travelling through the areas is legal, but breaches can be punished with fines, with a fixed penalty notice of Â£60 for a first offence. There is no similar legal restriction in England, although people in areas likeMerseyside, Halton and Warrington,externalhave been asked to avoid non-essential travel. The way lockdown restrictions work differs between England and Wales In the Commons the Labour MP for Swansea West, Geraint Davies, asked Mr Hancock if people travelling from England should quarantine when arriving in Wales. Mr Hancock said in response: ""The primary transmission of the disease is between households and between households mixing with each other"". ""And the approach that we've taken thus far in England since we came out of the initial full blown lockdown has been to put travel restrictions in guidance, rather than in law, because we felt that's the most appropriate thing to do. ""I know that's not the approach that they're taking in Wales, but that's how we are currently handling it in England"". James Davies, Conservative Vale of Clwyd MP, said the travel restrictions in north Wales have caused ""huge disruption"" to half a million people. Mr Davies said people had not been allowed to cross ""often meaningless county council boundaries."" The health secretary added that he had shared proposals for a ""simplified"" approach to local lockdowns with the devolved governments. The UK government is understood to be planning a new three-tier approach to local coronavirus restrictions in England. Mr Hancock said he had discussed these plans with Mr Gething and that it would ""simplify further if it were undertaken across the UK."" A UK government Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We work closely with local leaders and public health teams to inform decisions on local interventions, taking into account a range of factors."" Public Health England, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and NHS Test and Trace ""are constantly monitoring the levels of infection across the country,"" the spokesperson added. ""We discuss measures with local directors of public health and local authorities, constantly reviewing the evidence and we will take swift targeted action where necessary."" A data glitch that has delayed test results in England has not impacted Wales, an official has said. An investigation is under way after nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases went unreported in England, delaying contact tracing efforts. Giri Shankar, incident director at Public Health Wales, said: ""Preliminary findings from a Department of Health and Social Care analysis have indicated that this issue has not affected Wales, either in terms of data reporting, or in terms of contact tracing under Test, Trace, Protect. We continue to stay in close contact with the DHSC about this,"" he said.

"Nearly 16,000 virus cases missed after IT error","A technical glitch that meant nearly 16,000 cases of coronavirus went unreported has delayed efforts to trace contacts of people who tested positive. Public Health England said 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were left out of the UK daily case figures. They were then added in to reachSaturday's figure of 12,872 new casesandSunday's 22,961 figure. PHE said all those who tested positive had been informed. But it means others in close contact with them were not. The issue has been resolved, PHE said, with outstanding cases passed on to tracers by 01:00 BST on Saturday. The technical issue also means that the daily case totals reported on the government's coronavirus dashboard over the past week have been lower than the true number. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said daily figures for the end of the week were ""actually nearer 11,000"", rather than the about 7,000 reported. Labour has described the glitch as ""shambolic"". The BBC has been told by senior public health officials in the north-west of England that a significant proportion of the unreported cases are from the area. Cities such as Liverpool and Manchester already have among the highest infection rates in the country, at about 10 times the national average. BBC analysis found the number of cases reported for the week to 1 October increased by 92.6% in the north west after taking in the missing tests - with similar rises reflected across England. The increase is mostly down to the missing tests, but the figures also included some results which came back after 2 October. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I can't give you those figures but all those people are being contacted"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the cases data had been ""truncated"" and ""lost"", but added all people who had tested positive had been contacted and the tracers were ""now working through all the contacts"". How many cases are there in your area? What are the Covid rules where you live? Meanwhile, the head of the government's vaccine taskforce, Kate Bingham, has told theFinancial Times,externalthat less than half of the UK population could be vaccinated against coronavirus. ""There is going to be no vaccination of people under 18,"" she said. ""It's an adult-only vaccine for people over 50, focusing on health workers, care home workers and the vulnerable."" Mr Johnsonhas warned it could be ""bumpy through to Christmas""and beyond as the UK deals with coronavirus. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, the PM said there was ""hope"" of beating Covid, and called on the public to ""act fearlessly but with common sense"". In aninterview with the Sun,external, Rishi Sunak has defended his Eat Out to Help Out scheme, saying he had ""no regrets"", after suggestions it may have helped fuel the second wave of coronavirus cases. At a time when the testing system has come under intense scrutiny after reports of delays and a system struggling to keep up with demand, the latest revelation could not have come at a more awkward moment for the government at Westminster. Because the nearly 16,000 extra positive test results had been not entered into the test and trace system, their recent contacts were not immediately followed up. Experts advise that ideally contacts should be tracked down within 48 hours. Officials say the technical problem - thought to be IT related - has been resolved, with all the new cases added into totals reported over the weekend. But all this will hardly improve public confidence in the testing system in England. And it muddies the waters for policy makers and officials trying to track the spread of the virus at what the prime minister has called a ""critical moment"". On Sunday, the government's coronavirus dashboard said that, as of 09:00 BST, there had been a further 22,961 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 502,978. Another 33 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Sunday. In full: Andrew Marr's interview with Boris Johnson Ministers have 'lost control of virus' - Starmer Public Health England's interim chief executive Michael Brodie said a ""technical issue"" was identified overnight on Friday, 2 October in the process that transfers Covid-19 positive lab results into reporting dashboards. He said the majority of the unreported cases had occurred in the ""most recent days"". It was caused by some data files reporting positive test results exceeding the maximum file size. Mr Brodie said they worked with NHS Test and Trace to ""quickly resolve the issue and transferred all outstanding cases immediately into the NHS Test and Trace contact tracing system"". ""We fully understand the concern this may cause and further robust measures have been put in place as a result,"" he said. Test and Trace and Public Health England joint medical adviser Susan Hopkins said a thorough risk assessment had been undertaken ""to ensure outstanding cases were prioritised for contact tracing effectively"". PHE said NHS Test and Trace have made sure there are enough contact tracers working, and are working with local teams to ensure they also have sufficient resources to be urgently able to contact all cases. The number of call attempts is being increased from 10 to 15 over 96 hours. There have been clear problems with the government's Test and Trace data, but they do not change our view of the UK's trajectory. Cases surged at the beginning of September, they may still be climbing, but not as quicklyas anticipated just a few weeks ago. This perspective comes from three key sets of data - the Office for National Statistics, the React study by Imperial College London and the Covid symptom tracker app. None are blighted by either the current issues with the Test and Trace data or by people struggling to access a test. The real fallout of the weekend's statistical chaos is not the numbers, but the people who should have been contact-traced, told to quarantine and instead may have been unwittingly passing on the virus. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""This is shambolic and people across the country will be understandably alarmed."" He called for Health Secretary Matt Hancock to explain ""what on earth has happened"" and what he plans to do to fix test and trace. Mr Hancock is due to update MPs about coronavirus on Monday afternoon. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the treasury, told BBC Breakfast she wanted to know whether it had had ""any impact on government decision making around local restrictions"".

PHE data shows Manchester now has the highest rate of infection in England, at 495.6 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 1 October, from 223.2 the week before. Liverpool has the second highest rate, up to 456.4 from 287.1 per 100,000. Knowsley in Merseyside, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leeds and Sheffield have also seen sharp rises. News of the glitch in the daily count first emerged late on Saturday, when the UK announced more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time since mass testing began. From 25 Sept to 2 Oct 50,786Cases initially reported by PHE 15,841Unreported cases, missed due to IT error 8 daysof incomplete data 1,980cases per day, on average,  were missed in that time 48 hoursIdeal time limit for tracing contacts after  positive test The government said the technical issue meant some cases during the week were not recorded at the time, so were included in Saturday's data. The daily total rose from 4,044 on Monday to a then-high of 7,143 on Tuesday. However, over the next four days the daily total remained stable at a time when continued increases might have been expected. Then came the big leap in numbers - a far bigger day-on-day increase than at any time in the entire pandemic - which was announced on Saturday, five hours later than usual, and was accompanied by the government explanation.

Investigation launched into coronavirus test error,"The health secretary has said a technical glitch that saw nearly 16,000 Covid-19 cases go unreported in England ""should never have happened"". The error meant that although those who tested positive were told about their results, their close contacts were not traced. By Monday afternoon, around half of those who tested positive had yet to be asked about their close contacts. Labour said the missing results were ""putting lives at risk"". Experts advise that ideally contacts should be tracked down within 48 hours. How many cases are there in your area? What are the Covid rules where you live? How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? The technical error was caused by some Microsoft Excel data files exceeding the maximum size after they were sent from NHS Test and Trace to Public Health England. It meant 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were left out of the UK daily case figures. PHE said the error itself, discovered overnight on Friday, has been fixed, and outstanding cases had been passed on to tracers by 01:00 BST on Saturday. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the incident as a whole had not yet been resolved - with only 51% of those whose positive results were caught up in the glitch now reached by contact tracers. He said it had ""not substantially changed"" the government's assessment of the epidemic, however, and had ""not impacted the basis on which decisions about local action were taken"". He also said outbreak control in care homes, schools and hospitals had not been directly affected, as they do not rely on the data in question. ""This incident should never have happened. But the team have acted swiftly to minimise its impact,"" he added. The BBC has confirmed the missing Covid-19 test data was caused by the ill-thought-out use of Microsoft's Excel software. Furthermore, PHE was to blame, rather than a third-party contractor. The issue was caused by the way the agency brought together logs produced by the commercial firms paid to carry out swab tests for the virus. They filed their results in the form of text-based lists, without issue. PHE had set up an automatic process to pull this data together into Excel templates so that it could then be uploaded to a central system and made available to the NHS Test and Trace team as well as other government computer dashboards. The problem is that the PHE developers picked an old file format to do this - known as XLS. As a consequence, each template could handle only about 65,000 rows of data rather than the one million-plus rows that Excel is actually capable of. And since each test result created several rows of data, in practice it meant that each template was limited to about 1,400 cases. When that total was reached, further cases were simply left off. Read more from Leo here Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the missing results were ""putting lives at risk"". He said the unreported cases meant as many as 48,000 contacts had not been traced and therefore not been isolating, with ""thousands blissfully unaware they've been exposed to Covid, potentially spreading this deadly virus"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock tells MPs the late reporting of test results was a âserious issue that is being investigated fullyâ. Paul Wells said the NHS Covid-19 app allowed him to ""carry on as normal"" even after his husband had uploaded a positive test result and been told to self-isolate. ""It's very frustrating to hear that processes or systems are not working correctly, especially with something that is high risk,"" he told BBC News. ""The knock-on effect is damaging to not only myself and my husband, but the ripple effect it has to family and friends and our neighbours."" On Monday afternoon, the government's coronavirus dashboard announced a further 12,594 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 515,571. Another 19 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. The earlier technical error meant the daily case totals reported on the government's coronavirus dashboard over the past week have been lower than the true number. Why using Excel caused Covid-19 tests to be lost What's the danger of the missing 16,000 Covid cases? Daily figures for the end of the week were about 10,000 rather than the roughly 7,000 that had been reported. BBC analysis found the number of cases reported for the week to 1 October increased by 92.6% in the North West after taking in the missing tests - with similar rises reflected across England. The increase, of 8,348 cases, is mostly down to the missing tests, but the figures also included some results which came back after 2 October. You can look at the case numbers two ways: we normally count them on the date they're reported, which today would be 12,594. But today's news has shown how reporting lags can skew those trends. If you arrange the figures by the date the tests were taken, you can get a clearer picture. In that analysis, we reached an average of 10,000 new cases a day towards the end of last week. That's about double what it was a fortnight ago. It's hard to say for sure what's happened since then, since it takes a few days for tests to be reported and for these figures to settle down. But that pattern is consistent with other data: the number of people going into hospital, or official surveys and symptom trackers. They all paint a picture of an epidemic that's growing - not doubling every week, but growing. There's hope in some parts of the data that the pace of growth may be slowing slightly, but there's no evidence that it's shrinking. Mr Hancock suggested that the error did not impact the introduction of local restrictions last week. However, Liverpool Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram said the measures brought in there were ""predicated on"" figures that were ""underestimated by a considerable sum"". ""We understand that there needed to be further restrictions because of those increases in transmission rates, but we've not received any of the scientific evidence that backs that up,"" he told the BBC. ""It seems that the restrictions were predicated on a false promise that the figures that we were provided with were the basis for the announcement."" In full: Andrew Marr's interview with Boris Johnson Ministers have 'lost control of virus' - Starmer PHE data shows Liverpool has the second highest rate of infection in England, at 456.4 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 1 October, from 287.1 the week before. Knowsley in Merseyside, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leeds and Sheffield have also seen sharp rises. Manchester has the highest rate of infection, at 495.6 cases per 100,000 people, from 223.2 the week before. The BBC's Danny Savage said the head of public health in Manchester estimates the infection rate among the city's student population is as high as 3,000 cases per 100,000. ""We'll have to watch closely at what those figures are like in student populations across the country in areas with a high number of infection,"" he said. PHE said NHS Test and Trace has made sure there are enough contact tracers working, and is working with local teams to ensure they also have sufficient resources to be urgently able to contact all cases.

Boris Johnson urges people to âgo to the cinemaâThe prime minister's comments come after Cineworld said it would temporarily close UK and US venues.Business,"Odeon is cutting the opening hours for some of its cinemas in the UK and Ireland to weekends only because of delays to new film releases. The chain, which operates 120 theatres, said it will affect a quarter of its cinemas, which will now open between Friday and Sunday. Odeon, which employs 5,500 people, declined to comment on job cuts. It comes as Cineworld said it will temporarily close its UK and US venues, affecting 45,000 jobs. According to movie magazine Film Stories,external, Odeon emailed customers to tell them that from Friday 9 October it was temporarily reducing hours at some cinemas ""in light of the ongoing delays to the release of many new films"". The changes announced by Odeon and Cineworld come afterthe release of the new James Bond film was delayed again. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to return to cinemas. He said would ""encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support"" movie theatres. However, the cinema industry has been hit by an absence of blockbuster movie to lure in customers. Cineworld employs around 5,500 people in the UK and its chief executive Mooky Greidinger, said: ""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets."" No Time to Die, starring Daniel Craig as James Bond, will now be released in 2021 The company did not give a date for reopening its 663 cinemas, which include 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theatres in the UK. Mr Greidinger said the company ""cannot underscore enough how difficult this decision was"" to close the sites. ""Cineworld will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time, when key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen,"" he said. Rosalyn Lloyd has worked at Cineworld for nearly two years Rosalyn Lloyd, 30, found out that her job at a Cineworld theatre in Wolverhampton was under threat from social media at the weekend. And she still doesn't know if she'll get a wage this month. ""We've been told nothing at all,"" Ms Lloyd told the BBC. ""When I went to work yesterday, everyone had seen it on social media [and] everyone was down in the dumps which is understandable. ""One woman was crying because she'd been there for nine years."" Ms Lloyd has worked at Cineworld for nearly two years and was placed on furlough earlier this year, though she says because she is on a zero-hour contract the pay was ""very low"".

We all are waiting for a call - it is a waiting game."" ""No Time to Die"", which is reportedly actor Daniel Craig's final outing as 007, is a key movie release that had been due in cinemas in April this year, but was then postponed until November because of the coronavirus pandemic. The release date has now been moved to April next year. ""I think the Bond movie is the straw that broke the camel's back to be honest,"" said Robert Mitchell, director of theatrical insights at Gower Street Analytics.

Lana Del Rey criticised for wearing mesh mask,"The star read from her new poetry book at the event in Los Angeles Lana Del Rey has upset some of her fans due to her choice of face mask at a recent book signing in California. The star appeared at a branch of Barnes and Noble in Los Angeles, where she read passages from her new poetry book Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass. At the event, Del Rey wore a glittery, mesh face mask that she'd previously used in a cover shoot for Interview magazine. It would appear that the mask provided no barrier to the spread of Covid-19. The BBC has contacted Lana Del Rey's team for a comment. ""Lana, please wear a real mask. I'm begging you be safe,"" wrote a concerned fan, under an Instagram photo of the star at the book signing. ""I love Lana but this is incredibly irresponsible,"" said another.  ""Girl, we're in the middle of a pandemic,"" added a third. Should I wear a face covering in the supermarket? How to wear your face covering and inhibit coronavirus Lana Del Rey responds to accusations of racism Lana Del Rey's Norman Rockwell is critics' top album of 2019 Del Rey's sister, Caroline ""Chuck"" Grant, who livestreamed the poetry reading on Instagram, said the singer had ""tested negative"" and was remaining six feet away from her fans. However, pictures posted on the pop culture Twitter account @Popcrave showed the star posing next to fans after the reading. At least one was not following California's social distancing guidelines.

Worst September for UK car sales this century,"New UK car registrations fell 4.4% in September from a year earlier, according to the motor industry. That made it the worst September this century in what is normally the industry's second most important month. There were just 328,041 new registrations in the month, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The car sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which closed factories and showrooms. September is normally second to March as the industry's most important sales month, because licence plate changes typically prompt a spike in demand. But the SMMT said last month saw the lowest volume in new cars since the current licence plate system began in 1999. These figures are unlikely to generate much optimism in an industry which, in the SMMT's own words, has just gone through one of the bleakest periods in its history. There had been hope that pent-up demand from buyers unable to head out during lockdown would produce a spike in sales later in the year. It hasn't happened. It seems as though the economic uncertainty caused by Covid is making buyers wary of buying or leasing big-ticket items - such as cars. There is some good news for the industry, though. Sales of electric cars are rising fast, even as the market for diesels continues to collapse. Carmakers have ploughed huge sums into developing electric vehicles, effectively forced to do so by policymakers intent on cutting pollution and phasing out traditional cars. Right now, they are expensive to build and not very profitable. But if enough people buy them, then economies of scale will kick in and carmakers can hope to recoup some of their investment. ""During a torrid year, the automotive industry has demonstrated incredible resilience, but this is not a recovery,"" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes. ""Unless the pandemic is controlled and economy-wide consumer and business confidence rebuilt, the short-term future looks very challenging indeed."" The SMMT said the relaxation of Covid lockdown restrictions from June had seen consumers return to showrooms and factories restart production lines, after one of the bleakest periods in the sector's history. But it added that the market faced ""continued pressure"", including Brexit uncertainty and the threat of tariffs. while the shift towards zero emission-capable vehicles required huge investment. ""Additionally, consumer and business confidence is threatened by the forthcoming end of the government's furlough scheme, an expected rise in unemployment and continuing restrictions on society as a result of the pandemic,"" the SMMT said. 1.

However, not all carmakers had a bad month. Historic UK car marque MG, now Chinese-owned, said it had notched up 3,668 sales in September 2020 - 169% up on the same month in 2019.

Cineworld closures 'not a decision we made lightly',"Odeon is cutting the opening hours for some of its cinemas in the UK and Ireland to weekends only because of delays to new film releases. The chain, which operates 120 theatres, said it will affect a quarter of its cinemas, which will now open between Friday and Sunday. Odeon, which employs 5,500 people, declined to comment on job cuts. It comes as Cineworld said it will temporarily close its UK and US venues, affecting 45,000 jobs. According to movie magazine Film Stories,external, Odeon emailed customers to tell them that from Friday 9 October it was temporarily reducing hours at some cinemas ""in light of the ongoing delays to the release of many new films"". The changes announced by Odeon and Cineworld come afterthe release of the new James Bond film was delayed again. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to return to cinemas. He said would ""encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support"" movie theatres. However, the cinema industry has been hit by an absence of blockbuster movie to lure in customers. Cineworld employs around 5,500 people in the UK and its chief executive Mooky Greidinger, said: ""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets."" No Time to Die, starring Daniel Craig as James Bond, will now be released in 2021 The company did not give a date for reopening its 663 cinemas, which include 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse theatres in the UK. Mr Greidinger said the company ""cannot underscore enough how difficult this decision was"" to close the sites. ""Cineworld will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time, when key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen,"" he said. Rosalyn Lloyd has worked at Cineworld for nearly two years Rosalyn Lloyd, 30, found out that her job at a Cineworld theatre in Wolverhampton was under threat from social media at the weekend. And she still doesn't know if she'll get a wage this month. ""We've been told nothing at all,"" Ms Lloyd told the BBC. ""When I went to work yesterday, everyone had seen it on social media [and] everyone was down in the dumps which is understandable. ""One woman was crying because she'd been there for nine years."" Ms Lloyd has worked at Cineworld for nearly two years and was placed on furlough earlier this year, though she says because she is on a zero-hour contract the pay was ""very low"". Her immediate problem is a lack of information from Cineworld. ""Are they still going to pay us at the end of October? We just haven't heard anything at the moment. We all are waiting for a call - it is a waiting game."" ""No Time to Die"", which is reportedly actor Daniel Craig's final outing as 007, is a key movie release that had been due in cinemas in April this year, but was then postponed until November because of the coronavirus pandemic. The release date has now been moved to April next year. ""I think the Bond movie is the straw that broke the camel's back to be honest,"" said Robert Mitchell, director of theatrical insights at Gower Street Analytics. ""A lot of films have been moving for some time now and ultimately the cinemas need a pipeline of regular content to draw cinema goers in,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.

""Bond was really the one that UK exhibitors were really relying on more than any,"" he said. Shares in Cineworld plunged in early trading, down 27% at 28.74p each. Tim Richards, founder and chief executive of the Vue cinema chain, said the company had put safety measures in place at its theatres and noted there was ""pent up demand like we haven't seen ever before"" among customers to go out. However, he added: ""Our problem right now is we have no movies and this [the delay to the Bond film] was a big blow for us."" ""We are likely going to make it through,"" Mr Richards said, adding that Vue's goal is to try to keep as many of its 5,500 workers as possible. Tenet, a film by British director Christopher Nolan, was the most recent big box office release Mr Mitchell said he had forecast previously that UK box office takings would reach Â£500m this year. ""The Bond move obviously shaves a lot off that,"" he said. ""And now that Cineworld is closing and we don't know when it will be reopening, it might be a struggle to get over Â£400m."" Mr Richards said that outside the US, many cinemas had now re-opened. ""Looking globally right now, 75% of screens, maybe as high as 80% of screens are open. ""Even if you look at the numbers that Tenet generated in the UK it is going to get very close to Christopher Nolan's previous film Interstellar, maybe 80-90% of what it did.

Hepatitis C discovery wins the Nobel Prize,"The announcement was made at a press conference at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden Three scientists who discovered the virus Hepatitis C have won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology. The winners are British scientist Michael Houghton and US researchers Harvey Alter and Charles Rice. The Nobel Prize committee said their discoveries ultimately ""saved millions of lives"". The virus is a common cause of liver cancer and a major reason why people need a liver transplant. In the 1960s, there was huge concern that people receiving donated blood were getting chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation) from an unknown, mysterious disease. The Nobel Prize committee said a blood transfusion at the time was like ""Russian roulette"". Highly sensitive blood tests mean such cases have now been eliminated in many parts of the world, and effective anti-viral drugs have also been developed. ""For the first time in history, the disease can now be cured, raising hopes of eradicating Hepatitis C virus from the world,"" the prize committee said. However, there are 70 million people currently living with the virus, which still kills around 400,000 a year. The viruses Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B had been discovered by the mid-1960s. But Prof Harvey Alter, while studying transfusion patients at the US National Institutes of Health in 1972, showed there wasanother, mystery, infection at work,external. Patients were still getting sick after receiving donated blood. He showed that giving blood from infected patients to chimpanzees led to them developing the disease. The mysterious illness became known as ""non-A, non-B"" hepatitis and the hunt was now on. Prof Michael Houghton, while at the pharmaceutical firm Chiron, managed to isolated the genetic sequenceof the virus in 1989,external. This showed it was a type of flavivirus and it was named Hepatitis C. And Prof Charles Rice, while at Washington University in St. Louis, appliedthe finishing touches in 1997,external. He injected a genetically engineered Hepatitis C virus into the liver of chimpanzees and showed this could lead to hepatitis. Prof Houghton, now at the University of Alberta in Canada, told the BBC: ""We had limited tools available to us then, so it was rather like searching for a needle in a haystack. ""The amount of virus present in the liver and the blood was very low, and the sensitivity of our techniques was not high enough, so we were sailing very close to the wind all the time. ""We tried a lot of methods, probably 30 or 40 different methodological approaches over seven years, and eventually one worked."" Commenting on the announcement, Dr Claire Bayntun, a clinical consultant in global public health and vice-president of Royal Society of Medicine, said the discovery was an ""extraordinary achievement"". She said: ""[In] unlocking the door to the development of effective treatment and screening of blood transfusions, and protecting populations in many regions of the world, millions of lives have been saved.""

Coaching and advice for jobseekers in Â£238m scheme,"Jobseekers will be offered coaching and advice on moving into ""growing sectors"" as part of a Â£238m employment programme, the government has said. Job Entry Targeted Support is aimed at helping those out of work because of Covid-19 for three months. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said it would give people ""the helping hand they need"". But Labour said the scheme ""offers very little new support"" and it was ""too little too late"". Last month, official figures showed that the UK unemployment rate had risen to its highest level for two years,with young people particularly hard hit. How is furlough changing? Sunak defends emergency jobs scheme 'We have next to no income. There is no help for us' What jobs are available post-lockdown? The Job Entry Targeted Support (JETS) scheme will ""boost the prospects of more than a quarter of a million people across Britain"", Ms Coffey said. The Department for Work and Pensions says it is recruiting an additional 13,500 ""work coaches"" to help deliver the new scheme. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Coffey said JETS is aimed more at helping ""adults beyond the age of 25"" learn how their skills ""can be used in different parts of the economy"" - and she cited construction and care as examples of growing sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the scheme would ""provide fresh opportunities to those that have sadly lost their jobs, to ensure that nobody is left without hope"". ""Our unprecedented support has protected millions of livelihoods and businesses since the start of the pandemic, but I've always been clear that we can't save every job,"" he said. ""I've spoken about the damaging effects of being out of work, but through JETS we will provide fresh opportunities to those that have sadly lost their jobs, to ensure that nobody is left without hope."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It's going to continue to be bumpy through to Christmas"" However, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: ""By the government's own admission at least four million people could lose their jobs during the crisis. All it can muster in response are piecemeal schemes and meaningless slogans. ""This new scheme offers very little new support and relies on already overstretched work coaches on the ground, while many of the new work coaches promised have yet to materialise. ""It's too little too late again from a government that simply can't get a grip on this jobs crisis."" Mr Sunak is due to address the Conservative Party Conference later, saying the government has been faced with ""difficult trade-offs and decisions"" during the coronavirus pandemic. He will say that while he cannot protect every job, ""the pain of knowing it only grows with each passing day"". Mr Sunak will say his ""single priority"" as chancellor is ""to create support and extend opportunity to as many people as I can"". ""We will not let talent wither, or waste, we will help all who want it, find new opportunity and develop new skills,"" he is expected to say. In aninterview with the Sun,externalahead of his speech, Mr Sunak also defended his Eat Out to Help Out scheme after suggestions it may have helped fuel the second wave of coronavirus cases. The chancellor said the scheme had helped prop-up two million jobs and that he had no regrets about paying for it. Mr Sunak also strongly pushed back on the idea of further lockdowns, which he said would be detrimental not just to the economy but to society as well. ""Lockdowns obviously have a very strong economic impact, but they have an impact on many other things,"" he said. On the 22:00 curfew on pubs and restaurants, Mr Sunak said ministers were implementing such rules ""to try and nip this in the bud"", but he acknowledged it was ""frustrating"". ""Everyone is very frustrated and exhausted and tired about all of this,"" he told the paper. Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said her party had urged Mr Sunak to introduce a wage support scheme that incentivised employers to keep more staff on, but ""he ignored these calls and now nearly a million jobs are at risk when the furlough scheme ends in a few weeks' time"". ""When he speaks at Conservative Party Conference, Rishi Sunak must promise to get a grip of the jobs crisis before it's too late,"" she said. ""If he doesn't, Britain risks an unemployment crisis greater than we have seen in decades - and Rishi Sunak's name will be all over it."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? It comes as the furlough scheme ends this month, to be replaced by the government's new wage subsidy programme,the Job Support Scheme, on 1 November. Under the Job Support Scheme, if bosses bring back workers part time, the government will help top up their wages with employers to at least three-quarters of their full-time pay. Nearly three million workers - or 12% of the UK's workforce - are currently on partial or full furlough leave, according to official figures.

Top judge wants more diversity in Supreme Court,"Lord Reed has spoken to the BBC about the lack of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds among the Supreme Court's 12 justices The new Supreme Court president says he hopes a justice from an ethnic minority background will be appointed before his retirement in six years' time. Lord Reed said the lack of diversity among the 12 Supreme Court justices was a situation ""which cannot be allowed to become shameful if it persists"". Only 4% of senior judges appointed to the High Court or above are from ethnic minority backgrounds. Lord Reed has taken over as president of the Supreme Court from Lady Hale. What is the UK Supreme Court? Who is the new top judge at the Supreme Court? 'Nobody thinks black people can be barristers' In his first media interview since taking on the role, and when asked when there might be a justice from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background appointed to the court, Lord Reed told the BBC: ""I hope that will be before I retire which is in six years' time."" Last month black barrister Alexandra Wilson wasmistaken for a defendant three timesin the same morning at a magistrates' court. ""I thought that was appalling,"" Lord Reed said. ""Alexandra Wilson is a very gifted young lawyer, an Oxford graduate who has won umpteen scholarships, and for her to be treated like that was extremely disappointing to say the least,"" he said. Ms Wilson received an apology from Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service for ""the totally unacceptable behaviour"". Asked about a judge of South Asian heritage who was mistaken on numerous occasions for the court clerk, he said: ""That is down to ignorance and unconscious bias which has to be addressed by the courts service."" Alexandra Wilson, who specialises in family and criminal law, said she did not expect to ""constantly justify my existence at work"" Diversity has remained a stubbornly difficult issue for the judiciary which has often been described as ""stale, male and pale"". Currently just 4% of senior judges appointed to the High Court or above are from a black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. The figure rises to 8% of lower court judges and 12% of tribunal judges, a 2% increase compared with 2014 in both cases. The representation of women is better, but still unequal. Currently 32% of court judges and 47% of tribunal judges are women. The proportion has increased in recent years, but remains lower in senior court appointments with women making up just 26% of High Court and more senior judges. Until Lady Hale's departure there were three female Supreme Court justices. Often called the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court is a big beast. It is the final court of appeal for all UK civil cases and criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as hearing appeals on points of law of great public and constitutional importance. Unlike its more powerful US counterpart, it cannot strike down legislation, but it can judicially review the actions of ministers and other public bodies and decide if they are lawful. That gives it huge power, seen to the full last year when the court unanimously declared ""unlawful"" the advice Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave the Queen to suspend Parliament in the lead up to the Brexit deadline. Lord Reed succeeded Lady Hale as President of the Supreme Court It showed that independent judges can halt the might of government in its tracks if ministers have acted unlawfully and that no-one is above the law. That led some to accuse the court of judicial activism. ""What we are doing isn't activism. It's giving effect to the law,"" Lord Reed said. ""The fact that some of the topics can be politically sensitive is something which we cannot allow to deter us from applying the law which Parliament has enacted. That's what we're here for."" The government has set up a panel to examine judicial review. It will consider whether certain executive decisions should be decided on by judges, and which grounds and remedies should be available in bringing claims against the government. Lord Reed was not impressed with a Home Office video, tweeted in August,which described ""activist"" lawyerswho represent migrants arguing they have a right to remain in the UK. The animated video said current regulations were open to abuse allowing ""activist lawyers"" to delay and disrupt returns. ""I think that was unfortunate and I understand that the government has acknowledged that. ""There is no question of people being activist simply because they are doing their job,"" he said - underscoring that the lawyer's job is to see clients get the treatment they are entitled to by law. The government took down the video, but some saw its posting as as a deliberate attempt to pick a fight with lawyers, in order to deflect attention from the fact that migrants claiming asylum are sometimes unlawfully removed from the UK in breach of international human rights laws. Lord Reed acknowledged there was a risk in applying the label ""activist"" to lawyers and then withdrawing it because it can lodge in the public's mind. ""It's important that people are careful in the language that they use,"" he said. Lord Reed wants to maintain the standing of the Supreme Court as ""one of the very top courts in the world whose judgements are cited and followed by other courts around the world"". However, at a time when the government has placed the constitutional role of judges under intense scrutiny, he is keen to strengthen the relationship between the court and Parliament. ""Some of the reaction to the judgements that we gave relating to actions government was taking in the course of the Brexit negotiations revealed a lack of understanding of what our role was or how we operate - and perhaps a degree of suspicion of what our motives might be,"" he acknowledged. So, he is exploring with the Speaker's office how to enable members of Parliament to question and discuss with the justices how they decide cases. Understandably, Lord Reed would not be drawn on the Internal Market Bill which enables the government to break its international treaty obligations under the EU Withdrawal Agreement. It is, after all, still before Parliament. But in the next six years the Supreme Court is likely to remain locked into what is perhaps the constitutional clash of our times, between a powerful government that wants to get its way on policy decisions, and independent judges whose role is to scrutinise the lawfulness of those decisions.

This misses out on the much of the severe downturn in passengers since the pandemic took hold in January. Singapore barred the entry and transit of short-term visitors on 23 March. But the impact from those months still had a big impact, wiping out earlier gains built up over much of 2019. Profits plunged 36% to S$435m ($319m, Â£246m). For 2020 Changi was voted the world's best airport for an eighth consecutive year, according to rankings by UK-based analysts Skytrax.

Trump health monitored after weekend of confusion,"This video can not be played President Trump pays ""surprise visit"" to supporters outside hospital US President Donald Trump remains under scrutiny as he stays in hospital for Covid-19 treatment. There is scepticism over the prospect - raised by doctors earlier - that he could leave on Monday as questions continue over the seriousness of his illness. His oxygen level dipped twice and he received a steroid treatment. On Sunday, he made a surprise public appearance in a drive-past to greet supporters, drawing criticism. ""More than 205,000 Americans are dead. We need leadership. Not photo ops,""tweeted Hakeem Jeffries,external, chairman of the Democrats in the US House of Representatives. Wearing a mask, the president waved to well-wishers from behind the glass of a sealed car after tweeting that he would leave Walter Reed hospital to pay a ""surprise visit"" to ""patriots"" outside. A doctor at the hospital strongly criticised the president's motorcade ride due to the infection risk inside the car. ""That Presidential SUV is not only bulletproof, but hermetically sealed against chemical attack. The risk of Covid-19 transmission inside is as high as it gets outside of medical procedures,""Dr James Philips tweeted,external. He said that those inside the president's car would need to quarantine for 14 days and are at risk of getting ill. Earlier, it emerged that the president's condition was more serious than previously reported when he went to hospital Friday evening. The White House had said that Mr Trump was experiencing ""mild symptoms"" of Covid-19, but it was confirmed at the weekend that he received supplemental oxygen after his levels dipped twice within two days. He was given the steroid dexamethasone, which is normally reserved for serious cases, according to experts. However, Mr Trump sought to project an image of strength, tweeting images of himself appearing to work from the hospital and a video message teasing his surprise drive past. Read the latest updates here Unanswered questions about Trump's Covid crisis Who Trump met - and who's tested positive 'We're here to tell him that we love him' In a tweet, the president - dressed in a suit jacket and shirt with no tie - said:""I learned a lot about Covid.,externalI learned it by really going to school. This is the real school. This isn't the let's read the books school. I get it and I understand it. It's a very interesting thing, I'll be letting you know about it."" The president's diagnosis, which he made public in a tweet early on Friday, has upended his election campaign. Mr Trump faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden on 3 November. Earlier at the weekend, Mr Trump's doctors said that the president continued to improve and might be discharged as soon as Monday. However, Dr Sean Conley, the White House physician, disclosed that the president's oxygen level dropped twice since his diagnosis, and he was started on dexamethasone. The president was given extra oxygen at least once after testing positive, said Dr Conley, who also sought to clarify earlier confusion caused by conflicting statements about Mr Trump's condition. Speaking at a news conference at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center close to Washington DC, Dr Conley said Mr Trump's oxygen level dropped for the first time on Friday morning at the White House. The president had a high fever, he said, and an oxygen level below 94% - a healthy person's level is 95% or higher. The second episode happened on Saturday, when the level dropped below 93%. When questioned, Dr Conley did not say whether the president had received oxygen but added that, if it had happened, ""it was very limited"". The team, Dr Conley said, decided to give Mr Trump dexamethasone,which is shown in studies to improve survival for patients in hospitalwith severe Covid-19. This video can not be played Dr Sean Conley confirmed that President Trump was given supplemental oxygen on Friday morning Steroids calm down inflammation and the immune system and are already used in conditions like arthritis and asthma as well as in some severe infections. The drugs are not thought to be helpful in the early stages of a coronavirus infection. ""Given the timeline where [Mr Trump] is in the course of illness, we're trying to maximise everything that we can do for himâ¦ We decided that in this case the potential benefits early on in the course probably outweighed any risks at this time,"" Dr Conley said. Dr Conley also addresseda conflicting account about the president's healthgiven shortly after his briefing on Saturday by the White House chief of staff. Mark Meadows said Mr Trump's vital signs over the previous 24 hours had been ""very concerning"" and that the next 48 hours would be critical. ""I think his statement was misconstrued,"" the doctor said. However, he acknowledged giving an overly upbeat description of Mr Trump's condition a day earlier: ""I didn't want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction. And in doing so, you know, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn't necessarily true."" This video can not be played President Trump's seven days before his Covid-positive test The president, being 74, a man and someone categorised as obese, is in a higher-risk category for Covid-19. On Friday he was given an experimental drug cocktail injection and started a five-day course of antiviral medication remdesivir. Dr Brian Garibaldi, who is also part of the team treating the president, said: ""He feels well, he's been up and around and our plan for today is to have him to eat and drink, be up out of bed as much as possible to be mobile."" In pictures: Trump supporters hold rallies The Trump doctor in the eye of the storm The doctors said the president had not had a fever since Friday and that his liver and kidney functions had remained normal. But Dr Conley refused to answer questions on whether lung scans showed any damage. How significant is it that Donald Trump has been given dexamethasone? The steroid saves lives by calming the immune system, which can become dangerously overactive in Covid, but needs to be used at the right time. Give it too early and the drug could make things worse by impairing the body's ability to fight off the virus. This is not a drug you would usually give in the ""mild"" stage of the disease. The Recovery Trial, which took place in the UK,showed the benefit kicked in at the point people need oxygen,external- which Mr Trump briefly did. The World Health Organization translated those findings to adviseusing the steroid in ""severe and critical"" cases.,external Mr Trump's blood oxygen levels did dip below 94%, which is one of theNational Institutes of Health criteria for ""severe illness"".,externalHowever, those low oxygen levels were not sustained and the gap between someone needing transient oxygen support and end-stage Covid-19 is massive. We do not know the full details of Mr Trump's condition, but it is hard to imagine you or I would be discharged from hospital while taking dexamethasone and remdesivir and after being given an experimental antibody therapy.  However, we do not have the medical support at the US president's disposal. A number of people around the president have tested positive, including First Lady Melania Trump. Many of them attendeda meeting at the White House last weekendthat is being scrutinised as a possible ""super-spreader event"". Other people to have tested positive around Mr Trump include close aide Hope Hicks - believed to be the first to show symptoms - campaign manager Bill Stepien and former White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway. Nicholas Luna, the latest person reported to have tested positive, is a personal assistant or ""body man"" of the president and is in constant contact with Mr Trump. The president's campaignÂ team said on Saturday it would move forward ""at full speed""Â until Mr Trump could return to the campaignÂ trail.Â It is calling on top ""surrogates"", including Mr Trump's sons Donald Jr and Eric, and Vice-President Mike Pence toÂ ""carry the campaign forward"" for the time being. No White House events are scheduled for Monday. Meanwhile, Mr Pence is due to debate Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Wednesday. Joe Biden, who has continuedÂ his campaign, is due to make appearances in Miami, Florida on Monday - despite having shared a stage with Mr Trump last Tuesday, when the president may have already contracted the virus. Mr Biden's campaign said he tested negative for the virus on Sunday evening. In an interview to CBS' Face the Nation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said Republicans in Congress and the president had ""for a long time... been anti-science"" and that she hoped that Mr Trump's positive diagnosis would change his attitude towards the virus. ""I pray that in addition to his health, that the president's heart will be open to the millions of people who have been affected,"" she said. ""I hope it will be a signal that we really have to do better in preventing the spread of this virus.""

"London bans Uber rival Ola over safety concernsTransport for London said the firm made more than 1,000 trips made by unlicensed drivers.Business","Transport for London (TfL), the capital's transport authority, has not renewed the licence of Indian taxi app Ola over public safety concerns. The cab company has been operating in London since February. TfL said the firm reported a number of failings including more than 1,000 trips made by unlicensed drivers. Ola said it will appeal the decision and has 21 days to do so. It can operate in the meantime, according to the appeal rules. The transport authority said Ola did not report the failings as soon as it knew about them. ""Through our investigations we discovered that flaws in Ola's operating model have led to the use of unlicensed drivers and vehicles in more than 1,000 passenger trips, which may have put passenger safety at risk,"" Helen Chapman, TfL's director of licensing, regulation and charging, said. ""If they do appeal, Ola can continue to operate and drivers can continue to undertake bookings on behalf of Ola. We will closely scrutinise the company to ensure passengers safety is not compromised."" The ride-hailing company began operating in Cardiff in 2018 and has since spread to other UK locations. ""We have been working with TfL during the review period and have sought to provide assurances and address the issues raised in an open and transparent manner,"" Marc Rozendal, Ola's UK Managing Director, said in a statement. ""Ola will take the opportunity to appeal this decision and in doing so, our riders and drivers can rest assured that we will continue to operate as normal, providing safe and reliable mobility for London."" Last week, major rival Uber secured its right to continue operating in London after a judge upheld its appeal against TfL. The ride-hailing giant has been granted a new licence to work in the capital, nearly a year after TfL rejected its application, also over safety concerns because of unlicensed drivers.

I'm angry they think our business isn't importantSoft play and indoor sports centres still can't reopen - with some weeks away from financial collapse.Scotland,"This video can not be played Craig Meikle: ""I feel angry when I wake up in the morning, angry when I go to bed at night and angry every hour in between."" The owners of soft play and indoor sports facilities have warned they face financial ruin. While such businesses opened in England in mid-August they remain closed in Scotland. Many soft play centres, theatres and nightclubs had hoped to open on Monday but some fear they now never will. Last week First MinisterNicola Sturgeon confirmed that the date of their reopeninghad been postponed until at least 15 October. She said it would not be sensible to ease restrictions while infection rates were rising. The sectors had previously been given indicative reopening dates of 14 September and 5 October. Craig Meikle, who owns Saltire soft play and football centre in Dalkeith, has run out of patience. ""I feel angry when I wake up in the morning, angry when I go to bed at night and angry every hour in between,"" he said. ""My wife and I have spent six years building this business up to be a sustainable business. ""We're not going to get rich from this but our staff would have said they were in a stable secure job."" Saltire Soft Play in Dalkeith is close to financial disaster He says the business is six to eight weeks away from collapse. In six months of closure, he says Â£166,000 has left his business bank account with just Â£49,000 in furlough payments coming in. His business took a Â£100,000 loan to survive which is almost gone. Reopening postponed for theatres, live music venues and soft play Nightclub and festival job losses are ""unavoidable"" Mr Meikle says he is now at the mercy of his creditors but thanks to an understanding landlord, he is still hopeful for his business. He told BBC Scotland: ""So when you hear the chancellor talking aboutsupport packages for viable businessesit drives me absolutely nuts. ""When I think we have got a viable business that offers an important service to the community and it's not a business that either the Scottish government or the UK government are seeing fit to support financially, rage is probably the best feeling I could explain."" Saltire has had no financial help outside the job retention scheme and the business did not qualify for any grants. Mr Meikle has seen other businesses receive awards of up to Â£25,000 which have been allowed to reopen and earn money. The Saltire cafe sits empty His frustration is in getting no financial help and still being unable to earn. He is not alone. Mike Ferguson runs Forfar Indoor Sports. He says his phone never stops ringing asking if they are open. And he has had to watch his customers go elsewhere to venues that can open. He said: ""We are praying that on the 15th we get going. Heading towards something and not getting there is demoralising. ""The furlough scheme has been excellent for staff but we now have to think seriously about letting staff go. ""We can't carry on paying even a share of staff wages and the new rules don't assist."" Mr Ferguson says he is now trying to plan for reopening without a date. Cancellation of the 15 September deadline hit hard with training completed, deep cleans paid for and food wasted. He said: ""If they are not coming to us they are going somewhere else. That's the most frustrating point of all of this."" Frosty's Fun centre in Forfar has not seen customers since Lockdown began on 23 March A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said it understood the severe impact of the pandemic, but that Scotland was at a ""critical point"" as the virus continues to rise. She said: ""Our absolute focus has been to help businesses survive and retain as much employment as possible - using the limited powers available to us and we have repeatedly urged the UK government to transfer to us the financial powers needed to fully respond to the pandemic.

'How lockdown stopped me from breastfeeding',"Leonie Williams and six-month-old Marley who has grown to 17lb Like a lot of new mums, Leonie Williams wanted to breastfeed her baby as the advice she had was ""breast is best"". But like many newborn babies, little Marley found it tough and Leonie ""struggled"" to get professional support as the Covid-19 crisis gripped the UK. A new study has suggested 30% of breastfeeding mums gave up before they wanted to during lockdown because of a ""lack of face-to-face support"". The Welsh Government urged women with concerns to talk to maternity staff. Swansea University researchers said some health visitors were redeployed to help the NHS in its fight against coronavirus in March while house visits were stopped asthe UK went under lockdownand ""vital"" breastfeeding support groups shut. Why breastfeed a child until the age of five? 'Why I opened a breastfeeding cafe' Bottle feeding is a woman's right, midwives told Apart from phone advice with her health visitor and video calls to a family with young children, Leonie felt ""isolated"". ""Add the fact you're exhausted having a newborn, you're in pain through trying to breastfeed, it's our first baby so it's a big adjustment and your hormones are all over the place - it was really tough,"" said the 29-year-old. ""Then on top of that, you're dealing with a global pandemic."" Little Marley was born just a few days before the UK went under total lockdown Despite Leonie's best efforts, she ""couldn't continue breastfeeding"" as it was ""too much"" so she switched to feeding Marley formula full-time after about two weeks. Before coronavirus, theUK has some of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world- now the lack of support during the pandemic is ""worrying"" experts who say some new mums ""have been let down"". A worldwide studypublished in the Lancet in 2016,externalshowed 81% of UK mothers had tried breastfeeding at some point, but only 34% were breastfeeding at six months and 0.5% at 12 months. It was below other European countries, and the US, where 79% started, 49% were still going after six months and 27% after a year. The latest research, led by Swansea University's Professor of Child Public Health, Amy Brown, said some parents had been left ""isolated"" as ""what little in-person support available disappeared"". Mothers living in high-rise flats, with no private garden or green space nearby, or who didn't have high-speed wifi ""struggled the most"", the study suggested. ""The whole of maternity services has been completely let down across the board,"" Prof Brown said. ""There are groups of women whose experiences were destroyed because they couldn't get any help. ""Health visitors didn't come because of lockdown, maternity staff were redeployed to help the Covid fight and new mums didn't know where else to find support."" Emma Elias said she couldn't have continued breastfeeding Dahlia without support She added: ""It's like it doesn't matter. Maternity service help isn't just a nice-to-have; it is a major support for parents that shouldn't have been taken away."" Almost one in three of the 1,200 new mums spoken to said lockdown had a ""very negative impact on them"" and they felt ""abandoned and overwhelmed at the intensity of being alone with their baby"". Leonie can sympathise as, after Marley was born a healthy 7lb 11oz in Bridgend on 10 March, the world ""seemed to just shut down and you felt like you were on your own"". ""It was a bit manic,"" she recalled. ""The health visitor phoned after two weeks - and I still haven't seen one face to face - and I wanted to continue breastfeeding but I gave up as it was too much."" Leonie Williams' first baby Marley started having formula milk regularly after about two weeks ""It was disappointing but I couldn't,"" she said. ""I feel guilty as they say breast is best and I tried my best but I was exhausted, in agony and had no support."" Almost two months had passed and the UK was deep into lockdown when Emma Elias gave birth to her second daughter, weighing 7lbs 13.5oz, in Bridgend on 3 May - but Dahlia had ""difficulties with latching"". James, Emma, Elodie and Dahlia would only leave the house in lockdown to visit breastfeeding appointments Emma's experience, however, was slightly different as her health visitor referred the 34-year-old biomedical scientist to the area's breastfeeding coordinator. ""They were wonderful. It was the only time we'd leave the house to go to that appointment once a week -  and they were completely invaluable, I don't think we could've continued without them."" Emma Elias has praised breastfeeding support services for helping her through ""difficulties"" The new study showed that 40% of new mums surveyed did have a positive experience of breastfeeding in lockdown as their ""new baby took to breastfeeding well, they had supportive partners and weren't inundated with visitors"". Emma added: ""They are trying their best but there's no replacement for face-to-face support."" Prof Amy Brown has written six infant feeding and parent books Prof Brown now wants health boards and governments to make ""significant improvements"" and ensure the mothers who struggled are ""supported appropriately"", as the number ofcoronaviruscases increases again across the UK. ""Governments and health boards need to come up with a way to work out how groups can meet safely as it seems daft to me that it's easier to meet in a pub than get breastfeeding support,"" she said. ""Health visitors also need to be allowed into homes with the correct protection."" This video can not be played Breastfeeding and formula feeding mums share their experiences The Welsh Government said all new mothers had ""continued to receive support to help establish breastfeeding"". ""Once at home, midwives and health visitors will work with women to assess their needs and provide tailored support and targeted visits accordingly,"" a spokesman said. ""Anyone with any concerns or who requires breastfeeding support should contact their midwife or health visitor directly.""

'World's best airport' warns of prolonged crisis,"Singapore's Changi Airport has warned of a ""daunting period"" ahead as the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic shows no signs of abating. The Asian transit hub has been voted world's best airport for the eighth consecutive year. Changi has suspended operations in two terminals as flights have dropped to the lowest levels in its history. It has also suspended the construction of a fifth terminal for at least two years. ""The battle with Covid-19 has only just begun,"" Changi Airport Group said in its annual report. ""The future does appear daunting with the situation showing no signs of abatement."" US airlines lay off staff as federal relief ends 'Hundreds of thousands' of airline jobs at risk Pandemic fills up Australian airline storage The company's yearly results cover the period up until the end of March 2020. This misses out on the much of the severe downturn in passengers since the pandemic took hold in January. Singapore barred the entry and transit of short-term visitors on 23 March. But the impact from those months still had a big impact, wiping out earlier gains built up over much of 2019. Profits plunged 36% to S$435m ($319m, Â£246m). For 2020 Changi was voted the world's best airport for an eighth consecutive year, according to rankings by UK-based analysts Skytrax. Last year, Changi Airport opened Jewel, a shopping and entertainment complex covering 1.5m square feet (14ha). It includes stores and attractions including a rainforest, hedge maze and the world's highest indoor waterfall. This new complex has helped cushion the blow from the downturn in visitors, boosting revenue 2.6% to S$3.1bn. ""Jewel is a new icon for Singapore and has redefined what it means to be an airport,"" Changi Airport Group added. But the group still paints a grim picture of the international travel hub and says the recovery is ""highly dependent on how countries around the world manage border controls, the relaxation of air travel requirements and the development of viable medical treatments for the virus."" Last week, US airlines began laying off thousands of workers after efforts to negotiate a new economic relief plan in Congress stalled. And this month the aviation trade body, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), downgraded its 2020 traffic forecasts, after ""a dismal end to the summer travel season"". The IATA estimates that it will be at least 2024 before air traffic reaches pre-pandemic levels.

"How do pandemics normally end?Find out how previous health crises ended, giving us clues as to how our future may unfold."," We are in the grip of a pandemic like none other in living memory. While people are pinning their hopes on a vaccine to wipe it out, the fact is most of the infections faced by our ancestors are still with us. Scroll down ↓ to find out how some of those pandemics came to an end, giving us clues as to how our future may unfold. This is Jasmine. Just like us, her ancestors survived a number of pandemics.  Take a journey back in time to see what diseases they faced. Back in the Dark Ages, about 60 generations ago, Jasmine's relatives lived through a series of outbreaks of the bubonic plague. The disease, caused by bacteria transmitted by fleas on rats and via respiratory droplets from infected people, was devastating. It killed hundreds of millions of people over a period of 2,000 years. The Black Death of 1346-1353 is considered the deadliest outbreak of all. It is believed the disease, which causes swollen and infected lymph nodes, called buboes, was finally brought under control by strict quarantining and improved sanitation, among other things. But none of this could have happened without an understanding of how transmission occurred, says Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London. This is something that still applies today. ""Once you have the knowledge, and you share the knowledge, then you are able to take measures to push transmission much lower,"" he says. Yet cases of the plague still occur - for example, in Inner Mongolia in July this year - and, in theory, Jasmine could still catch it. Numbers are low though, and the disease can now be successfully treated with antibiotics. Hundreds of years later, Jasmine's ancestors faced the spectre of smallpox. The disease, caused by the virus variola minor, is one of the deadliest known to humans. It caused fluid-filled pustules to develop all over the body and at its height, about three out of every 10 people with the disease died. It could be spread via droplets from an infected person's nose or mouth or via their sores. Like the plague, smallpox killed hundreds of millions of people - 300 million in the 20th Century alone. But, thanks to a vaccine developed in 1796 by British doctor Edward Jenner and the efforts of the scientific community, the disease has been completely erased - although it took nearly two centuries to do so. Smallpox remains the only human disease to have been eradicated this way. Prof Riley regards this feat as one of the greatest achievements of mankind - rivalling the Moon landings. ""It could be seen as the greatest return on a public investment ever,"" he says, referencing the annual savings the world has enjoyed thanks to the absence of the disease. Because of this achievement of science, we, and Jasmine, are no longer at risk. Then, just eight generations ago, Jasmine's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents faced the threat of cholera. The disease, caused by contaminated food or drinking water, has killed millions of people in seven pandemics, according to the World Health Organization. But while improved hygiene and sanitation in the West has removed the threat of the disease, it remains endemic - or common -  in many low-income countries and kills between 100,000 and 140,000 people every year, according to the WHO. ""You plumb your way out of cholera,"" says Prof Riley. ""If the plumbing goes wrong, it can spread very quickly."" Because of this, depending on where Jasmine calls home, she could still be at risk of catching it and dying, despite the availability of a vaccine and the disease's easy treatment. Jasmine's family would also have lived through a number of flu pandemics. The biggest recorded was in the early 20th century, around the time of her great-great grandparents. The 1918 Influenza pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Spanish flu, was the most severe outbreak in recent history, killing 50-100 million people worldwide. Much like with the new coronavirus today, isolation and quarantine slowed transmission. After two waves between 1918 and 1920, that particular H1N1 strain of flu faded away to become a more benign version that still circulates every year. But other flu pandemics followed. The Hong Kong flu of 1968 killed one million people and also still circulates as a seasonal flu. As does Swine Flu - a version of the H1N1 virus - which infected about 21% of the world's population in 2009. Flu continues to pose ""a pandemic threat"", says Prof Riley, and Jasmine, and us, remain at risk of experiencing another pandemic caused by such viruses. We are also at risk of catching seasonal flu, which continues to kill hundreds of thousands every year. Then, about four decades ago, Jasmine's parents lived through the spread of HIV/Aids - regarded by some as a pandemic but described as a ""global epidemic"" by the WHO. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) - transmitted through bodily fluids - has claimed more than 32 million lives across the globe so far. HIV could be regarded as an ""worst case scenario virus"", says Prof Riley, because of the length of time it takes to develop symptoms and its high fatality rate. It spreads fast because people don't necessarily know they have it. However, advances in diagnostic techniques and global public health campaigns - which have changed sexual behaviour and increased the availability of safe injections for drug users - have helped slow the growth in infections. Despite this, an estimated 690,000 people died from Aids in 2019, according to WHO figures. Although there is no cure for HIV, if Jasmine lived in a country with good healthcare and access to antiretroviral drugs, she could now lead a long and healthy life. However, if she lived in a low-income country and did not have such provision, she may well still be at risk. Two and three decades later - during Jasmine's own lifetime - came the threat of Sars and Mers. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) - the first deadly epidemic caused by a coronavirus - killed more than 800 between 2002 and 2003, according to the WHO. But by late July 2003, no new cases were being reported, and the WHO declared the global outbreak to be over. A little later came Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), also a coronavirus, which has killed 912 people. Most cases have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula. While the risk of contracting the virus, known as Mers-CoV, in the UK, for example, is regarded as very low, it remains higher in the Middle East - with humans usually infected by camels. As such, while Jasmine could still catch Mers, the risk is low in most countries. Now, in Jasmine's and our lifetimes, we are facing the spectre of the new Sars coronavirus, which triggers the respiratory disease Covid-19. Sars-Cov-2, as it is known, is an evolved version of the 2003 Sars virus and is regarded by disease specialists as unique, thanks to its range of symptoms - from none to deadly - and high levels of transmission by people without symptoms or before they develop them. ""Because of that, many populations have not been able to control it,"" says Prof Riley. More than a million people have died with the virus so far - but the overall toll is likely to become much higher. While the hunt for a vaccine and effective treatments continues, the risk remains real for the vast majority of the global population. Jasmine, like us, is still at risk. So the coronavirus now circulating in our communities is just the latest in a long line of pandemics caused by emerging pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. Increased knowledge about transmission, public health campaigns, new treatments and vaccines have all played their part in bringing previous crises to an end. The end-game for the current pandemic is also likely to come from a combination of similar measures. Although a ""safe, highly-effective"" vaccine could bring about its conclusion, says Prof Riley, finding one is ""by no means a given"". Instead, we may have to get better at living with it while developing a level of resistance to the disease. ""Definitely by five years, hopefully much sooner, we'll either have a really good vaccine that is being used throughout the world or we'll have muddled on long enough that we've accumulated enough immunity and learned how to live with small resurgent outbreaks,"" he says. And as the eradication of smallpox proved, when the world's scientific community comes together, great things are possible. Although the new coronavirus is a much trickier challenge, because of its high levels of asymptomatic transmission, Prof Riley is optimistic the ""incredible"" global quest for a solution will win through. ""The world has never had a shared project like this before,"" he says. ""Hopefully it becomes a shared success at some point."" However, it may serve us well to remember that most of the pathogens that rampaged through societies in pandemics in the past are still around. While the crises ended, the viruses and bacteria - and their resulting infections - remain.
