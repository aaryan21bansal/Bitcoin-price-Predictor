Malta airlifts newborn from migrant ship,"The baby was taken to hospital in Malta after being born three days earlier on a beach in Libya Malta has airlifted a newborn and his mother from a Spanish migrant rescue ship and rejected accusations that it had refused food to more than 300 other migrants on board. The baby was born three days earlier on a beach in Libya and his life was in danger, the Proactiva charity said. Proactiva's boat was refused entry to Malta and Italy, while France, Tunisia and Libya did not respond to requests. Malta said crew had told officials they had enough provisions for two days. Why are people angry at UN plan for migrants? 'Horrific experiences' on crossing to Europe A Maltese spokesman said the airlift had gone beyond Malta's legal obligations, as the migrants were rescued on Friday in waters supervised by Libya. Earlier the charity posted on Instagram that the 311 migrants - including pregnant women, children and babies - had been rescued from ""certain death at sea"" and saidMalta had refused to provide food,external, adding ""this isn't Christmas"". The baby and his mother were airlifted off the rescue boat Meanwhile Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, from the far-right Lega party, tweeted that ""Italian ports are closed"" and the migrants would not be allowed to land. He also tweeted a picture of his lunch,externaland said he had eaten well, prompting an angry response from Proactiva's founder Oscar Camps, who saidfuture generations would be ""ashamed"" of him,external. Proactiva says its vessel is now heading towards the port of Algeciras in southern Spain, where the migrants can disembark. A Spanish government statement said the vessel had been allowed to head to Spain ""due to the refusal or lack of response from the nearest ports"". The journey will take five or six days but another Proactiva vessel is on its way with more supplies. Meanwhile, a German NGO, Sea-Watch, said it had rescued 33 migrants at sea and was appealing for a port where they could disembark. Allow Twitter content?

Actor will not play LGBT roles again,"Darren Criss says he will no longer accept LGBT scripts because he doesn't want to deprive gay actors of roles. The actor, who is straight, is well-known for playing the gay character of Andrew Cunanan in American Crime Story: The Assassination Of Gianni Versace. ""I want to make sure I won't be another straight boy taking a gay man's role,""he told Bustle magazine,external. He said it's been ""a joy"" acting in gay roles but no longer feels comfortable doing so, which is ""unfortunate"". Previous to American Crime Story, he was mostly known for his portrayal of gay pupil Blaine Anderson in Glee. Darren Criss won a Primetime Emmy award for his portrayal of serial killer Andrew Cunanan ""There are certain roles that I'll see that are just wonderful,"" he explained. ""But I want to make sure I won't be another straight boy taking a gay man's role."" The debate over who has a right to play certain characters was reignited earlier this yearwhen Scarlett Johanssondropped out of playing a transgender character following a backlash. Sir Ian McKellen is among those critical of Hollywood's attitude to gay actors. No openly gay man has ever won the Academy Award for best actor, while straight actors have taken home the prize for playing LGBT roles. Tom Hanks won it for Philadelphia in 1993, while Sean Penn scooped it for Milk in 2009. In total, 52 straight people have been Oscar-nominated for playing gay characters.

Morocco vigils for murdered Scandinavians,"Vigils were held in Rabat, Marrakesh and the village of Imlil, where the murdered tourists were found Hundreds of Moroccans have attended a vigil in the capital Rabat for two Scandinavian tourists found murdered in the Atlas mountains on Monday. Holding signs saying ""sorry"", they gathered to remember Maren Ueland, 28, and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, at the embassies of Norway and Denmark. On Friday Norwegian police said a video appearing to show one of the tourists being beheaded was likely to be real. Four suspects aged between 25 and 33 have been arrested. They pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a video made last week, police said. In the video, they said the murders were revenge for events in Syria. Nine more arrests were made on Thursday and Friday for suspected links to the perpetrators, Moroccan officials said. Many participants came with signs saying ""sorry"" In Rabat a minute's silence was held with Danish and Norwegian diplomats present. Hundreds more people attended a vigil in the southern village of Imlil, near where the women's bodies were found, and flowers were also laid in the city of Marrakesh. Ms Jespersen, who was 24 and from Denmark, and 28-year-old Norwegian Ms Ueland had been studying outdoor activities at the University of Southeastern Norway. Maren Ueland, left, and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen were found dead in a popular tourist area They had arrived on a month-long holiday in Morocco on 9 December and had travelled to the foothills of Mount Toubkal, North Africa's highest peak, 10km (6 miles) from Imlil. Their bodies were found in their tent. Both women had taken full precautions ahead of their trip, Maren Ueland's mother said.

US envoy quits over Trump Syria pullout,"Mr McGurk (L) had previously said the US should retain a presence in Syria A top US official in the fight against so-called Islamic State group has quit over President Donald Trump's decision to pull troops from Syria. Brett McGurk, the US special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat IS, brought his departure forward from February. Before Mr Trump's announcement he had insisted that the US would continue working against IS in Syria. Mr Trump described Mr McGurk's resignation as a ""nothing event"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr McGurk's decision to quit follows the resignation of Defence Secretary Jim Mattis on Thursday. Gen Mattis had also opposed withdrawing troops from Syria as well as reducing the US presence in Afghanistan. Trump rewrites US Syria policy After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Who are the Kurds? Mr McGurk, 45, is an experienced diplomat who was appointed to his current role in 2015 under the Obama administration. In early December he told reporters: ""We want to stay on the ground and make sure that stability can be maintained in these areas."" He went on to say: ""It would be reckless if we were just to say, well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now. I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that."" In his resignation letter, seen by AP news agency,Mr McGurk said that IS militants in Syria were on the run but not yet defeated,external. He said that withdrawing US forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to IS. In an email to staff quoted by the New York Times, he said Mr Trump's decision to pull out troops ""came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy"". It ""left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered"", he said. ""I ultimately concludedI could not carry out these new instructions and maintain my integrity,external,"" he went on to say. Mr Trump announced his decision to withdraw some 2,000 US troops from Syria on Wednesday, asserting that IS had been defeated. On Saturday, he continued to insist that the decision to pull out was the right one and that, now that IS was defeated on the ground, other players could take care of the situation.

However, important allies including senior Republicans and foreign powers have disputed the claim and say the move could lead to a resurgence of IS. A Kurdish-led alliance, the Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) has also warned that IS could recover. US troops have helped rid much of Syria's north-east of the jihadist group, but pockets of fighters remain. A recent US report said there were still as many as 14,000 IS militants in Syria,externaland even more in neighbouring Iraq. US ground troops first became involved in Syria in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise local Kurdish fighters who were fighting IS. The US did this reluctantly after several attempts at arming anti-IS groups had descended into chaos. Over the intervening years the numbers of US troops in Syria increased, standing today at some 2,000, though some estimates place the number perhaps even higher. A network of bases and airstrips has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country. The US has also been part of an international coalition conducting air strikes against IS and other militants. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State?

Tough task as US shutdown talks drag on,"Republican Mitch McConnell arrives at Congress. Most people are in the dark A partial US government shutdown is set to continue through Christmas with no deal in sight to break the impasse over budget spending. The Senate, which must pass a deal, has now adjourned until Thursday. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump will stay on in Washington for the festive period, cancelling holidays in Florida. The shutdown began at midnight on Friday after Democrats resisted Mr Trump's demands for $5bn (Â£4bn) for his Mexico border wall. Mr Trump warned there could be ""a long stay"" in the talks and Democrats told him: ""You must abandon the wall."" Vice-President Mike Pence stressed that negotiators were still talking. Five big things from Trumpâs head-spinning week Nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice began partially shutting down after funding for them lapsed at midnight (05:00GMT Saturday). Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to work unpaid or are furloughed, a kind of temporary leave. This is the third time US federal funding has lapsed so far this year, although the other two were brief. The Senate held a rare Saturday session but it was not long before it adjourned. Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said the ""pause button"" had been pushed and that there would be no new Senate vote until he had a signature from the president - and agreement from the Democrats - on a budget deal. The green light for government appears a way off yet Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a budget bill that had passed the Republican-controlled House on Thursday approving $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) of funding for the wall would ""never pass the Senate, not today, not next week, not next year"". He added: ""So Mr President, if you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall, plain and simple. ""The Senate is not interested in swindling American taxpayers for an unnecessary, ineffective and wasteful policy."" In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump said ""we are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed border security"" but the talks ""could be a long stay"". He again defended the wall, saying ""the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall. Let the work begin!"" One White House official said the administration hoped the shutdown would last only a few days but it could be longer. Some Republican lawmakers still hope there can be a deal, perhaps involving less money for the wall. On Wednesday, a bilateral deal appeared to have been agreed in the Senate to keep federal agencies open until 8 February. But the agreement did not include funding for the wall. This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" Mr Trump then dug his heels in over the issue after criticism from conservative talk show hosts and other allies, and insisted that funds for the wall must be included for him to sign the budget off. The House then passed a bill with such funding, with Mr Trump well aware the Democrats will be taking control of the legislature in January and wall funding will stall. But Mr Trump does not have the 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate he needs to get the House budget passed. He earlier suggested that Mr McConnell should invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"" to break the impasse. That would mean the bill could be approved in the Senate with a simple majority. But Mr McConnell has repeatedly refused in the past to invoke such an extreme manoeuvre. About 380,000 government employees will be made to take temporary, unpaid leave. Meanwhile, 420,000 employees working in essential roles - considered necessary for the ""protection of life and property"" - will keep working, without being paid. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug Administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected. Martin Ely, 54, a tax officer in Arizona, is affected by the shutdown and says he's frustrated with the politicians. ""I would like them not to use us a bargaining chip. ""I was last paid a week ago and hopefully should still be paid on 30 December for this week just gone, but anything after that will definitely be affected by the shutdown. ""I have been an IRS employee for around nine years, and I was furloughed during the 2013 shutdown that lasted from October 1-17. Being furloughed is never a pleasant experience. Having to live on savings and/or credit while waiting for back pay, which must be approved by Congress, is tremendously stressful. ""During the 2013 shutdown, I spent the entire time glued to the TV watching the news and waiting to be called back to work. Many of my co-workers did the same. We can't travel far or plan a vacation during a shutdown because we usually only get a day's notice or less to report back to work. So it's no holiday, especially during the Holidays."" A strengthened southern border wall was a key election promise from Mr Trump. On Friday he shared a graphic of his steel-slat design for the wall. Allow Twitter content?

Later, he posted a video regarding the immigration row, where he said it was ""very dangerous out there"".

Who is going to pay for the wall? Six things that could topple the border wall Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US During his campaign he insisted he would make Mexico pay for the wall, but the country has refused.

Scattered 'yellow-vest' protests in France,"This video can not be played Yellow Vests: Why Macron's concessions aren't enough for some Small demonstrations by ""yellow-vest"" protesters have been seen throughout France for a sixth consecutive Saturday, but not on the scale of the ones seen in recent weeks. About 2,000 people were demonstrating in Paris at around 16:00 (15:00 GMT), compared to about 4,000 last Saturday, police sources said. Some 142 people have been arrested, including a protest leader, police say. A man died in southern France, bringing the protests' overall death toll to 10. His car hit a truck at a roadblock near Perpignan overnight on Friday, the authorities said on Saturday. Protests have been dwindling sincePresident Emmanuel Macron offered tax and salary concessions to the protesters earlier this month. The gilets jaunes Macron promises divide protest leaders Are the Yellow Vests spreading beyond France? More than 38,000 demonstrators were protesting at 18:00 throughout the country compared with 66,000 last Saturday, the interior ministry said. There were some violent clashes on the Champs-ElysÃ©es in Paris as night fell, and 142 people were stopped and 16 detained, including a yellow-vest leader, Eric Drouet, Paris police said. Despite this, traffic was normal and most shops, except for some luxury boutiques, were open for business in the run-up to Christmas. French stores reported an average drop-off of 25% in sales compared with the same period a year earlier, junior economy minister AgnÃ¨s Pannier-Runacher told French TV. The palace of Versailles outside Paris and its gardens were closed as the authorities prepared for possible unrest there. Instead, protesters gathered in the Montmartre area of northern Paris for a small-scale demonstration. Hundreds of ""yellow vests"" briefly blocked trucks near the French-Spanish border There were other small-scale protests in the rest of the country, with hundreds of yellow vests briefly blocking trucks near the French-Spanish border before being dispersed by police. Roadblocks were also reported in northern France near the border with Belgium. Further demonstrations were planned around the country - though the movement seemed to be losing impetus in the run-up to Christmas. Police fired tear-gas in the northern resort of Le Touquet to keep a crowd away from a house there owned by Mr Macron and his wife, Brigitte. France's interior ministry said only 3,680 yellow vests had been counted on Thursday on the many traffic filtering points that have been appearing throughout the country since the beginning of the protests, their lowest number so far. This video can not be played Yellow vests: Is the symbol spreading across Europe? The ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protesters - named after the high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their cars - began in mid-November against fuel tax increases and later widened to include the liberal economic reform policies of President Macron. They were initially protesting against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. Mr Macron had said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. Mr Macron responded by scrapping an unpopular fuel tax rise, and promising an extra â¬100 (Â£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners. On Friday evening, the French Senate approved the measures which should come into force early next year. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 injured - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 injured - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 injured - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 injured - 1,220 in custody 15 December:66,000 protesters - 7 injured (in Paris) - 115 in custody (in Paris) French 'yellow vests' in defiant protests Euro falls as French protests hit economy 'Yellow vests' beyond France?

Remainers criticise Corbyn's Brexit pledge,"Remain supporters have criticised Jeremy Corbyn for saying he would continue to pursue Brexit if his party won a snap general election in 2019. Speaking to the Guardian,external, the Labour leader said he would go to Brussels to negotiate a better deal than the one Theresa May has offered to Parliament. Asked what stance Labour would take if another referendum took place, he said it would be for the party to decide. Labour's Chuka Umunna said the interview was ""deeply depressing"". Mr Corbyn also admitted he was ""extremely angry"" during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, but has denied calling Theresa May a ""stupid woman"". Ministers suggest rival Brexit 'Plan Bs' Corbyn denies 'stupid woman' jibe Gauke doubts PM would back no-deal Brexit Brexit: All you need to know The Labour leader has repeatedly called for a general election to solve the deadlock in the Commons over the prime minister's Brexit deal, which many MPs on all sides of the House have vowed to vote down. He told the paper the earliest an election could take place is February - as a month needs to pass after a government has resigned before a vote can take place. But if Labour won, he said he would still want to pursue Brexit, and try to get a deal agreed before 29 March 2019 - the day the UK is set to leave the EU. ""You'd have to go back, and negotiate, and see what the timetable would be,"" he said. A number of Mr Corbyn's own MPs back a ""People's Vote"" to ask the public their opinion of the deal. But asked if he could see such a referendum taking place, he offered no support, saying: ""I think we should vote down this deal; we should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union."" When questioned over the stance Labour would take were a referendum to take place, he said: ""It would be a matter for the party to decide what the policy would be. ""But my proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners."" MPs from all sides of the House, including Conservative Anna Soubry (pictured), have called for a ""People's Vote"" Writing on Facebook, former minister Mr Umunna - a leading member of the cross-party People's Vote for a second EU referendum - said his leader's comments were ""disappointing"". He wrote: ""Brexit is essentially a project of the hard right of British politics who want to turn Britain into a lightly regulated, offshore tax haven for the super rich, devoid of proper protections for workers, and one which seeks to dump the blame for the UK's problems on immigrants. ""Labour should stop pretending there is a 'good' Brexit deal and we should certainly not be sponsoring this project because Brexit is the problem - it solves nothing."" Fellow Labour MP Wes Streeting also criticised Mr Corbyn's remarks, saying: ""Why peddle this myth that Labour would be able to renegotiate a Brexit deal at this 11th hour? How would Labour's Brexit be any better than remaining in the EU? ""Our members and voters are overwhelmingly pro-European. This lets them, and our country, down."" And Luciana Berger said her party would never be forgiven if it facilitated Brexit. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas backs another referendum Rival parties, who want to remain in the EU, also attacked Mr Corbyn's comments, with the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling the Labour leader ""the midwife to the delivery of the Tory's Brexit plans"". Lib Dem leader Vince Cable said Mr Corbyn ""refuses once again to take the blinkers off"", adding: ""On Brexit, you simply cannot put a cigarette paper between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn."" And Caroline Lucas of the Green Party said it made the case for a People's Vote even stronger if this was the direction Labour would take.

Osborne: Tories facing period of opposition,"Former chancellor and Remain campaigner George Osborne now edits the Evening Standard newspaper The Conservative Party is heading towards a ""prolonged period"" in opposition unless it adapts to modern Britain, George Osborne has said. The former chancellor, who was sacked by Theresa May in 2016, said the party needed to become more socially-liberal and pro-business to survive in power. The ex-frontbencher, who now edits the Evening Standard newspaper, campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum. He added he believes a general election could be likely in 2019. Mr Osborne was interviewed by David Dimbleby, who is guest-editing BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday. He was former prime minister's David Cameron's closest ally in government and served as his chancellor for the whole six years Mr Cameron was prime minister - from 2010 to 2016. George Osborne and ex-PM David Cameron, who called the EU referendum, were close political allies and remain friends In the interview, Mr Osborne said that if he was still a member of government he would ""essentially try and steer the country away from the rocks to which it is heading"". Mr Osborne added he would also attempt to move the party ""away from a prolonged period of opposition, which is where I think it's heading, unless it engages with modern Britain and adopts the essentially socially-liberal, pro-business, internationalist approach which I think is the right one for the country"". Osborne: Mistakes led to EU leave vote George Osborne takes on another job Osborne and Blair: 'Gap in centre politics' The Remainer also told Mr Dimbleby the calls for a no-deal Brexit were ""reckless"" and he believes another referendum or general election is possible next year. ""In my view, a general election is at the moment an under-reported likelihood for 2019 because in the British system the simplest way to resolve political impasses is to return to the public at a general election,"" he said. ""There is a way of course for the government to avoid that and they are terrified of an election - they can themselves embrace a referendum. ""And that is clearly under discussion in Downing Street even though it's denied."" He said that if there was another referendum, he would urge people to vote to reverse the Brexit decision. ""It's not that you say to people, look, two years ago you made the wrong decision, you were stupid. ""It's that in the two years since we've learnt a lot more about what's involved in leaving the European Union, we've learnt a great deal more about what's on offer outside the European Union."" Mr Osborne, who Theresa May dropped from her top team when she took over as prime minister in July 2016, said he has known her for 20 years and called her ""a person of integrity and intelligence"". But he criticised her for mistakes he believes the government has made in the Brexit negotiating process. ""I think the mistake the government made - led by Theresa May - from the start was to try and claim that a country that had voted 17 million to leave the EU, 16 million to stay, wanted a 100% Brexit. Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: All you need to know ""I think she should have started where she has tried to end up, which is a more conciliatory partnership with the European Union, or associate membership. ""I think that was essentially a massive mistake by the Conservative administration - which it was punished for at the general election - because the Conservative Party decided to embrace the Brexit result in such a way as to essentially dismiss the views of those who had voted remain, treat them as saboteurs or traitors and run against urban Britain."" Mr Osbornehas previously spokenabout how he admitted having ""regrets"" about his time in office and ""mistakes that led to Brexit"". This video can not be played George Osborne: We did get things wrong He said that he was not in favour of an EU referendum but supported his ""close friend"" Mr Cameron's decision to hold one. David Dimbleby is the first of several public figures to take turns editing the Today programme over the festive period. Actress Angelina Jolie, who is a special envoy to the UN Refugee Agency, will take over editor duties on Today on 28 December.

Backflip FBI agent avoids jail term,"This video can not be played The FBI agent was performing a backflip A former FBI agent who accidentally shot a man while performing a backflip in a Denver bar has avoided jail after agreeing to a plea deal. Chase Bishop, 30, admitted third-degree assault and was sentenced to two years unsupervised probation. Bishop was off-duty when he was filmed dropping his gun while dancing last June. As he picked the weapon up it went off. Video of the incident went viral on social media and led to his arrest. ""We believe that this agreement strikes an appropriate balance of seeking justice for the victim and ensuring that this type of incident does not happen again,"" District Attorney Beth McCann said in a statement. The statement added that Bishop was no longer employed by the FBI. The victim, Thomas Reddington, is still recovering from a severed artery in his lower leg, his lawyer Bill Marlin told Reuters news agency. He said Mr Reddington was satisfied with the plea deal, adding: ""His concern was about Bishop's conduct and his behaviour after the shooting."" Video of Chase Bishop's dance moves that ended in the accidental shooting went viral Mr Reddington said on Friday he held ""no personal grudge against Mr Bishop"". ""I've done stupid things at bars to impress girls, too,"" he said, quoted by the Denver Post. The FBI has not commented on the sentencing. Last month, Bishop pleaded not guilty to a more serious second-degree assault charge. He told the court on Friday that his goal in life was to ""care, protect and serve people"", the Post reported. ""I never expected the result of my actions to lead to something like this,"" he added. Bishop, who was based in Washington DC, was on holiday when he was filmed at Mile High Spirits, a distillery and dance club in Denver. Video showed him dancing in a circle of people. A gun falls from his waistband while he does a backflip, and goes off as he picks it up from the floor. Bishop then walks quickly off the dancefloor.

Local pair quizzed over Gatwick drones,"Police are searching a house in Crawley in connection with the drone sightings A 47-year-old man and 54-year-old woman from Crawley are being questioned over multiple drone sightings that brought Gatwick Airport to a standstill. Flights were grounded for more than 36 hours when drones were first spotted close to the runway on Wednesday night. The airport has since reopened and flights were operating on schedule, but there were still long queues and some knock-on delays, a spokesman said. Police are searching a house in Crawley and the pair remain in custody. They were arrested on Friday evening and were being questioned on suspicion of disrupting civil aviation ""to endanger or likely to endanger safety of operations or persons"", Sussex Police said. The airport was forced to shut its runway for spells on Wednesday and Friday and for all of Thursday The force said it was deploying ""a range of tactics"" to prevent further incursions from drones following the arrests. Strategies were in place in case any further unmanned aircraft were seen inside the airport perimeter, it added. Supt James Collis said: ""We continue to urge the public, passengers and the wider community around Gatwick to be vigilant and support us by contacting us immediately if they believe they have any information that can help us in bringing those responsible to justice."" The airport said it aimed to run ""a full schedule"" of 757 flights on Saturday, carrying 124,484 passengers. Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones 'Desperately trying to get back' How can a drone cause so much chaos? A Gatwick spokesman said: ""Many people will be due to fly today and there will be longer delays perhaps. ""But broadly things are going in the right direction. By the end of the weekend, things should be back to normal."" The Shorrock family, from Oxford, arrived at the airport to fly to Innsbruck in the Austrian Alps for a skiing trip. Vivienne Shorrock said she was ""relieved"" to have avoided the disruption. ""Some people have suffered real losses by not getting where they want to go to be with family,"" she said. Her husband David joked the drama was a ""nice distraction from Brexit"". Passengers have been warned about some knock-on delays Passengers have been warned to expect some delays and cancellations and were advised to check with their airline before travelling to the airport. About 1,000 aircraft were either cancelled or diverted and about 140,000 passengers were disrupted during three days of disruption. The airport was forced to shut its runway for spells on Wednesday and Friday and for all of Thursday. The drones were first spotted at about 21:00 GMT on Wednesday. Every time the airport sought to reopen the runway on Thursday, the drones returned. Passengers queue for flights as the airport and airlines work to clear the backlog Authorities finally regained control over the airfield after the Army deployed unidentified military technology to guard the area, reassuring the airport that it was safe enough to fly from about 06:00 on Friday. The Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can detect drones using radar, is believed to have been used. It can jam communications between the drone and its operator, enabling authorities to take control of and land the device. But John Murray, professor of robotics and autonomous systems at the University of Hull, told the BBC the problem with this system was ""you can find the drone but not the person operating it"". ""You can take the drone out of the sky but you won't capture the person and that's what you want to do. ""You can get a second-hand drone for between Â£200 and Â£300 so if you take it down, they can just go out and buy another one,"" he said. No group has claimed responsibility for the disruption. The drones caused misery for travellers, with many sleeping on the airport floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings. Thousands of passengers returning to the UK were either stranded abroad or diverted to other UK airports. A handful of flights due to arrive into Gatwick on Saturday were cancelled, according to the airport's website, including an easyJet service from Milan-Linate and a TUI flight from Bridgetown, Barbados. A Gatwick spokesman said: ""Safety is Gatwick's top priority and we are grateful for passengers' continued patience as we work to get them to their final destination in time for Christmas.""

Obituary: Paddy Ashdown,"Paddy Ashdown was the action man of British politics. A former Royal Marine officer, he was the first elected leader of the Liberal Democrats, a party then badly in need of some military-style discipline. He led his party to its best election result for half a century but his combative style of leadership did not always sit easily with some activists. His mixture of military and diplomatic experience meant he was well-suited for the role he later undertook in the former Yugoslavia. Jeremy John Durham Ashdown was born in Delhi, India, on 27 February 1941, into an Irish family with a long record of service in the administration of the sub-continent. He boasted Irish nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell among his ancestors. His father was an officer in the Indian Army who later faced a court martial for refusing to abandon his troops during the retreat to Dunkirk. The charges were eventually thrown out. One of his earliest memories was seeing dead bodies in the streets, the result of conflict between Hindus and Muslims. He saw active service with the Royal Marines in the Far East and Persian Gulf The young Ashdown spent his childhood years on a farm his father had purchased in County Down, Northern Ireland, before attending Bedford School, in England, where his Irish brogue led to the nickname Paddy. He did not always find school easy, with one report describing him as vain and a poor team-player. There was a sexual relationship with a female maths teacher which he described in his memoir, A Fortunate Life, as ""a rite of passage"". He quit before taking his A-levels and joined the Royal Marines in 1959. Ashdown saw active service in Borneo and the Persian Gulf before joining the elite Special Boat Service, the seagoing equivalent of the SAS. In 1967, he went to Hong Kong where he learned Mandarin and qualified as an interpreter, before returning to Northern Ireland where he commanded a commando company in Belfast at a time when the Troubles were raging. Ashdown quit the Royal Marines in 1972 and joined the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) where he worked with diplomatic cover in Geneva liaising with a number of United Nations departments. Although he was a Labour supporter he had shown little interest in politics so there was surprise when he decided to quit his comfortable life in Switzerland and become an active member of the Liberal party. He finally won Yeovil in 1983 ""Most of my friends thought I was utterly bonkers,"" he later recalled, claiming he made the decision after being horrified at the state of the UK following the period of industrial unrest and fuel shortages in the mid-70s. In 1976, he was selected as the Liberal candidate in his wife's home constituency of Yeovil which had been held by right-wing Tory MP John Peyton for more than two decades. With what became a trademark energetic campaigning style, he set out to squeeze the Labour vote and, in the 1979 general election, took his party to second place, although still more than 10,000 votes behind Peyton. Having given up a lucrative post with the foreign office, Ashdown took a job with a subsidiary of the Westland Helicopter company, based in Yeovil. He then moved on to work with Tescan, a processor of sheepskins, but found himself out of work when the firm closed in 1981. As the personnel manager, he had to make his team redundant, something he described as ""the worst day of my life"". He was on the dole for six months before obtaining a job as a youth worker with Dorset County Council. His continuing campaigning in Yeovil paid off in the 1983 election when John Peyton decided to stand down; he won the seat with just over 50% of the popular vote. He joined Neil Kinnock on a picket line at GCHQ It was the era of the SDP-Liberal Alliance and Ashdown quickly found himself appointed as the Liberal spokesman on trade and industry. He was a prominent campaigner against the stationing of American cruise missiles on British soil, describing them as ""the weapon we have to stop"". Ashdown also spoke out against Margaret Thatcher's decision to allow the US to use bases in Britain to bomb Libya and was one of the harshest critics of the government's decision to ban workers at GCHQ from being members of a trade union. He had become a popular figure in Yeovil, where he increased his majority over the Conservatives in 1987. He had gained a reputation as someone not afraid to speak his mind, but who did not suffer fools gladly. In 1988, the SDP and Liberal Party formally merged as the Social and Liberal Democrats, later shortened to the Liberal Democrats. When former Liberal leader David Steel declined to stand for the leadership of the new party, Ashdown comfortably saw off Alan Beith, the only other candidate. He inherited a party licking its wounds after the arguments that had accompanied its formation and leading figures from both the Liberal and SDP camps walking away in protest at the merger. He comfortably won the ballot to become leader of the Liberal Democrats Ashdown threw himself into getting his party into shape for the 1992 election and it was to his credit that, despite all the problems, the new party suffered a net loss of just two seats. His career, and his marriage, also survived press revelations of an affair with his secretary, five years previously, leading to one Sun headline dubbing him Paddy Pantsdown. A year later, Ashdown began negotiations with Labour leader John Smith over closer co-operation between the two parties. After Smith's death, he continued the talks with Tony Blair.  It was the end of his party's historic stance of ""equidistance"" between Conservatives and Labour. He developed a close rapport with Blair. One colleague said the two of them would ""sit at the cabinet table and fix their gaze on each other - they worked exceptionally closely together"". The relationship was remarkably candid with Ashdown once telling Blair that ""some folk think you are a smarmy git"". Despite early signs that Labour were on course to win the 1997 election, Ashdown still hoped that he could offer the support of the Liberal Democrats in return for Labour agreeing to voting reform. Although Blair was sympathetic, the Labour landslide of 1997 removed any need for Lib Dem support and the majority of Blair's new cabinet, sitting on a secure majority, were not in favour of moving to some form of PR. Ashdown was also disappointed that Blair refused to share the Lib Dem leader's enthusiasm for joining the euro. In the election, the Liberal Democrats increased their number of MPs from 18 to 46, as the Conservative vote crumbled. But it remained the third party in UK politics. Ashdown stood down as Lib Dem leader in 1999 and was replaced by Charles Kennedy. Two years later, he quit the Commons and entered the Lords as Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub Hamdon. Retirement was far from his mind and, in 2002, his military and diplomatic experience saw him appointed as High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina. He had been a continuing advocate of intervention in the strife that followed the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and he made a number of positive contributions to creating a stable framework of government. ""Bosnia is under my skin,"" he said. ""It's the place you cannot leave behind."" He appeared as a prosecution witness in the trial of the former Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, although his claim that he had watched Serbian shells falling on villages in Kosovo was disputed by the defence. He was considered for the post of UN representative to Afghanistan in 2008 after he had called for a high-level co-ordinator to lead the foreign mission to the country, but ruled himself out of contention. Lord Ashdown campaigned with then-leader Nick Clegg ahead of the 2015 general election He remained active in the Liberal Democrats. He often appeared as a pundit on radio and television and chaired the party's election campaign in 2015. Appearing on the BBC election results programme, he took issue with the Exit Poll which suggested the Lib Dems would end the night with 10 seats.  Ashdown promised to ""eat his hat"" if the Exit Poll proved right.  In the event, the party won just eight. Ashdown campaigned vigorously against Brexit and waved away sympathy after the diagnosis of bladder cancer.  ""I've fought a lot of battles in my life,"" he said. He was a politician of great drive and energy, although some complained that he was not the most subtle or diplomatic of figures. ""It's not my job to be popular,"" he said. ""I'm goal-driven, my job is to get results."" He relished the cut and thrust of political life and its potential for throwing up the unexpected. ""If you make a mistake you usually pay the price very quickly,"" he said. ""It is what makes it more exciting and more terrifying than active service.""

How can a drone cause such chaos?,"As drones become more popular, countries will need to consider regulations to restrict usage Gatwick Airport re-opened its runway on Friday morning after hundreds of flights were grounded due to a drones being spotted over the airfield on Wednesday and Thursday. So why has a drone caused so much disruption and what are the risks posed by these devices? The term ""drone"" for some prompts images of air strikes - but the sophisticated flying robots used on the battlefield are unlikely to be what we are talking about here. The vast majority of unmanned aerial vehicles are actually small, remote-controlled quadcopters used by hobbyists and photographers. These small devices are now a mainstream gadget, which can cost from under Â£40 to several thousands of pounds. Drones are also increasingly being used in industries such as construction and retail. Gatwick runway reopens after drone chaos In October 2017, a drone collided with a commercial aircraft in Canada, striking one of the plane's wings. The plane sustained minor damage but was able to land safely. Experts agree that a drone could damage an aircraft Research on drone damage to aircraft is still limited but a number of  institutions have tested a variety of impact scenarios and each seems to reach a different conclusion. Tests conducted at the University of Dayton,externalin the US mimicked a midair collision between a 2.1lb (1kg) quadcopter and a commercial aircraft travelling at 238mph (383km/h) and appeared to show it inflicting major damage. Other research from,externalthe Alliance for System Safety of Unmanned aircraft system through research Excellence (Assure) in conjunction with the US's Federal Aviation Authority suggested drones could inflict more damage than a bird collision and the lithium ion batteries that power them may not shatter upon impact, instead becoming lodged in airframes and posing a potential risk of fire. Ravi Vaidyanathan, a robotics lecturer at Imperial College, London, told the BBC: ""The threat posed to larger aircraft by drones is small but not negligible. ""The probability of a collision is small but a drone could be drawn into a turbine. ""A drone greater than 2kg might break the cockpit windshield as well for certain aircraft."" Martin Lanni, chief executive of airspace security company Quantum Aviation, said: ""A drone looks quite fragile but the battery is hefty and if you compare a drone  to a bird, then it could be potentially more dangerous if it goes through the engine or hits the fuselage."" According to the UK Airprox Board, there were 92 instances of aircraft and drones coming close to colliding in 2017. Fighting back against rogue drones Drones ground flights at Gatwick Drone collides with commercial aeroplane in Canada There were 92 instances of aircraft and drones coming close to colliding reported in 2017 In the UK, legislation came into force in July, making it illegal to fly a drone within 1km (0.62 miles) of an airport. It is also illegal to fly a drone higher than 400ft (120m). But experts have pointed out that this could be ineffective, given that a landing aircraft would fly below 400ft. And of course those with malicious intent would have little regard for legislation. Systems have been tested in some prisons, where drones are often used to smuggle in goods, which aim to block radio signals within a certain area in order to prevent drones from landing. For airports serious about protecting themselves from drone attacks, there is the option of a more sophisticated, if expensive, system, such as that offered by Quantum Aviation, which employs radar, radio frequency detectors and cameras to detect when drones are nearby and locate where they came from. ""In an ideal world, you talk to a person but to do that you need to know where the drones are coming from,"" said Mr Lanni. ""What you don't want is to have them dropping out of the sky."" The Quantum Aviation system can ""jam"" a drone - effectively stopping it working - the drone should, in theory, have a default mode that would see it either return to where it came from or land safely. DJI, the world leader in making civilian drones, introduced geo-fencing systems in its products in 2013. This technology can prevent drones from flying in some locations and offers warnings to drone operators flying near a restricted zone. The weighted net entangles the drone and brings it to the ground If jamming a drone or geo-fencing does not work, there are some more blunt instruments to bring down the devices. The French authorities have demonstrated how you can use a drone equipped with a net to catch another one, and there are several firms, including DroneDefence and OpenWorks Engineering which offer to fire a net to trap a rogue drone. Lasers are another option and both the US and China have experimented with anti-drone lasers, that can shoot down a drone within seconds of locating it. The weapon works by fixing a laser beam on the aircraft long enough to burn through it. Whatever happens in the case of the rogue drones at Gatwick, airports will now be forced to consider the issue more seriously, thinks Iain Gray, director of aerospace at Cranfield University. ""Airports are alive to the issues and want to work closely with academics to help shape the technology that is needed for the future,"" he told the BBC.

Tough task as US shutdown talks restart,"Republican Mitch McConnell arrives at Congress. Most people are in the dark A partial US government shutdown is set to continue through Christmas with no deal in sight to break the impasse over budget spending. The Senate, which must pass a deal, has now adjourned until Thursday. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump will stay on in Washington for the festive period, cancelling holidays in Florida. The shutdown began at midnight on Friday after Democrats resisted Mr Trump's demands for $5bn (Â£4bn) for his Mexico border wall. Mr Trump warned there could be ""a long stay"" in the talks and Democrats told him: ""You must abandon the wall."" Vice-President Mike Pence stressed that negotiators were still talking. Five big things from Trumpâs head-spinning week Nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice began partially shutting down after funding for them lapsed at midnight (05:00GMT Saturday). Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to work unpaid or are furloughed, a kind of temporary leave. This is the third time US federal funding has lapsed so far this year, although the other two were brief. The Senate held a rare Saturday session but it was not long before it adjourned. Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said the ""pause button"" had been pushed and that there would be no new Senate vote until he had a signature from the president - and agreement from the Democrats - on a budget deal. The green light for government appears a way off yet Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a budget bill that had passed the Republican-controlled House on Thursday approving $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) of funding for the wall would ""never pass the Senate, not today, not next week, not next year"". He added: ""So Mr President, if you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall, plain and simple. ""The Senate is not interested in swindling American taxpayers for an unnecessary, ineffective and wasteful policy."" In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump said ""we are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed border security"" but the talks ""could be a long stay"". He again defended the wall, saying ""the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall. Let the work begin!"" One White House official said the administration hoped the shutdown would last only a few days but it could be longer. Some Republican lawmakers still hope there can be a deal, perhaps involving less money for the wall. On Wednesday, a bilateral deal appeared to have been agreed in the Senate to keep federal agencies open until 8 February. But the agreement did not include funding for the wall. This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" Mr Trump then dug his heels in over the issue after criticism from conservative talk show hosts and other allies, and insisted that funds for the wall must be included for him to sign the budget off. The House then passed a bill with such funding, with Mr Trump well aware the Democrats will be taking control of the legislature in January and wall funding will stall. But Mr Trump does not have the 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate he needs to get the House budget passed. He earlier suggested that Mr McConnell should invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"" to break the impasse. That would mean the bill could be approved in the Senate with a simple majority. But Mr McConnell has repeatedly refused in the past to invoke such an extreme manoeuvre. About 380,000 government employees will be made to take temporary, unpaid leave. Meanwhile, 420,000 employees working in essential roles - considered necessary for the ""protection of life and property"" - will keep working, without being paid. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug Administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected. Martin Ely, 54, a tax officer in Arizona, is affected by the shutdown and says he's frustrated with the politicians. ""I would like them not to use us a bargaining chip. ""I was last paid a week ago and hopefully should still be paid on 30 December for this week just gone, but anything after that will definitely be affected by the shutdown. ""I have been an IRS employee for around nine years, and I was furloughed during the 2013 shutdown that lasted from October 1-17. Being furloughed is never a pleasant experience. Having to live on savings and/or credit while waiting for back pay, which must be approved by Congress, is tremendously stressful. ""During the 2013 shutdown, I spent the entire time glued to the TV watching the news and waiting to be called back to work. Many of my co-workers did the same. We can't travel far or plan a vacation during a shutdown because we usually only get a day's notice or less to report back to work. So it's no holiday, especially during the Holidays."" A strengthened southern border wall was a key election promise from Mr Trump. On Friday he shared a graphic of his steel-slat design for the wall. Allow Twitter content?

Later, he posted a video regarding the immigration row, where he said it was ""very dangerous out there"".

Who is going to pay for the wall? Six things that could topple the border wall Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US During his campaign he insisted he would make Mexico pay for the wall, but the country has refused.

Stowaways held after cargo ship rescueThe vessel had been sailing in circles in the Thames Estuary after the crew were threatened.Essex,"The Grande Tema was due to dock at Tilbury Four stowaways found on a cargo ship in the Thames Estuary have been detained after the vessel's crew was threatened. The Grande Tema's crew had to lock themselves in the vessel's bridge for safety, a spokesman said. Essex Police said the vessel was boarded and secured shortly after 23:00 GMT on Friday - almost 14 hours after the force was first called. Four men who were on the ship have been held under the Immigration Act, the force added. A police spokesman said they would be handed over to UK Border Force. The stowaways had demanded to be taken to the coast, according to the ship's owner. Police previously said the situation was not being treated as a hostage, piracy or terror-related issue. GPS trackers showed the 71,000-tonne ship sailing in circles in the Thames Estuary. It had set off from Lagos, Nigeria, on 10 December. It docked at Tilbury just before 04.30 GMT. Grimaldi Group, which owns the vessel, said the four stowaways were discovered on board four days ago. They were put under surveillance in a cabin but escaped earlier and made threats to the ship's master as the vessel approached Tilbury, urging him to get close to the coast. A map showing the Grande Tema in the Thames Estuary at 17:00 GMT Grimaldi spokesman Paul Kyprianou said: ""The vessel was coming from Nigeria and was bound to Tilbury and those four stowaways were in the cabin. ""Today they managed to escape from the cabin and they started threatening the crew, requesting the master of the vessel [navigate] very close to the coast. ""That request was probably because they wanted to jump and reach the British coast."" He said the crew had locked themselves in the command area of the vessel. Mr Kyprianou added: ""It's a small group but obviously you can understand it would be scary.""

US government shutdown over border wall,"This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" A partial US government shutdown has taken effect after US lawmakers failed to break a budget impasse. President Donald Trump, who has to sign off on any deal, is insisting at least $5bn (Â£4bn) be included for his long-promised wall along the Mexican border. In the absence of a deal, funding for about a quarter of US federal agencies lapsed at midnight (05:00GMT Saturday). Congress began rare Saturday sessions at about noon local time to try to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice are now partially shutting down. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to work unpaid or are furloughed, a kind of temporary leave. This is the third time US federal funding has lapsed so far this year, although the other two were brief. Five big things from Trumpâs head-spinning week It's pretty much all about the wall. On Wednesday, a bilateral deal appeared to have been agreed in the Senate to keep federal agencies open until 8 February. But the agreement did not include funding for Mr Trump's wall. Mr Trump then dug his heels in over the issue after criticism from conservative talk show hosts and other allies, and insisted that funds for the wall must be included for him to sign the budget off. The Republican-controlled House then passed a bill on Thursday approving $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) of funding for the wall. Mr Trump is well aware the Democrats are taking control of the House in January and wall funding will then be opposed. The US Capitol was abuzz with last-ditch negotiations on Friday But the other problem for Mr Trump is that he does not have the 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate he needs to get the House budget passed. No amount of shuttling between party negotiators on Capitol Hill could resolve the issue before the Saturday deadline. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell addressed a new session on Saturday saying the ""pause button"" had been pushed and that there would be no new Senate vote until he had a signature from the president - and agreement from the Democrats - on a budget deal. In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump said he was ""working hard"" but that negotiations with the Democrats could be ""a long stay"". The Democrats remain staunchly opposed to funding for the wall, with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer saying President Trump had ""thrown a temper tantrum and now has us careening towards a 'Trump shutdown' over Christmas"". But some lawmakers were hopeful that there could be a deal involving less money for the wall and more restrictions on it. Nevertheless, Mr Trump has also suggested Mr McConnell should invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"" to break the impasse. The option would mean the bill could be approved in the Senate with a simple majority instead of the 60 currently required. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But Mr McConnell has repeatedly refused in the past to invoke such an extreme legislative manoeuvre. A number of Republican senators on Friday also made clear their staunch opposition to the proposal. About 380,000 government employees will be made to take temporary, unpaid leave. Meanwhile, 420,000 employees working in essential roles - considered necessary for the ""protection of life and property"" - will keep working, without being paid. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected. Martin Ely, 54, a tax officer in Arizona, is affected by the shutdown and says he's frustrated with the politicians. ""I would like them not to use us a bargaining chip. ""I was last paid a week ago and hopefully should still be paid on 30 December for this week just gone, but anything after that will definitely be affected by the shutdown. ""I have been an IRS employee for around nine years, and I was furloughed during the 2013 shutdown that lasted from October 1st-17th. Being furloughed is never a pleasant experience. Having to live on savings and/or credit while waiting for back pay, which must be approved by Congress, is tremendously stressful. ""During the 2013 shutdown, I spent the entire time glued to the TV watching the news and waiting to be called back to work. Many of my co-workers did the same. We can't travel far or plan a vacation during a shutdown because we usually only get a day's notice or less to report back to work. So it's no holiday, especially during the Holidays."" A strengthened southern border wall was a key election promise for Mr Trump. On Friday Mr Trump shared a graphic of his steel-slat wall design for the wall. Allow Twitter content?

Stowaways held after cargo ship rescue,"The Grande Tema was due to dock at Tilbury Four stowaways found on a cargo ship in the Thames Estuary have been detained after the vessel's crew was threatened. The Grande Tema's crew had to lock themselves in the vessel's bridge for safety, a spokesman said. Essex Police said the vessel was boarded and secured shortly after 23:00 GMT on Friday - almost 14 hours after the force was first called. Four men who were on the ship have been held under the Immigration Act, the force added. A police spokesman said they would be handed over to UK Border Force. The stowaways had demanded to be taken to the coast, according to the ship's owner. Police previously said the situation was not being treated as a hostage, piracy or terror-related issue. GPS trackers showed the 71,000-tonne ship sailing in circles in the Thames Estuary. It had set off from Lagos, Nigeria, on 10 December. It docked at Tilbury just before 04.30 GMT. Grimaldi Group, which owns the vessel, said the four stowaways were discovered on board four days ago. They were put under surveillance in a cabin but escaped earlier and made threats to the ship's master as the vessel approached Tilbury, urging him to get close to the coast. A map showing the Grande Tema in the Thames Estuary at 17:00 GMT Grimaldi spokesman Paul Kyprianou said: ""The vessel was coming from Nigeria and was bound to Tilbury and those four stowaways were in the cabin. ""Today they managed to escape from the cabin and they started threatening the crew, requesting the master of the vessel [navigate] very close to the coast. ""That request was probably because they wanted to jump and reach the British coast."" He said the crew had locked themselves in the command area of the vessel.

Can 'Super Saturday' save Christmas?Retailers are banking on last-minute Christmas shoppers to boost December sales.,"Retailers hoping for a last-minute rush of Christmas shoppers on ""Super Saturday"" may be disappointed as trade looked set to peak before the weekend. Springboard said footfall rose by 10.4% between Thursday and Friday. Based on historical data when Christmas Day fell earlier in the week, Friday is the busiest day as people tend to use Saturday to travel. Nevertheless, firms like Hammerson expect two million people to visit its shopping centres this weekend. ""There's always an uptick in footfall at this time of the year, as shoppers start to worry about whether online orders will be delivered in time for the big day,"" said Mark Bourgeois, UK & Ireland managing director at Hammerson, whose shopping centres include the Bullring in Birmingham and London's Brent Cross. But Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, the retail experts, said: ""Footfall peaks on Friday rather than Saturday. Last year, footfall dropped by 3.8% between Friday and Saturday and this is a trend we have seen in previous years."" Reality Check: Has it been the worst November for retailers? UK High Streets 'have twice as many shops as needed' Although footfall across the High Street, retail parks and shopping centres rose from Thursday,  Springboard said that compared to Friday last year it dropped by 6.7%. Westfield, however, is still expecting a ""Super"" Saturday. It said that over last weekend, between 14-16 December, 850,000 people descended on its London-based shopping centres in Stratford and Shepherd's Bush. Myf Ryan, chief marketing officer for Europe and group director of brand and strategic marketing at Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, said that since the Black Friday sales in November it has seen double digit growth in footfall and expects strong trade on the ""three full trading days"" before Christmas Day. But Ms Wehrle said that one of the problems retailers have faced this year is that Black Friday sales have lasted much longer and that there is an unprecedented number of shops that are offering pre-Christmas discounts. Recently, Mike Ashley, the Sports Direct founder and chief executive who also owns House of Fraser and a large stake in Debenhams, said last month was the ""worst November in living memory"" and predicted some retailers would be ""smashed to pieces"". Deloitte, the accountancy firm, said that retail discounts on goods are running at an average 43.6% and are expected to rise to a record 48% on Christmas Eve as shops look to shift stock. Jason Gordon, lead consumer analytics partner at Deloitte, said: ""Christmas falling on a Tuesday, shorter Sunday opening hours and many choosing the weekend prior to Christmas to travel to friends or family will complicate the last few crucial days trading. ""This is why we expect retailers to ramp up their discounting earlier than normal in an attempt to clear stock."" Deloitte said general economic and business uncertainty has made consumers cautious about spending while milder weather means retailers have too much winter stock in store. Ms Wehrle said that retailers with an online offering will be hoping internet shopping will make-up for weaker sales in their stores. Although she said that online growth was also slowing because of factors such as Brexit uncertainty as well as higher levels of credit card debt following a prolonged periodwhen wage growth fell below inflation. Last week, online fashion retailer Asos issued a profit warning after ""unprecedented"" discounting hit trading in November. And Ms Wehrle expects to see more retailers warn on profits in January or, at the very least, report weaker sales for the festive period. Looking ahead, Mr Gordon said: ""Against a backdrop of considerable business uncertainty across the sector, many retailers will extend their Christmas sales deep into January, with some having little option but to run through early February and even beyond. ""While this is unprecedented, it will not be a surprise.""

"Actor will not play LGBT roles againThe actor, who is straight, says he doesn't want to deprive gay actors of potential roles.Newsbeat","Darren Criss says he will no longer accept LGBT scripts because he doesn't want to deprive gay actors of roles. The actor, who is straight, is well-known for playing the gay character of Andrew Cunanan in American Crime Story: The Assassination Of Gianni Versace. ""I want to make sure I won't be another straight boy taking a gay man's role,""he told Bustle magazine,external. He said it's been ""a joy"" acting in gay roles but no longer feels comfortable doing so, which is ""unfortunate"". Previous to American Crime Story, he was mostly known for his portrayal of gay pupil Blaine Anderson in Glee. Darren Criss won a Primetime Emmy award for his portrayal of serial killer Andrew Cunanan ""There are certain roles that I'll see that are just wonderful,"" he explained. ""But I want to make sure I won't be another straight boy taking a gay man's role.""

Rail strikes disrupt Christmas weekend,"The RMT strikes over guards have been running for two years Workers on Northern and South Western Railway (SWR) have begun 24-hour strikes on the last Saturday before Christmas. The walkout, from midnight, is part of the long-running dispute over the future of train guards. Northern said the strike, by the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), would disrupt markets and other events ""at a vital time for businesses"". The RMT said its action was in defence of a ""safe and accessible"" railway. General secretary Mick Cash said he would not allow ""the dilution of the safety culture on Northern trains in a drive to prop up Deutsche Bahn's profits as [Northern's] parent company hits the skids"". Northern said the action would disrupt Christmas events Northern said the walkout would harm Christmas traders and ""damage the economic well-being of the north of England"". It said very few of its services would run after 17:00 GMT. SWR said the union was targeting people ""trying to travel to be with family and friends... at what should be a time of relaxation and enjoyment"". It said a ""reduced service"" would operate, although some routes would have no trains or replacement buses. Picket lines have been held outside many railway stations including in Newcastle Previously the union called for a guarantee that trains will not run if no guard is available, while SWR has said they would run in ""exceptional circumstances"". The RMT has been involved in a two-year dispute with several rail companies over the issue. It previously said it had secured ""guard guarantees"" in Wales and Scotland as well as on a number of English rail franchises. Further strikes have already been announced on SWR on 27 and 31 December. Walkouts on Northern are planned on each Saturday until the end of January.

Osborne: Tories facing period of oppositionThe ex-chancellor says the party must adapt to modern Britain to survive in government.,"Former chancellor and Remain campaigner George Osborne now edits the Evening Standard newspaper The Conservative Party is heading towards a ""prolonged period"" in opposition unless it adapts to modern Britain, George Osborne has said. The former chancellor, who was sacked by Theresa May in 2016, said the party needed to become more socially-liberal and pro-business to survive in power. The ex-frontbencher, who now edits the Evening Standard newspaper, campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum. He added he believes a general election could be likely in 2019. Mr Osborne was interviewed by David Dimbleby, who is guest-editing BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday. He was former prime minister's David Cameron's closest ally in government and served as his chancellor for the whole six years Mr Cameron was prime minister - from 2010 to 2016. George Osborne and ex-PM David Cameron, who called the EU referendum, were close political allies and remain friends In the interview, Mr Osborne said that if he was still a member of government he would ""essentially try and steer the country away from the rocks to which it is heading"". Mr Osborne added he would also attempt to move the party ""away from a prolonged period of opposition, which is where I think it's heading, unless it engages with modern Britain and adopts the essentially socially-liberal, pro-business, internationalist approach which I think is the right one for the country"". Osborne: Mistakes led to EU leave vote George Osborne takes on another job Osborne and Blair: 'Gap in centre politics' The Remainer also told Mr Dimbleby the calls for a no-deal Brexit were ""reckless"" and he believes another referendum or general election is possible next year. ""In my view, a general election is at the moment an under-reported likelihood for 2019 because in the British system the simplest way to resolve political impasses is to return to the public at a general election,"" he said. ""There is a way of course for the government to avoid that and they are terrified of an election - they can themselves embrace a referendum. ""And that is clearly under discussion in Downing Street even though it's denied."" He said that if there was another referendum, he would urge people to vote to reverse the Brexit decision. ""It's not that you say to people, look, two years ago you made the wrong decision, you were stupid. ""It's that in the two years since we've learnt a lot more about what's involved in leaving the European Union, we've learnt a great deal more about what's on offer outside the European Union."" Mr Osborne, who Theresa May dropped from her top team when she took over as prime minister in July 2016, said he has known her for 20 years and called her ""a person of integrity and intelligence"". But he criticised her for mistakes he believes the government has made in the Brexit negotiating process. ""I think the mistake the government made - led by Theresa May - from the start was to try and claim that a country that had voted 17 million to leave the EU, 16 million to stay, wanted a 100% Brexit. Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: All you need to know ""I think she should have started where she has tried to end up, which is a more conciliatory partnership with the European Union, or associate membership. ""I think that was essentially a massive mistake by the Conservative administration - which it was punished for at the general election - because the Conservative Party decided to embrace the Brexit result in such a way as to essentially dismiss the views of those who had voted remain, treat them as saboteurs or traitors and run against urban Britain."" Mr Osbornehas previously spokenabout how he admitted having ""regrets"" about his time in office and ""mistakes that led to Brexit"". This video can not be played George Osborne: We did get things wrong He said that he was not in favour of an EU referendum but supported his ""close friend"" Mr Cameron's decision to hold one.

"Scattered 'yellow-vest' protests in FranceProtests are seen for a sixth consecutive Saturday, but not on the same scale as previous weekends.","This video can not be played Yellow Vests: Why Macron's concessions aren't enough for some Small demonstrations by ""yellow-vest"" protesters have been seen throughout France for a sixth consecutive Saturday, but not on the scale of the ones seen in recent weeks. About 2,000 people were demonstrating in Paris at around 16:00 (15:00 GMT), compared to about 4,000 last Saturday, police sources said. Some 142 people have been arrested, including a protest leader, police say. A man died in southern France, bringing the protests' overall death toll to 10. His car hit a truck at a roadblock near Perpignan overnight on Friday, the authorities said on Saturday. Protests have been dwindling sincePresident Emmanuel Macron offered tax and salary concessions to the protesters earlier this month. The gilets jaunes Macron promises divide protest leaders Are the Yellow Vests spreading beyond France? More than 38,000 demonstrators were protesting at 18:00 throughout the country compared with 66,000 last Saturday, the interior ministry said. There were some violent clashes on the Champs-ElysÃ©es in Paris as night fell, and 142 people were stopped and 16 detained, including a yellow-vest leader, Eric Drouet, Paris police said. Despite this, traffic was normal and most shops, except for some luxury boutiques, were open for business in the run-up to Christmas. French stores reported an average drop-off of 25% in sales compared with the same period a year earlier, junior economy minister AgnÃ¨s Pannier-Runacher told French TV. The palace of Versailles outside Paris and its gardens were closed as the authorities prepared for possible unrest there. Instead, protesters gathered in the Montmartre area of northern Paris for a small-scale demonstration. Hundreds of ""yellow vests"" briefly blocked trucks near the French-Spanish border There were other small-scale protests in the rest of the country, with hundreds of yellow vests briefly blocking trucks near the French-Spanish border before being dispersed by police. Roadblocks were also reported in northern France near the border with Belgium. Further demonstrations were planned around the country - though the movement seemed to be losing impetus in the run-up to Christmas. Police fired tear-gas in the northern resort of Le Touquet to keep a crowd away from a house there owned by Mr Macron and his wife, Brigitte. France's interior ministry said only 3,680 yellow vests had been counted on Thursday on the many traffic filtering points that have been appearing throughout the country since the beginning of the protests, their lowest number so far. This video can not be played Yellow vests: Is the symbol spreading across Europe? The ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protesters - named after the high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their cars - began in mid-November against fuel tax increases and later widened to include the liberal economic reform policies of President Macron. They were initially protesting against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. Mr Macron had said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. Mr Macron responded by scrapping an unpopular fuel tax rise, and promising an extra â¬100 (Â£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners. On Friday evening, the French Senate approved the measures which should come into force early next year. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 injured - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 injured - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 injured - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 injured - 1,220 in custody 15 December:66,000 protesters - 7 injured (in Paris) - 115 in custody (in Paris) French 'yellow vests' in defiant protests Euro falls as French protests hit economy 'Yellow vests' beyond France?

"Scattered 'yellow-vest' protests in FranceProtests are seen for a sixth consecutive Saturday, but not on the same scale as previous weekends.Europe","This video can not be played Yellow Vests: Why Macron's concessions aren't enough for some Small demonstrations by ""yellow-vest"" protesters have been seen throughout France for a sixth consecutive Saturday, but not on the scale of the ones seen in recent weeks. About 2,000 people were demonstrating in Paris at around 16:00 (15:00 GMT), compared to about 4,000 last Saturday, police sources said. Some 142 people have been arrested, including a protest leader, police say. A man died in southern France, bringing the protests' overall death toll to 10. His car hit a truck at a roadblock near Perpignan overnight on Friday, the authorities said on Saturday. Protests have been dwindling sincePresident Emmanuel Macron offered tax and salary concessions to the protesters earlier this month. The gilets jaunes Macron promises divide protest leaders Are the Yellow Vests spreading beyond France? More than 38,000 demonstrators were protesting at 18:00 throughout the country compared with 66,000 last Saturday, the interior ministry said. There were some violent clashes on the Champs-ElysÃ©es in Paris as night fell, and 142 people were stopped and 16 detained, including a yellow-vest leader, Eric Drouet, Paris police said. Despite this, traffic was normal and most shops, except for some luxury boutiques, were open for business in the run-up to Christmas. French stores reported an average drop-off of 25% in sales compared with the same period a year earlier, junior economy minister AgnÃ¨s Pannier-Runacher told French TV. The palace of Versailles outside Paris and its gardens were closed as the authorities prepared for possible unrest there. Instead, protesters gathered in the Montmartre area of northern Paris for a small-scale demonstration. Hundreds of ""yellow vests"" briefly blocked trucks near the French-Spanish border There were other small-scale protests in the rest of the country, with hundreds of yellow vests briefly blocking trucks near the French-Spanish border before being dispersed by police. Roadblocks were also reported in northern France near the border with Belgium. Further demonstrations were planned around the country - though the movement seemed to be losing impetus in the run-up to Christmas. Police fired tear-gas in the northern resort of Le Touquet to keep a crowd away from a house there owned by Mr Macron and his wife, Brigitte. France's interior ministry said only 3,680 yellow vests had been counted on Thursday on the many traffic filtering points that have been appearing throughout the country since the beginning of the protests, their lowest number so far.

Vets warn pet owners over festive treats,"Bailey the dog, who became ill after eating chocolate, was treated by vets at the PDSA The Christmas decorations are up, the fridge is stocked and we are nearly ready to relax and overindulge on this most wonderful time of year. But those festive treats and knick-knacks can be harmful to our pets - with one vet saying she treats three times the number of animals in December than any other month. BBC News spoke to the vets who treat our beloved, if slightly gluttonous, pets when things go wrong. Mickey spent days in hospital after eating a mince pie Mickey the Belgian shepherd had to spend three nights at a veterinary hospital earlier this month after munching on a mince pie he took from a plate on the sofa. The 15-month-old was then given an injection to make him sick. Debs Smith, from Scarsdale Vets's Pride Veterinary Centre in Derby, said Mickey was then fed meals with charcoal which ""binds with any toxins left in the stomach"" to prevent them absorbing into the body. He was also put on intravenous fluids (IV) for 48 hours to keep him hydrated. ""Mickey was given IV fluids as raisins, sultanas and currants can cause kidney failure,"" she said. The vet said if a dog had eaten even the smallest amount of raisins or currants, they would advise treatment. Mrs Smith said this was typically how they treated pets who had ingested foods toxic to them. ""Unfortunately if they are not treated early it can be fatal,"" she said. ""The earlier these things are treated the more successful."" Grapes, raisins and sultanas are known to be toxic to dogs, and the PDSA said although it was not proven they were equally dangerous to other pets such as cats, it was probably still best if they avoided them. This video can not be played What your dog can't eat this Christmas Mickey's owner Pauline Warren said: ""Luckily I realised he had eaten the mince pie just a couple of minutes after and rang the vet straight away. ""I was so worried and just wanted him home, but I knew he needed treatment. I don't have any mince pies in the house now."" Another pet the practice saw this month was Jack the cockapoo, who had eaten a raisin cupcake he had snuck from the kitchen bench when his owner was not looking. Lisa Ridley, from Twyford in Derbyshire, said: ""We got him in within 40 minutes of him eating it. He had swallowed about nine raisins. ""I felt really guilty because I knew the dangers of the raisins. ""He is a very lively dog and barked most of the time [he was in hospital]. My other dog did not like him being away - she cried for most of the 48 hours he was gone."" Jack the cockapoo had to stay on a drip for 48 hours after eating raisins Pride Veterinary Centre sees about three times the number of cases in December compared with other months. Mrs Smith advised pet owners to make sure anything harmful to animals was not left lying around. Chocolate Anything containing raisins, sultanas and currants, such as mince pies and Christmas cake Alcohol Turkey, chicken or goose bones Anti-freeze Holly, mistletoe, poinsettia and ivy Decorations and fairy lights Christmas trees can be a tempting climbing frame for cats. The PDSA advises keeping them out of the room with the tree when you are not there to supervise Source: PDSA and Pride Veterinary Centre Ewan McNeill, from Castle Vets in Nottingham, recently had a case in which a Labrador had eaten about six or seven mince pies. He said another common festive issue was dogs eating turkey bones and then getting them stuck - as well as dogs eating chocolate, so he advised not putting anything tempting under the tree ""as dogs would be keen to investigate"". He said two other common problems were cats licking or drinking anti-freeze or pets ingesting Christmas tree decorations. The vet said anti-freeze ""is quite sweet so cats seem to like it"". Mr McNeill's advice to pet owners is to take the attitude of having a toddler in the house by placing food out of reach and being careful of electrical wiring and decorations. The PDSA said it once treated a cat who had swallowed a Christmas tree-shaped decoration Animal charity PDSA said the festive cases it had seen across their pet hospitals in recent years included dogs eating chocolate, a pooch who had gobbled down fairy lights, a cat that had swallowed tinsel and another with a Christmas tree-shaped decoration stuck in its body. Olivia Anderson-Nathan, a PDSA vet, said: ""Pets have no understanding of Christmas and the excitement that it can bring. ""Routines change, decorations spring up from nowhere and an influx of noisy guests arrive without warning, making Christmas a potentially stressful time for our pets. But with a little planning, we can help our furry friends enjoy the festive period too."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

Osborne: Tories facing period of oppositionThe ex-chancellor says the party must adapt to modern Britain to survive in government.UK Politics,"Former chancellor and Remain campaigner George Osborne now edits the Evening Standard newspaper The Conservative Party is heading towards a ""prolonged period"" in opposition unless it adapts to modern Britain, George Osborne has said. The former chancellor, who was sacked by Theresa May in 2016, said the party needed to become more socially-liberal and pro-business to survive in power. The ex-frontbencher, who now edits the Evening Standard newspaper, campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum. He added he believes a general election could be likely in 2019. Mr Osborne was interviewed by David Dimbleby, who is guest-editing BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday. He was former prime minister's David Cameron's closest ally in government and served as his chancellor for the whole six years Mr Cameron was prime minister - from 2010 to 2016. George Osborne and ex-PM David Cameron, who called the EU referendum, were close political allies and remain friends In the interview, Mr Osborne said that if he was still a member of government he would ""essentially try and steer the country away from the rocks to which it is heading"". Mr Osborne added he would also attempt to move the party ""away from a prolonged period of opposition, which is where I think it's heading, unless it engages with modern Britain and adopts the essentially socially-liberal, pro-business, internationalist approach which I think is the right one for the country"". Osborne: Mistakes led to EU leave vote George Osborne takes on another job Osborne and Blair: 'Gap in centre politics' The Remainer also told Mr Dimbleby the calls for a no-deal Brexit were ""reckless"" and he believes another referendum or general election is possible next year. ""In my view, a general election is at the moment an under-reported likelihood for 2019 because in the British system the simplest way to resolve political impasses is to return to the public at a general election,"" he said. ""There is a way of course for the government to avoid that and they are terrified of an election - they can themselves embrace a referendum. ""And that is clearly under discussion in Downing Street even though it's denied."" He said that if there was another referendum, he would urge people to vote to reverse the Brexit decision. ""It's not that you say to people, look, two years ago you made the wrong decision, you were stupid. ""It's that in the two years since we've learnt a lot more about what's involved in leaving the European Union, we've learnt a great deal more about what's on offer outside the European Union."" Mr Osborne, who Theresa May dropped from her top team when she took over as prime minister in July 2016, said he has known her for 20 years and called her ""a person of integrity and intelligence"". But he criticised her for mistakes he believes the government has made in the Brexit negotiating process. ""I think the mistake the government made - led by Theresa May - from the start was to try and claim that a country that had voted 17 million to leave the EU, 16 million to stay, wanted a 100% Brexit. Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: All you need to know ""I think she should have started where she has tried to end up, which is a more conciliatory partnership with the European Union, or associate membership. ""I think that was essentially a massive mistake by the Conservative administration - which it was punished for at the general election - because the Conservative Party decided to embrace the Brexit result in such a way as to essentially dismiss the views of those who had voted remain, treat them as saboteurs or traitors and run against urban Britain."" Mr Osbornehas previously spokenabout how he admitted having ""regrets"" about his time in office and ""mistakes that led to Brexit"". This video can not be played George Osborne: We did get things wrong He said that he was not in favour of an EU referendum but supported his ""close friend"" Mr Cameron's decision to hold one. David Dimbleby is the first of several public figures to take turns editing the Today programme over the festive period. Actress Angelina Jolie, who is a special envoy to the UN Refugee Agency, will take over editor duties on Today on 28 December.

Five things from TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs head-spinning week,"This week in Washington has distilled all the chaos, upheaval, drama and conflict of the first two years of the Donald Trump presidency down to its purest form. It's been a bungee jump from high to low, then careening everywhere in between - and it's not altogether clear that it won't end with the loud and final thud of an impact on the ground. Here's a look at the crises - plural - that have unfolded in the past few days. Most, if not all, are of the president's own making. Mr Trump campaigned as a disrupter, and this week has been disruption in the extreme. At the end of last week it appeared that Congress was on a glide path toward avoiding a partial shutdown of the federal government. Then, on Thursday, everything went haywire. After the White House had signalled it would support the stopgap funding measure, hard-core conservative media outlets and politicians demanded the president draw a line in the sand over building his much-promised border wall. Mr Trump abruptly changed course, announcing that ""any measure that funds the government must include border security"". The fact he's stopped calling for a wall and instead asked for border security and ""metal slats"" - fencing - is a concession that might have meant something if it was made weeks ago, and not under the shadow of a shutdown. This video can not be played Let the bickering begin ... who will be blamed for a shutdown? The irony is that the warning was made at a signing ceremony for bipartisan farm legislation, during which the president touted another recently passed bill reforming the criminal justice system. Green shoots of inter-party co-operation appeared this week, only to be met with the herbicide of wall acrimony. The House of Representatives seems solidly behind including wall funding in any bill. But the Senate, with only 51 Republicans and unified Democratic opposition, is well short of the 60 votes needed to agree to such a measure. And if enough House members change their mind, there's always the chance that the president will veto a stopgap bill without any funding for the wall. The dynamic changes considerably on 3 January, when Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats take over the House. At that point, the door slams shut on wall funding ever being approved in the House. The Senate may very well acquiesce to a new wall-free spending bill and the president becomes the final roadblock. Would he back down, giving the House Democrats an early win? That may be a bitter pill to swallow. For Mr Trump, however, the pain he appears to fear from his supporters seems to outweigh in his mind the political discomfort from a shutdown. If Mr Trump's pivot on budget funding was surprising, his unexpected announcement that he's pulling the 2,000 US troops out of Syria - and reports of plans for thousands more coming home from Afghanistan - was an electric shock through the US foreign policy establishment. The fact that the president, who campaigned in part on drawing down US involvement obligations abroad, might contemplate such a move is not unexpected. The manner in which the announcement was made, with little apparent consultation with senior government officials or US allies abroad, is the primary source of upheaval - and the cause for concern among even those who might otherwise support the decision. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? Then came the exclamatory punctuation mark at the end of the drawdown drama. Defence Secretary James Mattis, perhaps the most universally respected member of Mr Trump's Cabinet, announced he was resigning because of differences of opinion he has with the president. In his announcement, he offered full-throated support for the US alliance structure and a warning that the US must serve as a counterweight to authoritarian rivals. Then came his parting shot. ""Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defence whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,"" he wrote. It was one of the most direct suggestions of disapproval from any of Mr Trump's ever-expanding list of former advisers and Cabinet secretaries. Analysis: After Mattis, US allies are worried White House revolving door: Who's gone? All of this raises the question, why did the president act now? There has been some speculation that it may be tied the budget fight over the Mexican border wall. If people tell the president there's not enough money, then he'll reduce US commitments abroad. Others have suggested the move was a distraction in the midst of an unpleasant news cycle. Or perhaps it was a move to placate Turkey or - an evergreen explanation - Russia. Whatever the reason, Mr Trump has roiled his supporters in the US Senate at a time when he needs them most. In the past, Republican politicians have managed to walk the line between offering tuts of disapproval for presidential actions they don't like, while still voting lockstep for conservative policy priorities. In the coming days, however, this straddling effort will be tested like never before. Ina recent article in The Atlantic,external, Benjamin Wittes and Mikhaila Fogel compare Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation of possible Russian ties to the Trump presidential campaign to a siege on a walled city. If the investigation is ""a campaign of degradation over a substantial period of time"", this week brought a number of new volleys that could hasten the eventual collapse. There was Michael Flynn's sentencing fiasco, in which Mr Trump's former national security adviser admitted in open court that he knowingly lied to the FBI and wasn't tricked or trapped into it. The judge, Emmet Sullivan, then suggested he sold his country out. Facing the prospect of an angry judge threatening jail time, Flynn's lawyers asked for a sentencing delay - dangling the possibility of more co-operation by Flynn and guaranteeing this portion of the Mueller investigation will stretch on until at least March. Meanwhile, the Senate released two investigations into Russian social media campaigns to influence the 2016 presidential election. They indicated the scope of the attack was much wider than previously known. The efforts reached hundreds of millions of people on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and other services, engaging conservatives and discouraging key voting blocs on the left, all in an attempt to help Mr Trump's presidential bid. The president and his supporters have dismissed evidence of Russian meddling as blame-shifting by Democrats seeking an excuse for their 2016 defeat. With these reports, that becomes a more difficult case to make. What's still not known is if there are any direct links between the Russians and the Trump team. Rumours swirl of new Mueller indictments on the horizon, however, perhaps of Trump confidant Roger Stone, who had contacts with WikiLeaks, the group that released hacked Democratic documents. Then there'sthe NBC News report that Mr Mueller could release his findings and conclusions in mid-February,external- which, although it seems like an eternity in US politics these days, is just two months away. The clock is ticking - providing a possible explanation for Mr Trump's dyspeptic attitude of late. Six legal headaches for Trump Russia 'meddled in all big social media' There was evidence as early as 2016, thanks in large part to the efforts of the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, that Donald Trump frequently used his family's charitable foundation - funded in large part by donations from other people - to settle business lawsuits, buy baubles at auctions and, during the presidential campaign, advance his political interests. Any of this could qualify as ""self-dealing"" and put the charity's tax status at risk. The controversies swirling around the foundation attracted the attention of the Democrat-run attorney general's office in New York, which launched an investigation. On Tuesday, they negotiated the dismantling of the charity. Trump's troubled charity to shut down Mr Trump and his lawyers explained that they wanted this all along, and that the entire inquiry was the result of ""sleazy Democrats"". But this is another dark cloud that won't be disappearing anytime soon. Barbara Underwood, in a statement heralding the action, called the foundation ""little more than a chequebook"",externalfor the Trumps, with activity that displayed ""a shocking pattern of illegality"". What's more, she said, the state would continue to seek millions of dollars in back taxes and fines from the Trump Organization, and sanctions against the president and his three oldest children. During the 2016 campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly criticised Hillary Clinton and her family's much-larger operating foundation. Two years later, however, it's the president's charity that remains in the headlines. Mr Trump has spent much of his presidency touting the seemingly endless ascent of the US stock market. ""The Stock Market just reached an All-Time High during my Administration for the 102nd Time, a presidential record, by far, for less than two years,""he tweeted in early October,external. Politicians who hitch their star to the stock market, however, can be in for a bumpy ride. Since Mr Trump wrote that tweet, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen more than 4,300 points - a 16% decline. Due to a combination of rising interest rates, the president's trade wars, the impending government shutdown and indications of slower economic growth, the now long-in-the-tooth bull market may be coming to an end. December has seen the biggest market decline since the Great Depression and the largest drop in any month since 2009. Larger economic indicators, such as GDP growth, unemployment and consumer confidence, are still strong. The current economic expansion is now entering its 13th year, however, and no one has yet discovered how to outwit the business cycle. What goes up eventually comes down (at least a bit), and the timing may not be good for the president.

Arrests over Gatwick drones disruption,"Police remain at the airport to ""detect and mitigate"" any further drone threats Two people have been arrested in connection with a string of drone sightings that brought Gatwick Airport to a standstill. A 47-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman, from Crawley, were arrested in the town at about 22:00 GMT on Friday. Flights had been grounded for more than a day, affecting about 140,000 passengers, after drones were seen near the runway. The airport has since reopened and flights are operating on schedule. Sussex Police said it was continuing to investigate the ""criminal use of drones"" and appealed for information. The airport said it aimed to run ""a full schedule"" of 757 flights on Saturday, carrying 124,484 passengers. Passengers are flowing reasonably well through the South Terminal. Coming in through arrivals, it's a different story. Passengers are talking of delays of many hours involving road and ferry diversions. More than 1,000 flights were cancelled or diverted during the 36 hours of disruption and that knock-on effect is still being felt. The disruption lasted well into Friday evening But a spokesman added: ""Passengers should expect some delays and cancellations as we continue to recover our operations following three days of disruption."" They also urged passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling to the airport. Supt James Collis said officers remained at Gatwick, ready to ""detect and mitigate"" further drone flights by deploying a range of tactics. 'Desperately trying to get back' How can a drone cause so much chaos? He asked passengers and people living nearby to remain vigilant and report any suspicions. ""Every line of inquiry will remain open to us until we are confident that we have mitigated further threats to the safety of passengers,"" he added. Passengers were left waiting in the departure areas Gatwick reopened on Friday morning, although the runway was closed again for a short time after a further confirmed drone sighting at 17:10. A spokeswoman for the airport said military measures put in place at the airfield made it safe to reopen. Eleven inbound flights were diverted to other airports during the latest suspension and, while outbound flights would experience a ""knock-on delay"", none had been cancelled, she said. However, the BBC has been contacted by people claiming their flights were cancelled. A small number of flights due to arrive into Gatwick on Saturday were cancelled, according to the airport's website. They include an Easyjet service from Milan and a TUI flight from Barbados. A Gatwick spokesman said: ""Safety is Gatwick's top priority and we are grateful for passengers' continued patience as we work to get them to their final destination in time for Christmas.""

More young people buying own homes,"Joe Brewer and Stacy in their new home Joe Brewer, from Dartford in Kent, moved into his two-bedroom terrace with girlfriend Stacy a month ago. ""It's a big relief getting in there. It really took a long time but it has paid off. It seemed I was saving for a lifetime!"" says the 27-year-old. He is among increasing numbers of 25 to 34-year-olds for whom home ownership has become a reality. For the first time in 30 years, home ownership among this group has risen, says the Resolution Foundation. But the new research by the think tank, which focuses on people on lower incomes, warns that first-time buyers face still face acutely high barriers to entry. The Foundation says that easier credit conditions and a slowdown in house price growth in recent years have improved the situation for young first-time buyers. As a result, home ownership rates among 25 to 34-year-olds have risen by 3% since they hit 25% in 2016. But it says home ownership among this age group is half that of the 1980s, when half of this age group owned their own home. The Foundation says that despite this recent uptick, renting will continue to be the norm for the majority of young people, particularly in the UK's major cities. That means the share of young families in the private rental sector increased from just 9% in the late 1980s to 34% now. Among this group, even those with children are increasingly sharing a roof, with 12% of all young families now sharing with others, up from 3% in the late 1980s. In Bristol and Brighton, one in three young private renters is now living in shared accommodation. The Foundation says a better deal for renters is needed, as the high financial barriers to owning remain. It calls for the government to help young tenants by making indeterminate tenancies the sole form of private rental contract and limiting rent rises. Daniel Tomlinson, Research and Policy Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Home ownership politicians should act to increase the number of homes available to buy, use the tax system to favour first-time buyers over second-home owners, and ensure that the private rental sector is fit for purpose - providing the security that many young families need.""

Spinal surgery for unborn babies on NHSThe procedure can reduce the likelihood of illnesses later in life and improve walking ability.Health,"Spinal surgery for unborn babies with the birth defect spina bifida is to be made routinely available on the NHS in England, officials have announced. The surgery involves repairing the spinal tissue of the baby while it is still in the womb. It can improve their ability to walk and reduce health problems that result from spina bifida. The procedure is among several treatments being made available on the NHS for the first time from April. Two unborn babies' spines repaired in womb Spina bifida: 'Giving babies a chance' More than 200 babies are born in the UK each year with spina bifida, where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly during pregnancy, causing a gap in the spine. It often results in problems that include paralysis of the legs, incontinence and sometimes learning difficulties. The condition is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility. Spinal surgery in the womb wascarried out in the UK for the first timeearlier this year on two unborn babies at University College Hospital in London. In the past, patients had to travel abroad for the procedure. It is not known what causes spina bifida but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk. Kate Steele, chief executive of charity Shine, said: ""Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress."" Among the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). More than 300 people, mostly children, will benefit from this new treatment that reduces the number and severity of seizures. Louise Fish, chief executive of the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, said: ""We're delighted that NHS England has decided to fund this life-changing and potential life-saving treatment from April 2019 onwards. ""We'll be working with TSC clinics across England to help them get ready to prescribe this drug to more people who can benefit from it."" The other treatments that will be funded from 1 April 2019 are: Small bowel transplantation service (adults) and small bowel transplantation (children) Selexipag for pulmonary hypertension Trientine dihydrochloride for Wilson's Disease Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) for chemotherapy refractory / intolerant metastatic colorectal cancer Metreleptin for congenital leptin deficiency Gemcitabine and capecitabine as adjuvant treatment for resected pancreatic cancer Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

Can 'Super Saturday' save Christmas?,"Retailers hoping for a last-minute rush of Christmas shoppers on ""Super Saturday"" may be disappointed as trade looked set to peak before the weekend. Springboard said footfall rose by 10.4% between Thursday and Friday. Based on historical data when Christmas Day fell earlier in the week, Friday is the busiest day as people tend to use Saturday to travel. Nevertheless, firms like Hammerson expect two million people to visit its shopping centres this weekend. ""There's always an uptick in footfall at this time of the year, as shoppers start to worry about whether online orders will be delivered in time for the big day,"" said Mark Bourgeois, UK & Ireland managing director at Hammerson, whose shopping centres include the Bullring in Birmingham and London's Brent Cross. But Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, the retail experts, said: ""Footfall peaks on Friday rather than Saturday. Last year, footfall dropped by 3.8% between Friday and Saturday and this is a trend we have seen in previous years."" Reality Check: Has it been the worst November for retailers? UK High Streets 'have twice as many shops as needed' Although footfall across the High Street, retail parks and shopping centres rose from Thursday,  Springboard said that compared to Friday last year it dropped by 6.7%. Westfield, however, is still expecting a ""Super"" Saturday. It said that over last weekend, between 14-16 December, 850,000 people descended on its London-based shopping centres in Stratford and Shepherd's Bush. Myf Ryan, chief marketing officer for Europe and group director of brand and strategic marketing at Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, said that since the Black Friday sales in November it has seen double digit growth in footfall and expects strong trade on the ""three full trading days"" before Christmas Day. But Ms Wehrle said that one of the problems retailers have faced this year is that Black Friday sales have lasted much longer and that there is an unprecedented number of shops that are offering pre-Christmas discounts. Recently, Mike Ashley, the Sports Direct founder and chief executive who also owns House of Fraser and a large stake in Debenhams, said last month was the ""worst November in living memory"" and predicted some retailers would be ""smashed to pieces"". Deloitte, the accountancy firm, said that retail discounts on goods are running at an average 43.6% and are expected to rise to a record 48% on Christmas Eve as shops look to shift stock. Jason Gordon, lead consumer analytics partner at Deloitte, said: ""Christmas falling on a Tuesday, shorter Sunday opening hours and many choosing the weekend prior to Christmas to travel to friends or family will complicate the last few crucial days trading. ""This is why we expect retailers to ramp up their discounting earlier than normal in an attempt to clear stock."" Deloitte said general economic and business uncertainty has made consumers cautious about spending while milder weather means retailers have too much winter stock in store. Ms Wehrle said that retailers with an online offering will be hoping internet shopping will make-up for weaker sales in their stores. Although she said that online growth was also slowing because of factors such as Brexit uncertainty as well as higher levels of credit card debt following a prolonged periodwhen wage growth fell below inflation. Last week, online fashion retailer Asos issued a profit warning after ""unprecedented"" discounting hit trading in November. And Ms Wehrle expects to see more retailers warn on profits in January or, at the very least, report weaker sales for the festive period. Looking ahead, Mr Gordon said: ""Against a backdrop of considerable business uncertainty across the sector, many retailers will extend their Christmas sales deep into January, with some having little option but to run through early February and even beyond. ""While this is unprecedented, it will not be a surprise.""

Colombian dissident leader killed by forces,"Colombian President Ivan Duque (centre) announced the death on Friday A Colombian guerrilla leader has been found and killed, the country's president says. Walter ArÃ­zala, known better under his alias Guacho, was wanted for the murder of two Ecuadorean journalists and their driver earlier this year. On Friday, Colombian President Ivan Duque said he was killed in an operation near the Ecuadorean border. In a statement Mr Duque described him as ""one of the most horrendous criminals the country has known"". ""The message is clear, we won't take a step back in the defence of legality, life, honour and the property of Colombians,"" Mr Duque said. On top of killings, Guacho was also suspected of drug trafficking and extortion. The 29-year-old was a former member of Colombia's Farc rebel group. He is one of thousands who have refused orders to lay down arms after the guerrilla group signed a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016. Guacho broke away from the Farc and founded the Oliver Sinisterra Front - a dissident gang thought to have about 70 to 80 combatants operating around the Colombia-Ecuador border area. Watch and read more: Who are the Farc? 50 years of conflict Rare look inside a Farc rebel camp The Farc fighter rapping for peace in Colombia The group came to international attention earlier this year after kidnapping two Ecuadorean journalists - 32-year-old reporter Javier Ortega and 45-year-old photographer PaÃºl Rivas - along with their 60-year-old driver EfraÃ­n Segarra. Two weeks after seizing the three, the group announced they had ""died"" when the army came close to where they were being held. The killings led to outrage and grief in Ecuador Shortly after their bodies were recovered,the group were also blamed for the murder of an Ecuadorean couple. Oscar VillacÃ­s, 24, and Katty Velasco, 20, went missing from Puerto Rico, a rural area near the Colombian town of Tumaco, on the border with Ecuador. A video of them, restrained with ropes around their necks, was released by the Guacho's group days after their disappearance.

Spinal surgery for unborn babies on NHS,"Spinal surgery for unborn babies with the birth defect spina bifida is to be made routinely available on the NHS in England, officials have announced. The surgery involves repairing the spinal tissue of the baby while it is still in the womb. It can improve their ability to walk and reduce health problems that result from spina bifida. The procedure is among several treatments being made available on the NHS for the first time from April. Two unborn babies' spines repaired in womb Spina bifida: 'Giving babies a chance' More than 200 babies are born in the UK each year with spina bifida, where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly during pregnancy, causing a gap in the spine. It often results in problems that include paralysis of the legs, incontinence and sometimes learning difficulties. The condition is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility. Spinal surgery in the womb wascarried out in the UK for the first timeearlier this year on two unborn babies at University College Hospital in London. In the past, patients had to travel abroad for the procedure. It is not known what causes spina bifida but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk. Kate Steele, chief executive of charity Shine, said: ""Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress."" Among the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). More than 300 people, mostly children, will benefit from this new treatment that reduces the number and severity of seizures. Louise Fish, chief executive of the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, said: ""We're delighted that NHS England has decided to fund this life-changing and potential life-saving treatment from April 2019 onwards. ""We'll be working with TSC clinics across England to help them get ready to prescribe this drug to more people who can benefit from it."" The other treatments that will be funded from 1 April 2019 are: Small bowel transplantation service (adults) and small bowel transplantation (children) Selexipag for pulmonary hypertension Trientine dihydrochloride for Wilson's Disease Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) for chemotherapy refractory / intolerant metastatic colorectal cancer Metreleptin for congenital leptin deficiency Gemcitabine and capecitabine as adjuvant treatment for resected pancreatic cancer Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

US stocks suffer worst week in a decade,"US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets. All three indexes closed lower, with the technology-focused Nasdaq down 20% since its peak, placing it in so-called ""bear market"" territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its biggest weekly drop in percentage terms since 2008. The S&P 500 fell 7% for the week. It is the biggest weekly percentage drop since August 2011 while the Nasdaq's 8.36% decline is the sharpest since November 2008. The Dow Jones fell 6.8% during the week. What's knocked markets off course? US economy under Trump: Is it the best in history? After years of gains, US investors are fleeing stocks, worried about a range of factors likely to hit corporate profits, including slowing economic growth domestically and abroad. Earlier this week, the US Federal Reserve lifted the interest rate and signalled that it would continue to rise next year, albeit at a slower pace. The Fed also cut its forecasts for economic growth in 2019 to 2.3%, down from the 2.5% predicted in September. Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets, said: ""China is cooling and the eurozone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the US have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019."" Elliot Clarke, economist at Westpac, the banking group, added: ""Political brinkmanship in Washingtonis further heightening market uncertainty."" Markets were also unnerved by comments from President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro who told the Nikkei newspaper that it would be ""difficult"" for the US and China to reach a long lasting trade agreement that would end the tensions between the two. Share trading started Friday on an upswing, boosted by stronger-than-expected quarterly sales at sportswear giant Nike. Investors also appeared soothed after John Williams, president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the central bank would consider market turmoil as it weighs future interest rate decisions. Facebook's stock was one of the biggest fallers on Friday However, selling set in by afternoon with some of the major technology firms - that led the market's rally earlier this year - experiencing some of the most bruising falls. Facebook and Twitter both tumbled more than 6%, Amazon dropped more than 5%, and Apple and Microsoft slipped more than 3%. For the day,  the Nasdaq index fell almost 3%, the S&P 500 tumbled more than 2%, and the Dow slid 1.8%. Some economists argue that the steep Wall Street sell-off does not reflect conditions in the wider economy, which grew at an annual pace of 3.4% in the most recent quarter. Consumer sentiment also remains strong, according to the most recent data. However, the fears on Wall Street could spread in the event of a prolonged downturn, analysts warned. ""If these expectations begin to shift, then we would expect to see more downward pressure on sentiment and spending patterns in early 2019,""  Oxford Economics said.

Sabotaging your own wedding," On the morning of any wedding there’s a lot of preparation. On 4 November, Monika’s hair needed doing and her make-up had to be artfully applied. The bride needed her maroon wedding sari put on, as tradition dictated. The jewellery set aside for this special day had to be placed on her ears and nose and draped across her neck. For this Indian wedding, her hands needed to be daubed with intricate swirls of henna too. There was so much to do. But with only a few hours to go until the ceremony, no-one noticed as the bride herself quietly slipped into the shadows of the family home to make one last phone call. It was not to a friend, or a caterer, or the wedding venue to check everything was going smoothly. Instead, nervously, Monika dialled four digits - 1098 - the number of a helpline. Too young to marry under Indian law, Monika wanted to stop her own wedding. She was 13 when her marriage was meant to happen. That’s according to the charity that helped her, and comes from her school records. Her parents claim she’s more like 17. It’s common in this part of India for the ages of some people to be a little hazy. Birth certificates often don’t exist for poor families like Monika’s. What is not in doubt is that she is still a child, and that the law only allows marriage at 18. The city may not be as well known a tourist location as Jaipur or Jodhpur but it is still one of those places which assails every sense. Ganesh passed grocery stalls piled high with a rainbow of vegetables and endured the piercing horns of tuk-tuks hurtling through the streets and the smell of fresh camel dung at the roadside. On his return later that evening, he and Monika’s mother, Sita, sat their daughter down and told her that they had found her someone to marry. “Mummy and Papa told me they’d found a boy for me in Churu [115 miles away] and that he was very nice and educated and worked as a labourer,” recalls Monika. I felt that I was too young and that I shouldn’t marry - I wanted to get an education and become a teacher” When I ask her to describe her then husband-to-be she says simply, without any drama or emotion, that she had never met him but her parents did show her a photograph. He was 22. As an obedient daughter, her first instinct was to do as her parents wished but her emotions were in turmoil. “I felt that I was too young and that I shouldn’t marry. I wanted to get an education and become a teacher.” Monika pleaded with her parents. “I told them that I didn’t want to get married, and they asked why, so I explained that a girl should be at least 18 years old.” Marriage would have meant a life of isolation. Her prospective husband lived a four-hour train journey away from her own family.  “After getting married, life would have been spent only in this new home. Nobody would have allowed me to play, or talk, and I would have had to take care of all the household chores. My in-laws would have made me do a lot of work - and only work.” So why did Monika’s parents think it was right to marry off their daughter so young? The city may not be as well known a tourist location as Jaipur or Jodhpur but it is still one of those places which assails every sense.

My in-laws would have made me do a lot of work - and only work.” So why did Monika’s parents think it was right to marry off their daughter so young? As we sit and drink tea in the small, simply tiled courtyard of their home, it’s clear Ganesh and Sita are loving parents to their five daughters, but life is a struggle. Ganesh earns 500 rupees a day (£5.50) and his work is sporadic. His bike is propped against the yard wall, ready if a job suddenly comes up. The family is from the Valmiki - or sweeper - caste. In the past, that would have meant they were classed in the untouchables of Indian society. Even today they are very much on the fringes of their local community and they only mix with other families from the same caste. Monika’s mother and grandmother clear waste from houses in the neighbourhood. As is often the case with families from this background, the older daughters have only received a little education. Indeed, when I ask Monika how many school friends she has, she replies matter-of-factly that she doesn’t have any. Her studies seem to have petered out. It sounds like a solitary existence for a teenager. Stacked in the corner of one of the rooms off the courtyard is a pile of furniture. It includes a sturdy chest with a lock on it and a brand new fridge in all its original packaging. This is puzzling as the house doesn’t appear to have a working fridge of its own. Ganesh This jealously guarded hoard is Monika’s dowry - painstakingly saved up by her father for the day she marries. Ganesh sees his prime responsibility as getting his daughters married and settled down. His eldest daughter, Rajini, was due to marry legally in November. Her groom had a brother and Monika’s family thought it made sense to have a double wedding. “We thought that if we marry two daughters at the same time then the costs would only be for one wedding and not two,” explains her father. “We are a family of labourers and sometimes I get jobs in construction work but sometimes I don’t. We thought since we are marrying our one child we will marry another one and save on the expense.” But what they had planned for Monika was illegal under Indian law. Ganesh looks awkwardly at his hands. “We did know that it is a criminal offence. We did feel bad.” Sita For Sita, though, it’s as if their circumstances didn’t leave them much choice. “What should we do?” she says as she shrugs her shoulders. The marriage was also arranged with Monika’s personal safety in mind, Sita argues. “When we go out for work, we worry about leaving our daughter alone at home as the neighbourhood where we live is unsafe. It was out of the fear for her security that we thought that we would marry off both sisters together.” These kind of multiple marriages are common in Rajasthan. Often, only the oldest girl’s name is mentioned on the invitation. It makes it much harder for the authorities to detect a child marriage when there is the cover of a perfectly legal marriage happening simultaneously. But in Monika’s case the authorities received a tip-off. It came from the bride herself. As Monika sits alongside her parents and recounts her story, she seems to bear them no ill will. But last year, as the wedding drew nearer, it must have been a time of immense tension. She does not appear to be a natural teenage rebel and her shy mannerisms suggest a girl who is still finding her own voice in the world. Yet somewhere within she found the strength to kick back against the plans her family had made. The trigger point for Monika came on the wedding day. “When I saw my sister wearing her wedding dress, I realised that only she could do this - I just couldn’t.” Her gut feeling drove her to call the national hotline - ChildLine. Monika had seen the easy-to-remember number - 10-9-8 - in books. She borrowed a phone from her unwitting grandmother and rang. The wedding was then only hours away. She was afraid but this was her last resort. “I called up and I don’t know who picked up the phone but I told them everything - that I’m young and I don’t want to get married and want to study further. “I asked them ‘can you please do something that stops my marriage?’.” The helpline operator in Delhi tried to calm her down. They took details of her location and the time of the wedding. The message, Monika recalls, was “don’t worry we’re on our way”. She’s often in a race against time to save young girls from becoming child brides and can be seen zipping around town on her small white moped. “We had a tricky challenge as we had to save a child in just three hours’ time,” Preeti says. Over the phone, she managed to win Monika’s trust and talk her through what would happen next. Local police were scrambled and arrived at Monika’s house at about 17:00. The officers asked to see the paperwork - of which there was little - and after establishing that the bride was underage they warned everyone that the wedding could not take place. But the family ignored the police and at 20:00 Monika rang Preeti again. Her parents had changed the wedding venue to her grandmother’s house and were still trying to marry her off. “This was a change of venue to hide the wedding,” explains Preeti. “So we again contacted the police department. Myself, a female constable and two male police officers reached the new venue for the wedding at 22:00.” It was just in the nick of time. “Monika was in her wedding dress and when she saw us she gave a little smile, although she didn’t say anything at that time. She knew that we had come to stop her wedding. She was happy then.” The rest of the wedding party were bemused. “There were relatives all around who were asking each other in low murmurs about why the police had arrived.” No-one knew who had reported the wedding to the police. It is only now that Monika is happy for it to be known that she made the mystery call. The next task for Preeti and the police was to make sure the parents understood the gravity of the situation. “We called Monika’s parents and grandparents into a room and explained that not only does the child suffer because of early marriage but they too could also face a punishment for this offence. “So they stopped the wedding and the police took a written testimony from them promising they would not marry her before the age of 18. They were warned if they went ahead with it a second time then they would have to serve a prison sentence.” Preeti has seen between 20 and 25 cases of child marriage crossing her desk since the beginning of January this year. The winter months are part of the traditional marriage season in Rajasthan. Source:Unicef Child marriage was banned in India in 2006 but it is still widespread. With its huge population, India remains the country with the most child brides, according to Unicef. Preeti sees herself as a big sister figure for girls like Monika and admits to immense job satisfaction. “In my career I have stopped several weddings and when I come into direct contact with these girls we often stay in touch forever. I feel real pride that I am able to help them salvage their lives and protect their futures. It makes me feel happy.” It’s midday in the village of Husangsar in the middle of the Thar Desert in Rajasthan. All around, the sand dunes reflect the fierce sun, dazzling the unprepared visitor. Some of the houses here are just simple wooden huts with parched-looking thatching on top. Local children crowd round a tap on the wall of a schoolhouse - cupping their hands and dipping their heads as they slurp up the water. Inside the girls’ school, I ask the pupils whether they know any friends who have been married young. They turn in unison and point to one of their number who they say was married aged 10. Her name is Pooja. She’s dressed demurely in a caramel-coloured tunic and wearing a beaded necklace. As with Monika, there’s slight confusion over Pooja’s real age. She is in the school year for 14 to 15-year-olds, though she tells me she’s a couple of years older. At first, like any self-conscious teenager, Pooja seems a little intimidated by the sea of faces turned eagerly to hear her story. But, after a nod of encouragement from her teacher, she visibly relaxes and starts to talk: Pooja’s parents have agreed to delaygauna- the moment when a bride is sent to live with her husband’s family and the time when she is expected to have sex. This way, Pooja at least gets to have some schooling and doesn’t suffer the physical complications of early pregnancy. Even so, the message Pooja has had at school is that early marriage is wrong. “Our teacher says a girl should be at least 18 and a boy at least 21 when they wed.” And then she says something that sounds more from the heart than from a textbook: “Girls should be educated. I want to say this to all the villagers - don’t get underage girls married. Don’t ruin their life. If someone does that forcefully, call ChildLine on 10-9-8. This will help stop child marriage.” Outside a crowd of 300 has gathered. They are sitting under a huge awning in the middle of a sandy school playground. Most of them are either children in their school uniforms or from the local boys’ youth club. But the older generations are represented too. Mothers and grandmothers in their diaphanous pink veils and old men in turbans with deep lines etched on their faces. Word goes round that the performance is about to start. They’re all here to see a puppet show staged by the Urmul Trust. The storyline is simple - a young girl named Gudki is told by her father that she is to be married off early. Her mother protests because she wants her daughter to have time to play and develop as a teenager. She pleads with the father to reconsider. He insists, however, so Gudki marries and goes to live with her new family. When the father later pays a visit to the in-laws’ house he discovers his daughter died in childbirth. It may only be a puppet show but many of those in the audience are weeping. Watching from the sidelines is Arvind Ojha, the avuncular figure who leads the Urmul Trust. “Look how totally involved everybody is,” he gestures to the spellbound audience. “With that involvement comes a transformation. We don’t just focus on engaging women and children in these programmes but also older people and even religious leaders. Using folk media is very effective.” He has been working in western Rajasthan since 1986. The state has one of the worst child marriage rates in India - only behind Bihar and West Bengal. According to the National Family Health Survey, 35% of young Rajasthani women are married off before the age of 18 - the national average is 27%. But Ojha is sure that things are improving, mainly because of the way villages have gradually embraced girls’ education. Arvind Ojha, Urmul Trust Before the puppet show audience breaks up for lunch there is a poignant moment where all present - including Pooja and her friends - rise to their feet and raise an arm. The entire village of Husangsar is taking an oath to observe the law and make their community a child marriage-free zone from now on. In the surrounding districts, 178 villages have taken this same oath. Our next stop is the village of Lunkaransar, home to a girls’ boarding school and also in the Thar Desert. It’s a collection of low white buildings with a few Indian lilacs - or neem trees - providing shade in the centre. Here a group of schoolgirls are singing and clapping as they sit on wooden benches. Two or three have even got to their feet and are dancing with all the panache of Bollywood film stars. A formidable young woman named Radika Swami runs this music session. Now in her early 20s, she became something of an activist on child marriage after she was told she would marry aged 17. Radika’s story has some parallels to Monika’s. Radika Swami Both Radika’s mother and grandmother had been child brides so this was not a custom easily broken. But, through the sheer force of her personality, Radika persuaded her father and grandfather to keep her in education and break off the engagement. Now she works as a warden at this school campus teaching other girls about the importance of sticking with their studies. Radika Swami refused to marry in her teens Through music and drama, Radika tries to raise awareness. She has written a play on the subject of female foeticide - the selective abortion of girls in the womb. Although it is supposed to be illegal in India, it is still widely practised in states such as Rajasthan. In 2011, Rajasthan had 888 girls for every 1,000 boys below the age of six. This skewed sex ratio leads to a shortage of girls of marriageable age which, in turn, fuels the demand for child brides. Radika is sure much more needs to be done to involve boys in prevention work.  “Communities can take time in listening to what girls are saying, but with boys they are always heard instantly. So if we work with both sexes then we will get 100% results.” Across the world, 12 million girls every year marry before the age of 18 - that’s one in every five, according to children’s charity Unicef. A decade ago that figure was one in four but new analysis from Unicef suggests there has been significant progress in recent years, particularly in South Asia. In fact, in the past decade a girl in South Asia has seen her risk of being married off early drop from 50% to 30%. India is one of the countries which has led the way. Campaigners say that success now needs to be copied in sub-Saharan Africa. Niger, for example, remains the country with the highest overall rate (76%) of child marriage in the world. Source:Unicef It isn’t only a problem in the developing world. Child marriage even persists in some communities in Europe and North America. The marriageable age in many European countries is 16 with parental consent. There are a number of reasons for the practice. In cases like Monika’s, poverty is key. But campaigners say it’s primarily an issue of gender inequality. “Fundamentally, it happens to girls because they are seen as being less valuable than boys,” says Lakshmi Sundaram from Girls Not Brides, a global partnership of more than 900 civil society organisations. “Girls do not get given the same opportunities as boys. So if a family only has money to send one child to school, they will send the boy and not the girl. If they only have enough food to feed a certain number of their children, they will marry off the girl so that they can consolidate their resources.” Global statistics suggest it is most common in rural areas and child brides are more likely to have low levels of education. According to Sundaram, schools are one of the best forms of protection: “When a girl is in school there’s a feeling from the whole community that this is a student and a child who should be allowed to stay on that trajectory and finish their studies. But as soon as she comes out of that school she’s then seen as a future wife and mother. So families often think ‘why don’t we just hurry it up - what are we waiting for?’.” Many countries now have laws which set the minimum age of marriage at 18 but it is often allowed to be lower with parental consent or the judgement of a court. Campaigners say one of the best strategies is to involve religious leaders or tribal elders in the campaign to end child marriage. Once these figures of authority are on board, public opinion in the wider community can change very quickly. Some countries have started offering cash handouts to families if they agree to leave their daughters in school. Technology can be useful as well. One charity - Vikalp Sansthan - uses phone notifications to warn wedding photographers and make-up artists that their involvement in any underage nuptials will result in legal action. Above all, a better sense of the costs of child marriage is now emerging. This includes not only the physical problems of domestic violence and early pregnancy but the mental toll it takes on young brides too. “Girls... are seen as being less valuable than boys” And there could be an economic dividend from lower population growth and more girls completing their education, staying healthier and getting better jobs. While it is good news that child marriage cases are falling across the world, Sundaram is adamant there’s no room for complacency: “The rates of child marriage are declining but because of population growth the actual numbers of child brides continue to increase. So we have to accelerate progress if those numbers are to come down more dramatically in future.” There’s a commotion outside Monika’s house as word spreads round the neighbourhood that the BBC has come from London to interview her. “Is this about the wedding that was called off?” a nosey neighbour asks our translator. That alone gives you a sense of how big a deal it was for a young girl to report her parents. In a strange way, you can see Monika’s mother is actually proud of what her daughter did. “Yes, I feel good about it,” admits Sita. “I really rather like the idea that my daughter has done it. Change has come for all.” For her part, Monika is certain that she did the right thing and wants her story told: “I am glad that my experience will be shared with others. Maybe some other girl will learn from my case and she too can stop her child marriage. And if she can’t stop it, then I will even help her out myself!” What is so striking about Rajasthan is how girls like Monika are taking the fight against child marriage into their own hands, in a culture where their voices are often not heard. The education these girls receive, though it’s often limited, is teaching them that they should not be married off before 18. It feels inconceivable that 10 or 20 years ago this kind of bottom-up resistance would have existed in poor urban areas or remote desert villages. Back then, girls would have been more pliant in accepting their fate as it was seen by a patriarchal society. Now it seems like there is the prospect of real change. Not everything is perfect for Monika. She tells us wistfully she would like to return to school - something the Urmul Trust is trying to arrange. But as she sits with her new friend, Preeti, on the porch of the family home watching the world go by in the evening twilight, it’s easy to see how just how young she is and what a lucky escape she’s had. A childhood was nearly lost. Now - through an act of teenage rebellion - a childhood has been regained. Built with Shorthand"
"Rail strikes disrupt Christmas weekendA rail firm says very few evening trains will run ""at a vital time for businesses"".England","The RMT strikes over guards have been running for two years Workers on Northern and South Western Railway (SWR) have begun 24-hour strikes on the last Saturday before Christmas. The walkout, from midnight, is part of the long-running dispute over the future of train guards. Northern said the strike, by the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), would disrupt markets and other events ""at a vital time for businesses"". The RMT said its action was in defence of a ""safe and accessible"" railway. General secretary Mick Cash said he would not allow ""the dilution of the safety culture on Northern trains in a drive to prop up Deutsche Bahn's profits as [Northern's] parent company hits the skids"". Northern said the action would disrupt Christmas events Northern said the walkout would harm Christmas traders and ""damage the economic well-being of the north of England"". It said very few of its services would run after 17:00 GMT. SWR said the union was targeting people ""trying to travel to be with family and friends... at what should be a time of relaxation and enjoyment"". It said a ""reduced service"" would operate, although some routes would have no trains or replacement buses.

Drugs 'kingpin' jailed for 22 years,"Robert Dawes was under surveillance by Spain's Guardia Civil for months after the drugs were found A British petty criminal who became an ""international drugs kingpin"" has been jailed for 22 years. Robert Dawes, 46, from Nottinghamshire, was arrested in Spain in 2015 for trafficking 1.3 tonnes of cocaine into Europe. A judge-only trial in Paris heard he used corrupt officials in Venezuela and supplied several criminal gangs. Police said Dawes ran Europe's largest crime group involved in ""trafficking, money laundering and murder"". Robert Dawes was arrested after a raid by Spanish police on his home The court heard the drugs - packed into 30 suitcases - were seized on a flight from South America to Paris in 2013. The National Crime Agency said he was a global ""big fish"", who brokered deals with the Italian mafia and Colombian cartels. Dawes lived in luxury villa on the Costa del Sol, where he was eventually arrested. Guns, cash and encrypted mobile phones were seized when Dawes villa was raided Guns, cash and encrypted mobile phones were seized from the property. The court previously heard he started as a small-time criminal in Sutton-in-Ashfield and was first convicted of a crime aged 11. Dawes denied all charges, saying a conversation where he was recorded talking about drug shipments was a ploy to get himself arrested to end ""heavy-handed surveillance"" by Spanish police. Before the verdict Dawes was laughing and smiling, even miming hanging himself to his lawyer as he entered the dock. Police said Dawes used violence and intimidation to move ""huge shipments"" across borders He was convicted of seven charges connected with drug trafficking and not guilty of one charge. Matt Horne from the NCA said: ""Robert Dawes and his organised crime group were feared by their criminal counterparts. ""They could broker deals between the biggest groups and were trusted to move huge shipments. ""He was a drugs kingpin who had an impact across the UK."" Of two other Britons on trial, Nathan Wheat was convicted of six charges and jailed for 13 years, while Kane Price was acquitted. Three Italians were also convicted. Dawes will have his properties confiscated and the defendants were told they faced a 30m euro fine, but the details of this have not been released. Dawes's lawyers have indicated he will appeal.

China-held Canadian 'can't turn lights off',"Michael Kovrig was arrested on 10 December in China A former Canadian diplomat detained in China last week is being denied legal representation and is not allowed to turn lights off at night, sources say. Michael Kovrig, who now works for the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank, was detained on accusations of harming national security. Canada drew Chinese protests after it arrested an executive at telecoms giant Huawei at the request of the US. China says it has guaranteed Mr Kovrig's lawful rights. ICG spokesman Karim Lebhour told the BBC: ""Michael has not been allowed access to his lawyers. The arrest is unjustified."" Mr Kovrig has been working as North East Asia senior adviser for the Brussels-based think tank since February 2017. Meanwhile an unnamed source told Reuters news agency that he was being held at an undisclosed location and being questioned every morning, afternoon and evening. He is not allowed to turn off the lights when he tries to sleep at night, the person added. ""He is physically all right, but tired and stressed,"" a source told the Financial Times. ""Physically, he does not appear mistreated."" Who is detained Canadian Michael Spavor? The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Huawei arrest puts 'bullseye' on Apple China denied Mr Kovrig was being mistreated. ""We have already said that China has in accordance with the law guaranteed Michael Kovrig's lawful rights and humanitarian treatment, and has provided Canada with necessary help to carry out normal consular work,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a press briefing, referring questions to the ""relevant authorities"". Canada only gained consular access to Mr Kovrig at a police station on 14 December, when he was visited for half an hour by the Canadian ambassador and two other Canadian diplomats, the sources said. On Friday Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada was ""deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention"" of the two men and called for their immediate release. Meng extradition Mr Kovrig was arrested in Beijing on 10 December, they added. A second Canadian - Michael Spavor, a businessman - was also detained last week and is facing the same accusations. Canada arrested Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou earlier this month, at the request of the US, which is engaged in a trade war with China. Ms Meng faces extradition to the US to face fraud charges linked to allegations of avoiding US sanctions on Iran. Each charge carries a maximum possible sentence of 30 years jail. China has denied the detention of both men is tied to Ms Meng's arrest, but many analysts believe it was a tit-for-tat action.

US shutdown looms over border wall row,"This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" A partial US government shutdown has taken effect after US lawmakers failed to break a budget impasse. President Donald Trump, who has to sign off on any deal, is insisting at least $5bn (Â£4bn) be included for his long-promised wall along the Mexican border. In the absence of a deal, funding for about a quarter of US federal agencies lapsed at midnight (05:00GMT Saturday). Congress began rare Saturday sessions at about noon local time to try to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice are now partially shutting down. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to work unpaid or are furloughed, a kind of temporary leave. This is the third time US federal funding has lapsed so far this year, although the other two were brief. Five big things from Trumpâs head-spinning week It's pretty much all about the wall. On Wednesday, a bilateral deal appeared to have been agreed in the Senate to keep federal agencies open until 8 February. But the agreement did not include funding for Mr Trump's wall. Mr Trump then dug his heels in over the issue after criticism from conservative talk show hosts and other allies, and insisted that funds for the wall must be included for him to sign the budget off. The Republican-controlled House then passed a bill on Thursday approving $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) of funding for the wall. Mr Trump is well aware the Democrats are taking control of the House in January and wall funding will then be opposed. The US Capitol was abuzz with last-ditch negotiations on Friday But the other problem for Mr Trump is that he does not have the 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate he needs to get the House budget passed. No amount of shuttling between party negotiators on Capitol Hill could resolve the issue before the Saturday deadline. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell addressed a new session on Saturday saying the ""pause button"" had been pushed and that there would be no new Senate vote until he had a signature from the president - and agreement from the Democrats - on a budget deal. In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump said he was ""working hard"" but that negotiations with the Democrats could be ""a long stay"". The Democrats remain staunchly opposed to funding for the wall, with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer saying President Trump had ""thrown a temper tantrum and now has us careening towards a 'Trump shutdown' over Christmas"". But some lawmakers were hopeful that there could be a deal involving less money for the wall and more restrictions on it. Nevertheless, Mr Trump has also suggested Mr McConnell should invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"" to break the impasse. The option would mean the bill could be approved in the Senate with a simple majority instead of the 60 currently required. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But Mr McConnell has repeatedly refused in the past to invoke such an extreme legislative manoeuvre. A number of Republican senators on Friday also made clear their staunch opposition to the proposal. About 380,000 government employees will be made to take temporary, unpaid leave. Meanwhile, 420,000 employees working in essential roles - considered necessary for the ""protection of life and property"" - will keep working, without being paid. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected. Martin Ely, 54, a tax officer in Arizona, is affected by the shutdown and says he's frustrated with the politicians. ""I would like them not to use us a bargaining chip. ""I was last paid a week ago and hopefully should still be paid on 30 December for this week just gone, but anything after that will definitely be affected by the shutdown. ""I have been an IRS employee for around nine years, and I was furloughed during the 2013 shutdown that lasted from October 1st-17th. Being furloughed is never a pleasant experience. Having to live on savings and/or credit while waiting for back pay, which must be approved by Congress, is tremendously stressful. ""During the 2013 shutdown, I spent the entire time glued to the TV watching the news and waiting to be called back to work. Many of my co-workers did the same. We can't travel far or plan a vacation during a shutdown because we usually only get a day's notice or less to report back to work. So it's no holiday, especially during the Holidays."" A strengthened southern border wall was a key election promise for Mr Trump. On Friday Mr Trump shared a graphic of his steel-slat wall design for the wall. Allow Twitter content?

Later, he posted a video regarding the immigration row, where he said it was ""very dangerous out there"".

Who is going to pay for the wall? Six things that could topple the border wall Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US During his campaign he insisted he would make Mexico pay for it, but the country has refused.

Two arrests over Gatwick drones,"Police remain at the airport to ""detect and mitigate"" any further drone threats Two people have been arrested in connection with a string of drone sightings that brought Gatwick Airport to a standstill. A 47-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman, from Crawley, were arrested in the town at about 22:00 GMT on Friday. Flights had been grounded for more than a day, affecting about 140,000 passengers, after drones were seen near the runway. The airport has since reopened and flights are operating on schedule. Sussex Police said it was continuing to investigate the ""criminal use of drones"" and appealed for information. The airport said it aimed to run ""a full schedule"" of 757 flights on Saturday, carrying 124,484 passengers. Passengers are flowing reasonably well through the South Terminal. Coming in through arrivals, it's a different story. Passengers are talking of delays of many hours involving road and ferry diversions. More than 1,000 flights were cancelled or diverted during the 36 hours of disruption and that knock-on effect is still being felt. The disruption lasted well into Friday evening But a spokesman added: ""Passengers should expect some delays and cancellations as we continue to recover our operations following three days of disruption."" They also urged passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling to the airport. Supt James Collis said officers remained at Gatwick, ready to ""detect and mitigate"" further drone flights by deploying a range of tactics. 'Desperately trying to get back' How can a drone cause so much chaos? He asked passengers and people living nearby to remain vigilant and report any suspicions. ""Every line of inquiry will remain open to us until we are confident that we have mitigated further threats to the safety of passengers,"" he added. Passengers were left waiting in the departure areas Gatwick reopened on Friday morning, although the runway was closed again for a short time after a further confirmed drone sighting at 17:10. A spokeswoman for the airport said military measures put in place at the airfield made it safe to reopen. Eleven inbound flights were diverted to other airports during the latest suspension and, while outbound flights would experience a ""knock-on delay"", none had been cancelled, she said. However, the BBC has been contacted by people claiming their flights were cancelled. A small number of flights due to arrive into Gatwick on Saturday were cancelled, according to the airport's website. They include an Easyjet service from Milan and a TUI flight from Barbados. A Gatwick spokesman said: ""Safety is Gatwick's top priority and we are grateful for passengers' continued patience as we work to get them to their final destination in time for Christmas.""

The photographer sucked into a whirlpoolThe NHS scandal that killed both my husbandsThe girl who sabotaged her own weddingThe drug causing chaos in prisonsThe man who thinks Europe is being invaded," About eight miles from Penzance, down one of those narrow, winding country lanes Cornwall is notorious for, lies Gwynver beach. Many will drive past without realising it is there, bound instead for the fishing village of Sennen or the tourist attraction of Land's End. But those who make the turn, opposite a chapel featuring a cross formed by two surfboards, will be rewarded. On a fine day, Gwynver could pass for paradise. A stretch of blindingly bright sand caressed by the blue Atlantic. A curved cliff envelops the beach like a pair of protective wings. Out to sea, trawlers chug along. The waves are dotted by surfers, undeterred by a smooth swell, their wetsuits shining black, their boards a grainy white. Gwynver was Jacob’s spiritual home. It was here he surfed and held late-night barbecue parties. It was here his friends gathered the day after his death to light fires and release lanterns. It was here his ashes were scattered along with those of his sister Grace. Jacob's existence was one of exhilaration, excitement and risk. Whether dancing at all-night raves, surfing impossible waves or exploring crystal-filled caves, Jacob attacked life full throttle. ""He had these crazy eyes that looked like the sea, his hair was always unkempt, he always looked happy,"" says his friend Barnaby Courtney. ""He made you believe magic existed."" Jacob grew up just outside Penzance and, although he travelled the world, he only felt truly at home in the town and the beaches that surround it. It was a quintessential Cornish childhood. Days were spent running around the countryside or bathing at the beach. Children were tanned or pink from days in the sun, or bundled up in Quiksilver coats against the murky mist that often smothered the land. ""Jacob loved the water,"" his mother Carolyn says. ""Once he was in you could never get him out."" Diagnosed with dyslexia when he was 10, school was a struggle. He would skip lessons with his friends to hitchhike to the beach, surfboards beneath their arms. Grace was the polar opposite of her brother - a star pupil. She worked hard, consistently scored top marks and was a champion at netball, hockey and cross country. ""Grace was great,"" says Paul Kellas, Jacob’s form tutor at Cape Cornwall Comprehensive and now the school's assistant head teacher. He smiles at his memories of her but the smile fades. ""What happened to her, well, it was heartbreaking. ""What more does that poor family have to go through?"" Jacob was the youngest of four children, the baby brother to Grace, Laura and Joe. But he was closest to Grace, three years his senior. When he was a toddler the pair devised a secret language and she would always speak for him. In fact people thought Jacob had a problem. ""They were genuinely worried that he didn't know how to talk,"" says his older sister Laura. ""But I said of course he knows how to talk, it's just he doesn't need to, Grace does it for him."" As Jacob grew older, his closeness to Grace remained. ""She was really bright but also really driven and determined; if she wanted to achieve something she did,"" says her best friend Dabriella Quayle. ""She was the sort of girl your parents talked about, 'why can't you be more like Grace'?"" Dabriella’s twin sister Aprilla nods in agreement. ""She was very headstrong, but she was also fun. ""She was older than her years, she had the sense of someone in their 30s or 40s."" The twins pause. ""Looking back now it was eerie,"" says Aprilla. ""Almost as if Grace knew she had limited time so had to excel and do everything."" We thought through it all she was going to survive."" The headaches had begun in the summer of 2001 while Grace was on a gap year working at children's camps in France. She came home in the August and was diagnosed with a brain tumour in September. Grace underwent radiotherapy at the Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, her family camping nearby throughout. However, Jacob stayed at home. ""Because he was younger we did not tell Jacob a lot of what was happening,"" says his mother. ""We thought through it all she was going to survive."" After six months Grace's cancer returned and her only hope was an operation in Belgium. Grace went to Belgium, the operation was only a partial success. The tumour returned. This time it was terminal. Grace died on 18 December 2002. She was 20. After her death, Grace's ashes were stored in the airing cupboard, her ""favourite place in the house"". She had asked for them to be kept until another family member died. She had been afraid of being scattered alone. It surprised Dabriella. ""I thought it was a very strange request for her,"" she says. ""She had always been such an independent person, it was just very un-Grace."" Eleven years later, following the death of her grandmother, arrangements were finally being made to scatter their ashes together. Then, a day before the planned ritual, Grace's younger brother died. She was no longer alone. Jacob was the youngest of four children, the baby brother to Grace, Laura and Joe. But he was closest to Grace, three years his senior. When he was a toddler the pair devised a secret language and she would always speak for him. In fact people thought Jacob had a problem. ""They were genuinely worried that he didn't know how to talk,"" says his older sister Laura. ""But I said of course he knows how to talk, it's just he doesn't need to, Grace does it for him."" As Jacob grew older, his closeness to Grace remained. ""She was really bright but also really driven and determined, if she wanted to achieve something she did,"" says her best friend Dabriella Quayle. ""She was the sort of girl your parents talked about, 'why can't you be more like Grace'?"" Dabriella’s twin sister Aprilla nods in agreement. ""She was very headstrong, but she was also fun. ""She was older than her years, she had the sense of someone in their 30s or 40s."" The twins pause. ""Looking back now it was eerie,"" says Aprilla. ""Almost as if Grace knew she had limited time so had to excel and do everything."" We thought through it all she was going to survive."" The headaches had begun in the summer of 2001 while Grace was on a gap year working at children's camps in France. She came home in the August and was diagnosed with a brain tumour in September. Grace underwent radiotherapy at the Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, her family camping nearby throughout. However, Jacob stayed at home. ""Because he was younger we did not tell Jacob a lot of what was happening,"" says his mother. ""We thought through it all she was going to survive."" I thought it was a very strange request for her."" After six months Grace's cancer returned and her only hope was an operation in Belgium. Grace went to Belgium, the operation was only a partial success. The tumour returned. This time it was terminal. Grace died on 18 December 2002. She was 20. After her death, Grace's ashes were kept in the airing cupboard, her ""favourite place in the house"". She had asked for them to be kept until another family member died. She had been afraid of being scattered alone. It surprised Dabriella. ""I thought it was a very strange request for her,"" she says. ""She had always been such an independent person, it was just very un-Grace."" Eleven years later, following the death of her grandmother, arrangements were finally being made to scatter their ashes together. Then, a day before the planned ritual, Grace's younger brother died. She was no longer alone. Jacob was 17 when Grace died and her death had a devastating impact on him. It changed his view of life. He believed her energy transferred into him. This inspired him to ""throw everything to the wind and give it a try,"" his girlfriend Rachel says. ""He thought, as a young beautiful woman she did not do anything in life to deserve that, there was no karma to it, it was just cruel. ""He felt like he needed to live his life for her as well as for himself. ""Maybe that's why he lived his life twice as hard."" On a board in his bedroom, a teenage Jacob had laid bare his ambition. ""I am becoming a world famous photographer and filmer,"" he had written. ""I will concentrate my mind on this desire for 10 minutes daily for the purpose of determining just how I shall transform it into reality. ""I will permit nothing to intervene with my doing so."" The photography normally went hand in hand with his other obsession - taking risks. He would usually be armed with a camera during each daredevil escapade and was prepared to do anything to get the best shots. Jacob pushed himself to greater extremes. He taught himself to hold his breath for long periods so he could explore the depths. He would also surf over rocks or towards cliffs.The danger of it all was part of the draw. ""He and his friends dared to surf where others did not,"" says Gary Richards, a friend who had known Jacob since babysitting him. ""They wanted to catch the bigger waves and do bigger tricks."" After he and his friends surfed a storm in Newlyn in 2008, numerous national newspapers splashed with this photograph showing Jacob moments before he was struck by a huge wave. A regular stunt was to throw himself from tall buildings into the water below, such as the three-storey Abbey Warehouse in Penzance harbour. He received a police caution after leaping from a railway bridge in Hayle. And on another occasion, he jumped into the harbour outside Bosun’s Locker Nightclub in Penzance and had to be rescued from being crushed by a ship. Zain Ishmael was one of those who came to his aid, forming a four-man human chain with his friends to pull a jubilant Jacob to safety. Everyone cheered, Jacob laughed and then just ran off into the night. ""What a crazy cat,"" Zain recalled. Jacob was 17 when Grace died and her death had a devastating impact on him.

Everyone cheered, Jacob laughed and then just ran off into the night. ""What a crazy cat,"" Zain recalled. By his early 20s, he had won awards from National Geographic and The Sunday Times. He was a regular contributor to surf magazines, often providing the much-coveted cover shot. Most of his pictures featured the sea. His shot of a fishing boat returning to port in a large swell won a competition to appear on posters on the London Underground. Weeks before his death, he won a £28,000 expedition to Antarctica, the adventure of a lifetime. Jacob's shot of his friend Seb surfing near a supertanker in Sumatra was the winning image in a travel photography contest run by The Guardian. Judges said the picture would ""stand the test of time"". As well as being a stunning photograph it also epitomised his ethos - the shoot had been ""extremely dangerous"", according to Jacob. Waves bouncing off the great hulk of the hull were wildly unpredictable and just below the surface there were great twists of metal waiting to skewer the unfortunate. Another photograph Jacob entered for the same competition won a photograph of the month prize for August. A selfie of him and his friends partying in a small Cornish pub, its magic-of-the-moment unbridled joy and energy was typical of his style. ""His career was photography but that encompassed so much of what he found important in life,"" says Rachel. ""Everything he did was in symbiosis with the way he lived his life. It was all kind of one big experiment."" The money he earned was quickly spent on new photography gadgets. Prizes, such as a new television, were typically given away to friends. He won expeditions, stays in fancy hotels, exhibition space. One contest saw him win a pair of custom design Nike trainers which he called the Yak 2000, Yak being one of the various nicknames he was known by. He sought new experiences and wanted to capture them all with his camera. One of these was close to his home. It seemed to offer the perfect combination of excitement and visual art. It was the whirlpool. The vortex in Hayle harbour only appeared a few times a year. It was a quirk of Victorian engineering devised to stop the harbour silting up. Water would be stored in a pool at high tide and, once the tide had retreated, released back into the harbour to wash away the sand. The water would get into the pool through a tunnel beneath a quay. But once every spring tide the sea would come back in faster than the water could pass through the tunnel. This would create the whirlpool. The swift-swirling vortex appealed to Jacob's adventurous spirit and enticed him in. Ignoring the warning signs placed around the sluice, he would swim with the whirlpool and film it. Jacob posted the videos on YouTube where they were watched millions of times, making him hundreds of pounds. The videos are beautiful and hypnotic. They are also terrifying. It was 28 May 2013 when the whirlpool returned. Artist David Raine, who had collaborated with Jacob in the past, was in his living room when he saw his friend running towards the house. Jacob was excited, already wearing his wetsuit and clutching his camera. David agreed to film him as he swam around the whirlpool. By the time he reached the harbour, Jacob was already in the water. He was wearing a rubber horse’s head, a prop he thought would make the video more eyecatching on YouTube. Jacob had already shot a lot of footage but while the whirlpool was there he wanted to make the most of it. David filmed from the quay as a whooping Jacob swirled around the whirlpool's edge. ""It looks a powerful one,"" David called to Jacob. ""Ah yeah, earlier on it was really scary,"" Jacob shouted back. ""It's fine now because it's so deep but when I first got in I was a bit scared to be honest. ""It's safe as now, though."" He let the whirlpool carry him around again. It caught Jacob, tugging him down. ""Woah woah,"" he cackled as he escaped the drag. ""That was pretty scary."" He asked David to pass him a GoPro camera attached to a short pole. Jacob wanted to get one last shot below the surface. Jacob dived down. David watched. Jacob did not reappear. David began to worry. He called his friend's name. David ran across to the other end of the quay where the tunnel the whirlpool funneled into flowed into a pool. He asked a fisherman if he had seen anyone come through, but he hadn't. There was a grill in the ground through which he could see the water churning through the tunnel below. But there was no sign of Jacob. David ran back and forth. Then he saw him. Jacob was in the pool, the tunnel had spat him out. He was floating in the water, face down. David waded out to him. He knew it was too late.

The NHS scandal that killed both my husbandsThe girl who sabotaged her own weddingThe drug causing chaos in prisonsThe man who thinks Europe is being invaded," Liz Hooper never meant to fall in love with two haemophiliacs, any more than she ever intended to be widowed twice. But fall in love with them is what she did, one after the other. And now they are gone, she says, her heart overflows for both men equally. Sometimes Liz wonders what the chances must have been. A million to one? More? They were such wildly different characters. Jeremy was loud, gregarious, an extrovert - at 6ft and 17 stone, as large a character as he was a physical presence. Paul was his opposite, slightly built, quiet and dry-witted, a gentle man as well as a gentleman. And what she felt for each of them was singular, unique. Jeremy was her first love, she says, and Paul was her soulmate. But probabilities aren’t something Liz dwells upon much, barely six months after Paul’s death and almost a decade after Jeremy’s. It's still too painful to contemplate. What united Jeremy and Paul, as well as their love for Liz and her love for them, was the scandal that killed both men. It's been called the biggest in the history of the National Health Service, and campaigners say it has resulted in the deaths of at least 2,883 British haemophiliacs - though no-one has yet been held accountable. During treatment for haemophilia, Jeremy and Paul were given contaminated blood products, and they died horribly as a result. If Liz hadn’t lost Jeremy, she wouldn’t have met Paul. And that’s a bittersweet pill for her to take, she says, as she sits in her living room and recalls them both. “Because I’d wish neither of them dead, but I wouldn't want my life without either of them in it.” In 1978, when Liz was 13, a special assembly was called for the third year at Kineton High School in rural Warwickshire. The headmaster stood up and announced that a new pupil would soon be joining them and that he had a disease that meant his blood didn’t clot - so no-one was to pick on him and no-one was to fight with him. Liz - then Liz Byng - was intrigued about this boy who was special enough to warrant his own assembly. Soon afterwards, Jeremy Foyle arrived at the school gates. He was far from the delicate child the headmaster’s warning might have implied. Short, plump and sporting a pudding-bowl haircut, Jeremy was a Chelsea supporter with a London accent - a Jack-the-lad type, Liz recalls, prone to settling arguments with his fists (he was outraged when he learned about the assembly). Because he arrived mid-way through the school year, he was slotted into whichever classes had space for him, and one of these was, improbably, Liz’s needlework class. Her first impression was that he was, as she puts it, an obnoxious little git. Jeremy was born on 17 April 1965 in Sutton, on the border between Surrey and south-west London, with severe haemophilia B. The diagnosis arrived relatively late, at the age of nine, after a series of bleeds left him on a plasma drip with both legs in traction. His parents moved to Kineton so he could be closer to the specialist haematology unit at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, about an hour's drive away. Despite the severity of his condition, Jeremy went out of his way to disregard the advice of his doctors. When they warned him that getting into playground fights wasn’t good for him, he went out and joined a boxing club. As he grew older, he made a point of turning up to hospital appointments on a motorbike. From across their needlework class, Jeremy would pass Liz notes asking her to the village disco. Liz wasn't interested. They moved in different circles. Liz was a country girl who liked riding horses. Jeremy became a punk, spiking up his hair with egg whites, going to gigs and drinking too much. After their O-levels, Liz stayed on at school while Jeremy dropped out. “I didn’t see him, other than just around the village, looking like a pillock with his punk hair,” she recalls. Matthew was infected with HIV at the age of eight.Read his story here: In 1982, when Liz was 16, she went to a school end-of-year party in the village hall. Jeremy gatecrashed, and when she spotted him at the door Liz was astonished at how he’d changed. He’d shot up in height. The spiky haircut and the puppy fat had gone. He was dressed like the singer of some post-punk band: black Doc Marten boots, narrow black jeans, a grey shirt and a vintage German military jacket. “He’d become a proper man,” says Liz. In an instant she realised she had fallen headlong in love with him. “I was just totally besotted. And it was mutual because he made a beeline for me.” Jeremy stayed by Liz’s side all night. When it was time to leave, he gave her his packet of John Player Special Silver with a handful of cigarettes inside. Liz would hold on to it for years. Then he told her to listen to the song that was playing. It was Only You by Yazoo, and five years later it would be the first dance at their wedding. After the disco, Liz wrote in her diary: “JEZ LUVS LIZ LUVS JEZ,” and drew a heart around it. They were now a couple, and inseparable. Jeremy began proving he was more than a rebellious school dropout. After landing a job behind the counter of a builders' merchant, he discovered he had a talent for making sales. “He could sell a fridge to an Eskimo,” says Liz. He rose from the counter to a series of roles as a sales rep and, eventually, as a company sales and marketing director. “He was very driven,” she says. It seemed to her that he had to prove to the world he could achieve things in spite of his illness. “I think being a haemophiliac made him more motivated.” Over time, Jeremy’s drive brought material rewards: a detached home, fast cars in the driveway - at one stage, a Lotus Europa for him, an Escort XR3 for her - and holidays to New York, Las Vegas and Egypt. They had a wide circle of friends, and Jeremy would hold court at barbecues and parties. “If you were in a crowded room, you always knew Jeremy was there,” Liz says. “He was always the life and soul of the party.” But there was another side to Jeremy that he mostly managed to keep hidden from his friends and co-workers. His bleeds left him in great pain and restricted his mobility - his blood would fill the cavities of his leg joints, making movement extremely uncomfortable. In the 1970s and 80s, a new treatment for haemophiliacs was hailed as a wonder drug. Those with the condition (mostly men) were given injections of proteins called factor concentrates - usually Factor VIII or, in Jeremy’s case, Factor IX - that helped clot their blood. They were made from donated blood plasma, and demand was so high that the NHS began importing them from abroad, including the US. If Jeremy had a particularly bad bleed, he’d need to use two large syringes to apply the Factor IX, and Liz would help change them over. “It wasn’t just a case of him being this lovely, gregarious, vibrant person. I also knew the fragile person that other people didn’t see. I've sat with him when he cried because he was in so much pain from a bleed.” Occasionally there would be reports on the evening news about a scandal involving the blood of haemophiliacs being contaminated with infectious diseases. But generally Jeremy felt fine and mostly didn't pay his condition much notice. “He was living a normal life, a happy normal life, he was doing what he wanted, when he wanted. He didn’t want to know anything else,” says Liz. In 1993, the couple’s son, Lewis, was born. And then one day, three years later, Jeremy answered a phone call from the hospital. He needed to come in, and could his wife accompany him? The doctor had bad news. Jeremy had a disease called hepatitis C. At some stage he’d been given Factor IX contaminated with the virus. The problem was the imported factor concentrates. Many of the US donors came from the fringes of society - prison inmates, prostitutes and drug addicts - and were often paid for donating their blood. The products were made in huge vats from the plasma of tens of thousands of people. Just one donation infected with a virus would be enough to contaminate the whole batch. As early as 1974, warnings had been raised about the safety of Factors VIII and IX and in 1975 the Health Secretary David Owen told Parliament that the UK aimed to be self-sufficient in blood products within two to three years. It wasn't. Eight years later, as the Aids crisis unfolded, US blood products were still coming in. The Department of Health received expert advice that they should be withdrawn, but this was not heeded until 1986 - a further three years later. It wasn’t only haemophiliacs who were affected – it is feared that tens of thousands of non-haemophiliacs may have been infected through blood transfusions, too. It turned out Jeremy had been infected 10 years earlier, and he was livid. “Oh, he was fuming,” says Liz. “The language was foul.” Above all, he was furious because he feared he had passed the virus on to Liz and Lewis. There was an anxious wait before his wife's test results came back negative, which meant his son was in the clear too. Hepatitis C primarily attacks the liver. It wasn't unusual that Jeremy hadn’t noticed anything was wrong - the disease doesn’t have any noticeable symptoms until the organ is seriously damaged. It can then lead to cirrhosis - scarring - of the liver tissue, and ultimately to liver failure and cancer. Jeremy attempted to carry on as normal, but when he began to feel tired and lethargic he was offered experimental treatments that it was hoped would kill the virus - ribaviron tablets and injections of interferon. “He was on that for six months and it was the most horrific thing,” says Liz. The drugs made him nauseous, he was unable to sleep and he became aggressive and short-tempered. “It was probably the closest he and I ever came to being divorced,” says Liz. Each evening he would come home from work and shut himself away from his son and his wife. Liz took it personally, but later, after coming off the drugs, he explained that he hadn’t wanted to inflict his mood swings on them. “He was in such a dark place,” Liz says. After the six-month course of treatment was finished, Jeremy was tested for the virus, and the drugs hadn’t shifted it. “It was six months of total hell for no reason,” says Liz. Jeremy couldn’t face going back on the medication again. He preferred to live with the risk of liver failure rather than put his family through that a second time. So he resolved to struggle on and his and Liz’s relationship returned to normal. He was still feeling tired, but he never knew to what extent this was simply down to the pressures of a stressful job. Over time he began feeling stomach pains, but an endoscopy didn’t reveal anything untoward. He and Liz both knew the risks, and while both were dimly aware that haemophiliacs infected during the 1980s were dropping dead, neither was fully aware of the scale of the problem. “He was scared, but his way of dealing with it was just to be flippant about it,” says Liz. “He always said: ‘Well, you know, I don’t want to make old bones.’” On 7 December 2008, the family sat down to breakfast as normal. Lewis, now 15, caught his bus to school. Liz went to the insurance company office where she worked part-time handling claims. Not long before lunchtime, she was in a meeting when a colleague knocked on the door. The mobile phone she had left on her desk was going off. It was Jeremy. “Please can you come home?” he asked. “I’m really not very well.” Liz raced back to the house and called out Jeremy's name as she stepped through the front door. No-one answered. She went upstairs and opened the bathroom door. “It was absolutely horrific,” she says. There was bright red blood everywhere. Then she went to the bedroom. Jeremy was lying on the bed, ashen-faced. The colour had drained from his lips. Barely conscious, he told Liz he’d been vomiting blood. She rang an ambulance. Paramedics arrived to take him to hospital. He was booked in for an endoscopy to see what was wrong. The next morning, before he went in for the examination, Jeremy told Liz: “Right, I’m going to get this done and then I’m going home and I want to have a hot bath and a big cup of tea with sugar.” He didn’t normally take sugar, only on special occasions, as a treat. Those were the last words he ever said to Liz. The endoscope was put down his throat, but it didn’t get very far before an internal bleed erupted. He then had a cardiac arrest. The medical staff resuscitated him and rushed him into surgery. A doctor summoned Liz to tell her what had happened. “I knew from his expression what he was going to say,” she recalls. There was nothing they could do. “I still feel ashamed of myself,” Liz says. “I remember getting on the floor in front of the doctor. I held my arms out and I said to him: ‘Take my blood because if you take my blood, he’ll have it.’” The doctor told her it was too late for that. The doctor asked if she wanted to see Jeremy. She did, but she would later deeply regret setting foot inside the operating theatre. There was blood everywhere. “It was coming out of his mouth and out of his nose and even the corners of his eyes. His body was just rejecting everything.” She couldn’t stay with him. “It’s a memory that I’ve got etched in my mind and it was just like something from a horror film.” Just before midnight, Liz received a call telling her that Jeremy had died. He was 43 years old. Liz had had no idea that Jeremy, who was never a big drinker, had developed cirrhosis of the liver. On his death certificate, hepatitis C was listed as a cause. “We just assumed that because of him being a haemophiliac he’d bled to death,” Liz says. But the doctors told her it wasn't the haemophilia that ultimately did for him. Because his liver was so badly scarred, it had become harder for his body to move blood through it. So it had opened up a new vessel to transport the blood - but this “wasn’t up to the job” and ruptured. “It was the hepatitis C. The total cause of his death was hepatitis C.” Before she could mourn Jeremy, before she could face up to the loss of the man she had loved for 26 years and confront his horrific death, Liz had to go into survival mode. She didn’t know where to begin. Jeremy had always looked after their finances. He had been on a good wage, and her part-time salary wasn’t enough to cover the mortgage. Despite the scale of the contaminated blood scandal, there was very little in the way of compensation. She was eligible for £25,000 from the Skipton Fund, set up to make payments to people infected with hepatitis C through NHS blood products. But this was a drop in the ocean. She sold the house. Lewis, still only 15, went through the legal paperwork with her - and found a smaller place to live. One night, not long after she and Lewis had settled in, she sat down to dinner and lifted a fork of spaghetti Bolognese. Before it reached her face, a force hit her, as though someone had punched her in the stomach. “I just went to pieces,” she says. “I cried and cried and cried and cried and I couldn't talk.” The grief was like nothing Liz had ever experienced. It manifested in her as a searing physical pain, like burning coals in her stomach and hot rods poking into every part of her body. “I had a total and utter catastrophic breakdown,” she says. “I couldn't speak to anybody, I didn’t want people to talk to me, I didn’t want to open my mouth. I just wanted to sit in a corner with a duvet over my head. That was a very, very dark time for me.” It hurt even to make decisions, even whether or not she wanted Marmite on her toast. “He’d been my life,” she says. “He was my everything. He was my first love, and it was an all-consuming love. I took him and loved him and I loved all the bad parts as well as all the good parts. To me, he was the most perfect human being.” As she finally began to emerge from the lowest depths of her grief, it was Liz’s son who told her she had to start engaging with the outside world again. “This is just stupid, Mum,” he told her. He set up a profile for her on Facebook. This was 2009 and Liz didn’t know what Facebook was. One day she left a comment below a friend’s post - she can’t remember what, something throwaway - and someone replied to her. His name was Paul Hooper, and he was a friend of a friend. Liz responded to Paul’s response, and he responded again. Then he sent her a friend request. They exchanged private messages - “How old are you?”, “I keep dogs”, “I love dogs too” - and private messaging turned into texting and texting turned into phone calls, two or three times a day. They spoke about their childhoods and Liz mentioned that she was a widow. Then Paul happened to mention, in passing, that he was “poorly”. You can’t just say something like that and leave it hanging there, Liz told him. Poorly with what? Paul told her he was a haemophiliac. She explained that she knew all about the condition, told him about her late husband. “I’d lived with it so there was nothing he could tell me that would shock me.” The coincidence was striking. “I wasn’t looking for another husband, let alone a husband that had haemophilia,” she says. But that was how things turned out. One weekend, Paul and Liz travelled up to Cambridgeshire to the house of a friend of Liz's. When they finally met in person, it was apparent from the start they were quite different characters - Paul a quiet, taciturn Brummie, Liz more gregarious, an outdoorsy type. But they hit it off immediately. “It was like a coming-together of two old friends that had been brought up together,” says Liz. “It was like I’d known him for years.” He was gently spoken with a quick, dry wit. He called Liz his “posh bird”. To her, he was “Hoops”. He’d stand up when ladies entered the room. He was quite unlike anyone she'd met before. “He was the opposite to Jeremy,” she says. He wasn't particularly outgoing. He wasn’t much interested in material possessions either, apart from his beloved cameras, which went everywhere with him. Before their relationship became physical, Paul mentioned that he had HIV as well as hepatitis C - he was one of about 1,250 haemophiliacs infected with both as a result of the contaminated blood scandal. Liz didn’t have any experience of HIV, but she knew it wasn’t something she had to worry about as long as the two of them used protection. Paul William Hooper was born on 16 January 1964 in Birmingham, and unlike Jeremy - who had no close relatives with the condition - everyone around him had been acutely conscious of his haemophilia from birth. His grandfather and a cousin had it too and, instead of attending a mainstream school, Paul was sent to one for children with physical disabilities. He’d worked as a civil servant, but had been made redundant after his employers found out he was HIV-positive. He always described himself as “medically retired”. He kept himself busy with activism. He was part of the campaign to get to the bottom of why the contaminated blood scandal had happened in the first place. He’d go on demonstrations and visit Downing Street bearing petitions demanding answers. But beyond his campaigning, Paul had become somewhat reclusive since losing his job - in fact, he’d barely left the house after he was mugged twice near his home in Walsall. Both he and Liz were emerging from dark periods of isolation when they met each other. He’d stopped taking combination-therapy drugs for his HIV until Liz told him he was being selfish and ordered him to go back on them. “We saved one another,” Liz says. “We came together at a time when we both needed one another. He helped me crawl out of that horrible place I was in.” Liz could always recall the date of every significant anniversary with Jeremy. But with Paul it always felt to her as though the calendar was irrelevant and time was out of sync. “It was like - we got married in 2011, but we’d known each other since 1896,” she says. “The first time that we met, it was almost like we’d just carried on a conversation we’d been having a few years before.” By the time they moved in together in Kineton, Liz and Paul had settled into the routine of a happy middle-aged couple. Paul’s mobility was much better than Jeremy’s had been, and they’d go bimbling - a Brummieism of Paul’s meaning “wandering semi-aimlessly” - around the shops in Stratford-upon-Avon, and take trips to Bath and Paris. There was a village near their home called Wellesbourne that had a small airfield, and they’d go to watch the planes take off and land. While his movement was better than Jeremy’s, overall Paul’s illness had a much greater impact on his life. There were endless hospital visits and check-ups - for the HIV, the hepatitis C and the haemophilia. Paul couldn’t drive so Liz would have to accompany him to the clinics. She was learning for the first time the scale of the contaminated blood scandal. “Paul really opened my eyes to it,” she says. On one occasion a doctor mentioned that he had high blood pressure. Then one morning in November 2015, Paul woke up with a headache that wouldn’t go away. When it finally cleared up, he told Liz he had a “wiggle” in his line of sight. Eventually, it turned into a blind spot. When he went to the hospital to get it checked out, the doctors found his blood pressure had sky-rocketed. He’d had a stroke, and his eyesight deteriorated over the next few months to the point where he was registered blind. Paul’s loss of sight transformed the couple’s relationship. Bimbling around town was no longer possible. Paul was terrified of making a fool of himself and didn’t like to leave the house much. Liz dressed him, cut up his food, trimmed his beard. Doing his injections became a task that took hours. It brought them close together, but they were trapped indoors. The most devastating thing for Paul was that he could no longer make his posh bird a cup of tea. One day they made a rare visit to a cafe in Wellesbourne. Paul wore wrap-around dark glasses because the sunlight hurt his eyes. It was the first time since he’d lost his sight that he’d eaten out. He was worried about spilling food all over his plate. Paul ate his scampi and chips and drank his tea and listened to the planes landing, and he began crying. Paul’s health was now precarious. He’d have seizures and, one day when he had been hospitalised for sepsis, a doctor warned Liz that he could die at five minutes’ notice. But somehow he kept bouncing back. His sight was gone for good but his sense of humour was intact. Over time Paul and Liz settled into a kind of routine. She was optimistic. “He’d be back to being my Hoops,” Liz says.“Going about his business, laughing and joking and taking the mickey out of me and making me laugh.” One morning Paul woke up and told Liz he didn’t want breakfast, as he was feeling a bit bloated. Liz didn’t think much of it. Paul had seemed to be having one of his better phases health-wise, and the two of them had been planning a week’s holiday in Devon together. She left him in bed and popped out to walk the dogs. When she returned, half an hour later, she realised he was iller than either of them had thought. He vomited on the bed and lost control of his bowels. Liz helped him up on to a commode they kept in the room, stripped him off and began cleaning him up. “I’m all right, I’m all right,” he insisted, but Liz thought otherwise. She dialled 999. A paramedic was on the scene within minutes and, after checking Paul, he called an air ambulance. The helicopter landed on a playing field next to their house. Liz held her husband, his head on her chest, as the house became filled with people and noise. “Don’t you be dying on me, Hoopy,” Liz told Paul. “Don’t be daft, you silly woman. I’m not going anywhere.” There were now so many medical staff in the bedroom that there wasn’t room for Liz. From downstairs, she could hear all hell breaking loose. A doctor emerged to tell her that Paul had had a cardiac arrest and they had resuscitated him with a defibrillator. “Prepare yourself for the worst,” the doctor told Liz. Paul was raced to hospital and Liz followed. When she arrived, the doctors told her that he’d had two more cardiac arrests on the way. There wasn’t much more they could do for him. Liz went into the intensive care unit to say her goodbyes. He wasn't conscious and unlike Jeremy, when she'd last seen him, Paul looked peaceful. Liz told him that she loved him, that he wasn’t to worry, that she would take care of everything. Liz had known from the early days of their relationship that she was likely to outlive Paul but he'd been in a good place when he died, apart from his blindness. “I knew that he was not going to be with me forever,” she says. “In my naivety, I suppose, I just thought I’d get him a bit longer.” Paul died on 1 December 2017. He was 53. On his death certificate, hepatitis C was listed among the causes. For the second time in less than a decade, the tainted blood scandal had left Liz bereaved. In the small cottage she shared with Paul, Liz sits on her sofa and sips from a mug of tea. A pendant containing some of Paul’s ashes hangs around her neck. Six months have passed since she lost him, but grief hasn’t yet consumed her. There has been too much to sort out and too much to process. She has cried, but she hasn’t yet fallen to her knees and sobbed her heart out, as she knows she will. “At the moment, you’re meeting me in that phase I was in with Jeremy where I knew I had to get my son safe,” she tells me. “I’m marching. My feet are going one in front of the other. When I get to that point, and not until I get to that point, can I allow myself to stop and think about what’s actually gone on.” As Liz was Paul’s full-time carer, most of her income died with him. There were seven years left on their mortgage and now the house is on the market. When the sale goes through she will move in with her mother, who lives nearby, and then she will begin to grieve. “It’s likedeja vu,” she says. “But I’m taking my anti-depressants, and I’m not going back to that place I was in with Jeremy. I do not want to hit that wall, which is a very real fear for me.” While she hasn’t had long to mourn, Liz has had a little time to reflect on the public inquiry into the use of infected blood that recently began its investigative work. Chaired by Sir Brian Langstaff, it is the culmination of decades of campaigning by victims and their loved ones. According to the pressure group Tainted Blood, Paul is one of more than 70 victims who died between the government announcing the inquiry would take place and it actually beginning. She isn’t interested in compensation. Nor is she getting her hopes up that the inquiry will deliver justice, or indeed answers. The entire contaminated blood community has been through too many disappointments for that. But she desperately hopes it does. “We’ve been hurt in the most horrific ways. Our menfolk have been killed in the most horrific manner - they’ve been poisoned and slowly allowed to die,"" she says. “I mean, Jeremy, for God’s sake, bloody bleeding to death, you can’t begin to imagine. My Paul, Hoops, lying on the bedroom floor, covered in vomit and crap, just bloody horrendous. They were both fantastic men, they were salt-of-the-Earth, God’s honest-to-goodness men who deserved their lives, they didn’t deserve what they had done to them.” She knows that she isn't a political animal, the kind of person who could go to London and campaign and lobby her MP. She’s used to trees and open space, not people and brickwork. All she can do for her husbands is let the world know who they were, she tells me. ""Use my words,"" she says, quietly and firmly. ""Use as much as you want. Tell everyone what happened to Paul and Jeremy. “I’m bloody honoured to have known both of them, I really am. I’ve been a privileged, privileged woman. I had my first love and I had my soulmate. They’ll always be with me and I will love both of them equally and my heart overflows with love for the pair of them. They’re amazing men, and they need their stories told, both of them.” Built with Shorthand"
The girl who sabotaged her own weddingThe drug causing chaos in prisonsThe man who thinks Europe is being invaded," On the morning of any wedding there’s a lot of preparation. On 4 November, Monika’s hair needed doing and her make-up had to be artfully applied. The bride needed her maroon wedding sari put on, as tradition dictated. The jewellery set aside for this special day had to be placed on her ears and nose and draped across her neck. For this Indian wedding, her hands needed to be daubed with intricate swirls of henna too. There was so much to do. But with only a few hours to go until the ceremony, no-one noticed as the bride herself quietly slipped into the shadows of the family home to make one last phone call. It was not to a friend, or a caterer, or the wedding venue to check everything was going smoothly. Instead, nervously, Monika dialled four digits - 1098 - the number of a helpline. Too young to marry under Indian law, Monika wanted to stop her own wedding. She was 13 when her marriage was meant to happen. That’s according to the charity that helped her, and comes from her school records. Her parents claim she’s more like 17. It’s common in this part of India for the ages of some people to be a little hazy. Birth certificates often don’t exist for poor families like Monika’s. What is not in doubt is that she is still a child, and that the law only allows marriage at 18. The city may not be as well known a tourist location as Jaipur or Jodhpur but it is still one of those places which assails every sense. Ganesh passed grocery stalls piled high with a rainbow of vegetables and endured the piercing horns of tuk-tuks hurtling through the streets and the smell of fresh camel dung at the roadside. On his return later that evening, he and Monika’s mother, Sita, sat their daughter down and told her that they had found her someone to marry. “Mummy and Papa told me they’d found a boy for me in Churu [115 miles away] and that he was very nice and educated and worked as a labourer,” recalls Monika. I felt that I was too young and that I shouldn’t marry - I wanted to get an education and become a teacher” When I ask her to describe her then husband-to-be she says simply, without any drama or emotion, that she had never met him but her parents did show her a photograph. He was 22. As an obedient daughter, her first instinct was to do as her parents wished but her emotions were in turmoil. “I felt that I was too young and that I shouldn’t marry. I wanted to get an education and become a teacher.” Monika pleaded with her parents. “I told them that I didn’t want to get married, and they asked why, so I explained that a girl should be at least 18 years old.” Marriage would have meant a life of isolation. Her prospective husband lived a four-hour train journey away from her own family.  “After getting married, life would have been spent only in this new home. Nobody would have allowed me to play, or talk, and I would have had to take care of all the household chores. My in-laws would have made me do a lot of work - and only work.” So why did Monika’s parents think it was right to marry off their daughter so young?

My in-laws would have made me do a lot of work - and only work.” So why did Monika’s parents think it was right to marry off their daughter so young? As we sit and drink tea in the small, simply tiled courtyard of their home, it’s clear Ganesh and Sita are loving parents to their five daughters, but life is a struggle. Ganesh earns 500 rupees a day (£5.50) and his work is sporadic. His bike is propped against the yard wall, ready if a job suddenly comes up. The family is from the Valmiki - or sweeper - caste. In the past, that would have meant they were classed in the untouchables of Indian society. Even today they are very much on the fringes of their local community and they only mix with other families from the same caste. Monika’s mother and grandmother clear waste from houses in the neighbourhood. As is often the case with families from this background, the older daughters have only received a little education. Indeed, when I ask Monika how many school friends she has, she replies matter-of-factly that she doesn’t have any. Her studies seem to have petered out. It sounds like a solitary existence for a teenager. Stacked in the corner of one of the rooms off the courtyard is a pile of furniture. It includes a sturdy chest with a lock on it and a brand new fridge in all its original packaging. This is puzzling as the house doesn’t appear to have a working fridge of its own. Ganesh This jealously guarded hoard is Monika’s dowry - painstakingly saved up by her father for the day she marries. Ganesh sees his prime responsibility as getting his daughters married and settled down. His eldest daughter, Rajini, was due to marry legally in November. Her groom had a brother and Monika’s family thought it made sense to have a double wedding. “We thought that if we marry two daughters at the same time then the costs would only be for one wedding and not two,” explains her father. “We are a family of labourers and sometimes I get jobs in construction work but sometimes I don’t. We thought since we are marrying our one child we will marry another one and save on the expense.” But what they had planned for Monika was illegal under Indian law. Ganesh looks awkwardly at his hands. “We did know that it is a criminal offence. We did feel bad.” Sita For Sita, though, it’s as if their circumstances didn’t leave them much choice. “What should we do?” she says as she shrugs her shoulders. The marriage was also arranged with Monika’s personal safety in mind, Sita argues. “When we go out for work, we worry about leaving our daughter alone at home as the neighbourhood where we live is unsafe. It was out of the fear for her security that we thought that we would marry off both sisters together.” These kind of multiple marriages are common in Rajasthan. Often, only the oldest girl’s name is mentioned on the invitation. It makes it much harder for the authorities to detect a child marriage when there is the cover of a perfectly legal marriage happening simultaneously. But in Monika’s case the authorities received a tip-off. It came from the bride herself. As Monika sits alongside her parents and recounts her story, she seems to bear them no ill will. But last year, as the wedding drew nearer, it must have been a time of immense tension. She does not appear to be a natural teenage rebel and her shy mannerisms suggest a girl who is still finding her own voice in the world. Yet somewhere within she found the strength to kick back against the plans her family had made. The trigger point for Monika came on the wedding day. “When I saw my sister wearing her wedding dress, I realised that only she could do this - I just couldn’t.” Her gut feeling drove her to call the national hotline - ChildLine. Monika had seen the easy-to-remember number - 10-9-8 - in books. She borrowed a phone from her unwitting grandmother and rang. The wedding was then only hours away. She was afraid but this was her last resort. “I called up and I don’t know who picked up the phone but I told them everything - that I’m young and I don’t want to get married and want to study further. “I asked them ‘can you please do something that stops my marriage?’.” The helpline operator in Delhi tried to calm her down. They took details of her location and the time of the wedding. The message, Monika recalls, was “don’t worry we’re on our way”. She’s often in a race against time to save young girls from becoming child brides and can be seen zipping around town on her small white moped. “We had a tricky challenge as we had to save a child in just three hours’ time,” Preeti says. Over the phone, she managed to win Monika’s trust and talk her through what would happen next. Local police were scrambled and arrived at Monika’s house at about 17:00. The officers asked to see the paperwork - of which there was little - and after establishing that the bride was underage they warned everyone that the wedding could not take place. But the family ignored the police and at 20:00 Monika rang Preeti again. Her parents had changed the wedding venue to her grandmother’s house and were still trying to marry her off. “This was a change of venue to hide the wedding,” explains Preeti. “So we again contacted the police department. Myself, a female constable and two male police officers reached the new venue for the wedding at 22:00.” It was just in the nick of time. “Monika was in her wedding dress and when she saw us she gave a little smile, although she didn’t say anything at that time. She knew that we had come to stop her wedding. She was happy then.” The rest of the wedding party were bemused. “There were relatives all around who were asking each other in low murmurs about why the police had arrived.” No-one knew who had reported the wedding to the police. It is only now that Monika is happy for it to be known that she made the mystery call. The next task for Preeti and the police was to make sure the parents understood the gravity of the situation. “We called Monika’s parents and grandparents into a room and explained that not only does the child suffer because of early marriage but they too could also face a punishment for this offence. “So they stopped the wedding and the police took a written testimony from them promising they would not marry her before the age of 18. They were warned if they went ahead with it a second time then they would have to serve a prison sentence.” Preeti has seen between 20 and 25 cases of child marriage crossing her desk since the beginning of January this year. The winter months are part of the traditional marriage season in Rajasthan. Source:Unicef Child marriage was banned in India in 2006 but it is still widespread. With its huge population, India remains the country with the most child brides, according to Unicef. Preeti sees herself as a big sister figure for girls like Monika and admits to immense job satisfaction. “In my career I have stopped several weddings and when I come into direct contact with these girls we often stay in touch forever. I feel real pride that I am able to help them salvage their lives and protect their futures. It makes me feel happy.” It’s midday in the village of Husangsar in the middle of the Thar Desert in Rajasthan. All around, the sand dunes reflect the fierce sun, dazzling the unprepared visitor. Some of the houses here are just simple wooden huts with parched-looking thatching on top. Local children crowd round a tap on the wall of a schoolhouse - cupping their hands and dipping their heads as they slurp up the water. Inside the girls’ school, I ask the pupils whether they know any friends who have been married young. They turn in unison and point to one of their number who they say was married aged 10. Her name is Pooja. She’s dressed demurely in a caramel-coloured tunic and wearing a beaded necklace. As with Monika, there’s slight confusion over Pooja’s real age. She is in the school year for 14 to 15-year-olds, though she tells me she’s a couple of years older. At first, like any self-conscious teenager, Pooja seems a little intimidated by the sea of faces turned eagerly to hear her story. But, after a nod of encouragement from her teacher, she visibly relaxes and starts to talk: Pooja’s parents have agreed to delaygauna- the moment when a bride is sent to live with her husband’s family and the time when she is expected to have sex. This way, Pooja at least gets to have some schooling and doesn’t suffer the physical complications of early pregnancy. Even so, the message Pooja has had at school is that early marriage is wrong. “Our teacher says a girl should be at least 18 and a boy at least 21 when they wed.” And then she says something that sounds more from the heart than from a textbook: “Girls should be educated. I want to say this to all the villagers - don’t get underage girls married. Don’t ruin their life. If someone does that forcefully, call ChildLine on 10-9-8. This will help stop child marriage.” Outside a crowd of 300 has gathered. They are sitting under a huge awning in the middle of a sandy school playground. Most of them are either children in their school uniforms or from the local boys’ youth club. But the older generations are represented too. Mothers and grandmothers in their diaphanous pink veils and old men in turbans with deep lines etched on their faces. Word goes round that the performance is about to start. They’re all here to see a puppet show staged by the Urmul Trust. The storyline is simple - a young girl named Gudki is told by her father that she is to be married off early. Her mother protests because she wants her daughter to have time to play and develop as a teenager. She pleads with the father to reconsider. He insists, however, so Gudki marries and goes to live with her new family. When the father later pays a visit to the in-laws’ house he discovers his daughter died in childbirth. It may only be a puppet show but many of those in the audience are weeping. Watching from the sidelines is Arvind Ojha, the avuncular figure who leads the Urmul Trust. “Look how totally involved everybody is,” he gestures to the spellbound audience. “With that involvement comes a transformation. We don’t just focus on engaging women and children in these programmes but also older people and even religious leaders. Using folk media is very effective.” He has been working in western Rajasthan since 1986. The state has one of the worst child marriage rates in India - only behind Bihar and West Bengal. According to the National Family Health Survey, 35% of young Rajasthani women are married off before the age of 18 - the national average is 27%. But Ojha is sure that things are improving, mainly because of the way villages have gradually embraced girls’ education. Arvind Ojha, Urmul Trust Before the puppet show audience breaks up for lunch there is a poignant moment where all present - including Pooja and her friends - rise to their feet and raise an arm. The entire village of Husangsar is taking an oath to observe the law and make their community a child marriage-free zone from now on. In the surrounding districts, 178 villages have taken this same oath. Our next stop is the village of Lunkaransar, home to a girls’ boarding school and also in the Thar Desert. It’s a collection of low white buildings with a few Indian lilacs - or neem trees - providing shade in the centre. Here a group of schoolgirls are singing and clapping as they sit on wooden benches. Two or three have even got to their feet and are dancing with all the panache of Bollywood film stars. A formidable young woman named Radika Swami runs this music session. Now in her early 20s, she became something of an activist on child marriage after she was told she would marry aged 17. Radika’s story has some parallels to Monika’s. Radika Swami Both Radika’s mother and grandmother had been child brides so this was not a custom easily broken. But, through the sheer force of her personality, Radika persuaded her father and grandfather to keep her in education and break off the engagement. Now she works as a warden at this school campus teaching other girls about the importance of sticking with their studies. Radika Swami refused to marry in her teens Through music and drama, Radika tries to raise awareness. She has written a play on the subject of female foeticide - the selective abortion of girls in the womb. Although it is supposed to be illegal in India, it is still widely practised in states such as Rajasthan. In 2011, Rajasthan had 888 girls for every 1,000 boys below the age of six. This skewed sex ratio leads to a shortage of girls of marriageable age which, in turn, fuels the demand for child brides. Radika is sure much more needs to be done to involve boys in prevention work.  “Communities can take time in listening to what girls are saying, but with boys they are always heard instantly. So if we work with both sexes then we will get 100% results.” Across the world, 12 million girls every year marry before the age of 18 - that’s one in every five, according to children’s charity Unicef. A decade ago that figure was one in four but new analysis from Unicef suggests there has been significant progress in recent years, particularly in South Asia. In fact, in the past decade a girl in South Asia has seen her risk of being married off early drop from 50% to 30%. India is one of the countries which has led the way. Campaigners say that success now needs to be copied in sub-Saharan Africa. Niger, for example, remains the country with the highest overall rate (76%) of child marriage in the world. Source:Unicef It isn’t only a problem in the developing world. Child marriage even persists in some communities in Europe and North America. The marriageable age in many European countries is 16 with parental consent. There are a number of reasons for the practice. In cases like Monika’s, poverty is key. But campaigners say it’s primarily an issue of gender inequality. “Fundamentally, it happens to girls because they are seen as being less valuable than boys,” says Lakshmi Sundaram from Girls Not Brides, a global partnership of more than 900 civil society organisations. “Girls do not get given the same opportunities as boys. So if a family only has money to send one child to school, they will send the boy and not the girl. If they only have enough food to feed a certain number of their children, they will marry off the girl so that they can consolidate their resources.” Global statistics suggest it is most common in rural areas and child brides are more likely to have low levels of education. According to Sundaram, schools are one of the best forms of protection: “When a girl is in school there’s a feeling from the whole community that this is a student and a child who should be allowed to stay on that trajectory and finish their studies. But as soon as she comes out of that school she’s then seen as a future wife and mother. So families often think ‘why don’t we just hurry it up - what are we waiting for?’.” Many countries now have laws which set the minimum age of marriage at 18 but it is often allowed to be lower with parental consent or the judgement of a court. Campaigners say one of the best strategies is to involve religious leaders or tribal elders in the campaign to end child marriage. Once these figures of authority are on board, public opinion in the wider community can change very quickly. Some countries have started offering cash handouts to families if they agree to leave their daughters in school. Technology can be useful as well. One charity - Vikalp Sansthan - uses phone notifications to warn wedding photographers and make-up artists that their involvement in any underage nuptials will result in legal action. Above all, a better sense of the costs of child marriage is now emerging. This includes not only the physical problems of domestic violence and early pregnancy but the mental toll it takes on young brides too. “Girls... are seen as being less valuable than boys” And there could be an economic dividend from lower population growth and more girls completing their education, staying healthier and getting better jobs. While it is good news that child marriage cases are falling across the world, Sundaram is adamant there’s no room for complacency: “The rates of child marriage are declining but because of population growth the actual numbers of child brides continue to increase. So we have to accelerate progress if those numbers are to come down more dramatically in future.” There’s a commotion outside Monika’s house as word spreads round the neighbourhood that the BBC has come from London to interview her. “Is this about the wedding that was called off?” a nosey neighbour asks our translator. That alone gives you a sense of how big a deal it was for a young girl to report her parents. In a strange way, you can see Monika’s mother is actually proud of what her daughter did. “Yes, I feel good about it,” admits Sita. “I really rather like the idea that my daughter has done it. Change has come for all.” For her part, Monika is certain that she did the right thing and wants her story told: “I am glad that my experience will be shared with others. Maybe some other girl will learn from my case and she too can stop her child marriage. And if she can’t stop it, then I will even help her out myself!” What is so striking about Rajasthan is how girls like Monika are taking the fight against child marriage into their own hands, in a culture where their voices are often not heard. The education these girls receive, though it’s often limited, is teaching them that they should not be married off before 18. It feels inconceivable that 10 or 20 years ago this kind of bottom-up resistance would have existed in poor urban areas or remote desert villages. Back then, girls would have been more pliant in accepting their fate as it was seen by a patriarchal society. Now it seems like there is the prospect of real change. Not everything is perfect for Monika. She tells us wistfully she would like to return to school - something the Urmul Trust is trying to arrange. But as she sits with her new friend, Preeti, on the porch of the family home watching the world go by in the evening twilight, it’s easy to see how just how young she is and what a lucky escape she’s had. A childhood was nearly lost. Now - through an act of teenage rebellion - a childhood has been regained. Built with Shorthand"
The drug causing chaos in prisonsThe man who thinks Europe is being invaded," Warning: Contains offensive language Rob was often the last prisoner into the visitors’ room. On one of Alison’s previous attempts to see her son, he hadn’t turned up at all. The officers simply said they couldn’t find him. Now she was here again on one of the hottest days of summer 2016. The room - big enough to hold 40 tables - was sweltering. Alison and her husband Chris sat down in the middle of the room - waiting and watching intently. A single file of inmates queued - each was methodically patted down before coming in. Alison didn’t look away for a second - she wanted to see Rob the moment he arrived. Despite his distinctive close-cropped red hair, it was sometimes hard to make him out among the identical blue and white check shirts worn by the other prisoners. But this time he was unmissable. Every visitor turned to see Rob enter the room. “He was walking like a zombie with his back arched, completely out of it. I was absolutely shocked,” his mother recalls. Alison leapt up and ran to Rob. Chris, who was queueing for coffee, also rushed to his son. Rob looked on the verge of collapse. Chris called his son’s name, says Alison. “Rob said, ‘Is that you, Dad?’” They brought their son over to where they were sitting. “I was shouting, ‘Can somebody come and help us?’” says Alison. As Rob sat down, she noticed that he had a T-shirt on underneath his prison-issue top - two layers despite the heat. Alison wanted to cool him down. “As I pulled the T-shirt down I noticed that he had ‘twat’ drawn across his chest in Biro.” Alison shouted again for help from nearby prison officers. The medical team escorted Rob out of the visitors’ room and checked him over. They denied he was under the influence of Spice, but his mother was convinced. “It was obvious he’d taken it, we know he had. I was scared for him and I felt that he was humiliated.” Also in the visitors’ room that day was Ben, an inmate who had served time in six prisons and was then inside after a fraud conviction. He was talking to his girlfriend when Rob entered the room. “I’d seen Robert about, always dazed, high all the time.” Rob and Ben were being held on the same wing. But it was only after seeing the episode in the visitors’ room that Ben got to know Rob. “He came in doubled over backwards as if he was going to fall over, sweating. “When the parents sat down I told them, ‘I’ve seen him on my wing, I will keep an eye on him.’” Rob had been transferred to The Mount prison on 11 May 2016 at the age of 24, after serving a large part of his sentence in HMP Peterborough. It marked one of the final stages of a sad decline. He had been someone that people loved. One friend would later describe his “wildly engaging smile and his eccentric sense of humour”. Another wrote: “Swimming in the park on boiling hot days will always stay with me, as will making dens and climbing trees - always in places we shouldn’t.” But Alison had seen a big change in Rob in his penultimate year at secondary school. Previously a sporty child, playing rugby and cricket at county level, he and his friends then started to smoke cannabis. The drug was supplied by one friend in particular. “He was able to supply them with whatever they wanted and they were impressionable. “A lot of his friends got through that stage but for Rob, I realise now, from the age of 18 it affected his mental health. That’s when his behaviour became quite unpredictable.” There is evidence that cannabis can have an effect on teenagers’ mental health. A 2015 study by King’s College London found that the risk of psychosis was five times higher for those who smoked potent cannabis every day compared with non-users. Rob didn’t seem built to cope with addiction. In his early 20s he travelled to India three times.  He had always been interested in the spirituality of India - but his mother thinks he was really just trying to escape from his addiction. On one of his trips he had to be picked up from Dubai airport by his father. Rob had experienced a drug-induced breakdown and was in custody after stealing alcohol from an airport shop. In the year before being sent to prison in the UK, his alcohol and drug addiction led to a string of shoplifting offences and then robbery. One evening in November 2015 he demanded money from a man leaving a supermarket. When the man refused, he punched him in the face. Rob was arrested and pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and theft. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison for those offences, with another three months added from a previous suspended sentence. Alison says Rob was drunk at the time of the robbery and on anti-psychotic medication. He was full of remorse although he had little memory of exactly what he had done. Rob was classed as a vulnerable person on entering prison because he had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychosis. “He finally was sent to prison after he had been diagnosed with a mental illness,” Alison says. “As his family, we were relieved, thinking the prison system will sort this out now.” Warning: Contains offensive language Rob was often the last prisoner into the visitors’ room.

You can still see the remains of the control tower. Another part of the old RAF base holds an outdoor market where you can get everything from cheap trainers to Chinese food. Once a tiny medieval village, Bovingdon expanded rapidly after World War Two and is now a 9,000-strong community, firmly ensconced in the London commuter belt. The prison is home to just under 1,000 men. The names of its wings mostly refer to WW2 bomber pilots - Lakes, Ellis, Fowler, Brister. It’s category C - a closed prison but one where inmates typically serve shorter sentences for more minor crimes. But being the nearest category C prison to London, it has a lot of prisoners from the capital. A lot of inner-city mentality lands in rural Hertfordshire, says Michael (not his real name), a prison officer with two decades of experience who has worked in The Mount. Short-staffing always causes problems. Experienced staff left and were not fully replaced. A high proportion of officers and managers had less than two years’ experience. Many other prisons have also been struggling. In November 2016, the then Justice Secretary Liz Truss announced plans for more funding and for 2,500 extra officers across the system in England and Wales. Up until then officer numbers had fallen from about 25,000 in 2010 to just 18,000. “A lot of problems are caused by staff shortages,” says Michael. But while staff shortages have caused many prisons to struggle, another factor has pushed some to the brink - Spice. Spice was originally a brand name but has come to be used generically for a number of synthetic replacements for cannabis created from the 1980s onwards. These substances were designed to mimic cannabis, but some experts say they can be up to 100 times more potent. Soon after their invention they were being used recreationally, marketed as “legal highs”. A rapid spread was to follow. By 2012, the drug was beginning to have a foothold in British prisons and by 2015 it was everywhere. Spice became illegal in May 2016, under the Psychoactive Substances Act. There was some progress, but the change in the law did not stop the drugs getting into prison. Ministry of Justice figures obtained by the BBC show Spice seizures in the six months after the ban were 20% down in prisons in England and Wales. But not a single month passed without Spice being seized in The Mount between October 2015 and June 2017. Every night, drones would fly in to deliver the drug, taking advantage of the absence of netting, a report by the prison's independent monitoring board noted. That was addressed and drone deliveries were declining, its report suggested last year, but drugs were still getting in. In February this year, 50 prisoners were randomly tested - 24 had taken a drug of some kind. Lots of prisons have problems with Spice, and the effect of this drug on prison life is chilling. “Spice is the worst drug I’ve ever seen,” says Michael, whose duties included administering drug tests. “Unless you see a full-on Spice attack you can’t imagine. It’s like they’re absolutely paralytically drunk but can also speak. “If you didn’t know better you would say they were fitting. It’s extreme.” As well as these dramatic zombie-like “attacks”, Spice has also been linked to a wave of self-inflicted deaths in prison. Figures from the Prison Ombudsman show that 79 prisoners died in England and Wales between June 2013 and September 2016 who were either known to use synthetic cannabinoids, or were strongly suspected to have taken them before death. In 42 concluded inquests from this period, 27 of the deaths were deemed to be self-inflicted. Michael says problems connected with Spice exacerbate short-staffing. He remembers three or four ambulances attending The Mount in a single day for separate Spice attacks. Officers have to accompany inmates to hospital. “The impact on staff is demoralising. For each person in hospital, that takes four staff out of the system for 24 hours.” In November 2016 alone there were 70 emergency service call outs, mainly for drug-related problems. More than half of those occurred in a single week. And the popularity of the drug in prisons creates a dangerous Spice economy.

More than half of those occurred in a single week. And the popularity of the drug in prisons creates a dangerous Spice economy. Like many other prisons, Spice was easy to get hold of in The Mount. But there were reports of a particularly virulent strain. It was known simply as Death. This type of Spice was widely available and led to a number of hospital visits, the prison’s Independent Monitoring Board said. Ben says cannabis was everywhere too. “When you come into my wing you smell so much weed, more than I’ve ever smelt outside. “Even an idiot officer comes to the wing, which they do every hour, and knows somebody’s smoking it there.” Once the drugs were in, many prisoners would do anything to get hold of them. The debt culture was so acute in The Mount, Michael says, that prisoners who owed money and goods to others were deliberately offending so they could get into the prison’s segregation unit, or be transferred to another prison. Ben remembers one particularly vicious assault in The Mount. “I went down to the laundry and four or five guys started on someone, punching and kicking him in the face. “It was so ferocious. His face was so mashed up he looked like he’d been hit by a car.” Ben was told the inmate was attacked because he had not settled a debt. While Rob was in The Mount, Alison received phone calls as regularly as once a week from her son on different prisoners’ mobile phones. Each time he was asking her to transfer money. “He told me it was for tobacco and if he didn’t get the money he would be beaten up. “I think what had happened was Robert has been given Spice on tick [credit] and then he had to pay it back.” Alison says she typically paid £25 each time. “I was scared for him. It’s very difficult.” Like many other prisons, Spice was easy to get hold of in The Mount. But there were reports of a particularly virulent strain. It was known simply as Death.

It’s very difficult.” Ben says addicts like Rob are especially vulnerable to bullying in prison. In Rob’s case he would buy things from “canteen” and then give them to other prisoners. Canteen is in effect a shop where each prisoner has a set allowance to spend and the goods are collected on Fridays. “Rob never spent any money from his canteen [on things for himself],” says Ben. “I told the officers, ‘Stop his canteen, let’s see who’s taking this from him because he’s got nothing in his room.’ “Who is it taking it from him? If he’s got money where’s the money going to? Why is nobody checking the bullying?” Other prisoners would stand alongside Rob, ready to take his items as soon as they were handed to him. This happened in plain sight in front of officers, says Ben, but they dismissed his concerns. “They’d say he’s an addict - he can deal with it. I said you can see he’s not capable of dealing with it.” Robert was an easy target for drug dealers inside prison, says Alison. On one occasion he was held hostage by another inmate for two hours. Alison obtained prison records of Rob’s mental and physical health inside The Mount. They said “staff could hear Mr Morris being punched and crying out in pain”. The records said: “When the hostage situation was resolved, Mr Morris denied that he was being punched, which was challenged by staff.” Rob told officers that he did not want to press charges and did not want to get other prisoners in trouble. Staff on Rob’s wing told mental health services that he was a regular Spice user and “allows other prisoners to punch [him] as payment”. “That’s what they do, they completely and utterly bully a vulnerable person,” says Alison. The Spice trade has cultivated bullying in many prisons, says Mike Trace, chief executive of the Forward Trust. The charity helps prisoners with drug and alcohol dependence and ran a centre in The Mount. Last year the trust stopped running rehabilitation courses because drugs were too readily available across the prison. “The scale of the consumption of Spice was also creating violence and intimidation problems because it was gang-led.” Prisoners undergo “Spice dares” - ridiculous challenges either while high on Spice or in return for more of the drug, says Ben. Their behaviour is erratic enough without being goaded or forced into worse. “I’ve seen people being dragged [around the floor] banging their heads into walls,” says Ben. “People watch people on Spice and they just see it as entertainment. This is what keeps them happy in prison.” Sexual violence was driven by the drug trade, Ben believes. “I’ve heard of inmates being offered spice for sexual favours. It’s a bit rampant actually.” Alison understands that Rob was subjected to sexual abuse inside the prison, recorded in his medical records as a “suspected assault”. She says her son’s release papers also showed he had received rape counselling. “I never asked Robert about that because it could humiliate him more.” She says on release that information was not passed on to his probation officer, psychiatrist or his mental health team. “And so when he came out he had to live with all of those things that had happened to him.” Ben says addicts like Rob are especially vulnerable to bullying in prison. In Rob’s case he would buy things from “canteen” and then give them to other prisoners. Canteen is in effect a shop where each prisoner has a set allowance to spend and the goods are collected on Fridays. “Rob never spent any money from his canteen [on things for himself],” says Ben. “I told the officers, ‘Stop his canteen, let’s see who’s taking this from him because he’s got nothing in his room.’ “Who is it taking it from him?

They can’t get a beer out the fridge after a bad day. I come home and watch a film. That’s my escapism.” He says the general mental health of prisoners has been in decline for years. “When I joined the service two decades ago, there were very few mental health problems. Now it seems only one in three hasn’t got a mental health issue. It’s that prevalent. “I’ve had people walk up to me and slice their own stomach open.” More than one in three (37%) prisoners report having mental health or well-being issues at any one time, according to surveys carried out by HM Inspectorate of Prisons for England and Wales. The number of health emergencies and mental health interventions is rising throughout the prison system, says Mike Trace. Forward Trust tries to track them. Spice is causing both cardiac and respiratory problems as well as psychosis. “The level of use of cannabis in prisons has been high for decades and what we’ve seen is a partial replacement of cannabis and tobacco with Spice. That’s the explanation for the much higher rates of hospitalisation and psychosis,” says Mr Trace. In April 2015, an unannounced inspection of The Mount by the Chief Inspector of Prisons found that while secondary mental health care provision was deemed good, primary mental health services - the first port of call for inmates - were inadequate. Michael has seen everything there is to see in prison. He says he’s witnessed 16 riots, cut down 12 inmates who had attempted suicide, and dealt with six deaths. He believes more sheltered accommodation needs to be provided for low-level offenders with mental health problems. “There is still a view from judges that for people with diagnosed mental health illness, prisons are a place of safety,” says the President of the Prison Governors Association, Andrea Albutt. “They are not a place of safety. Someone with mental health illness is very vulnerable.” Just before he was released from The Mount in September 2016 Rob wrote a letter, in effect for himself, setting out what he hoped to achieve when he got out. It started: “My main aim on my release from prison is to make my parents proud.” The letter was an assessment of the flaws in his character and what he needed to do to make things better and restore his relationships with his family. He talked of his severe depression. And of giving up smoking Spice. He finished by writing: “I wonder when it was that I chose to get off the ride - one too many trips and an unstable mind makes for a complete mess.” Robert Morris died on 3 March 2017 at the age of 25. It was just six months after he left The Mount, although he had also spent a stint back at HMP Peterborough in that time after being arrested for being drunk and disorderly. He was found slumped in a chair in his room in a supported living accommodation unit, having inhaled his own vomit after drinking heavily. The coroner’s report into Rob’s death recorded a verdict of misadventure. But it criticised a failure to rehabilitate him and the lack of attention paid to his mental illness. “During his time in prison he suffered significant abuse but his severe mental illness does not seem to have been fully recognised or addressed and an opportunity for beneficial treatment that this period of detainment afforded was missed,” the coroner said. (Below: Alison, Rob's mother) From early 2015 it had been clearly established that Rob “suffered from paranoid schizophrenia exacerbated by his alcohol and illicit drug abuse”. There’s no doubt Rob Morris must have been a complex prisoner to deal with. His prison records show he refused or failed to take medication on five occasions. But it's clear he suffered a lot during his time in prison. In the first few months the records state that he was held hostage, as well as suffering bruises and abrasions on his body, a number of Spice incidents, suspected relapses of schizophrenia and a suspected sexual assault. After nearly three and a half months he was moved to a different wing. Ben believes the prison was responsible for his death. “The Mount killed him 100%. I’ll stand anywhere in the world and say that. “If he’d had 1% of the right help he’d be here now. The system did not care about Rob. “If I had a headache you’d tell me to go to the hospital. He had mental issues - they put him in a prison with a thousand people from the general population who are messed up anyway.” Alison says the prison can’t be blamed wholly for her son’s death. “Robert was leading a risky life. Rob was sent to prison because he had committed crime, low-level crime. “[But] he was sent into a den of drug taking, abuse, bullying and was not kept safe. So what was the point of it all?” Alison doesn’t dispute that her son should have been sent to prison - she just wishes there was some way that people like Rob could be looked after once inside. “When a young person with complex needs such as Rob is sent to prison [they should be] rehabilitated. “In fact, prison was less safe than the environment he’d come from. There were not enough staff there to deal with specific issues people may have.” People like Rob are often going to have difficulties in prison, says Andrea Albutt. “Prisoners with mental health problems are vulnerable so are ripe to be abused by the stronger prisoners. “We have a lot of people who drop between mental health and segregation units.... It’s really difficult to manage them - they disrupt wings and that further adds to what’s going on and it’s destabilising. If you have one or two people who are unwell it can have a massive impact.” The BBC’s request for an interview with the governor of The Mount was declined. But in a statement, the Ministry of Justice said its “sincere condolences are with the family and friends of Mr Morris”. “The safety and welfare of people within our custody is our priority and all prisons, including The Mount, have procedures to identify, manage and support people with mental health issues,” it added. The POA, which represents rank-and-file officers, has for some time been raising the issue of psychoactive substances and the potential personality changes and cognitive function damage caused to inmates. It is well known that prisoners bully other prisoners to take a drug in order to establish the strength of a batch, says Andy Baxter, from the POA’s National Executive Committee. “Unfortunately, despite government claims to have addressed the recruitment emergency, our members are simply rushed off their feet in the chaos that is a Prison Service in crisis, perpetuated in part by the availability of psychoactive substances. “Prison officers want to do a good job, but staffing levels of five or six officers to 190 prisoners make it impossible for staff to be all places at all times. “The chaos within our prisons needs to slow down - things need to go back to being controlled and safe.” In July 2018, new figures showed that almost a third of prisoners randomly tested in The Mount over 12 months had taken drugs. Across the prison system, the figure was one in five. Alison is sure that it was The Mount where Rob’s condition deteriorated most, rather than in Peterborough where he spent more of his sentence. 2017: Dozens of prisoners rioted at the Mount But it would be wrong to suggest that The Mount is a particularly bad prison. The problems it has are common to varying degrees across the prison system in England and Wales. When it was last inspected in 2015, The Mount was deemed to be “reasonably safe” and several aspects of the prison were praised or deemed better than comparable prisons. But the then chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick identified problems in key areas. “Too many victims of bullying sought sanctuary in the segregation unit and most were then moved out to prisons with insufficient effort to resolve their concerns and reintegrate them back on the wings where appropriate. “Prisoners told us drugs and alcohol were easily available, despite determined efforts by the prison to prevent this.” On 31 July 2017, almost a year after Rob left The Mount, there was an illustration of the pressures that can build up in a prison. For two days armed inmates took control of all of one wing and half of another. Specialist “tornado” riot-trained staff were called in. As many as 30 prisoners were involved - threatening prison officers and smashing windows. In the middle of the chaos, a report was published warning of “severe” staff shortages at the jail. A year afterwards, the Independent Monitoring Board said the prison had been “locked into a vicious spiral of decline”. The current Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, has said that jails have become ""unacceptably violent and dangerous places"" with attempted reforms undermined by the presence of Spice and similar drugs among inmates. In a recent report he criticised “the shockingly high numbers who acquire a drug habit while they are detained”. But the Ministry of Justice says it has tackled the rise in Spice by “bringing in 300 specialist drug dogs, new body scanners and making it a criminal offence to possess NPS [synthetic drugs such as Spice] in prison”. Ms Albutt does not think these changes have had an effect yet and says drug use and mental health problems remain ubiquitous across the prison system. The effect of funding cuts, and the loss of experienced staff, was exacerbated by other changes. “A lot of prisons are in dire straits. We lost years and years of knowledge and at the same time the demographics of prisoners started to change so we had younger, more violent, less respectful men in prison. “Organised crime gangs managed to get a hold of our prisons. Staff are scared. Self-harm, violence, prisoner on prisoner - every stat has gone up. “We need more technology. We need body scanners. We need to have really well-resourced security departments joined up with the police. We are recruiting 2,500 officers but they’re brand new and coming into a prison service that has been in crisis for a long time. Once we get experienced officers and trust with prisoners - it will take time.” The death of a former prisoner isn’t the kind of thing that normally makes headlines. But Rob’s family and friends will always remember that prison was a place where he couldn’t find the help to be who he wanted to be. “I am not ashamed of my son,” says Alison. “I’m actually quite proud of Rob because he suffered an awful lot in his life. “At his funeral we had 200 people. They remembered the Robert that was well.” Author:  Noel TitheradgeIllustrations: Rebecca HendinOnline production: Ben MilneEditor: Finlo Rohrer Photography: Press Association; Shutterstock; Getty Images; Science Photo Library All images subject to copyright Built with Shorthand"
Review: Forgotten portrait of artist who endured rape trial,"Great literature can be a good way of gaining an insight into art. For instance, Rodin's monumental sculpture The Gates of Hell (1880-90) is a complex work that becomes more comprehensible when you realise the artist's source material was Dante's Divine Comedy. Similarly, it helps to know Ophelia (1851), a painting by Millais, was inspired by Shakespeare's Hamlet. The same applies to the art world, an opaque place that is occasionally illuminated by a gifted writer such as Tom Wolfe. But it takes a wordsmith of quite exceptional talent to produce a book to help us understand the truly baffling vagaries of today's art market. Fortunately there is such a writer. His name is Roger Hargreaves, and the book in question is his 1972 miniature masterpiece Mr Topsy-Turvy. Mr. Topsy-Turvy by Roger Hargreaves helps us fathom the unpredictable workings of the art market No literary character better sums up the bizarre, seemingly cockeyed monetary value placed on art nowadays. In the book, Mr Topsy-Turvy goes to an art gallery and turns all the pictures upside down. One can only assume he walked happily past the auction houses having noted the sale prices were already the wrong way round. The amount of money being paid for modern and contemporary art in comparison to the sums fetched by the Old Masters will come to be seen as nonsensical as Pulp's Common People being kept off the number one chart spot by Robson and Jerome in 1995. Take Christopher Wool, for example. He is a good contemporary artist, But is he $30m good, which is around the figure someone paid at Sotheby's for his text piece UNTITLED, RIOT in 2015? Maybe. But if so, what does that make a painting by Artemisia Gentileschi worth, given that she was the greatest female artist of the Baroque period? Twice as much? Ten times more? Rather less, it turns out. The National Gallery in London paid Â£3.5m for her Self Portrait as Saint Catherine (c 1615-20). Admittedly, it wasn't in tip-top condition. There was a small tear in the canvas, the image was covered with a layer of yellowed varnish, and there were some obvious paint losses. The restoration of Artemisia Gentileschi's Self Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria took five months of painstaking work including cleaning the old varnishes Still, feels like a bargain when you think the gallery could have bought a 1978 Andy Warhol Oxidation Painting for roughly the same amount: a ""painting"" the artist made by asking a friend to urinate on a canvas. Instead it went for the Gentileschi, then passed it on to its conservation department to clean and restore before hanging it in the Central Hall alongside a group of other Baroque paintings, where it looks very good indeed. The picture has, as they like to say in auction houses, wall power. Artemisia Gentileschi brought a female point of view to a man's world and well known subjects. (1) She often used herself as the model, sometimes as a ""self-portrait"" of a carefully selected historical figure. She's always making a point. (2) The idea of presenting yourself partially disguised as someone else such as the Lute Player has been taken on by contemporary, post-modern artists from Cindy Sherman to David Bowie. (3) It also has a striking back story. Artemisia Gentileschi was born in Rome in 1593. Her father, Orazio Gentileschi, was an artist heavily influenced by Caravaggio's dramatic ""chiaroscuro"" lighting technique, where the painter accentuates the contrast between light and dark to model forms and create a sense of theatricality. Boy Bitten by a Lizard (about 1594-5) by Caravaggio, whose lighting technique greatly influenced both Orazio Gentileschi and his daughter Artemisia Soon, Artemisia was making her way as an artist in the roughhouse that was 17th Century Rome. She produced her first known work - Susanna and the Elders - when she was about 16. A year later, she was raped by an acquaintance of her father's called Agostino Tassi, the result of which was a trial that saw Tassi convicted, but only after Artemisia had endured torture to prove she was telling the truth. She left for Florence shortly afterwards. It was while in Florence she painted the National Gallery picture, in which she presents herself as the Christian martyr Saint Catherine, another woman who had endured torture at the hands of men. She faces us in a three-quarter pose with an inscrutable expression on her face. Her left hand rests on a broken wooden wheel (Catherine Wheel) inset with metal spikes, an implement that was intended to torture and kill her. Her right hand, which holds the martyr's palm, is held to her chest. In this painting, Artemisia Gentileschi portrays herself as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who was also tortured by men A single light source makes her white sleeve appear to jump out of the picture. Your eye is then drawn towards the silky red sleeve of her dress and upwards towards her beady left eye, which is giving absolutely nothing away. The golden arch of the palm is echoed by her halo at the top of the picture, and her shawl at the bottom of the frame. It is a well-balanced, tonally sensuous painting, which is only slightly compromised by the proximity of the palm to the sitter's face (the same motif is better placed in another version she painted of the same subject, which is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence). For a painting that is almost 400 years old, it feels incredibly modern. Imagine if the sitter was a contemporary figure like Cindy Sherman, an artist who has also made a career out of depicting herself as other people? Untitled Film Still #21, 1978, by Cindy Sherman, who like Artemisia Gentileschi, presents herself as other figures We would read it as a fresh and subversive image. Which it was and is. Artemisia Gentileschi was a woman operating in a man's world, making weighty pictures that celebrated and represented women. Her near identical pose in Self Portrait as a Lute Player, and the gruesome depiction of Judith Beheading Holofernes, both show a familiar image from a female point of view. It is a difference in attitude that can be seen by looking at Caravaggio's painting of The Lute Player and of Judith's murderous act. Same story, different perspective. Which brings us back to Mr. Topsy-Turvy.

Doctor lay dead in storeroom for two daysEduard Zigar took his own life less than a week after beginning his hospital placement.Birmingham & Black Country,"Eduard Zigar was working as a locum in Birmingham The body of a junior doctor lay undiscovered in a hospital storeroom for two days, an inquest has heard. Eduard Zigar, 25, took his own life at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham less than a week after beginning his placement, the city's coroner's court heard. There had been difficulty identifying him as missing because hospital staff were looking under the wrong name. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide. In a statement, the hospital trust described the death as a ""tragedy"" and said it hoped the conclusion of the inquest would ""bring some sense of closure"". Dr Zigar, a Lithuanian living in Wolverhampton, was a locum at the Birmingham hospital, allied to the upper gastro-intestinal surgical team. He was last seen on the site's CCTV at about 19:00 BST on Saturday 25 August and found in the ambulatory care unit at about 22:00 on 27 August. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Dr Zigar had begun to work at the hospital on 20 August and appeared ""detached"" and ""quiet"" on 25 August, colleagues said. Consultant John Whiting told the hearing that he found Dr Zigar to be a little nervous, which he said was not unusual and gave him no concerns for his mental well-being. When he did not turn up for his shift on Sunday, staff were not initially worried as they assumed there had been a rota error. Dr Zigar was found in the ambulatory care department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital When Dr Zigar's friends and family became concerned, the locum agency contacted the hospital but, because of entering his name into the system incorrectly, it could find no trace of him working there. Since the death, the hospital has introduced a supervisor for the locum team. Dr Zigar's mother described him as ""tolerant and loving"" and said his death had come as a ""massive shock"".

Things that could topple Trump wall," US President Donald Trump’s promise to build a ""big, beautiful wall"" between the US and Mexico was a rallying cry throughout his election campaign. As president, Mr Trump has asked for design ideas for the barrier, with a chosen few to be selected this month for a prototype showcase this summer in San Diego, California. Mr Trump says he wants a wall along half the 2,000-mile (3,100km) border - with nature, such as mountains and rivers, helping to take care of the rest. However, the route crosses difficult terrain, is home to a lot of wildlife and cuts across land owned by Native American tribes as well as private citizens. So is building the wall actually possible? Here are some of the obstacles Mr Trump will have to overcome. As it runs from San Diego, California, in the west, to Brownsville, Texas, in the east, it changes from relatively straight lines to following the windy path of the Rio Grande. In fact, the actual border is, in many places, defined as the deepest channel of the river. Building a wall in the middle of the Rio Grande would be challenging for obvious reasons, but there are also legal issues. A treatysigned by Mexico and the US in 1889prevents any disruption to the flow of the river, meaning any border wall would probably have to be built on its banks. This, again, presents obvious problems. Existing border fencing often sits far from the river, outside its floodplains, leaving a wide gap between the fence and the official border. This means some US citizens have been forced to live on the Mexican side of the fence in a kind of limbo between the two countries. While two thirds of its length runs along rivers, the southern US border also bisects other challenging environments - desert in California and Arizona and mountains in New Mexico. In eastern California, there are the Algodones - or Imperial Sand Dunes - the largest sand dune ecosystem in the US. There is already a section of “floating fence” here, specifically engineered to work with the shifting sands, installed by the George W Bush administration. Meanwhile, Arizona and New Mexico are mountainous. Coronado National Forest, in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico, has several 9,000-ft peaks. A wall appears impossible here. The US-Mexico border hasa delicate ecosystemthat could be disrupted by any new barrier. A wall would prevent animals reaching their hunting lands, water sources and migration corridors. Grey wolves and jaguars hunt on both sides of the border. Other cross-border populations of wildlife include bison, bighorn sheep, ocelots and bears. Splitting these animals will not only decrease genetic diversity but also make species susceptible to diseases and epidemics, conservationists have warned. Protecting the wildlife along 12% of the US-Mexico border is the task of Big Bend National Park in West Texas, home to thousands of species, including more types of birds, bats, and cacti than any other national park in the US. Staff there are concerned that any barrier would impact greatly on their mission to protect the Chihuahuan Desert’s ecosystem for future generations and jeopardise relationships with colleagues working on the other side of the Rio Grande. Jennette Jurado, Big Bend public information officer and ranger, says this collaboration with Mexican neighbours is crucial to her conservation work. “I think if you look at this place from the air, you wouldn’t notice that a political divide went down the middle of that river because the ecosystem is whole and protected,” she says, “but it takes two nations to do so.” Mike Davidson, a guide at Big Bend, agrees that cooperation has been crucial to wildlife protection and says building a wall or other structure would be “really sad”, detracting from people’s desire to come to Big Bend. “Why come down here when there’s a big blank wall instead of these beautiful canyons?” Mr Trump’s initial price tag of between $8bn and $12bn (£6.4bn and £9.7bn) has been widely disputed. The 650 miles of fencing built under President George W Bush cost an estimated $7bn, and it could not be described as fulfilling Mr Trump's promises of a ""tall, powerful, beautiful"" barrier. A number of very different estimates have been put forward by other official bodies. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, stated the cost would be between $12bn and $15bn, while a report by the US Department for Homeland Security estimated the wallwould cost between $21.6bn and $25bn. Meanwhile, a report by Senate Democrats, said the wallcould cost nearly $70bn to build and $150m a year to maintain. Other, unofficial, estimates have varied. Wall Street research and brokerage firm Bernstein Research said the price tag could be between$15bn and $25bn, while construction consultants Gleeds believe it would bein the region of $31bn. Meanwhile, Konstantin Kakaes, an international security fellow with the New America Foundation writing in the MIT Technology Review, saidthe total could reach $40bn. One thing’s for sure, it’s going to be expensive, and so far, the cash hasn’t been found. In his proposed budget unveiled in March, Mr Trump allocated $1.4bn for wall construction in the ongoing fiscal year, with another $2.6bn for the 2018 budget year starting on 1 October. However, Congress didn’t approve any funding for wall construction this year (only cash for repairs to 40 miles of older fencing) and Mr Trump has now reduced his request to $1.6bn - down £1bn - for 2018. An additional $1bn is allotted to border “technology and infrastructure”. According to the Department of Homeland Security,the £1.6bn would be spent on 74 miles of barrier, mostly in the Rio Grande Valley. While Mr Trump originally promised to build a wall along the whole 2,000-mile border, he later clarified that it would only cover 1,000 miles due to “natural barriers”. As for height, he has given estimates ranging between 30ft and 50ft. In March, the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection clarified the government’s requirements. In addition to the complex structural work, there is the surveying, land acquisition and access road-building, among other things, he says. Inviting companies to submit designs, theFedBizOpps.govwebsite stated the “cost-effective” structure must be made of reinforced concrete and: New York-based structural engineer Alex Weinberg told the BBC that a wall, “even one of this size”, was not difficult in terms of engineering because there was “nothing to engineer”. Instead, the “big task” would be the scale of the operation. “It’s the logistics that are the real challenge here,” he said. Land would need to be surveyed and acquired, foundations dug and construction materials made. On top of this, because of the remote location of much of the construction site, access roads would need to be built and supplies, accommodation, transport and medical care would need to be provided for the required large labour force. “It’s going to be a slog,” Mr Weinberg said. However, the government, alongside its call for concrete wall designs, has asked for submissions for a “see-through component/capability” that “facilitates situational awareness”. This appears to suggest that the government is considering building out of materials other than concrete - something Homeland Security Secretary John F Kelly, a retired general, alsotold senators on the Homeland Security Committee this month. “It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,” he said. However, he added that physical barriers would be ""put in the right places"" and that sensors, drones and other technology would fill in gaps where a wall would not be present. In order to build the wall, the government needs permission to use the land it stands on. However, about66% of landalong the US-Mexico border is either owned privately, by Native Americans or by individual states. In these cases, the government will need to coordinate mass voluntary sales of property or negotiate a right of way for the wall along large swaths of land. Thousands of homeowners could be affected, includingranchers in Texas- among them Donald Trump supporters - who rely on access to the Rio Grande and pastures for their livestock. Trying to purchase this land could be a major challenge and if people refuse, the government would have to forcibly get hold of it. Welcome to the term ""eminent domain"". Eminent domain is a system used to gain ownership of private property for public use, such as for highways and railroads, usually accompanied by compensation. It has been used for the construction of border fences in the past. Gerald S Dickinson, assistant professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, haswarned that such eminent domain fights could take years. Any federal eminent domain action on such a large scale against even a few landowners could trigger “decades of court disputes before anything is built”, he told the Washington Post. In the 2000s, the Bush administration had to negotiate land purchases with hundreds of landowners. Many citizens and local governments mounted resistance, causing major delays. Among them was a family who lost half their farmland and their house and are now forced to live on the Mexican side of the fence, only accessing the US side via a locked gate into which they have to punch in a passcode. Democratic Senator Claire McCaskilltold the Senate Homeland Security Committeethat out of 400 land acquisitions needed for the fencing that currently exists, 330 lawsuits were filed by the Department of Justice and more than 90 of those cases were still pending. However, some landowners are receptive to the current administration’s moves. The Villareal family, whose property lies just outside Rio Grande City, Texas, and borders the river, say they now feel better protected under President Trump because of his hardline approach to immigration. “I do feel safer,“ says Daniel Villareal. “I mean, we've always come down here [to the river] armed, ever since we're sort of having the problem [of illegal immigrants crossing their land]. “But now that the situation's different, and there's not that many people trying to come across, maybe we can come down here, clear this area and then have our riverbank.” The family was approached by the Bush administration when it was researching areas to build a fence, but nothing came of it. Rene Villareal, Daniel’s brother, says the family would not oppose plans for a wall across their property if it helped prevent more people crossing the border illegally in the short term. “I want the wall because it's not going to be permanent,” says Rene. “It's not going to be forever into eternity. It's just until people come to their senses.” But, while some private property-owners may not object, the proprietors of Tribal lands have already voiced firm opposition. The Tohono O’odham Nation owns much of such land, including a reservation that extends along 75 miles of the border in Arizona. Tribe members still live on both sides of the border, considering the territory their ancestral lands, and haveindicated they will attempt to block construction if the wall goes ahead. Should that happen, Mr Trump would need a bill from Congress to acquire the land, which is currently protected under law. As many have pointed out, a strip of concrete stretching across the continent would not keep people out indefinitely unless it is manned by border guards. Homeland Security secretary, John F Kelly, has himself said that a“physical barrier will not do the job”and that you would have to back it up with patrolling human beings, sensors and observation devices. In executive orders issued five days after his inauguration, Trump called for the recruitment of an extra 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 10,000 immigration officers, but budget requests so far would only pay for 500 border agents and 1,000 immigration officers. Marlene Castro, supervisory border patrol agent in the Rio Grande Valley sector, believes adequate staffing is part of the package of measures needed to secure the border. “You can have all the technology and infrastructure, but if you don’t have the personnel to respond efficiently and effectively then it becomes useless,” she says. Ms Castro has seen the number of illegal crossings in her area go down since Donald Trump was elected, but at the same time, she and her fellow agents have experienced a rise in assaults against them. She puts this down to the frustration felt by those enabling illegal entry into the US. “The smugglers are pretty desperate right now… of course this is just an assumption, I can’t speak for a smuggler, but I’m thinking they’re losing a lot of money because of the lack of people coming across.” One of those people smugglers, known locally as “The Horse”, says his business was impacted by the Bush administration’s fence and that a bigger wall would “complicate” the people-smuggling trade further. However, he warns that the Mexican mafia “will always try to find a way to cross” and that prices would simply increase. Tony Estrada, Arizona’s Santa Cruz County sheriff, agrees that people will still find a way through. “No wall, no matter how beautiful, how big or how expensive is going to stop people that are desperate, people that are needy and people that are poor. “These people are coming from thousands and thousands of miles at great expense and in great danger. They have been victimised most of the way. Do you think a wall is gonna stop them? No, it’s just going to be another obstacle.” Sealing off the border would also affect the economies of border towns and affect the wider US-Mexican economy - something many US politicians would be keen to avoid. Communities along the US side of the border have developed close and dependant economic relationships with their sister cities in Mexico. Many Mexican towns are home to US factories employing thousands of people and Mexican shoppers spend billions of dollars in US border states every year. The supply of cheap labour in Mexico has also fuelled the rise of manufacturing plants - known as maquiladora - along the border. These maquiladoras - or maquilas, for short - enjoy tax breaks and produce and export goods, a legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement which came into force in 1994, scrapping many tariffs between the US, Canada and Mexico. The wall could also impact on the wider US-Mexico economic relationship too. Mexico is America’s second largest export market and America is Mexico’s largest. The two countries have a “very deep” economic relationship, explains Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the think-tank the Wilson Center, with five million US jobs depending on it. The Wilson Center’s research suggests that if trade between the US and Mexico were halted, 4.9 million Americans would be out of work. The two economies are now so interconnected, Mr Wilson says, that they no longer just sell finished products to each other, but instead “actually build products together”. “Parts are moved across the border, sometime multiple times in the course of production,” he says. “Both the United States and Mexico are contributing to the value of products that are ultimately sold in the region or exported to the rest of the world.” Research by the Wilson Center suggests that half of all US-Mexico trade is made up of this movement of parts and materials. “At the deepest level, we’re in it together,” Mr Wilson says. Truck driver Jose Antonio Garcia Fuentes, living in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, knows very well how much the two sides of the border rely on each other. President of a company of 50 truck drivers, Jose crosses the border every week and worries about the changes a new barrier would bring. “Imagine if there are 14,000 trucks crossing every day here and then 4,000,” he says. “There would be truck drivers here without work.” He also points out that moving jobs and manufacturing businesses back into the US, as President Trump has promised, could have a detrimental impact on both countries. “The labour is more expensive [in the US]. They pay US$14 an hour to a worker. With that you can pay three Mexicans,” he says. “That is why it's very difficult to break the commercial links between Mexico and the US, the US saves [money] here in Mexico. That's what is at risk.” Field reporting, video journalism and photography by Paul Harris and Kelvin Brown. Words and production by Lucy Rodgers. Data journalism and production by Nassos Stylianou.
