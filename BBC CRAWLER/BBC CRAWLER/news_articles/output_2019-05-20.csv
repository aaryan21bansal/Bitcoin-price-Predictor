Watchdog reviewing Brexit Party funding,"This video can not be played Nigel Farage said his party was mostly funded via donations of Â£25 The Electoral Commission is visiting the offices of The Brexit Party to review how it receives funding. A spokesperson said Tuesday's visit was part of its ""active oversight and regulation"" of donations. Ex-PM Gordon Brown accused the party -which is riding high in polls ahead of the European elections- of receiving a large amount of money via small ""undeclared, untraceable payments"". Leader Nigel Farage accused Mr Brown of ""a disgusting smear"". An Electoral Commission spokesman said if there was ""evidence that the law may have been broken"", it would consider it ""in line with our enforcement policy"". The watchdog said the visit was arranged on Monday, adding that it does meet regularly with parties both during and outside campaigns to verify their processes. Reality Check: What are the rules around political funding? Under the rules governing donations to political parties,,externalamounts below Â£500 do not have to be declared. An official donation of Â£500 or more must be given by a ""permissible donor"", who should either be somebody listed on the UK electoral roll or a business registered at Companies House and operating in the UK. The Brexit Party has updated its website to say that those making donations or becoming registered supporters must comply with those requirements. This video can not be played Gordon Brown wants the Electoral Commission to investigate Brexit Party funding At an event in Glasgow on Monday, Mr Brown said there was no way of telling whether donations to The Brexit Party - which can be made through PayPal - come from British or foreign sources, and therefore the system was being abused. Other political parties - including the Conservatives and Labour - also use PayPal to collect donations on their websites. ""You can pay to this party in Russian roubles or American dollars,"" Mr Brown said. ""Democracy is ill served, and trust in democracy will continue to be undermined, if we have no answers as to where the money is coming from,"" he added. Labour MP Chris Bryant has also said the system is open to abuse. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Responding to the Mr Brown's comments, Mr Farage said: ""Most of our money has been raised by people giving Â£25 to become registered supporters."" ""And over 110,000 of them now have done that. And frankly, this smacks of jealousy because the other parties simply can't do this."" When asked if the party took donations in foreign currency, Mr Farage replied: ""Absolutely not, we only take sterling - end of conversation."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for ""a full and open and transparent, independent inquiry into the funding of Mr Farage"". This video can not be played This video has been removed for right reasons. On Monday, Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice told Radio 4's Today programme the party applied ""the appropriate Electoral Commission rules"" to amounts above Â£500. Asked if he could confirm whether the party takes cash from foreign citizens, Mr Tice said: ""I don't sit in front of the PayPal account all day so I don't know what currencies people are paying in, but, as I understand it, the PayPal takes it in sterling."" The Conservative Party said it required people to give their name and address before contributing Â£500 or more. Change UK said: ""We identify all donors, including those under the Â£500 threshold, so that we can conduct a permissibility check should the aggregate of donations per donor exceed the Â£500 threshold."" In 2013, the Electoral Commission issued guidance to parties that ""if a donor makes regular payments for an unspecified donation and towards an unspecified total amount, our view is that these payments should be treated as separate donations."" As you might expect, the world of party funding and finance is a complicated one. But an interesting element to pin-point is this issue of smaller donations. Under UK law a donation to a political party that's under Â£500 does not have to be reported to the Electoral Commission. In fact, that kind of financial contribution doesn't even count as a donation. So, for example, the usual rules around the money having to come from a UK elector or UK-registered company don't apply. What wouldn't be allowed are repeated small donations, from the same source, in order to dodge the donation limits. Significantly, these rules originate from legislation that's nearly 20 years old - the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Back then, they probably didn't worry about the risk that parties might be able to crowdfund from foreign donors, and one academic's told me that the law is no longer ""fit for purpose"". Meanwhile, when it comes to the Electoral Commission's plan to visit The Brexit Party's offices - I understand that officials and the party have been in dialogue for several weeks and that's it's not necessarily unusual for the commission to meet parties to ensure that their systems are up to scratch. However, it appears that the commission hasn't yet visited any others during this particular campaign. During his speech, Gordon Brown also attacked Mr Farage for receiving Â£450,000 from Leave campaigner Arron Banks while still a member of the European Parliament. Mr Brown said The Brexit Party leader should have declared the payments he was receiving ""to avoid a conflict of interest"". Asked about it followingan investigation by Channel 4 News,,externalMr Farage said he did not declare it to the European Parliament because he was about to leave politics and had been seeking a new life in the US. Lib Dem MEP Catherine Bearder has written to the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani calling for an investigation into the matter.Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said,externalshe had also referred Mr Farage to the European Anti-Fraud Office.

Thomas Cook tries to reassure customers,"Thomas Cook is trying to sell its fleet of planes Troubled travel firm Thomas Cook has been reassuring customers who contacted the firm with concerns about holiday trips, after its share price crashed. Its share price fell sharply at the end of last week, and it dropped a further 14% on Monday to just 10p. Thomas Cook has been reassuring people on social media, and in a statement at the weekend, telling customers that it is ""business as usual"". The firm also said it was looking to strengthen its financial position. Thomas Cook shares 'worthless' says bank Thomas Cook says Brexit hitting holiday plans What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? On Sunday, Thomas Cook said: ""We have the support of our lending banks and major shareholders, and just this week we agreed additional funding for our coming winter cash low period. ""We have ample resources to operate our business and at the same time, as usual, our liquidity position continues to strengthen into the summer period."" Thomas Cook also said: ""We're responsible for taking over 20 million people abroad on holiday every year and we take that responsibility very seriously.  As an ATOL-protected business, our customers can have complete confidence in booking their holiday with us."" By Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Protection under the ATOL - orAir Travel Organiser's Licence,external- scheme means UK travellers on an air package holiday do not lose their money or become stranded abroad if a holiday firm collapses. It also covers many charter flights and means that, if the operator collapses while people are away, they can finish their holiday and be flown home at no extra cost. If the business collapses before they go away, the scheme will provide a replacement holiday of equal value, or a refund. When flights are booked on their own, or when people book flights and accommodation separately, the ATOL scheme does not usually come into effect. However, the ATOL scheme does now cover more custom-built holidays than it used to. If a holiday is ATOL-protected it will be clearly marked with a certificate on holiday documents. The scheme is run by the UK Civil Aviation Authority and is backed by the UK government. Thomas Cook released its statement after concerned customers asked the firm on social media if it was ""about to go under"" or ""going into administration"". Others had queried if the firm was ""in danger of collapsing"",  and if their holiday flights and packages were safe. But on Twitter, Thomas Cook said: ""We have been taking customers on their holidays with us for 175 years and we plan to do so for a very long time."" It also said: ""We are very much trading as normal and we aren't going into administration"". On Friday, analysts at Citigroup said the travel firm's shares were ""worthless"". The bank's damning conclusion came a day afterThomas Cook issued its third profit warningin less than a year and reported a Â£1.5bn half-year loss. Citigroup analysts also pointed to a warning from auditor EY in Thomas' Cook's results which warned of ""material uncertainties"" over the group's sale of its airline, on which a new Â£300m bank facility depends. Thomas Cook is in the process of seeking bidders for its fleet of 105 jets as it tries to raise funds for the business. It says it has received ""multiple bids"" for the fleet. The company is also seeking to cut costs. It has closed 21 of its High Street stores, its currency arm Thomas Cook Money is under review and more ""cost efficiencies"" are planned. It has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays due to Brexit. But it has also suffered from competition from online travel agents and low-cost airlines.

'Bored' workers 'cremated mouse',"Fire crews were called to Bury St Edmunds town centre at 17:00 on 29 September 2017 Two ""stupid"" and ""bored"" workers set fire to a mouse that led to a blaze in a cycle shop.

Chelsea fan Antony Crump, 28, was found guilty of intentional racially aggravated harassment, alarm and distress at Tameside Magistrates' Court on 9 June, after his trial was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Crump, of Hereford Close, Worksop, was banned from attending games for three years and fined Â£1,700.

Thomas Cook tries to reassure customersTroubled travel firm has been reassuring customers who flooded the firm with concerns about holiday trips.BusinessComments,"Thomas Cook is trying to sell its fleet of planes Troubled travel firm Thomas Cook has been reassuring customers who contacted the firm with concerns about holiday trips, after its share price crashed. Its share price fell sharply at the end of last week, and it dropped a further 14% on Monday to just 10p. Thomas Cook has been reassuring people on social media, and in a statement at the weekend, telling customers that it is ""business as usual"". The firm also said it was looking to strengthen its financial position. Thomas Cook shares 'worthless' says bank Thomas Cook says Brexit hitting holiday plans What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? On Sunday, Thomas Cook said: ""We have the support of our lending banks and major shareholders, and just this week we agreed additional funding for our coming winter cash low period. ""We have ample resources to operate our business and at the same time, as usual, our liquidity position continues to strengthen into the summer period."" Thomas Cook also said: ""We're responsible for taking over 20 million people abroad on holiday every year and we take that responsibility very seriously.  As an ATOL-protected business, our customers can have complete confidence in booking their holiday with us."" By Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Protection under the ATOL - orAir Travel Organiser's Licence,external- scheme means UK travellers on an air package holiday do not lose their money or become stranded abroad if a holiday firm collapses. It also covers many charter flights and means that, if the operator collapses while people are away, they can finish their holiday and be flown home at no extra cost. If the business collapses before they go away, the scheme will provide a replacement holiday of equal value, or a refund. When flights are booked on their own, or when people book flights and accommodation separately, the ATOL scheme does not usually come into effect. However, the ATOL scheme does now cover more custom-built holidays than it used to. If a holiday is ATOL-protected it will be clearly marked with a certificate on holiday documents. The scheme is run by the UK Civil Aviation Authority and is backed by the UK government. Thomas Cook released its statement after concerned customers asked the firm on social media if it was ""about to go under"" or ""going into administration"". Others had queried if the firm was ""in danger of collapsing"",  and if their holiday flights and packages were safe. But on Twitter, Thomas Cook said: ""We have been taking customers on their holidays with us for 175 years and we plan to do so for a very long time."" It also said: ""We are very much trading as normal and we aren't going into administration"". On Friday, analysts at Citigroup said the travel firm's shares were ""worthless"". The bank's damning conclusion came a day afterThomas Cook issued its third profit warningin less than a year and reported a Â£1.5bn half-year loss. Citigroup analysts also pointed to a warning from auditor EY in Thomas' Cook's results which warned of ""material uncertainties"" over the group's sale of its airline, on which a new Â£300m bank facility depends. Thomas Cook is in the process of seeking bidders for its fleet of 105 jets as it tries to raise funds for the business. It says it has received ""multiple bids"" for the fleet. The company is also seeking to cut costs. It has closed 21 of its High Street stores, its currency arm Thomas Cook Money is under review and more ""cost efficiencies"" are planned. It has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays due to Brexit. But it has also suffered from competition from online travel agents and low-cost airlines.

Ecuador hands Assange belongings to USThe Wikileaks founder is facing extradition requests from Sweden and the US over separate accusations.Europe,"The Wikileaks founder was holed up in Ecuador's London embassy for seven years to avoid extradition to Sweden Ecuador has seized some of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange's possessions left behind following his stay in its London embassy. An Ecuadorean judge authorised the seizure after a request for assistance by the US. Wikileaks said Ecuador was allowing US prosecutors to ""help themselves to Assange's belongings"". The material includes manuscripts, legal papers, medical records and electronic equipment, Wikileaks said. Mr Assange's lawyer called it ""completely unprecedented in the history of asylum"". ""Ecuador is committing a flagrant violation of the most basic norms of the institution of asylum by handing over all the asylee's personal belongings indiscriminately to the country that he was being protected from,"" added lawyer Aitor Martinez. Foreign Minister JosÃ© Valencia said last week that the decision which items to share with US authorities should be taken by the Ecuadorean prosecutor's office and that any handover would be carried out ""in full compliance with the law"". Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga Why Ecuador ended Assange's stay in embassy Wikileaks' Editor-in-Chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in a statement that there was ""no doubt that Ecuador has tampered with the belongings it will send to the United States"". The US is seeking Assange's extradition from the UK over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material by Wikileaks in 2010. Mr Assange is serving a 50-week sentence in Belmarsh prison for skipping his extradition order to Sweden Australian-born Assange faces a charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US. He is accused of participating in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets, which could result in a prison term of up to five years. The 47-year-old whistleblower is already facing moves to extradite him to Sweden. In 2010, a Swedish woman accused him of rape after they met at a WikiLeaks conference in Stockholm. Assange has always denied the allegations, and sought refuge in Ecuador's embassy for seven years to avoid a British extradition order to Sweden. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London The charges were dropped in 2017, but on Monday prosecutors issued a renewed request to hold Mr Assange on suspicion of rape - a first step towards seeking his extradition. Swedish deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, said in a statement a request had been filed with the Uppsala district court to have Assange detained in his absence. 'Reckless hacktivist' or campaigner for truth? How likely is a conviction in US? She added that once the court had granted the request, she would then ask British authorities to transfer Assange to Sweden. Mr Assange was arrested on 11 April after being handed over to British authorities by Ecuador. He is serving a 50-week sentence in Belmarsh prison for skipping his extradition order. Correction 21 May 2019: A previous version of this article stated that Julian Assange's possessions had been handed over to the US. This has been amended to clarify that they have been seized by the Ecuadorean authorities following a US request. Correction 4th June 2019: This article has been amended to remove a reference to ""rape charges"".

Farage: Funding claims 'a disgusting smear',"This video can not be played Nigel Farage said his party was mostly funded via donations of Â£25 The Electoral Commission is visiting the offices of The Brexit Party to review how it receives funding. A spokesperson said Tuesday's visit was part of its ""active oversight and regulation"" of donations. Ex-PM Gordon Brown accused the party -which is riding high in polls ahead of the European elections- of receiving a large amount of money via small ""undeclared, untraceable payments"". Leader Nigel Farage accused Mr Brown of ""a disgusting smear"". An Electoral Commission spokesman said if there was ""evidence that the law may have been broken"", it would consider it ""in line with our enforcement policy"". The watchdog said the visit was arranged on Monday, adding that it does meet regularly with parties both during and outside campaigns to verify their processes. Reality Check: What are the rules around political funding? Under the rules governing donations to political parties,,externalamounts below Â£500 do not have to be declared. An official donation of Â£500 or more must be given by a ""permissible donor"", who should either be somebody listed on the UK electoral roll or a business registered at Companies House and operating in the UK. The Brexit Party has updated its website to say that those making donations or becoming registered supporters must comply with those requirements. This video can not be played Gordon Brown wants the Electoral Commission to investigate Brexit Party funding At an event in Glasgow on Monday, Mr Brown said there was no way of telling whether donations to The Brexit Party - which can be made through PayPal - come from British or foreign sources, and therefore the system was being abused. Other political parties - including the Conservatives and Labour - also use PayPal to collect donations on their websites. ""You can pay to this party in Russian roubles or American dollars,"" Mr Brown said. ""Democracy is ill served, and trust in democracy will continue to be undermined, if we have no answers as to where the money is coming from,"" he added. Labour MP Chris Bryant has also said the system is open to abuse. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Responding to the Mr Brown's comments, Mr Farage said: ""Most of our money has been raised by people giving Â£25 to become registered supporters."" ""And over 110,000 of them now have done that. And frankly, this smacks of jealousy because the other parties simply can't do this."" When asked if the party took donations in foreign currency, Mr Farage replied: ""Absolutely not, we only take sterling - end of conversation."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for ""a full and open and transparent, independent inquiry into the funding of Mr Farage"". This video can not be played This video has been removed for right reasons. On Monday, Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice told Radio 4's Today programme the party applied ""the appropriate Electoral Commission rules"" to amounts above Â£500. Asked if he could confirm whether the party takes cash from foreign citizens, Mr Tice said: ""I don't sit in front of the PayPal account all day so I don't know what currencies people are paying in, but, as I understand it, the PayPal takes it in sterling."" The Conservative Party said it required people to give their name and address before contributing Â£500 or more. Change UK said: ""We identify all donors, including those under the Â£500 threshold, so that we can conduct a permissibility check should the aggregate of donations per donor exceed the Â£500 threshold."" In 2013, the Electoral Commission issued guidance to parties that ""if a donor makes regular payments for an unspecified donation and towards an unspecified total amount, our view is that these payments should be treated as separate donations."" As you might expect, the world of party funding and finance is a complicated one. But an interesting element to pin-point is this issue of smaller donations. Under UK law a donation to a political party that's under Â£500 does not have to be reported to the Electoral Commission. In fact, that kind of financial contribution doesn't even count as a donation. So, for example, the usual rules around the money having to come from a UK elector or UK-registered company don't apply. What wouldn't be allowed are repeated small donations, from the same source, in order to dodge the donation limits. Significantly, these rules originate from legislation that's nearly 20 years old - the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Back then, they probably didn't worry about the risk that parties might be able to crowdfund from foreign donors, and one academic's told me that the law is no longer ""fit for purpose"". Meanwhile, when it comes to the Electoral Commission's plan to visit The Brexit Party's offices - I understand that officials and the party have been in dialogue for several weeks and that's it's not necessarily unusual for the commission to meet parties to ensure that their systems are up to scratch. However, it appears that the commission hasn't yet visited any others during this particular campaign. During his speech, Gordon Brown also attacked Mr Farage for receiving Â£450,000 from Leave campaigner Arron Banks while still a member of the European Parliament. Mr Brown said The Brexit Party leader should have declared the payments he was receiving ""to avoid a conflict of interest"". Asked about it followingan investigation by Channel 4 News,,externalMr Farage said he did not declare it to the European Parliament because he was about to leave politics and had been seeking a new life in the US. Lib Dem MEP Catherine Bearder has written to the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani calling for an investigation into the matter.Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said,externalshe had also referred Mr Farage to the European Anti-Fraud Office. Meanwhile, a manhas been chargedwith assaulting Nigel Farage by throwing a milkshake at him.

"New law will 'deter' spies, says Javid","Foreign spies in the UK might have to add their names to a register under a new espionage bill, Home Secretary Sajid Javid has said. It would aim to tackle threats from hostile states, he said in a speech at New Scotland Yard in London. He also said Syria and parts of west Africa could be designated as banned countries, with Britons who travelled there breaking the law. The new bill would update the Official Secrets Act and the laws on treason. He has also appointed Jonathan Hall QC as a watchdog to monitor the new terror laws. A register would act as a deterrent to spying and make it easier to take action against those involved, Mr Javid said. The home secretary said the tempo of terrorist activity was increasing, with 19 plots foiled in the UK in two years. No, the proposed Foreign Agents Register isn't an attempt to get spies to cough up - that would be ridiculous. The purpose, it appears, is to regulate legitimate political and government lobbying by people acting on behalf of overseas states and interests and ensure it's carried out in a more transparent way. Suspicion would inevitably fall on those who don't register; they'd face prosecution.  Equally, those who have made a declaration but don't comply with the rules could also face sanctions. The US has had similar legislation for more than 80 years and in December 2018 Australia introduced a ""Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme"" with a register available to see at the click of a button. Although the home secretary's plans are at an early stage, it's hoped they could help the authorities identify and take action against those intent on undermining the country's way of life through tactics of subversion and disinformation. The changes come after Britons in Syria asked to return to the UK. Shamima Begum - whohad her UK citizenship revoked by Mr Javid in February- was found in a Syrian refugee camp after leaving London to join the Islamic State group when she was 15. Mr Javid said people travelling to, or remaining in, certain areas of Syria without good reason could face up to 10 years in prison. UK terrorism threat: How has it changed? Speaking to senior security figures in central London, Mr Javid set out for the first time how he expects to use the new Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act. He said there were ""real gaps"" in legislation concerning so-called 'hostile states'. He said: ""I've asked my officials to work closely with the police and intelligence agencies to urgently review the case for exercising this power in relation to Syria, with a particular focus on Idlib and the north east. ""Anyone who is in these areas without a legitimate reason should be on notice."" This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" The north-western Syrian province of Idlib isthe last remaining stronghold controlled by forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. Mr Javid said police and security services ""have worked tirelessly"" to identify people intending to join the Islamic State group overseas and prevent them from leaving the country. He told the House of Commons in February that900 people people from the UK were estimated to have joined the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.,external Of those, 40% were estimated to still be somewhere in the region, 40% to have returned, and 20% to have been killed in battle. Mr Javid also emphasised the importance of international co-operation in combating terrorism. ""As these threats become more global we all rely on an international system of defence, policing, security and intelligence - a safety net based upon co-operation and unity,"" he said. ""These structures rely upon free, democratic nations to pool information, co-ordinate law enforcement action and surrender suspected criminals across borders."" Sir Peter Fahy, former counter-terrorism lead for the Association of Chief Police Officers said the changes had been ""a long time coming"" but there would be complications over who it covered. Sir Peter agreed there was a ""tremendous need"" to reassure allies, adding: ""The world is a very uncertain place at the moment... the whole issue about Brexit, thisissue about Huaweiand thesituation with Iranis creating tension with the United States. ""People involved in counter-terrorism will be looking to see if that does affect the level of co-operation.""

Google restricts Huawei's use of Android,"This video can not be played Young people in Singapore say they are now wary of buying Huawei phones Google has barred the world's second biggest smartphone maker, Huawei, from some updates to the Android operating system, dealing a blow to the Chinese company. New designs of Huawei smartphones are set to lose access to some Google apps. The move comes after the Trump administration added Huawei to a list of companies that American firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence. Google said it was ""complying with the order and reviewing the implications"". Huawei said it would continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold or are still in stock globally. ""We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally,"" it added. Huawei's Android loss: How it affects you In a press briefing, China said it ""supports the relevant company [Huawei] to defend its legitimate rights according to law"". Existing Huawei smartphone users will be able to update apps and push through security fixes, as well as update Google Play services. But when Google launches the next version of Android later this year, it may not be available on Huawei devices. Future Huawei devices may no longer have apps such as YouTube and Maps. Huawei can still use the version of the Android operating system available through an open source licence. Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy, said the move by Google would have ""big implications for Huawei's consumer business"". UK mobile trade body Mobile UK said it was ""working closely with relevant authorities to understand the implications of the US Department of Commerce's placement of Huawei on its Entity List."" This video can not be played What does Google's move mean for Huawei phone users? Last Wednesday, the Trump administration added Huawei to its ""entity list,external"", which bans the company from acquiring technology from US firms without government approval. Trump declares national emergency over IT threats Huawei: The world's most controversial company? Which countries are blocking Huawei? In his first comments since the firm was placed on the list, Huawei chief executive Ren Zhengfei told Japanese media on Saturday: ""We have already been preparing for this."" He said the firm, which buys about $67bn (Â£52.6bn) worth of components each year according to the Nikkei business newspaper, would push ahead with developing its own parts. Huawei faces a growing backlash from Western countries, led by the US, over possible risks posed by using its products in next-generation 5G mobile networks. Several countries have raised concerns that Huawei equipment could be used by China for surveillance, allegations the company has vehemently denied. Huawei has said its work does not pose any threats and that it is independent from the Chinese government. However, some countries have blocked telecoms companies from using Huawei products in 5G mobile networks. So far the UK has held back from any formal ban. ""Huawei has been working hard on developing its own App Gallery and other software assets in a similar manner to its work on chipset solutions. There is little doubt these efforts are part of its desire to control its own destiny,"" said Mr Wood. US chipmakers including Intel, Qualcomm and Broadcom are reported to have told their workers they will stop supplying Huawei,according to Bloomberg,external. Intel would not to comment to the BBC. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Ryan Koontz said Huawei would be ""seriously crippled"" if it did not have these ""key US components"", although the Chinese firm is believed to have stockpiles in place. California-based Xilinx said it was aware of the order by the Trump administration and was ""co-operating"" but had nothing to add. Outside the US, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is continuing to deliver to Huawei. The Nikkei reported that TSMC had said it owned a ""complicated and sophisticated export control compliance system"" and ""based on the data in the system we are not changing our shipping practice for the time being"". This video can not be played We explain the controversy around Huawei's 5G tech â using castles By Leo Kelion, BBC Technology desk editor In the short term, this could be very damaging for Huawei in the West. Smartphone shoppers would not want an Android phone that lacked access to Google's Play Store, its virtual assistant or security updates, assuming these are among the services that would be pulled. In the longer term, though, this might give smartphone vendors in general a reason to seriously consider the need for a viable alternative to Google's operating system, particularly at a time that the search giant is trying to push its own Pixel brand at their expense. As far as Huawei is concerned, it appears to have prepared for the eventuality of being cut off from American know-how. Its smartphones are already powered by its own proprietary processors, and earlier this year its consumer devices chieftold German newspaper Die Welt that,external""we have prepared our own operating systems - that's our plan B"". Even so, this move could knock its ambition to overtake Samsung and become the bestselling smartphone brand in 2020 seriously off course. The latest move against Huawei marks an escalation in tensions between the firm and the US. The company isfacing almost two dozen criminal charges filed by US authorities. Washington is also seeking the extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wangzou from Canada, where she was arrested in December at the behest of American officials. It comes as trade tensions between the US and China also appear to be rising. The world's two largest economies have been locked in a bruising trade battle for the past year that has seen tariffs imposed on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. A quick guide to the US-China trade war Moving to Vietnam to avoid US-China trade war Earlier this month, Washington more than doubled tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate with its own tariff hikes on US products. The move surprised some - and rattled global markets - as the situation had seemed to be nearing a conclusion. The US-China trade war has weighed on the global economy over the past year and created uncertainty for businesses and consumers.

Iran dismisses Trump's 'genocidal taunts',"Mohammad Javad Zarif has insisted that Iran does not want a war Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has dismissed US President Donald Trump's ""genocidal taunts"" and warned him not to threaten the country. Amid rising tensions, Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday: ""If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran."" Mr Zarif said the US president should look to history. ""Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone... Try respect - it works!"" The US has deployed additional warships and planes to the Gulf in recent days. But Mr Trump's tweet marked a shift in tone after recent attempts by him to downplay the possibility of a military conflict with Iran. When asked by reporters on Thursday if the US was going to war, he said: ""I hope not."" Iranian state media reported on Monday that the country had increased by fourfold its production of low-enriched uranium, which was limited to a 300kg stockpile by the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Is the United States heading for war with Iran? Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI), said Iran would ""go beyond the 300kg limit in the not too distant future"". This video can not be played ""US now in isolation over Iran,"" says James Clapper, former director of US national intelligence ""If they want us to maintain this limit, it would be better for European countries to take the measures they want to implement as soon as possible."" Mr Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear deal last year, but the European parties say they remain committed to it. The US president's warning to Iran on Sunday was issued hours after a rocket was fired into the heavily fortified Green Zone in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, and hit a building about 0.5km (0.3 miles) from the US embassy. The US recently evacuated non-emergency staff from the mission because of what it called a ""serious"" threat reportedly linked to Iran-backed forces in Iraq. A rocket landed half a kilometre from the US embassy in central Baghdad on Sunday Writing on Twitter on Monday, Iran's foreign minister said the US president was being ""goaded"" by what he called the ""B Team"" - a reference to US National Security Adviser John Bolton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. Mr Trump ""hopes to achieve what Alexander [the Great], Genghis [Khan] & other aggressors failed to do. Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone. #EconomicTerrorism & genocidal taunts won't 'end Iran',"" he added. ""#NeverThreatenAnIranian. Try respect - it works!"" Tensions began rising earlier this month, whenthe US ended exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying from Iran. The decision was intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue. Mr Trump reinstated the sanctions last year after abandoning a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that he wants to renegotiate. Days later, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saidhis country was suspending several commitments under the dealand threatened to step up uranium enrichment if European countries did not act to protect its oil and banking industries from the effects of the US sanctions with two months. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The White House then announced that the US was sending an aircraft carrier, B-52 bombers and a Patriot missile defence battery to the region because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. Last week,four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman were damaged in what the United Arab Emirates said were sabotage attacks, and drone attacks on two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Houthi rebels - who are supported by Iran - forced the temporary closure of a pipeline. Iran has denied that it was behind two incidents. There were also unconfirmed reports, citing US and regional security officials, that Iran had loaded missiles onto boats in Iranian ports and that Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary fighters had positioned rockets near facilities in Iraq used by US troops. ""I would say to the Iranians: do not underestimate the resolve on the US side,"" UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told reporters in Geneva on Monday. ""They don't want a war with Iran. But if American interests are attacked, they will retaliate."" The USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group has been deployed to the Gulf ""We want the situation to de-escalate, because this is a part of the world where things can get triggered accidentally,"" he added. Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, said the kingdom ""does not want a war, is not looking for it and will do everything to prevent it"". ""But at the same time, if the other side chooses war, the kingdom will respond with strength and determination to defend itself and its interests."" The foreign minister of Oman, which has brokered secret talks between the US and Iran in the past, visited Tehran to discuss regional issues with Mr Zarif on Monday.

Huawei's Android loss: How it affects you,"Huawei's smartphone division's success has been tied to the popularity of Google's Android The restrictions being placed on Huawei's access to the Android operating system will cast a long shadow over Tuesday's launch of the Chinese company's latest handsets. The firm has invited press from across the globe to London to witness the unveiling of its Honor 20 Series smartphones. The BBC understands the devices will still offer the full Android experience - including use of Google's own app store. But unless a clash with the US government is resolved,future launches are set to deliver a much more limited experience- assuming Huawei decides to run them off Android at all. As yet it is unclear whether the restrictions Google has imposed on Huawei will be long-lasting. Huawei had sent out this invitation to the launch of new smartphones under its Honor sub-brand Presumably Google does not want to break ties with what is the world's second bestselling Android phone-maker after Samsung - the Chinese firm recentlysaid more than half a billion consumers use its handsets.,external In theory,the US's Bureau of Industry and Security,externalcould issue a licence to let Google continue the relationship or at least parts of it, or even make a U-turn and drop its restrictions altogether. But assuming the matter is not resolved soon, let's try and pick our way through the consequences. The US tech firm is suspending all business activity with Huawei related to ""non-public"" transfers of hardware, software and technical services. That does not mean that Huawei loses all access to Android, as the core operating systemis an open source project.,externalAny manufacturer can modify it and install it on their devices without having to get permission. But in practice, all the major vendors rely on a lot of support from Google. In addition, Google controls access to several add-on bits of software, including: the Play app store its own apps the Google Assistant virtual helper the Gmail email service tools that allow third-party services access to certain functions Owners of Huawei or Honor phones will not find that they suddenly cannot install new apps or get updates for Google services. Huawei shipped about 3.1 million handsets to the UK between April 2018 and March 2019, according to analysts IDC, making it the third most popular brand after Apple and Samsung The reason is that their devices have already been certified under processes known as the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) and the Vendor Test Suite (VTS). As a consequence, Google can provide them with new versions of its products and authorise downloads from its Play marketplace, without having to directly deal with Huawei itself. Huawei's use of Android restricted by Google Vodafone's 5G UK service to use Huawei kit at launch Why UK is at odds with its cyber-allies over Huawei However, matters become more complex when it comes to security updates. The way these typically work is that Google gives Android device-makers the code for its software fixes about one month before it reveals details to the public about the vulnerabilities involved. This gives manufacturers time to check the patches do not cause problems for their own proprietary software, and then to package up a customised version of the fixes as a download. Huawei will now only learn of the patches on the same day they are released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), meaning there will be a lag before it can distribute them. Huawei has promised to continue providing security updates for its smartphones That could theoretically result in a situation in which a serious flaw is revealed and Huawei's devices  remain exposed for several days or weeks. New phones will not be certified, and as a consequence willnot be able to have Google Mobile Services (GMS) pre-installed.,external This includes a suite of Google's own apps including: the Play stores for apps, music and other media Google Photos YouTube Google Maps Google Drive cloud storage Google Duo video calls Some of these services will still be accessible via the web, but many would find that less convenient. The loss will not have much impact on China-based users, who are already blocked from accessing most of Google's facilities. But elsewhere, it could be a deal-breaker for many consumers. They would still be able to install third-party apps via alternative stores or a process known as side-loading. But Google prevents its own apps being installed on uncertified devices. Furthermore, losing access to GMS also means that third-party developers would not be able to tap into Google's application programming interfaces (APIs) on new devices. The consequences would be that their apps could lose some functions. Huawei would be unable to install the GMS suite of apps on its forthcoming phones ""Let's say an app wants to send a notification to your device,"" Mishaal Rahman, editor-in-chief of the news site XDA-developers.com, explained to the BBC. ""There's a really, really good chance that it's using Google Play Services for its push notification service. So any apps - even Twitter - could stop working with push notifications."" Another example, he added, would be the loss of Casting, a facility that allows handsets to wirelessly stream audio and video to a TV or other equipment via a tap of an icon. There has already been a lot of speculation that Huawei devices might be stuck with the current version of Android. But Mr Rahman believes that is unlikely to be the case since the next version - Android Q - will also be open source and Google has already shared most of the source code with Huawei and other partners. However, he added that things could be more tricky for the subsequent release - Android R - in 2020. ""What happens is that Google's top partners - which includes companies like Huawei and Samsung - get early access to the preview code many months before the public beta release,"" he explained. ""That gives them a big head-start on adapting their own software releases. ""The impact on Huawei would be that it would lose several months of development time."" Moreover, Mr Rahman added, even if the Chinese company was willing to accept it could only offer the operating system much later than its competitors, it would also face a marketing nightmare. ""Android is actually a brand, and in order to use it your software must [be certified],"" he explained. ""So, even if Huawei continues to sell devices using the open source code, it cannot legally call its devices Android."" Huawei told the BBC it would prefer to work with Android, but has created a new operating system as a Plan B ""We have been making plans for this possible outcome - but it hasn't happened yet,"" Jeremy Thompson, Huawei's UK executive vice president said. ""We have a parallel programme in place to develop an alternativeâ¦ which we think will delight our customers. ""In the short-term it's not good news for Huawei, but I think we can manage that."" Huawei's consumer business chief Richard Yu has also confirmed it has developed an alternative to Android In China, that might not be too disruptive a move, thanks to the fact that device-owners spend much of their time within WeChat - a platform that allows third-party apps to run within it. Furthermore, other developers are likely to be put under pressure to quickly release versions of their stand-alone apps for the new operating system. But elsewhere the move could be highly problematic. ""Whatever they have cooked up is dead in the water,"" claimed Mr Rahman. ""The critical part of success with a mobile OS is the number of apps available on the market. ""And besides Apple's iOS, Android has the biggest developer platform.""

Is the US heading for war with Iran?,"The US has deployed the aircraft carrier strike group to the Gulf There are two competing narratives. The first, which is favoured by US President Donald Trump's administration, is that Iran is up to no good. Preparations are said to have been seen for a potential attack on US targets, though few details have been revealed publicly. The US has moved reinforcements to the region; it is reducing its non-essential diplomatic personnel in Iraq; and it is reportedly dusting off war plans. The message to Tehran is clear: any attack on a US target from whatever source, be it Iran or one of its many proxies or allies in the region, will be met by a significant military response. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The second narrative lays the blame for this crisis squarely at Washington's door. Iran - not surprisingly - holds to this view, but so too do many domestic critics of the Trump administration's approach. Indeed, to varying degrees many of Mr Trump's key European allies share some of these concerns. According to this narrative, the ""Iran hawks"" in the Trump administration - people like National Security Adviser John Bolton, or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - sense an opportunity. Their goal, this narrative argues, is regime change in Tehran. And if maximum economic pressure does not work then they believe, military action is not ruled out in the appropriate circumstances. Reinstated US sanctions have pushed Iran's economy towards a deep recession These two narratives reflect different interpretations of the reality and, as so often, they play up certain facts and ignore others to make their case. But perceptions here matter just as much as reality. Indeed, in many ways they produce the reality. And that reality is that a conflict between the US and Iran - albeit by accident rather than design - is more likely today than at any time since Mr Trump took office. Tensions in the Middle East are certainly mounting. Iran, its economy suffering from the re-imposition of US sanctions that were lifted under a 2015 nuclear accord with world powers, is pushing back. It has warned that it may no longer abide by the restrictions on its nuclear activities. Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, has said it does not want to pull out of the nuclear deal The arrival of Mr Trump was a turning point. The president pulled the US out of the nuclear deal a year ago and embarked upon a policy of maximum pressure against Tehran. Iran has had enough. It is pushing the Europeans to do more to help its ailing economy and threatening if they do not - and it is hard to see what they can do - it will go ahead and breach the nuclear deal. That would only give the Trump administration additional ammunition. John Bolton, the US national security adviser, has long pushed for regime change in Iran Much now depends upon the dynamics inside the Trump administration and also on Tehran's assessment of what is going on there. The president himself has sought to play down the idea that his officials are divided regarding Iran, and reports indicate that he has little enthusiasm for war. His opposition to military entanglements abroad is well-known. However Mr Trump is unlikely to back down if US forces or facilities are attacked. However this is not necessarily the way things may be seen in Tehran. Might Iran think that it can play off Mr Bolton against his boss; raising tensions enough for the national security adviser's perceived designs to be revealed perhaps precipitating his downfall? If that is Tehran's assessment, then it is a high-risk strategy. Spain withdrew a frigate from the US carrier strike group amid differences over Iran While Washington's key Middle Eastern allies - Israel and Saudi Arabia - may be applauding from the sidelines, Mr Trump's European partners are uneasy at the way things are heading. Spain, Germany and the Netherlands have all taken steps to suspend military activities in the region alongside the Americans, citing the rising tensions. This is not the moment to rehearse what a conflict between Iran and the US would look like. But comparisons between such a conflict and the 2003 Iraq war are unhelpful. Iran is a very different proposition to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. A full-scale invasion of Iran is not going to be on the cards. Rather, this would be an air and maritime conflict with a huge dose of asymmetry in Iran's responses. It could set the whole region ablaze. US-led forces invaded Iraq in 2003 and overthrew Saddam Hussein's regime There were those who predicted a major foreign policy catastrophe when Mr Trump took office. Instead, there is an unfolding and multi-dimensional crisis that has many elements and the Iran situation illustrates them all: an antipathy to international agreements; an over-reliance on regional allies with their own agendas to pursue; rising tensions with long-standing Nato partners; and, above all, an inability to determine and to prioritise Washington's real strategic interests. With the revival of great power competition, when the US is seeking to re-orientate its deployments and to bolster its armed forces to face a rising China and an emboldened Russia, where should Iran rate in Washington's strategic priorities? The US sees the thousands of Iran-backed Shia Muslim paramilitary fighters in Iraq as a threat Does the Iran threat really merit a major conflict? Many US strategic pundits would say no. Many accept that containing Tehran and, yes, threatening severe reprisals if US interests are attacked, may be necessary. But the steady drumbeat towards war is not. And one thing should be clear. There is no ""drift"" towards war. That suggests an involuntary process that people can do little about. If there is a conflict then it will be down to conscious decision-making, to the calculations and miscalculations of the Iranians and the Americans themselves.

Which countries block Huawei?,"The US decision to ban its companies from using foreign telecoms providers regarded as a security risk is the latest salvo apparently directed against Chinese tech giant Huawei. The US has been at the forefront of an effort to restrict the use of Huawei equipment in 5G mobile networks, citing serious security issues. Huawei is now facing resistance from other governments over the risk that its technology could be used for espionage. So which other countries are blocking Huawei's 5G technology, and which are allowing it to operate? What is 5G? A simple guide to why Huawei is in trouble This is new technology, in its very early stages of implementation, and many countries are still deciding what role - if any - Huawei should play. But Huawei says it has now signed more than 40 commercial 5G contracts around the world, including in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Australiaeffectively banned Huawei and another Chinese telecom firm, ZTE, last year when it applied national security rules to companies supplying equipment to telecoms firms. New Zealandhas blocked Huawei from supplying one mobile network with 5G equipment, but has not yet ruled out all Huawei 5G contracts completely. These two countries, along with the UK and Canada, make up the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network with the US. The UKis still reviewing its 5G telecoms policy and may allow Huawei to supply ""non-core"" 5G components, such as antenna masts. Huawei role in UK 'an unnecessary risk' The story of a controversial company Canadais still weighing up its decision over Huawei. The United Stateshas effectively blocked all Huawei involvement in its 5G networks. So far, no European country has formally blocked Huawei, and the majority of the company's current global 5G contracts are with companies operating within Europe. The EU in March issued recommendations about 5G security, asking member states to review their networks by the end of June and report their findings to the EU Commission. Despite pressure from the United States,Germanyhas resisted a ban, andFrancehas not indicated it plans to follow a tough line against the Chinese company. The Netherlands'largest telecom firm, KPN, has already made clear that it would not allow Huawei to build its ""core"" 5G infrastructure, but it could supply other equipment considered less sensitive. The Dutch government is expected to make a decision on using Huawei equipment by the end of June. A telecoms firm inRussiasigned a deal with Huawei on 5G technology during a visit to the country in June by the Chinese president. South Korealaunched commercial 5G services last month, and one of its three carriers has used 5G equipment supplied by Huawei. 5G trials are due to be carried out inIndialater this year with Huawei one of the companies invited to take part. However, there are reports that India may limit Huawei's involvement in developing its 5G infrastructure. Malaysiahas already made clear that Huawei can be involved in developing its 5G networks, with the prime minister visiting the company's office in Beijing in April. South Korea now has a nationwide 5G network InIndonesia, the country's telecoms minister said earlier this year that it could not afford to be ""paranoid"" over using Huawei technology. InThailand, Huawei has already launched a 5G test project. Vietnam, which is developing a 5G network, has not officially banned Huawei, although one of the largest largest telecoms carriers is currently using Ericsson technology. Japanhas blocked the use of Huawei equipment for 5G over security fears, although as in other countries, Huawei kit is part of the existing 4G network. The growth of 5G is likely to lead to other opportunities for Huawei around the world. The company says it already has 10 confirmed 5G contracts in the Middle East. The African continent has not been in the forefront of early 5G adoption, but its more advanced economies provide potentially fertile markets. InSouth Africa, for example, Huawei has already announced its involvement in a commercial 5G network in Johannesburg with the mobile data provider, Rain. According to one industry-wide body,there were more than 200 operators in 85 countries investing in 5G networks in some form or another by March this year.,external Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external Trump declares emergency over IT threats Huawei willing to sign 'no-spy' agreements 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Huawei's Android loss: How it affects youGoogle's move to end business ties with Huawei will affect current devices and future purchases.Technology,"Huawei's smartphone division's success has been tied to the popularity of Google's Android The restrictions being placed on Huawei's access to the Android operating system will cast a long shadow over Tuesday's launch of the Chinese company's latest handsets. The firm has invited press from across the globe to London to witness the unveiling of its Honor 20 Series smartphones. The BBC understands the devices will still offer the full Android experience - including use of Google's own app store. But unless a clash with the US government is resolved,future launches are set to deliver a much more limited experience- assuming Huawei decides to run them off Android at all. As yet it is unclear whether the restrictions Google has imposed on Huawei will be long-lasting. Huawei had sent out this invitation to the launch of new smartphones under its Honor sub-brand Presumably Google does not want to break ties with what is the world's second bestselling Android phone-maker after Samsung - the Chinese firm recentlysaid more than half a billion consumers use its handsets.,external In theory,the US's Bureau of Industry and Security,externalcould issue a licence to let Google continue the relationship or at least parts of it, or even make a U-turn and drop its restrictions altogether. But assuming the matter is not resolved soon, let's try and pick our way through the consequences. The US tech firm is suspending all business activity with Huawei related to ""non-public"" transfers of hardware, software and technical services. That does not mean that Huawei loses all access to Android, as the core operating systemis an open source project.,externalAny manufacturer can modify it and install it on their devices without having to get permission. But in practice, all the major vendors rely on a lot of support from Google. In addition, Google controls access to several add-on bits of software, including: the Play app store its own apps the Google Assistant virtual helper the Gmail email service tools that allow third-party services access to certain functions Owners of Huawei or Honor phones will not find that they suddenly cannot install new apps or get updates for Google services. Huawei shipped about 3.1 million handsets to the UK between April 2018 and March 2019, according to analysts IDC, making it the third most popular brand after Apple and Samsung The reason is that their devices have already been certified under processes known as the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) and the Vendor Test Suite (VTS). As a consequence, Google can provide them with new versions of its products and authorise downloads from its Play marketplace, without having to directly deal with Huawei itself. Huawei's use of Android restricted by Google Vodafone's 5G UK service to use Huawei kit at launch Why UK is at odds with its cyber-allies over Huawei However, matters become more complex when it comes to security updates. The way these typically work is that Google gives Android device-makers the code for its software fixes about one month before it reveals details to the public about the vulnerabilities involved. This gives manufacturers time to check the patches do not cause problems for their own proprietary software, and then to package up a customised version of the fixes as a download. Huawei will now only learn of the patches on the same day they are released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), meaning there will be a lag before it can distribute them. Huawei has promised to continue providing security updates for its smartphones That could theoretically result in a situation in which a serious flaw is revealed and Huawei's devices  remain exposed for several days or weeks. New phones will not be certified, and as a consequence willnot be able to have Google Mobile Services (GMS) pre-installed.,external This includes a suite of Google's own apps including: the Play stores for apps, music and other media Google Photos YouTube Google Maps Google Drive cloud storage Google Duo video calls Some of these services will still be accessible via the web, but many would find that less convenient. The loss will not have much impact on China-based users, who are already blocked from accessing most of Google's facilities. But elsewhere, it could be a deal-breaker for many consumers. They would still be able to install third-party apps via alternative stores or a process known as side-loading. But Google prevents its own apps being installed on uncertified devices. Furthermore, losing access to GMS also means that third-party developers would not be able to tap into Google's application programming interfaces (APIs) on new devices. The consequences would be that their apps could lose some functions. Huawei would be unable to install the GMS suite of apps on its forthcoming phones ""Let's say an app wants to send a notification to your device,"" Mishaal Rahman, editor-in-chief of the news site XDA-developers.com, explained to the BBC. ""There's a really, really good chance that it's using Google Play Services for its push notification service. So any apps - even Twitter - could stop working with push notifications."" Another example, he added, would be the loss of Casting, a facility that allows handsets to wirelessly stream audio and video to a TV or other equipment via a tap of an icon. There has already been a lot of speculation that Huawei devices might be stuck with the current version of Android. But Mr Rahman believes that is unlikely to be the case since the next version - Android Q - will also be open source and Google has already shared most of the source code with Huawei and other partners. However, he added that things could be more tricky for the subsequent release - Android R - in 2020. ""What happens is that Google's top partners - which includes companies like Huawei and Samsung - get early access to the preview code many months before the public beta release,"" he explained. ""That gives them a big head-start on adapting their own software releases. ""The impact on Huawei would be that it would lose several months of development time."" Moreover, Mr Rahman added, even if the Chinese company was willing to accept it could only offer the operating system much later than its competitors, it would also face a marketing nightmare. ""Android is actually a brand, and in order to use it your software must [be certified],"" he explained. ""So, even if Huawei continues to sell devices using the open source code, it cannot legally call its devices Android."" Huawei told the BBC it would prefer to work with Android, but has created a new operating system as a Plan B ""We have been making plans for this possible outcome - but it hasn't happened yet,"" Jeremy Thompson, Huawei's UK executive vice president said. ""We have a parallel programme in place to develop an alternativeâ¦ which we think will delight our customers. ""In the short-term it's not good news for Huawei, but I think we can manage that."" Huawei's consumer business chief Richard Yu has also confirmed it has developed an alternative to Android In China, that might not be too disruptive a move, thanks to the fact that device-owners spend much of their time within WeChat - a platform that allows third-party apps to run within it. Furthermore, other developers are likely to be put under pressure to quickly release versions of their stand-alone apps for the new operating system. But elsewhere the move could be highly problematic. ""Whatever they have cooked up is dead in the water,"" claimed Mr Rahman. ""The critical part of success with a mobile OS is the number of apps available on the market. ""And besides Apple's iOS, Android has the biggest developer platform.""

Britons could be banned from Syria,"Foreign spies in the UK might have to add their names to a register under a new espionage bill, Home Secretary Sajid Javid has said. It would aim to tackle threats from hostile states, he said in a speech at New Scotland Yard in London. He also said Syria and parts of west Africa could be designated as banned countries, with Britons who travelled there breaking the law. The new bill would update the Official Secrets Act and the laws on treason. He has also appointed Jonathan Hall QC as a watchdog to monitor the new terror laws. A register would act as a deterrent to spying and make it easier to take action against those involved, Mr Javid said. The home secretary said the tempo of terrorist activity was increasing, with 19 plots foiled in the UK in two years. No, the proposed Foreign Agents Register isn't an attempt to get spies to cough up - that would be ridiculous. The purpose, it appears, is to regulate legitimate political and government lobbying by people acting on behalf of overseas states and interests and ensure it's carried out in a more transparent way. Suspicion would inevitably fall on those who don't register; they'd face prosecution.  Equally, those who have made a declaration but don't comply with the rules could also face sanctions. The US has had similar legislation for more than 80 years and in December 2018 Australia introduced a ""Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme"" with a register available to see at the click of a button. Although the home secretary's plans are at an early stage, it's hoped they could help the authorities identify and take action against those intent on undermining the country's way of life through tactics of subversion and disinformation. The changes come after Britons in Syria asked to return to the UK. Shamima Begum - whohad her UK citizenship revoked by Mr Javid in February- was found in a Syrian refugee camp after leaving London to join the Islamic State group when she was 15. Mr Javid said people travelling to, or remaining in, certain areas of Syria without good reason could face up to 10 years in prison. UK terrorism threat: How has it changed? Speaking to senior security figures in central London, Mr Javid set out for the first time how he expects to use the new Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act. He said there were ""real gaps"" in legislation concerning so-called 'hostile states'. He said: ""I've asked my officials to work closely with the police and intelligence agencies to urgently review the case for exercising this power in relation to Syria, with a particular focus on Idlib and the north east. ""Anyone who is in these areas without a legitimate reason should be on notice."" This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" The north-western Syrian province of Idlib isthe last remaining stronghold controlled by forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. Mr Javid said police and security services ""have worked tirelessly"" to identify people intending to join the Islamic State group overseas and prevent them from leaving the country. He told the House of Commons in February that900 people people from the UK were estimated to have joined the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.,external Of those, 40% were estimated to still be somewhere in the region, 40% to have returned, and 20% to have been killed in battle. Mr Javid also emphasised the importance of international co-operation in combating terrorism. ""As these threats become more global we all rely on an international system of defence, policing, security and intelligence - a safety net based upon co-operation and unity,"" he said. ""These structures rely upon free, democratic nations to pool information, co-ordinate law enforcement action and surrender suspected criminals across borders."" Sir Peter Fahy, former counter-terrorism lead for the Association of Chief Police Officers said the changes had been ""a long time coming"" but there would be complications over who it covered. Sir Peter agreed there was a ""tremendous need"" to reassure allies, adding: ""The world is a very uncertain place at the moment... the whole issue about Brexit, thisissue about Huaweiand thesituation with Iranis creating tension with the United States. ""People involved in counter-terrorism will be looking to see if that does affect the level of co-operation.""

Scottish bank branches 'here for decades',"The boss of Lloyds Bank in Scotland has predicted traditional branches will still be around in 30 or 40 years, as he announced a digital expansion. Philip Grant said the banking group was creating 500 high-skilled tech jobs in Edinburgh because customers wanted more access to financial services online. Mr Grant said he understood concerns about branch closures. But he said Lloyds was committed to maintaining face-to-face services for vulnerable and other customers. The bank's new tech hub will be based at its Scottish Widows headquarters, with the new jobs phased in over the next 18 months. The hub will develop technology for a number of the bank's brands It will develop new technology for Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and Scottish Widows customers. The announcement comes after a Â£3bn investment was announced last year to overhaul digital services. Most high street banks, including Lloyds, have been shutting branches in recent years as more customers conduct their banking through apps or on the internet. Cash fears as third of Scottish banks lost Lloyds revamp to affect thousands of jobs Shared 'hubs' urged for bankless towns Last year, the group earmarked more than 60 branches for closure, while in 2017 it closed dozens of Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and Halifax branches. Mr Grant told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that Lloyds Banking Group ran one in five UK bank branches, but now also operated Britain's biggest digital bank, with 16 million users. And he said 70% of new products offered by Lloyds were acquired online. Philip Grant said the group's tech labs were ""designing what customers will need in the future"" On branch closures, Mr Grant said: ""While I understand the concern at a local level about changes we're making to that part of our service, we have a responsibility to invest in our new growing part of our business at the same time. ""The move towards digital is helping us be much more efficient, but there are lots of times when our customers need a space to come and talk to us. ""We have vulnerable customers who need that attention, and there are 'moments of truth' in our life experience where you need to speak to an individual. ""We're also making that available digitally as well, through digital videos on our app."" He added: ""I think there is still a place for branch and if I was a betting man, I would say in 30 or 40 years, we'll still have bank branches in Scotland."" Mr Grant, who has just been named as the new chairman of the industry body Scottish Financial Enterprise, said Scotland was a great place to grow a business, despite some challenges. ""Right now the whole sector is focussing on readiness for Brexit - supporting customers in whatever the next weeks and months bring,"" he said. ""Beyond that, the biggest challenge we have is skills and talent and ensuring in the rapid changes in our business that we can anticipate them."" Mr Grant said there was now a drive to attract software engineers, designers and other people with technology skills who would not have previously thought of a career in financial services. He said: ""I think that's one of our biggest challenges - keeping pace with that.""

Thousands affected by airport delays,"The chaos meant there would be no Roman holiday for Sheree Hogg and her partner Shaun Waring About 13,000 people have been affected by delays at Manchester Airport caused by problems with fuel supplies. Flights to Tenerife, Belfast and Milan were among 87 cancelledon Sunday, while others were delayed by hours. The airport has apologised, saying the issues were resolved by 03:00 BST and flights are operating as planned apart from four cancelled Flybe flights. Sheree Hogg, from Preston, said she was ""gutted"" to miss out on a trip to Rome for her 30th birthday. The surprise holiday was a present from her fiancÃ© Shaun Waring, who had been planning the trip for months. Ms Hogg said she and her fellow passengers on the 17:45 Ryanair flight on Sunday were ""left stranded... we were just shuffled out and we didn't know where to go"". ""It was absolute carnage."" Manchester Airport says ""most flights"" are now operating as normal She added: ""We queued for five hours to try and get an alternative flight... only to be told there was nothing until Wednesday. ""It was almost 2am at this point and we had no car and no train - we even had to organise our own taxi home which cost Â£80."" The couple have now booked a few days in Whitby. ""It's not Rome but we're going to make the most of it."" One unnamed passenger, who had to stay at a hotel overnight after his flight was cancelled, told the BBC: ""Our flight to Geneva was cancelled and what happened then was complete and utter chaos. ""The lack of customer service was unbelievably poor. There were about 400 people having to rebook flights and the queue which started at about 18:30 was still 100 people deep at 23:30 last night. ""We now have to get to Manchester Piccadilly to get a train to Euston, a Tube to London City Airport and a flight from London tonight to Geneva because there were no other flights available. ""I'll never come to Manchester Airport again. I will find another airport."" He described the situation as ""the pits"". Alessandro Biraglia, a lecturer at University of Leeds Business School, was also caught up in the delays and said the way BA handled it was ""embarrassing"". He was due to depart Manchester via London Heathrow at 20:05 on Sunday for a conference in Argentina. After a three-hour delay he was told a hotel and taxi had been booked for him in Manchester city centre by a third party company which deals with stranded passengers. However, the taxi had not been paid for and there was no record of the hotel booking, so he had to pay the cost of more than Â£100 out of his own pocket. Mr Biraglia said it was not how he taught business students to handle a crisis. ""As a silver lining I am planning to write a case to use in my services marketing class on the event and what could be done better. I will be happy to send it to British Airways free of charge."" Of the flights cancelled on Sunday, 42 were arrivals and 45 were departures. Money floods in for trashed model railway Woman donates Â£1,500 to help pug breathe Venice dream for Â£3m child artist A Manchester Airport spokesperson said: ""We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Ecuador hands Assange belongings to US,"The Wikileaks founder was holed up in Ecuador's London embassy for seven years to avoid extradition to Sweden Ecuador has seized some of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange's possessions left behind following his stay in its London embassy. An Ecuadorean judge authorised the seizure after a request for assistance by the US. Wikileaks said Ecuador was allowing US prosecutors to ""help themselves to Assange's belongings"". The material includes manuscripts, legal papers, medical records and electronic equipment, Wikileaks said. Mr Assange's lawyer called it ""completely unprecedented in the history of asylum"". ""Ecuador is committing a flagrant violation of the most basic norms of the institution of asylum by handing over all the asylee's personal belongings indiscriminately to the country that he was being protected from,"" added lawyer Aitor Martinez.

Swedish deputy director of public prosecutions, Eva-Marie Persson, said in a statement a request had been filed with the Uppsala district court to have Assange detained in his absence. 'Reckless hacktivist' or campaigner for truth? How likely is a conviction in US? She added that once the court had granted the request, she would then ask British authorities to transfer Assange to Sweden. Mr Assange was arrested on 11 April after being handed over to British authorities by Ecuador. He is serving a 50-week sentence in Belmarsh prison for skipping his extradition order. Correction 21 May 2019: A previous version of this article stated that Julian Assange's possessions had been handed over to the US. This has been amended to clarify that they have been seized by the Ecuadorean authorities following a US request.

'Too many' young in mental health hospitals,"Too many children in England are being admitted to mental health hospitals unnecessarily, according to a report. Research for the Children's Commissioner for England found children were often unable to get appropriate support at school and in the community. This was contributing to children ending up in institutions, sometimes for months or years, the report found. Children with learning disabilities or autism were being particularly let down by the system, it added. Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield's report says successive governments have tried to tackle the problem, but the number of children in mental health hospitals remains ""unacceptably high"". Research shows a clear need to ""focus on children's journeys before they are admitted into inpatient care"", the report says, but often this is not happening. ""Children, families and staff working in this area spoke again and again about how the failure to provide appropriate support to children when they are in school and living in the community, and particularly when they reach a crisis point, has contributed to inappropriate hospital admissions and delayed discharges,"" it says. Child mental health 'postcode lottery' Is young people's mental health getting worse? The review says there were 250 children identified as having a learning disability or autism in mental health hospitals in England in February 2019, compared with 110 in March 2015. According to the report, NHS England said the figure of 110 was due to under-identification of these children in the past. But even using adjusted figures from NHS England, the number has still not come down in the last four years, the report says. It says it is ""particularly concerning"" that these findings come after NHS England's Transforming Care programme, which sought to improve the quality of care for people with a learning disability or autism. Ms Longfield said: ""They are some of the most vulnerable children of all, with very complex needs, growing up in institutions usually far away from their family home. ""For many of them this is a frightening and overwhelming experience. For many of their families it is a nightmare."" Ms Longfield said she had spoken to parents whose children had been ""locked away in a series of rooms for months"". ""Others have to listen as they are told by institutions that their child has had to be restrained or forcibly injected with sedatives,"" she said. ""They feel powerless and, frankly, at their wits' end as to what to do."" Ms Longfield is calling for a national strategy to ""address the values and culture of the wider system across the NHS, education and local government so that a failure to provide earlier help is unacceptable, and admission to hospital or a residential special school is no longer seen as almost inevitable for some children"". A spokesman for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said some of the most vulnerable children were being ""horribly failed"". He said: ""No child should be left to languish alone and it's important that the government takes urgent action to provide high quality, community-based care that can prevent the need for children to be placed in secure hospitals."" Improving child mental health 'years off' Children 'must be suicidal to get help' Tim Nicholls, head of policy at the National Autistic Society, said autistic children and adults were ""being failed by a broken system"". Wherever possible, autistic people should get the mental health support they need in their own community, he added. The government said it was determined to reduce the number of people with autism or learning disabilities who are in mental health hospitals. A spokeswoman said: ""The NHS is committed to reducing numbers of people with a learning disability and autistic people who are inpatients in mental health hospitals by 35% by the end of March 2020, and through the Long Term Plan we will reduce numbers even further by investing in specialist services and community crisis care and giving local areas greater control of their budgets to reduce avoidable admissions and enable shorter lengths of stay. ""The CQC [Care Quality Commission] is also undertaking an in-depth review into the use of seclusion, segregation and restraint  - which should only be used as a last resort - in order to improve standards across the system.""

Ryanair expects to win in airline 'fare wars',"Michael O'Leary says profits could suffer for the next couple of years Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary has said he expects the airline to benefit from any price war in the industry. Mr O'Leary said ""artificially low prices"" and ""attritional fare wars"" could dent profits for a year or two. He was speaking after the airline reported that profits fell by nearly a third last year to â¬1bn (Â£880m) because fuel costs rose and fares fell. Profits at Europe's biggest discount airline might also be lower this year, as fares could fall by up to 2%. For last year, Ryanair's average one-way fare was â¬37, down 6%, although this was offset by spending on services such as hotels and car hire. For the current financial year, the carrier said it was ""cautious"" on pricing and had ""zero"" visibility for the second half of the year. It said that while bookings in the first half of this year were slightly ahead of last year, ""fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue through 2019"". Ryanair's teasing of BA bungle backfires Ryanair named 'worst short-haul airline' Mr O'Leary said: ""Frankly, if we are in a period where there's going to be attritional fare wars for a year or two that's good for Ryanair... as... we have the lowest cost base... profits will suffer for a year or two and I think that is what our shareholders should expect. ""However it is clear in my mind that within the next four to five years you are seeing the emergence of four or five large European airline groups,"" he said. He referred to Ryanair, Lufthansa, IAG (owner of British Airways), Air France-KLM and, probably, Easyjet. Mergers of other airlines would lead to ""some upward pressure on pricing,"" he said. ""[Fares] will begin to rise again because they are artificially low at the moment,"" Mr O'Leary said. Despite a 7% increase in passenger numbers, earlier this year Ryanair was named the UK's least-liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running in a survey by consumer body Which?. Neil Sorahan, Ryanair's chief financial officer, told the BBC that the airline did not spend too much time worrying about surveys and that the most important thing was being on time. ""Our customers enjoyed an average fare of â¬37 which was down 6% on last year. At the same time, however, they continue to spend money on our ancillary products [car hire etc] which helps offset that,"" he said. Mr Sorahan said there was too much capacity in the market, and pointed to a wave of airline failures - such as Primera, Flybmi and WOW - caused by higher oil prices and lower fares. Last week,EasyJet reported a loss of Â£275min the six months to the end of March, compared with a Â£68m loss a year earlier, while troubled travel operatorThomas Cook is attempting to sell its airlineto plug a gap in financing after reported a Â£1.5bn half-year loss. Fuel prices are also an important factor to airline profitability and Ryanair said its bill for this year is expected to rise by â¬460m. The airline said its forecasts will also depend on last-minute fares and any impact from Brexit, but it estimated that profits could range between â¬750m and â¬950m. Ryanair is delaying deliveries of five of the Boeing 737 Max planes, which have been grounded because of two fatal crashes, but said it had the ""utmost confidence"" in the aircraft. The delay to deliveries from the spring will lead it to cut capacity by one million passengers this year, but it ultimately expects the planes to drive down costs and, Ryanair said, lead to lower prices for passengers. The airline expect the 737 Max planes to return to the air in July or August in the US, and September or October in the EU. Ryanair also announced it was buying back â¬700m of its shares, which analysts at Liberum said would support the share price in the short-term despite the ""disappointing"" guidance on profits for this year. ""Ryanair remains the long-term winner in the European airline industry, based on its leading market position, extensive network, low unit costs and strong balance sheet,"" Liberum said. ""We see tougher market conditions in the short term as positive for the stronger airlines in the long term, since this clears out weaker competitors and aids consolidation in the market."" Shares in Ryanair fell 6% in early trading, before recovering to stand 1% lower. Ryanair's profit figure excludes the loss of â¬139m from the Austrian airline Lauda it took over last year.

Lloyds to create 500 roles at new tech hub,"Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) has announced plans to create 500 high-skilled jobs at a new digital tech hub in Edinburgh. The bank has started recruiting software engineers and data scientists for the hub, which will be based at its Scottish Widows' headquarters. The new roles will be phased in over the next 18 months. LBG said it was responding to a shift in customer behaviour towards digital services. The hub will be used to develop new technology for Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Scottish Widows customers. The move is part of a Â£3bn investment announced by Lloyds last year to overhaul its digital services. Philip Grant said the group's tech labs were ""designing what customers will need in the future"" Most high street banks, including Lloyds, have been shutting branches in recent years as more customers conduct their banking through apps or on the internet. Last year, the group earmarked more than 60 branches for closure, while in 2017 it closed dozens of Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and Halifax branches. Lloyds said some of the roles at its new hub would be taken up by existing staff looking to upskill. Philip Grant, chairman of LBG's Scottish executive committee, said the group was working to ""strengthen our tech-based talent pool in Scotland"". He said: ""People's expectations are rising rapidly as they want the same experience they're used to with established digital brands. ""In our tech labs, we are designing what customers will need in the future, making products and services that can adapt to their lives and making it easier for them to connect with their finances."" Scotland's Economy Secretary Derek Mackay welcomed the announcement. He said: ""Edinburgh is fast becoming one of the UK's most competitive tech hubs, with growth in agile start-ups, offerings from its world-leading universities and new digital academies providing greater scale and choice for careers in the industry. ""Lloyds' investment will be a major boost towards growing the workforce of the future in Scotland, helping create a more dynamic and innovative side to its thriving financial sector."" Lloyds is already actively involved in the Edinburgh tech scene, regularly hosting digital academies and meet-ups including CodeClan and CodeBar, as well as partnerships with Fintech Scotland and HackerX.

China threatens US over Huawei,"Huawei denies that its products post a security threat to foreign nations China has threatened to retaliate against US sanctions seen as an attempt to restrict international trade by the Chinese technology giant Huawei. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Beijing opposed countries imposing unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and would take action. The Trump administration on Wednesday effectively blocked Huawei products from being used in US networks. The order does not name any company, but is believed to target Huawei. Huawei denies its products pose a security threat and says it is ready to engage with the US. Huawei role in UK 'an unnecessary risk' The story of a controversial company Beijing accused President Trump of engaging in industrial sabotage by using state security as ""as a pretext for suppressing foreign business"". ""We urge the US to stop this practice and instead create better conditions for business co-operation,"" Mr Lu said. He did not give any details over how China planned to retaliate. The confrontation over Huawei comes amid a broader trade war between the US and China, with both sides imposing aggressive tariffs on imports. Writing in the Evening Standard on Wednesday, Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, said China did not want a trade war but was ""not afraid of one and would fight one if necessary"". ""China is always open for talks but it would fight to the end should a 'trade war' break out,"" he wrote. According to a White House statement, Mr Trump's order aims to ""protect America from foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services"". It gives the secretary of commerce the power to ""prohibit transactions posing an unacceptable risk to the national security"", the statement adds. Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment The move was instantly welcomed by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who called it ""a significant step toward securing America's networks"". The US had already restricted federal agencies from using Huawei products and has encouraged allies to shun them, while Australia and New Zealand have both blocked the use of Huawei gear in 5G networks. The US cannot crush us, says Huawei boss In April 2018 another Chinese tech company, ZTE, was barred from buying US parts after it was placed on the same ""entity list"".It resumed business after reaching a deal with the US in July. Huawei has said its work does not pose any threats and that it is independent from the Chinese government. ""Restricting Huawei from doing business in the US will not make the US more secure or stronger,"" the company said in a statement. ""Instead, this will only serve to limit the US to inferior yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the US lagging behind in 5G deployment, and eventually harming the interests of US companies and consumers."" The company also said ""unreasonable restrictions"" on Huawei raised ""other serious legal issues"". During a meeting in London on Tuesday, Huaweisaid it was ""willing to sign no-spy agreements with governments""as concerns over the security of its products used in mobile networks continued to grow. Tara McKelvey, White House reporter Trump's executive order is designed to protect national security, and there is no doubt that Chinese technology can seem formidable. The Chinese use aggressive surveillance tools in their country and Trump has reason to be concerned. Some analysts say the president's order has gone too far, though. They point out that one significant breach - the Chinese recruitment of a former CIA officer, Kevin Mallory - was done through low-tech means: LinkedIn, a social media site. Mallory was convicted of spying, and he faces up to life in prison (he will be sentenced on Friday). These analysts say the threat from China is real, but that global telecommunications are nearly impossible to control and the best defence against espionage is not an executive order but old-fashioned vigilance among those who use computers and other technology. UK Prime Minister Theresa May last month provisionally approved Huawei technology for use in the nation's future 5G telecoms networks, but a leaked account of the meeting said five cabinet ministers raised concerns about the move. France, Germany and Belgium have not banned Huawei technology, but Japan has from public contracts. The US has pressured allies to shun Huawei in their next generation 5G mobile networks. The US has raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese imports and is threatening to tax an additional $300 billion worth. Stock markets have been hit by the row but have steadied in recent days amidhopes the two countries might hold talks. Do you have a question about Donald Trump's national emergency or Huawei?

Which countries are blocking Huawei?,"The US decision to ban its companies from using foreign telecoms providers regarded as a security risk is the latest salvo apparently directed against Chinese tech giant Huawei. The US has been at the forefront of an effort to restrict the use of Huawei equipment in 5G mobile networks, citing serious security issues. Huawei is now facing resistance from other governments over the risk that its technology could be used for espionage. So which other countries are blocking Huawei's 5G technology, and which are allowing it to operate? What is 5G? A simple guide to why Huawei is in trouble This is new technology, in its very early stages of implementation, and many countries are still deciding what role - if any - Huawei should play. But Huawei says it has now signed more than 40 commercial 5G contracts around the world, including in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Australiaeffectively banned Huawei and another Chinese telecom firm, ZTE, last year when it applied national security rules to companies supplying equipment to telecoms firms. New Zealandhas blocked Huawei from supplying one mobile network with 5G equipment, but has not yet ruled out all Huawei 5G contracts completely. These two countries, along with the UK and Canada, make up the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network with the US. The UKis still reviewing its 5G telecoms policy and may allow Huawei to supply ""non-core"" 5G components, such as antenna masts. Huawei role in UK 'an unnecessary risk' The story of a controversial company Canadais still weighing up its decision over Huawei. The United Stateshas effectively blocked all Huawei involvement in its 5G networks. So far, no European country has formally blocked Huawei, and the majority of the company's current global 5G contracts are with companies operating within Europe. The EU in March issued recommendations about 5G security, asking member states to review their networks by the end of June and report their findings to the EU Commission. Despite pressure from the United States,Germanyhas resisted a ban, andFrancehas not indicated it plans to follow a tough line against the Chinese company. The Netherlands'largest telecom firm, KPN, has already made clear that it would not allow Huawei to build its ""core"" 5G infrastructure, but it could supply other equipment considered less sensitive. The Dutch government is expected to make a decision on using Huawei equipment by the end of June. A telecoms firm inRussiasigned a deal with Huawei on 5G technology during a visit to the country in June by the Chinese president. South Korealaunched commercial 5G services last month, and one of its three carriers has used 5G equipment supplied by Huawei. 5G trials are due to be carried out inIndialater this year with Huawei one of the companies invited to take part. However, there are reports that India may limit Huawei's involvement in developing its 5G infrastructure. Malaysiahas already made clear that Huawei can be involved in developing its 5G networks, with the prime minister visiting the company's office in Beijing in April. South Korea now has a nationwide 5G network InIndonesia, the country's telecoms minister said earlier this year that it could not afford to be ""paranoid"" over using Huawei technology. InThailand, Huawei has already launched a 5G test project. Vietnam, which is developing a 5G network, has not officially banned Huawei, although one of the largest largest telecoms carriers is currently using Ericsson technology. Japanhas blocked the use of Huawei equipment for 5G over security fears, although as in other countries, Huawei kit is part of the existing 4G network. The growth of 5G is likely to lead to other opportunities for Huawei around the world. The company says it already has 10 confirmed 5G contracts in the Middle East.

US issues fresh Huawei warning to UK,"The US has warned that its intelligence sharing with other countries would have to be re-evaluated if those countries use Huawei to build their 5G networks. Senior US official Rob Strayer said any such role for the firm posed an ""unacceptable risk"" to security. It has been reported that the UK might allow the Chinese telecoms firm into the non-core parts of its 5G network. But opponents of the plan have raised concerns about Huawei's ties to the Chinese government. Last week, a leak from the UK's National Security Council indicatedthe government had decided to allow the Chinese telecoms firm to have a limited rolein bringing 5G to the UK. The news provoked controversy, with reports several of Prime Minister Theresa May's senior cabinet ministers had warned against the move. This video can not be played Emily Taylor from the Royal Institute of International Affairs explains what worries security experts about 5G. The US expressed serious concerns at the time, since, along with Australia and New Zealand, it belives the Chinese firm is a security risk because of its ties to the state. Responding to Mr Strayer's intervention, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""Our position has always been that where national security concerns arise in any foreign investment the government will assess the risks and consider what course of action to take."" China's ambassador in London saidBritain should resist pressure from other nations, and that the company had a ""good track record on security"". What is 5G? Huawei: The story of a controversial company Huawei ban 'would delay 5G rollout' Beijing defends Huawei Mr Strayer, the deputy assistant secretary for cyber and international communications at the US State Department, said the US was letting other countries know that if they put ""unsecure and untrusted vendors"" into their 5G networks, ""in any place"" then it was ""going to have to consider the risk that produces to our information-sharing arrangements with them"". 5G is the next - and fifth - generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Strayer said: ""We think the stakes couldn't be higher with regard to 5G technology, because of all of the things we build out over the coming years on top of that tech. ""This is truly a monumental decision being made now... we think there's unacceptable risk in letting untrusted vendors provide that base infrastructure because they could disrupt any of those critical services. ""In addition we're concerned about the ability for a government that has the track record... that China has, to potentially have access to that massive increase in data, personal data in many cases, that could be used in nefarious ways."" Mr Strayer earlier told journalists even allowing an ""untrustworthy"" operator into the ""edges"" of the network created risks of espionage or sabotage. He added: ""We should be concerned about all parts of the 5G network. No part of the 5G network should have parts or software coming from a vendor that could be under the control of an authoritarian government."" It is understood telecoms operators who use Huawei equipment in their networks have been asked to attend a meeting with officials including Mr Strayer at the US Embassy in London on Tuesday. 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. The world is going mobile and existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns, particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average and experts say 5G - which is starting to be rolled out in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster. What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Six UK cities named as 5G pioneers Huawei was started by a former People's Liberation Army officer in 1987. The company started out making equipment for phone networks and has grown rapidly to become a global leader. It is based in Shenzhen, Guangdong, and is owned by 80,000 of its 180,000 employees. More recently it has started making smartphones as well, and Huawei has now captured about 16% of the global market, making it the world's third-largest supplier after Samsung and Apple. The US points to its founder's military background and potential interference from the Chinese government to argue it represents a risk to national security. Australia and New Zealand have blocked telecoms companiesfrom using Huawei equipment in 5G networks, citing security concerns. But the company is keen to portray itself as a firm with no ties to the Chinese government. It says it prioritises safety and security and that at least some of the hostility is because the firm poses a competitive threat. Should we be worried about Huawei?

"Staff shortages 'abusing good will of nurses'Nursing chiefs want to see safe staffing rules enshrined in law as 40,000 posts remain vacant.Health","The good will of nurses in England is being abused by politicians who have failed to get to grips with a desperate shortage of staff, nurse leaders say. Royal College of Nursing general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair will call for safe staffing levels to be enshrined in law in a speech on Monday. There are currently nearly 40,000 nurse vacancies - one in nine posts. However, the government says it is committed to increasing the number of nurses in training. But Dame Donna, in an address to the RCN's annual conference in Liverpool, will say this is not enough. A report earlier this year by three leading think tankswarned vacancies could rise to 70,000 within five years and 100,000 in 10if action was not taken. Dame Donna will say the situation has been made worse by the removal of a student bursary for trainees and the introduction of tuition fees in 2016. She will also say the good will of nurses is being abused - and that ministers need to consider the financial and human cost of leaving jobs unfilled. She will demand tougher rules on safe staffing be introducing, criticising the ""vague metric"" currently used which does not distinguish between care provided by registered nurses or healthcare assistants. Dame Donna will point to the new staffing law in Scotland, which cleared its final parliamentary hurdle earlier this month, as evidence of how legislation can be introduced. Scotland is now the second country in the UK to set staffing accountability in law after Wales became the first in Europe to legislate in 2016. She will say: ""We will not stop until people are held to account for the desperate shortages each and every one of us has witnessed. Politicians must stop short-changing the public. ""They must stop the rot and put an end to the workforce crisis in nursing. ""Rather than only looking at the cost of educating and employing nurses, the government must think about the true cost - financial and human - of not doing it. 'Employers, decision-makers and ministers with the power to change things should not let individual nurses take the blame for systemic failings. ""The goodwill of nursing staff is being abused and politicians must know it is running out. I will not stand by while this profession is denigrated."" The Department of Health and Social Care has already announced plans to increase training places by 25% - and the NHS in England is now working on a long-term plan for the workforce. A spokeswoman praised the ""commitment"" of nurses and said the government would ""secure"" the staff the service needed.

"'Too many' young in mental health hospitalsA lack of support in schools and the community in England is contributing to the problem, says a report.UK","Too many children in England are being admitted to mental health hospitals unnecessarily, according to a report. Research for the Children's Commissioner for England found children were often unable to get appropriate support at school and in the community. This was contributing to children ending up in institutions, sometimes for months or years, the report found. Children with learning disabilities or autism were being particularly let down by the system, it added. Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield's report says successive governments have tried to tackle the problem, but the number of children in mental health hospitals remains ""unacceptably high"". Research shows a clear need to ""focus on children's journeys before they are admitted into inpatient care"", the report says, but often this is not happening. ""Children, families and staff working in this area spoke again and again about how the failure to provide appropriate support to children when they are in school and living in the community, and particularly when they reach a crisis point, has contributed to inappropriate hospital admissions and delayed discharges,"" it says. Child mental health 'postcode lottery' Is young people's mental health getting worse? The review says there were 250 children identified as having a learning disability or autism in mental health hospitals in England in February 2019, compared with 110 in March 2015. According to the report, NHS England said the figure of 110 was due to under-identification of these children in the past. But even using adjusted figures from NHS England, the number has still not come down in the last four years, the report says. It says it is ""particularly concerning"" that these findings come after NHS England's Transforming Care programme, which sought to improve the quality of care for people with a learning disability or autism. Ms Longfield said: ""They are some of the most vulnerable children of all, with very complex needs, growing up in institutions usually far away from their family home. ""For many of them this is a frightening and overwhelming experience. For many of their families it is a nightmare."" Ms Longfield said she had spoken to parents whose children had been ""locked away in a series of rooms for months"". ""Others have to listen as they are told by institutions that their child has had to be restrained or forcibly injected with sedatives,"" she said. ""They feel powerless and, frankly, at their wits' end as to what to do."" Ms Longfield is calling for a national strategy to ""address the values and culture of the wider system across the NHS, education and local government so that a failure to provide earlier help is unacceptable, and admission to hospital or a residential special school is no longer seen as almost inevitable for some children"". A spokesman for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said some of the most vulnerable children were being ""horribly failed"". He said: ""No child should be left to languish alone and it's important that the government takes urgent action to provide high quality, community-based care that can prevent the need for children to be placed in secure hospitals."" Improving child mental health 'years off' Children 'must be suicidal to get help' Tim Nicholls, head of policy at the National Autistic Society, said autistic children and adults were ""being failed by a broken system"". Wherever possible, autistic people should get the mental health support they need in their own community, he added. The government said it was determined to reduce the number of people with autism or learning disabilities who are in mental health hospitals. A spokeswoman said: ""The NHS is committed to reducing numbers of people with a learning disability and autistic people who are inpatients in mental health hospitals by 35% by the end of March 2020, and through the Long Term Plan we will reduce numbers even further by investing in specialist services and community crisis care and giving local areas greater control of their budgets to reduce avoidable admissions and enable shorter lengths of stay. ""The CQC [Care Quality Commission] is also undertaking an in-depth review into the use of seclusion, segregation and restraint  - which should only be used as a last resort - in order to improve standards across the system.""

Ryanair cautious on outlook as profits slide,"Michael O'Leary says profits could suffer for the next couple of years Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary has said he expects the airline to benefit from any price war in the industry. Mr O'Leary said ""artificially low prices"" and ""attritional fare wars"" could dent profits for a year or two. He was speaking after the airline reported that profits fell by nearly a third last year to â¬1bn (Â£880m) because fuel costs rose and fares fell. Profits at Europe's biggest discount airline might also be lower this year, as fares could fall by up to 2%. For last year, Ryanair's average one-way fare was â¬37, down 6%, although this was offset by spending on services such as hotels and car hire. For the current financial year, the carrier said it was ""cautious"" on pricing and had ""zero"" visibility for the second half of the year. It said that while bookings in the first half of this year were slightly ahead of last year, ""fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue through 2019"". Ryanair's teasing of BA bungle backfires Ryanair named 'worst short-haul airline' Mr O'Leary said: ""Frankly, if we are in a period where there's going to be attritional fare wars for a year or two that's good for Ryanair... as... we have the lowest cost base... profits will suffer for a year or two and I think that is what our shareholders should expect. ""However it is clear in my mind that within the next four to five years you are seeing the emergence of four or five large European airline groups,"" he said. He referred to Ryanair, Lufthansa, IAG (owner of British Airways), Air France-KLM and, probably, Easyjet. Mergers of other airlines would lead to ""some upward pressure on pricing,"" he said. ""[Fares] will begin to rise again because they are artificially low at the moment,"" Mr O'Leary said. Despite a 7% increase in passenger numbers, earlier this year Ryanair was named the UK's least-liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running in a survey by consumer body Which?. Neil Sorahan, Ryanair's chief financial officer, told the BBC that the airline did not spend too much time worrying about surveys and that the most important thing was being on time. ""Our customers enjoyed an average fare of â¬37 which was down 6% on last year. At the same time, however, they continue to spend money on our ancillary products [car hire etc] which helps offset that,"" he said. Mr Sorahan said there was too much capacity in the market, and pointed to a wave of airline failures - such as Primera, Flybmi and WOW - caused by higher oil prices and lower fares. Last week,EasyJet reported a loss of Â£275min the six months to the end of March, compared with a Â£68m loss a year earlier, while troubled travel operatorThomas Cook is attempting to sell its airlineto plug a gap in financing after reported a Â£1.5bn half-year loss. Fuel prices are also an important factor to airline profitability and Ryanair said its bill for this year is expected to rise by â¬460m. The airline said its forecasts will also depend on last-minute fares and any impact from Brexit, but it estimated that profits could range between â¬750m and â¬950m. Ryanair is delaying deliveries of five of the Boeing 737 Max planes, which have been grounded because of two fatal crashes, but said it had the ""utmost confidence"" in the aircraft. The delay to deliveries from the spring will lead it to cut capacity by one million passengers this year, but it ultimately expects the planes to drive down costs and, Ryanair said, lead to lower prices for passengers. The airline expect the 737 Max planes to return to the air in July or August in the US, and September or October in the EU. Ryanair also announced it was buying back â¬700m of its shares, which analysts at Liberum said would support the share price in the short-term despite the ""disappointing"" guidance on profits for this year. ""Ryanair remains the long-term winner in the European airline industry, based on its leading market position, extensive network, low unit costs and strong balance sheet,"" Liberum said. ""We see tougher market conditions in the short term as positive for the stronger airlines in the long term, since this clears out weaker competitors and aids consolidation in the market."" Shares in Ryanair fell 6% in early trading, before recovering to stand 1% lower. Ryanair's profit figure excludes the loss of â¬139m from the Austrian airline Lauda it took over last year.

Kate shows off garden to her children,"This video can not be played Princess Charlotte and her brothers explore the garden their mother designed The Duchess of Cambridge has unveiled her garden at the Chelsea Flower Show. She visited the woodland wilderness garden with schoolchildren a day after Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis also enjoyed it. The royal children spent an hour on Sunday playing in the Back to Nature Garden, which has a tree house, stream and swing. The site was co-created with landscape architects Andree Davies, Adam White and the Royal Horticultural Society. Charlotte was pictured on a swing, while a barefoot George paddled in a stream and Louis ran about with a stick. One-year-old Louis enjoys the plot the Duchess of Cambridge co-created for the Chelsea Flower Show Over the past months, George, Charlotte and Louis helped their mother collect leaves, moss and twigs, which were then incorporated into the garden. Kate offers 'peek' at Back to Nature Garden Harry and Meghan share unseen wedding snaps Princess Charlotte photos mark birthday The Duke of Cambridge was seen playing with his family in pictures released by Kensington Palace and taken by photographer Matt Porteous. Hazel sticks collected by the royals were used to make the garden's den Catherine has been closely involved in the project and been at the site ahead of the event, which opens to the public on Tuesday. The garden includes a tree house, waterfall, rustic den and a campfire as well as tree stumps, stepping stones and a hollow log for children to play on. The Duchess of Cambridge was joined by local schoolchildren at her garden It also features Princess Diana's favourite flowers, forget-me-nots, among the geraniums, blue periwinkle, astrantias, ferns, strawberry plants and rhubarb. Reclaimed timber from Southend Pier was used to create the decking. The duchess was keen to show her children the project she had been working on William and Louis enjoy the multi-sensory garden designed by Kate The duchess's woodland wilderness plot forms part of her work on early childhood development. The garden is intended to highlight the benefits the natural world brings to mental and physical well-being. One of the people she chatted with while touring the garden on Monday was fellow mother Alison Shockledge. Ms Shockledge said: ""She was talking about it from a mum's perspective: put your devices down, let's go out. Be relaxed with your children, let them get muddy."" Kate hopes to pass on her passion for the outdoors to her children The duchess also chatted to Colette Morris and Rebecca Beale. Ms Morris said: ""She said children played very differently. In a way she didn't anticipate."" Ms Beale added: ""Children are often sat still looking at screens. She said it was important to be multi-sensory."" The duchess told the BBC: ""I really feel that nature and being interactive outdoors has huge benefits on our physical and mental well-being, particularly for young children. ""I really hope this woodland that we have created inspires families, kids and communities to get outside, enjoy nature and the outdoors, and spend quality time together.""

"Teens in care 'abandoned to crime gangs'Thousands of teenagers in care are being ""dumped"" in unregulated homes across England, Newsnight learns.UK","Thousands of teenagers are living in supported or semi-supported accommodation, which can often be a house on a residential street Thousands of teenagers in care are being ""dumped"" in unregulated homes and ""abandoned to organised crime gangs"", the BBC has been told. The number of looked-after children aged 16 and over living in unregistered accommodation in England has increased 70% in a decade, Newsnight has found. Police forces have raised concerns, saying criminals see the premises as an easy target for recruitment. The government said children in care ""deserve good quality accommodation"". The Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS) said local authorities do ""many things"" - including unannounced checks and DBS checks - to monitor provision. As part of a special series of reports, Britain's Hidden Children's Homes, Newsnight has learned that - according to figures from the Department for Education - around 5,000 looked after children in England are living in so-called 16+ supported or semi-supported accommodation - up from 2,900 10 years ago. Children in care 'unnecessarily criminalised' Counting the kids in gangs Thousands of teens living alone 'in care' This type of accommodation is not inspected or registered by Ofsted, even though residents are in the care of the state. But because they are deemed to be receiving support, rather than care, the accommodation is not subject to the same checks and inspections as registered children's homes. Local authorities can pay to place children in unregistered accommodation if they deem it is in a child's best interests. This can often be simply a house on a residential street, with staff on site or visiting for as little as a few hours a week. Amy - now 19 - was moved to one of these homes in Bedfordshire, when she was 16 years old. ""There was a mattress but no bed sheets, it was freezing cold and I had to use my coat and blanket as a duvet. It made me feel sort of desperate and very alone."" Amy - not her real name - said there were times she was frightened living in the home. ""I was hit in the face by one of the staff members,"" she said. Jackie Sebire, assistant chief constable at Bedfordshire Police and the National Police Chiefs' Council lead on serious violence, said that more than half of the 60 homes for looked-after children in Bedfordshire are unregulated. ""They are the ones that we have the majority of the children going missing from because the care is so inconsistent,"" she said. Jackie Sebire, assistant chief constable at Bedfordshire Police, said care is 'inconsistent' Amy was among these missing children, taking the train to ""meet random men in London, as anywhere is better than this"". ""We'd just get random men off the internet and then sometimes they would come and pick us up at the home and they'd take us places.  A lot of them were just strange men who just wanted younger girls and they were very, very dangerous,"" she said. ""They wanted sex and they wanted drugs and because they would buy you alcohol they would think you owed them something."" Amy says she was not sexually assaulted. The home Amy lived in told Newsnight it investigates complaints thoroughly and operates with high standards. It said it would support the 16+ sector being regulated. A Bedford Borough Council spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the concerns raised which were fully investigated at the time. ""Semi-independent living accommodation for young people over 16 is not regulated by an inspection regime and this is an issue across the country. Many local authorities share our concerns and this has been discussed in parliament."" The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Missing Children and Adults has been looking into the issue, and wrote to 43 police forces in England and Wales. Thirty-four responded, with at least three-quarters expressing concern. Newsnight has been given exclusive access to this research, which the group's chairwoman, Ann Coffey, described as painting an overall picture ""of dumping children in a twilight world and leaving them to fend for themselves and take their chances"". Cambridgeshire Police said premises are often ""well known to local criminals"" and seen as ""an easy target location for recruitment of new children"". This was echoed by Hertfordshire Police. The force said it had seen examples where young adults had been targeted and ""girls have been groomed and trafficked to other areas"". Ms Coffey said ""we should be very concerned"" about this growing sector. ""It is absolutely essential that that market is regulated in a way that meets the needs of children,"" she said. ""If you don't have regulation then what will happen is it will meet the needs of the providers - the people who are basically making a profit out of this kind of accommodation."" ""I wouldn't place my 16 or 17-year-old in this accommodation,"" she added. ""Why should we be placing other 16 and 17-year-olds in this twilight world where, at a very vulnerable age where they need the greatest level of support, we are abandoning them to paedophiles and organised crime gangs?"" Andrew Neilson, from the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""Exposing children to greater risks of criminalisation and exploitation isn't just wrong: it makes a mockery of joined-up government."" The Department for Education ""should be reviewing the situation urgently"", he added. Jackie Sebire and the NPCC also want action from government. ""If you think about all the places we regulate the fact that we don't regulate those 16+ settings - it's just wrong and it really needs to change nowâ¦ because the care is so inconsistent,"" she said. ""Ofsted could have a duty to regulate if the legislation and their remit changed and that is one solution we have proposed.""

MPs to debate immunity for NI veterans,"A petition calling for soldiers who served in Northern Ireland to be immune from prosecution will be debated by MPs amid reports No 10 has vetoed calls for legislation to protect veterans. Several Tory MPs are expected to urge an end to what they say are ""abhorrent"" proceedings against elderly veterans. The petition says criminal probes into historical incidents should be outlawed ""after a certain period of time"". Ministers are consulting on how to deal with ""legacy"" cases fairly. Some victims' groups and politicians in Northern Ireland believe that no-one should be above the law. Six former soldiers are currently facing prosecution over Troubles-era killings, although not all the charges are murder. They include Soldier F, who is facing murder charges over the killing of two people - James Wray and William McKinney - on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. 'Unfair' military prosecutions to be barred MP withdraws support for PM over veterans Rally in support of Bloody Sunday soldier There has been increasing political controversy over the extent to which soldiers accused of crimes in the line of duty in Northern Ireland should be investigated. Veterans protested against historical prosecutions in several UK cities on Saturday Tory MP and ex-soldier Johnny Mercer, who served in Northern Ireland, has withdrawn his support from the government over the issue and called for legislation to limit the scope for further prosecutions. The petition being debated on Monday, launched by Karen Webb-James, urges the authorities not to ""prosecute the military for its work in Northern Ireland"". The document, which has obtained more than 146,000 signatures, calls for a statute of limitations on prosecutions although it does not specify at what point this should apply. Any petition with more than 100,000 signatories has to be considered for debate in Westminster Hall - the secondary debating chamber in the Commons. Mr Mercer told Sky News that due legal process had to be followed but the ""endless chase of people to their graves"" did not represent justice. He suggested unconfirmed reports in the Sunday Telegraph that the Theresa May had personally blocked legislation giving greater protection to veterans was ""devastating"". While he did not support a blanket amnesty or statute of limitations, he said a presumption against prosecution after 10 years, with a higher evidential threshold, was reasonable. Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt said service personnel should not be ""victims of unfounded allegations"" The government announced last week that soldiers and veterans will be given stronger legal protections against prosecution for alleged offences committed in action abroad. This would not apply to alleged offences in Northern Ireland although Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt said she wanted to end the ""chilling effect"" of repeated prosecutions. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood said legacy cases had not been handled in the best way but the government had to act within the law. ""You can't give an amnesty just to armed forces personnel, you'd have to share that with terrorists as well,"" he told Sky News. ""[Mrs May] was unwilling to do that. That's international law. That's what we have to abide by."" The Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland said that of 26 so-called legacy cases it has taken decisions on since 2011, 13 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five are connected to the Army. Internment, protest and Blood Sunday,external Injustice fear over Army prosecutions rule Ex-soldier to be charged with 1972 murder Sinn FÃ©in has insisted said there could be ""no immunity or impunity"" for British forces ""guilty of crime, collusion and murder in Ireland"". In its formal response to the petition last month, the Northern Ireland Office said no-one could be immune from prosecution, however long ago the alleged offences took place. ""Where there is evidence of wrongdoing it is right that this should be investigated and, where the evidence exists, for prosecutions to follow,"" it said. In response to the Sunday Telegraph story, it said the outcome of the consultation into the current system would be announced as soon as possible.

China threatens US over Huawei sanctions,"Huawei denies that its products post a security threat to foreign nations China has threatened to retaliate against US sanctions seen as an attempt to restrict international trade by the Chinese technology giant Huawei. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Beijing opposed countries imposing unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and would take action. The Trump administration on Wednesday effectively blocked Huawei products from being used in US networks. The order does not name any company, but is believed to target Huawei. Huawei denies its products pose a security threat and says it is ready to engage with the US. Huawei role in UK 'an unnecessary risk' The story of a controversial company Beijing accused President Trump of engaging in industrial sabotage by using state security as ""as a pretext for suppressing foreign business"". ""We urge the US to stop this practice and instead create better conditions for business co-operation,"" Mr Lu said. He did not give any details over how China planned to retaliate. The confrontation over Huawei comes amid a broader trade war between the US and China, with both sides imposing aggressive tariffs on imports. Writing in the Evening Standard on Wednesday, Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, said China did not want a trade war but was ""not afraid of one and would fight one if necessary"". ""China is always open for talks but it would fight to the end should a 'trade war' break out,"" he wrote. According to a White House statement, Mr Trump's order aims to ""protect America from foreign adversaries who are actively and increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology infrastructure and services"". It gives the secretary of commerce the power to ""prohibit transactions posing an unacceptable risk to the national security"", the statement adds. Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment The move was instantly welcomed by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who called it ""a significant step toward securing America's networks"". The US had already restricted federal agencies from using Huawei products and has encouraged allies to shun them, while Australia and New Zealand have both blocked the use of Huawei gear in 5G networks. The US cannot crush us, says Huawei boss In April 2018 another Chinese tech company, ZTE, was barred from buying US parts after it was placed on the same ""entity list"".It resumed business after reaching a deal with the US in July. Huawei has said its work does not pose any threats and that it is independent from the Chinese government. ""Restricting Huawei from doing business in the US will not make the US more secure or stronger,"" the company said in a statement. ""Instead, this will only serve to limit the US to inferior yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the US lagging behind in 5G deployment, and eventually harming the interests of US companies and consumers."" The company also said ""unreasonable restrictions"" on Huawei raised ""other serious legal issues"". During a meeting in London on Tuesday, Huaweisaid it was ""willing to sign no-spy agreements with governments""as concerns over the security of its products used in mobile networks continued to grow. Tara McKelvey, White House reporter Trump's executive order is designed to protect national security, and there is no doubt that Chinese technology can seem formidable. The Chinese use aggressive surveillance tools in their country and Trump has reason to be concerned. Some analysts say the president's order has gone too far, though. They point out that one significant breach - the Chinese recruitment of a former CIA officer, Kevin Mallory - was done through low-tech means: LinkedIn, a social media site. Mallory was convicted of spying, and he faces up to life in prison (he will be sentenced on Friday). These analysts say the threat from China is real, but that global telecommunications are nearly impossible to control and the best defence against espionage is not an executive order but old-fashioned vigilance among those who use computers and other technology. UK Prime Minister Theresa May last month provisionally approved Huawei technology for use in the nation's future 5G telecoms networks, but a leaked account of the meeting said five cabinet ministers raised concerns about the move. France, Germany and Belgium have not banned Huawei technology, but Japan has from public contracts. The US has pressured allies to shun Huawei in their next generation 5G mobile networks. The US has raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese imports and is threatening to tax an additional $300 billion worth. Stock markets have been hit by the row but have steadied in recent days amidhopes the two countries might hold talks. Do you have a question about Donald Trump's national emergency or Huawei?
