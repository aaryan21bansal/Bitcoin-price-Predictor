US denies North Korean nuclear talks failed,"North Korean delegates had arrived from the embassy in Stockholm The US has denied that its day of nuclear talks with North Korea ended in failure, insisting that ""good discussions"" were had. Earlier, North Korea said the meeting had broken down, because the US brought ""nothing to the negotiation table"". Officials from the two countries met in Sweden on Saturday, in the hope of breaking their stalemate. This came just days after North Korea tested a new missile, in a significant advance on earlier tests. The meeting was the first formal working-level discussion since US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met briefly at the inter-Korean border zone in June. Neither of the leaders was present in Sweden. Instead, initial discussions were being handled by North Korea's Kim Myong Gil and US Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun. They met on an island north-east of Stockholm called Lidingo, where North Korea has its embassy. On Saturday evening, North Korea's top nuclear envoy Kim Myong Gil spoke to reporters outside the embassy, saying ""the negotiations have not fulfilled our expectation and finally broke off"". North Korea's missile tests have alarmed people in the South ""The US raised expectations by offering suggestions like a flexible approach, new method and creative solutions, but they have disappointed us greatly,"" he added. He said ""the US would not give up their old viewpoint and attitude"". North Korea crisis in 300 words However, shortly afterwards, the US state department released a contradictory statement from spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus. ""The early comments from the DPRK [North Korean] delegation do not reflect the content or the spirit of today's 8.5-hour discussion,"" it read. ""The US brought creative ideas and had good discussions with its DPRK counterparts."" Washington has also accepted Sweden's invitation to host more talks in two weeks' time, Ms Ortagus said. Many observers saw the fresh talks as an opening move to another Trump-Kim summit. The two have held two summits so far. The first one in Singapore in 2018 resulted in a vague denuclearisation agreement which led to few concrete results. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on The second summit in Vietnam in February 2019 ended early without any agreement. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Just this Thursday, North Korea confirmed it had test-fired a new type of a ballistic missile, a significant escalation from the short-range tests it has conducted since May. A picture released by North Korea's news agency said to be of the missile The missile - able to carry a nuclear weapon - was the North's 11th test this year. Fired from a platform at sea, it appears to be capable of being launched from a submarine, which means North Korea could potentially launch missiles far outside its territory. Analysts said North Korean might have been seeking to build up pressure ahead of the talks.

"Brexit deal still possible, says Varadkar","Leo Varadkar was speaking at a Fine Gael event in Dublin on Saturday Leo Varadkar has said he believes a Brexit deal is still possible, but that the PM's current proposals do not ""form the basis for deeper negotiations"". The taoiseach (Irish PM) said a deal must be agreed ahead of the European Council summit in two weeks. Speaking on Saturday, he also said he hoped to meet Boris Johnson next week. Mr Johnson'sproposalswould see NI stay in the European single market for goods, subject to approval every four years by the Northern Ireland Assembly. Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union along with the rest of the UK - resulting in new customs checks. Julian Smith defends government's Brexit plan 'It will be no-deal if Brexit plan is final offer' What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Mr Varadkar told the Irish national broadcaster RTÃ News there was still time for the UK government to put forward further proposals. ""I think a deal is still possible,"" he said. ""It is possible at the European Council summit in two weeks' time but the current position as of today is the European Union, including Ireland, doesn't feel that the proposals put forward by Prime Minister Johnson yet form the basis for deeper negotiations."" The taoiseach said that Friday would be a reasonable deadline for new proposals, but that it was not his job to set one and he did not want to set a false deadline. Prime Minister Johnson has said there will be no delay to Brexit beyond the 31 October deadline On Friday his deputy Simon Coveneydescribed Mr Johnson's latest Brexit proposals as a ""step forward""but insisted that further change is needed to avoid customs checks. Talks will resume on Mondayafter the EU said the UK's proposed alternative to the Irish backstop could not be the ""basis"" for a legally-binding treaty. The UK has said it would work on the details before then but there was ""no path"" to a deal without alternative arrangements in Northern Ireland. The PM's Brexit plan set out details of a replacement for the Irish border ""backstop"" in the current Brexit agreement. The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone"" This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes.

Council leader suspended over 'serious allegation',"Jas Athwal says he has provided evidence the ""allegations were untrue"" The leader of Redbridge Council has been suspended from the Labour Party over ""extremely serious allegations"". Jas Athwal is running to become Labour's parliamentary candidate in Ilford South, and a decision was due on Saturday. Applications have since reopened. The move sparked accusations of a ""stitch-up"" to allow a Jeremy Corbyn supporter to become the candidate. Mr Athwal said he had provided evidence that the ""allegations were untrue"". Hetweeted,external: ""This is not a fair process. It is contrary to natural justice. All I seek is a fair hearing and due process."" A Labour spokesperson said: ""The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously, which are investigated and any appropriate disciplinary action taken in line with the party's rules and procedures. ""We can't comment on individual cases."" A local Labour Party member told the BBC: ""I wish this was a case of the Labour Party doing its due process and taking care of a member, but it's not. It's a naked attempt at a political stitch-up."" No allegations have been referred to Redbridge Council, and Jas Athwal remains its leader Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for neighbouring Ilford North,tweeted,externalto say the ""suspension of the local frontrunner just 15 hours before the vote is politically motivated and biased in order to stitch up the selection"". Campaign group Sikhs for Laboursaid,externalthe move put into question whether Labour ""still has a place for Sikhs"". The BAME Parliamentary Labour Party group, made up of senior ethnic minority MPs, released a statement saying it was ""very concerned"" about the suspension. A Labour Party source said: ""This decision was taken by a panel following a report from an independent investigator from a specialist organisation. ""The case was anonymised so the panel did not know who the individual was,"" the source added. ""The timing has nothing to do with the selection process."" Mr Athwal's case has been referred to the National Constitutional Committee and he has been suspended pending that process. He is up against Sam Tarry, an ally of Labour leader Mr Corbyn, for the chance to stand for Labour in Ilford South at the next general election. Current MP Mike Gapesquit the partyover its handling of anti-Semitism. Mr Tarry, a Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) official,tweeted:,external""I am gutted that the selection process in Ilford South has been suspended today, but it's absolutely the right thing to do. ""I am proud to have run a positive, people-powered campaign with hundreds of local supporters. I look forward to winning the vote when it comes back.""

Six elephants die trying to save each other,"Thai authorities believe the herd fell after trying to help a baby elephant Six elephants have fallen to their deaths in Thailand while trying to save each other from a notorious waterfall. Officials said the incident occurred after a baby elephant slipped over the waterfall in central Thailand's Khao Yai National Park. Two other elephants were also found struggling on a cliff edge nearby, and have been moved by Thai authorities. The waterfall, known as Haew Narok (Hell's Fall), has a history of similar incidents. A herd of eight elephants died after falling in 1992, in a case that brought national attention. Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) said officials were called to the scene on Saturday at 03:00 local time (20:00 GMT on Friday) when a group of elephants was blocking a road by the waterfall. Thai authorities shared an image of one survivor attempting to revive its companion Three hours later, the body of a three-year-old elephant was spotted near the base of Haew Narok, and five others were discovered nearby. Khanchit Srinoppawan, chief of the national park, told the BBC that the two remaining elephants were being monitored. World Elephant Day: Nine reasons why we love elephants Poacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lions Edwin Wiek, the founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, said the pair may have difficulty surviving as elephants rely on their large herds for protection and finding food. The incident could also take an emotional toll. Elephants have been known to display signs of grief. Thai authorities moved the herd's two surviving elephants with the help of ropes ""It's like losing half your family,"" Mr Wiek told the BBC. ""There's nothing you can do, it's nature unfortunately,"" he said. Around 7,000 Asian elephants remain in Thailand, with more than half living in captivity.

Parents of brain-damaged girl call for law review,"Specialists at the Royal London Hospital believe Tafida Raqeeb has no chance of recovery The mother of a brain-damaged girl says the law should be amended, after the High Court ruled her daughter could travel abroad to receive treatment. Five-year-old Tafida Raqeeb has been on life support at the Royal London Hospital since suffering a traumatic brain injury in February. Health bosses had tried to block attempts to take her to the Gaslini children's hospital in Genoa, Italy. Tafida's mother Shalina Begum said: ""The law now needs to be revisited"". The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which rules a ""child's best interests are paramount"" in all healthcare decisions, was ratified in 2000. Mrs Begum said the ""country has evolved"" since the law came into effect. Speaking on the BBC Today programme, she called for a ""clear law that says if there is a reputable hospital prepared to treat a child then there should be no blocking"". Shelina Begum and husband Mohammed Raqeeb said doctors in Italy would continue to treat their daughter unless she was diagnosed as brain dead UK specialists had argued any further treatment of Tafida, who suffered a brain haemorrhage, would be futile. Do hospitals or parents of sick children get to decide? Girl 'will suffer if life support continues' Brain-damaged girl's mum 'doesn't trust UK medics' Bosses at Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Whitechapel, have argued that ending Tafida's life-support is in her best interests. Tafida's parents, both practising Muslims, argued Islamic law said only God could take the decision to end her life. Tafida suffered a traumatic brain injury in February The High Court ruled on Thursdaythere was no justification to stop the child being taken abroad. Mrs Begum said there had been a ""complete meltdown"" in the relationship with doctors at the hospital since the ruling. ""We don't talk, we don't speak. They just walk past,"" she said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Decisions around withdrawing treatment are never easy, and it is important that families and medical experts reach agreement in the best interests of the child. ""Where this is not possible, as in this sad case, it is right the Courts are asked to make a decision.""

Crash victim's mum appeals for US suspect's return,"Harry Dunn pictured with his mother Charlotte Charles The mother of a teenager killed in a car crash involving the wife of a US diplomat has urged her ""as a mum"" to return to the UK for questioning. Harry Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike collided with a car near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August. The diplomat's wife, who has diplomatic immunity, left the UK despite telling police that she had no plans to. Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, told the BBC the family had been left ""utterly devastated"" by his death. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he has urged the US embassy to reconsider after the State Department said that diplomatic immunity is ""rarely waived"". ""I have called the US ambassador to express the UK's disappointment with their decision,"" he said. The teenager died in hospital after his motorbike crashed with a Volvo Mrs Charles told the BBC's PM programme: ""We're really hoping to try to get her back; from me, as a mum, to her, as a mum, you just hope that he [Mr Raab] can try to get through to her. ""We don't wish her any ill harm, but we don't understand how she can just get on a plane and leave our family just utterly devastated. ""If we don't get any luck over here, then we will go over there."" Should diplomats still have immunity? Underthe 1961 Vienna Convention,external, diplomats and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, so long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them - in this case, the US. Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale There are more than 22,500 people in the UK who hold diplomatic immunity and most do not break the law. But if a diplomat is guilty of an egregious breach, there are some things that a host country can do. In a written Parliamentary answer in October 2017, then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""The FCO does not tolerate foreign diplomats breaking the law. ""When instances of alleged criminal conduct are brought to our attention by the police, we ask the relevant foreign government to waive diplomatic immunity where appropriate. ""For the most serious offences, and when a relevant waiver has not been granted, we seek the immediate withdrawal of the diplomat."" The problem here is that the US do not appear to have granted a waiver for this particular diplomatic spouse. Instead, they have removed her from the UK before the British government could threaten to remove her itself if she did not submit to questioning. As such, the US appears to have calculated that protecting the woman from identification, questioning and possible prosecution was more important than the potential risk to UK-US relations. This is further evidence the adjective ""special"" should rarely be used to describe the alliance between both countries. Supt Sarah Johnson said that the suspect ""engaged fully"" following the incident near RAF Croughton, a US Air Force communications station, and that she ""had previously confirmed... that she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"". ""The force is now exploring all opportunities through diplomatic channels to ensure that the investigation continues to progress,"" she said. The crash happened on the B4031 near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire The US Embassy in London confirmed the diplomat's family had left the UK, but it could not confirm the identity of the people involved in the incident ""due to security and privacy considerations"". The US State Department said it was in ""close consultation"" with British officials, but could not comment on ""private diplomatic conversation"" with the British government. ""We express our deepest sympathies and offer condolences to the family of the deceased in the tragic August 27 traffic accident involving a vehicle driven by the spouse of a U.S. diplomat assigned to the United Kingdom,"" a spokesperson said. ""Any questions regarding a waiver of immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry; immunity is rarely waived.""

How damaging are Ukraine texts?,"This video can not be played Trump calls for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens Kurt Volker brought receipts, as the saying goes - and it could spell real trouble for President Donald Trump. During the former US special envoy to Ukraine's private testimony to congressional committees on Thursday, he turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. They documented the Trump administration's efforts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate a Ukrainian company with ties to Joe Biden's son and conspiracy theories around Russian hacking during the 2016 US presidential election. On Thursday night, Democrats in the US House of Representatives - which is conducting an impeachment investigation of Donald Trump - made public a selection of these messages. While some Republicans are saying the release does not paint a complete picture of the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts and the motivations behind them, the messages themselves offer dramatic evidence of what Democrats view as an abuse of presidential authority. Donald Trump and his defenders have insisted there was no quid-pro-quo in his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The text messages, however, tell a different story. It was very clear to members of the administration's Ukrainian diplomatic team what Mr Trump wanted - a publicly announced Ukrainian investigation of political rival Joe Biden and the 2016 election hacking, which the intelligence community has concluded was carried out by Russia (although Mr Trump still has his doubts). Kurt Volker, Mr Trump's Ukraine envoy who resigned a week ago Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, and a significant donor to Mr Trump Bill Taylor, a top US diplomat at the US embassy in Ukraine Messages appear to show the US diplomats coordinating Ukraine's investigation announcement, saying that a draft of Mr Zelensky's statement should include references to 2016 and Burisma, the company that Mr Biden's son worked for. It also was very clear what they had to offer the Ukrainians: not only US military aid, which had been put on hold by the White House, but also a meeting between the two presidents in Washington that would have been extremely valuable in bolstering the legitimacy of the newly elected Ukrainian leader. Drawing a straight line between the offer and the ask doesn't take much imagination - and at least one American diplomat, acting US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, had serious concerns about the propriety of it all. He worried that delaying congressionally authorised US military aid to Ukraine, as the Trump administration had done in July, would be a boon to Russia - and would put Ukraine in a precarious spot. He wondered whether the aid, and a potential Zelensky visit to Washington, were being explicitly conditioned on Ukrainian ""investigations"". The Trump impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? ""I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,"" Mr Taylor texted Gordon Sondland, the deep-pocketed Republican donor who Mr Trump nominated to be US ambassador to the European Union. After five hours, Mr Sondland - whose previous messages to Mr Taylor were conversational - replied with a denial of any ""quid pro quo"" that sounded like a statement crafted by lawyers, followed by a request that they stop texting about it. Other text messages - between Mr Taylor, Mr Sondland and Mr Volker are even more direct. The team seemed intent on getting the Ukrainians to release a statement announcing a new corruption investigation into Burisma and possible Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 hacking - a move that, even if it amounted to nothing, could have provided political ammunition for Republicans to undermine Mr Biden's presidential campaign. ""Heard from the White House - assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,"" Mr Volker wrote, in which seems the clearest acknowledgement of a quid pro quo. It may not be long before the White House falls back to its final line of defence - that threatening and cajoling Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden and the 2016 hacking was a reasonable exercise of a president intent on cracking down on corruption involving a then high-ranking American official. ""We are looking at corruption, we are not looking at politics,"" Mr Trump said on Friday morning. ""I don't care if it's Biden or anybody else."" He may say he doesn't care if it involves Biden (and he dodged a question about whether he's ever asked foreign leaders for an investigation of someone who is not a political rival), but this strategy will necessitate all-out attacks on Mr Biden, his son Hunter and their reputation - despite no current evidence that the then-vice-president acted inappropriately in his interactions with Ukrainian officials. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims In the past two days, Mr Trump has said the Bidens are ""crooked"", that they are ""pillaging the country"" and that the former vice-president arranged ""sweetheart deals"" with foreign governments in order to help his son. Complicating matters for the White House, however, was Mr Trump's decision on Thursday to suggest both Ukraine and China open investigations into the Bidens - essentially saying publicly what Democrats were accusing him of doing in his private phone call with Mr Zelensky. That he made the suggestion to China less than a minute after discussing the two nations' ongoing trade negotiations and saying that the US has ""tremendous power"" will leave Democrats howling - particularly aftera report later in the day,externalthat Mr Trump brought up Mr Biden in a 18 June call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Not to be outdone, Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who has essentially served as the president's private detective investigating the Bidens,told the Wall Street Journal,externalthat Mr Trump ordered the dismissal of the previous US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, because she was insufficiently supportive of the Biden investigation. This video can not be played Mr Giuliani is alleged to have sought to dig up dirt on Democrat candidate Joe Biden All in all, the recent spate of revelations paints a picture of a White House wielding the tools of foreign policy to advance goals that could be seen as overtly political. Many Democrats have already said this is an abuse of power necessitating presidential impeachment and removal from office. A handful of Republicans have also been critical. In a series of tweets on Friday, Mitt Romney - the 2012 Republican presidential nominee -offered a stinging rebuke,externalof the president. ""When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,"" he wrote. ""By all appearances, the president's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling."" Trump urges China to investigate Bidens The reality, however, is that for all the blows Mr Trump has received and may yet endure, none of them may prove fatal. He's faced seemingly mortal crises before, only to plough through and emerge intact on the other side. Impeachment, even if it now seems like a foregone conclusion, isn't the end of the Trump presidency. That would take two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate voting for removal. As Axios's Mike Allen points out, the chamber has more than enough Republican senators from states where the president remains popular - 36 - to form a ""red firewall"" to block removal. Unless Mr Trump's approval craters, any of these senators voting to convict the president would be tantamount to political suicide. The president knows how to endure the ""political storm"", as he called it earlier this week. ""I'm used to it,"" he said. ""For me, it's like putting on a suit in the morning."" With what's coming in the days ahead, he's going to need that to be a suit of armour. Follow Anthony on Twitter,external Five things to know about Canada's election Is Justin Trudeau in trouble?

US diplomat's wife leaves UK amid crash probe,"Harry Dunn pictured with his mother Charlotte Charles The mother of a teenager killed in a car crash involving the wife of a US diplomat has urged her ""as a mum"" to return to the UK for questioning.

Guide dogs could face sea trip to enter Republic,"Assistance dog users in Northern Ireland could face a trip across the Irish Sea to bring their animals into the Republic of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Stormont's Department for Agriculture, Environment, and Rural Affairs(DAERA) has said pets would have to enter the Republic through approved entry points.,external The ports at Cork and Rosslare are the only approved sea points of entry. Dublin Airport is also an approved point of entry. How would a no-deal Brexit affect life in NI? 'Impossible' no-deal cross-border trade warning DAERA's guidlines for post-Brexit pet travel,external It means a journey from Londonderry to Donegal - normally a short drive - could involve taking a sea crossing to England or Scotland, driving to Wales, going through the official point of entry in County Wexford and then driving north to Donegal. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 31 October, the UK will become what the EU considers an ""unlisted third country"" under the EU Pet Travel Scheme. The EU does not consider all non-members to be unlisted but non-EU countries must apply to be listed, judged on veterinary and administrative systems and number of rabies incidences. ""As an unlisted third country, there would be a requirement for pet animals including assistance dogs to enter the EU through a travellers' point of entry,"" said DAERA. Laurence McDermott, a guide dog user who lives in Derry, told BBC News NI it would be terrible if there was a situation where his travel was restricted. The 62-year-old is a volunteer with Irish Guide Dogs and regularly travels to Cork and Dublin as part of his duties. He received his guide dog, a black Labrador retriever called Scamp, during a period living across the border in County Donegal where he is originally from, and so was given the dog by Irish Guide Dogs. ""What this Brexit will do I don't really know - nobody seems to know,"" he said. Laurence McDermott expects to be able to continue to travel with his guide dog Scamp Mr McDermott said he would not be deterred from travelling into the Republic by any potential changes. ""I will keep on doing the same thing, hoping it doesn't change. ""We'll probably get a pass of some kind for the guide dog if it does."" Patrick Burke, the chairman of Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, said: ""We are closely reviewing the situation and will be advising our clients once the final outlook becomes clearer."" Alliance Party MLA Kellie Armstrong said she had written to the Northern Ireland Office asking for a meeting to discuss the issue. ""If you do have anyone with an assistance dog who needs to go cross border for hospital treatment or work and they are going as part of their work this is a big deal,"" she said. Guide Dogs Northern Ireland said the issue was ""extremely fluid and complex"" and while it was aware of potential difficulties it is waiting to be ""in a better position to have a more informed conversation"". It said it was important that guide dog owners are aware of government advice for people travelling with pet and assistance dogs. ""In the event of a no-deal Brexit, guide dog owners may be required to plan their travel up to four months in advance,"" it added. Guide dogs entering EU countries are subject to the same checks as pets At present, pets can travel unimpeded between the UK and other EU countries due to the pet passport scheme, which shows an up-to-date rabies shot. DAERA said there would be ""additional certification and health requirements"" for animals travelling to the EU after a no-deal withdrawal. It would mean more rigorous testing before travelling,which could take up to four months. The rules would apply to dogs, including assistance dogs, cats and ferrets travelling into the EU. Under the rules, pets are required to have: A microchip A rabies vaccination A blood test, with the blood sample at least 30 days after the rabies vaccination A three-month wait after the date of a successful blood test before travel An official third country veterinary certificate And only for dogs, a tapeworm treatment 'Impossible' no-deal cross-border trade warning How would a no-deal Brexit affect life in NI?

Transport paralysed as Hong Kong clamps down,"This video can not be played Protests resumed on Saturday after Friday's rioting Most of Hong Kong's metro system remains shut after a day which saw stations and businesses attacked in violent anti-government protests. Only the Airport Express remained open as protesters began fresh demonstrations in the autonomous Chinese territory. Chief executive Carrie Lam has defended her decision to invoke emergency powers in order to restore order. Hong Kong had been through a ""very dark night"" of ""extreme violence"", she said. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on the Hong Kong protests In pictures: The face masks Hong Kong wants to ban Unrest intensified on Friday after a young demonstrator was shot in the leg by a police officer. Protesters have also called on people to defy a ban on face masks announced by Ms Lam. Ms Lam's message was broadcast on local media Unrest in the former British colony started in June, sparked by proposals to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China. The extradition bill was subsequently cancelled but protests have widened into pro-democracy and anti-police demonstrations. MTR (Mass Transit Railway), the rail operator, said it wasunable to resume normal services,externalas repairs were still being made at damaged stations. A limited bus service would be provided. Supermarkets and banks were also closed, reeling from Friday's chaos when rioters targeted MTR stations and, reportedly, businesses with links to mainland China. ""The radical behaviour of rioters took Hong Kong through a very dark night, leaving society today half-paralysed,"" Ms Lam said in a pre-recorded video statement. ""The extreme violence clearly illustrated that Hong Kong's public safety is widely endangered. That's the concrete reason that we had to invoke emergency law yesterday to introduce the anti-mask law."" This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters burn a banner after Hong Kong's face mask ban ""We cannot allow rioters any more to destroy our treasured Hong Kong,"" she added. Hundreds of protesters, many of them wearing masks, marched through the Causeway Bay shopping district on Saturday. ""We're not sure what is going to happen later but we felt we had to get out and show our basic right to wear a mask,"" Sue, 22, told Reuters news agency from behind her black mask and dark glasses. Glass was shattered at some stations ""The government needs to learn it can't squeeze Hong Kong people like this."" A French resident, who gave his first name Marko, told AFP news agency the face mask ban was ""adding oil to the fire"". ""But I think the people who destroyed the stations are extremists,"" he said. By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Hong Kong The more radical Hong Kong protesters have been wearing masks in part to protect themselves from tear gas - but also to maintain their anonymity. For both reasons the Hong Kong government wants the wearing of masks stopped. From midnight (16:00 GMT) Friday anyone caught on the streets wearing a mask will be ordered to remove it. Mask-wearing demonstrators can be arrested and could face up to a year in jail. Carrie Lam is under intense pressure from the territory's powerful business lobby to end the protests. The violence on the streets reached a new level this week but invoking the emergency law for the first time in more than 50 years could also escalate the conflict. The radical student groups leading the protests said they would defy the law. Over the months, clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent. Causeway Bay MTR train station was damaged by fire On Tuesday, police shot a protester with a live bullet for the first time, wounding the 18-year-old, who was allegedly attacking a police officer. On Friday, a boy aged 14 was shot in the leg with a live round in Yuen Long, a town to the west of the city. A plain-clothes police officer with an unmarked police car was laterset upon by rioters,externalin the same area but officials did not link the two incidents, the South China Morning Post reports. Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that guarantees it some autonomy, and its people certain freedoms, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP who led thelegal fight against Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament, is among those who addressed the rally. Earlier Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalto say she would be at the march ""in spirit"" but not in person. ""Be in no doubt - independence is coming"", she added.

Six Thai elephants die trying to save each other,"Thai authorities believe the herd fell after trying to help a baby elephant Six elephants have fallen to their deaths in Thailand while trying to save each other from a notorious waterfall. Officials said the incident occurred after a baby elephant slipped over the waterfall in central Thailand's Khao Yai National Park. Two other elephants were also found struggling on a cliff edge nearby, and have been moved by Thai authorities. The waterfall, known as Haew Narok (Hell's Fall), has a history of similar incidents. A herd of eight elephants died after falling in 1992, in a case that brought national attention. Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) said officials were called to the scene on Saturday at 03:00 local time (20:00 GMT on Friday) when a group of elephants was blocking a road by the waterfall. Thai authorities shared an image of one survivor attempting to revive its companion Three hours later, the body of a three-year-old elephant was spotted near the base of Haew Narok, and five others were discovered nearby. Khanchit Srinoppawan, chief of the national park, told the BBC that the two remaining elephants were being monitored. World Elephant Day: Nine reasons why we love elephants Poacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lions Edwin Wiek, the founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, said the pair may have difficulty surviving as elephants rely on their large herds for protection and finding food. The incident could also take an emotional toll. Elephants have been known to display signs of grief. Thai authorities moved the herd's two surviving elephants with the help of ropes ""It's like losing half your family,"" Mr Wiek told the BBC. ""There's nothing you can do, it's nature unfortunately,"" he said. Around 7,000 Asian elephants remain in Thailand, with more than half living in captivity.

PayPal pulls out of Facebook cryptocurrency plans,"PayPal was one of the first companies to join Facebook's planned cryptocurrency network Payments firm PayPal has become the first company to pull out of an alliance that is trying to launch Facebook's digital currency Libra. PayPal made the announcement in a statement on Friday, but did not specify what had prompted the decision. Libra, and its digital wallet Calibra, were revealed by Facebook in June. But the cryptocurrency has been criticised by regulators, and both France and Germany have pledged to block it from Europe. PayPal said it ""[remained] supportive of Libra's aspirations"" but had chosen to focus on its own core businesses. The firm was one of the original members of the Libra Association, a group of 28 companies and non-profits helping to develop Libra. Its other members include payments company Visa, ride-hailing app Uber and humanitarian charity Mercy Corps. Why Facebook wants to be money's future Could Facebookâs new currency be stopped in its tracks?

Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has been criticised for the firm's record on data protection At its unveiling this year, Facebook said people would be able to make payments with the currency via its own apps, as well as on messaging service WhatsApp. Partner firms would also be able to accept Libra for transactions.

Paddington crash survivor fears safety 'slipping'Thirty-one people died when two trains collided after a driver missed a red signal on 5 October 1999.,"More than 500 people were injured when two trains collided head-on after a train driver missed a red signal on 5 October 1999 A Paddington rail disaster survivor has said he fears safety standards may be slipping 20 years after the crash. Thirty-one people died when two trains collided almost head-on after a driver missed a red signal on 5 October 1999. In 2018-19, 304 trains passed through red signals, a 10-year high, accordingto official data for England, Wales and Scotland.,external ""The risk now is that standards might drop,"" said Jonathan Duckworth, chair of the Paddington Survivors Group. He was one of 227 people hospitalised when his First Great Western train collided with another train at Ladbroke Grove, about two miles from its destination of Paddington, at a combined speed of about 130mph. In the 10 years following 1999 the number of Signals Passed at Danger (Spads) more than halved, from 593 to 273. But the number has begun to creep up again and July saw 41 Spads, more than one a day, the highest number in a single calendar month for 12 years. The UK has ""one of the safest railway networks in Europe"", rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said. He added: ""We are continually learning how to make our railways safer, that is the legacy of a terrible disaster such as this. ""But disasters could happen any time. That is why one of my many jobs is to ensure we have safety hardwired into every decision that they make."" Emergency services freed 20 trapped survivors and took eight days to clear the scene of the crash. A 70-metre wall of fire engulfed the two trains as fuel caught alight following the collision at about 08:10 BST on a Tuesday morning 20 years ago. ""We went through a massive fireball. I could feel the heat coming through the windows,"" Mr Duckworth said. ""I had no idea what was going on. I thought perhaps it was a bomb. ""We basically derailed and overturned, so our coach ended up on its side. ""There was a bit of a battle to get out. It's not easy to get out of an overturned carriage."" When he got out Mr Duckworth saw ""smoke billowing out from charred carriages"" lying on their sides as police and rescuers swarmed over the wreckage to try to locate trapped survivors. It would take days to remove all the bodies from the wreckage. This video can not be played Jonathan Duckworth said the crash gave him PTSD and ruined his career The outcry that followed led to the biggest-ever safety reform of the country's rail network. A series of complex public inquires culminated in two reports by Lord Cullen. The inquiry found the crash was caused by the Thames Trains service travelling from Paddington passing through a red signal. But Lord Cullen concluded the crash was the culmination of ""a catalogue of failures to act"". He levelled severe criticism at Thames Trains for its ""slack and less than adequate"" safety culture. It was fined Â£2m in 2004. Railtrack, Network Rail's predecessor, was accused of a ""lamentable failure"" to introduce safe signalling systems in the entrance to Paddington station. Lord Cullen levelled severe criticism at the rail industry for ""a catalogue of failures to act"" on known rail safety problems Paddington was supposed to be a watershed but a series of fatal rail crashes followed at Hatfield in 2000, at Selby in 2001 and at Potters Bar in 2002. The Paddington Survivors Group, set up to help victims and bereaved families cope with trauma, campaigned to improve rail safety. Under pressure from the group, a train protection warning system that halted trains passing through red signals became industry standard. The group worked with the Office for Rail and Road and Network Rail to reorganise the industry in the wake of the crash. Network Rail, which superseded Railtrack in 2002, was fined Â£4m in 2007 for health and safety breaches in the run-up to the Paddington crash, after years of campaigning by the survivors group. In addition to July seeing the highest number of Spads for more than a decade, the past 12 months has seen 10 trains pass red signals and reach the ""conflict point"" - the position along the track at which a collision could theoretically take place. The average over the past five years has been between four and five. Carriages overturned as the two trains crashed A memorial garden has been created, partially overlooking the site of the rail crash Concern over the increase led the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) to write to Network Rail and all train and freight operating companies. Mark Phillips, RSSB chief executive, said the 20th anniversary of the disaster was ""a timely reminder of what can go wrong if we don't keep our eyes on the ball"". ""We need to look at current train protection technology and industry initiatives, and ask whether enough is being done,"" he added. Mr Duckworth said: ""The risk is now that there hasn't been a serious rail crash for 20 years, standards might drop and focus might change. ""The industry needs to keep recognising that safety is of great importance, because though these incidents don't happen anymore, when they do occur they are devastating.""

Parents of brain-damaged girl call for law reviewThe NHS has said it will not appeal against a High Court decision to allow Tafida Raqeeb to travel abroad.London,"Specialists at the Royal London Hospital believe Tafida Raqeeb has no chance of recovery The mother of a brain-damaged girl says the law should be amended, after the High Court ruled her daughter could travel abroad to receive treatment. Five-year-old Tafida Raqeeb has been on life support at the Royal London Hospital since suffering a traumatic brain injury in February. Health bosses had tried to block attempts to take her to the Gaslini children's hospital in Genoa, Italy. Tafida's mother Shalina Begum said: ""The law now needs to be revisited"". The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which rules a ""child's best interests are paramount"" in all healthcare decisions, was ratified in 2000. Mrs Begum said the ""country has evolved"" since the law came into effect. Speaking on the BBC Today programme, she called for a ""clear law that says if there is a reputable hospital prepared to treat a child then there should be no blocking"". Shelina Begum and husband Mohammed Raqeeb said doctors in Italy would continue to treat their daughter unless she was diagnosed as brain dead UK specialists had argued any further treatment of Tafida, who suffered a brain haemorrhage, would be futile. Do hospitals or parents of sick children get to decide? Girl 'will suffer if life support continues' Brain-damaged girl's mum 'doesn't trust UK medics' Bosses at Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Whitechapel, have argued that ending Tafida's life-support is in her best interests. Tafida's parents, both practising Muslims, argued Islamic law said only God could take the decision to end her life. Tafida suffered a traumatic brain injury in February The High Court ruled on Thursdaythere was no justification to stop the child being taken abroad. Mrs Begum said there had been a ""complete meltdown"" in the relationship with doctors at the hospital since the ruling. ""We don't talk, we don't speak. They just walk past,"" she said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Decisions around withdrawing treatment are never easy, and it is important that families and medical experts reach agreement in the best interests of the child. ""Where this is not possible, as in this sad case, it is right the Courts are asked to make a decision."" No appeal against brain-damaged girl ruling 'Our beautiful daughter is not dying' Video, 00:00:49'Our beautiful daughter is not dying' Brain-damaged girl can go abroad for treatment Why parents don't always get to decide Girl 'will suffer if life support continues' Brain-damaged girl's mum 'doesn't trust UK medics' Brain-damaged girl 'should be allowed to die' HM Courts & Tribunals Service A war is being waged against us The fight for central London goes on Creep who committed 'obscene sexual acts' towards women in Catford jailed again Man who waited 12 hours in A&E after coughing up blood says NHS is âout of timeâ Pound tumbles to 14-month low as FTSE climbs despite slump from retail stocks Teens admit to trying to steal 'Â£31k worth of iPhones' from Apple Store LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's casket heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Large crowds predicted for independence march,"Thousands of people have taken part in a march through Edinburgh in support of Scottish independence Thousands of people have marched through Edinburgh in support of Scottish independence. There was a carnival atmosphere as they waved flags and banners from Holyrood Park to a rally in The Meadows. Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP who led thelegal fight against Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament, is among those who addressed the rally. Earlier Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalto say she would be at the march ""in spirit"" but not in person. ""Be in no doubt - independence is coming"", she added. The marchers are walking from Holyrood Park to a rally in The Meadows Organisers All Under One Banner (AUOB) claimed that more than 200,000 people took part in the event. Gary Kelly, of AUOB, said: ""It's buzzing - the rain may be on but the people are not deterred. Our appetite for independence is still alive."" However, neither Police Scotland nor the City of Edinburgh Council was able to give an independent estimate of numbers. Following asimilar event last year, AUOB said there was a crowd of 100,000 but the council later estimated that 20,000 marchers took part. Allow Twitter content?

The 34-year-old from Edinburgh said: ""I'm here to support the cause for independence. ""To be honest, after the last referendum I was a bit deflated and disenfranchised and I was not going to be taking part anymore."" However, she said a recent trip to the west coast of Scotland ""re-inspired"" her, and so she decided to join Saturday's march. She continued: ""I've not really been caught up in the whole Brexit debate, I'm not bothered about that.

""But this is one opportunity for the Yes movement to get together in celebration and despite the rain I think there's been a fantastic turn out."" Earlier this year Nicola Sturgeon said she would demand Holyrood was given thepower to hold a second referendum on independence. The SNP is expected to put its opposition to Brexit and its desire for another poll at the centre of its manifesto in the event of a snap election.

Iran hackers 'targeted US 2020 campaign'Reports suggest the hackers tried to break into President Donald Trump's re-election campaign.US & Canada,"Microsoft said the hackers were ""highly motivated"" Hackers that appear to be linked to Iran's government have targeted the 2020 US presidential election, according to tech company Microsoft. The group attacked more than 200 email accounts, some of which belonged to people associated with ""a US presidential campaign"", it said. The target was President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, sources told Reuters news agency. Iran has not yet publicly commented on the allegations. A spokesman for the Trump campaign said it had no indication it had been targeted. ""Today we're sharing that we've recently seen significant cyber activity by a threat group we call Phosphorus, which we believe originates from Iran and is linked to the Iranian government,""a Microsoft statement reads,external. Phosphorus, it said, made more than 2,700 attempts to identify people's email accounts over a 30-day period in August and September. It then attacked 241 accounts. ""The targeted accounts are associated with a US presidential campaign, current and former US government officials, journalists covering global politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran,"" Microsoft said. Who will take on Trump in 2020? If the US election were like Canada's... Currently, 19 Democrats are seeking to be nominated as their party's candidate to stand against Donald Trump in 2020, while three Republicans say they plan to challenge the president. The statement did not identify which specific campaign was targeted. However Reuters reported it was President Trump's re-election campaign, citing sources familiar with the operation. Reuters reports that the campaign targeted was US President Donald Trump's According to Microsoft, only four accounts were eventually compromised, and none of these were associated with a campaign, nor any former or current officials. The hackers tried to take over the accounts, in attacks Microsoft called ""not technically sophisticated"". The company has told account holders affected and helped to protect them. Russians charged with US election hack Russia cyber-plots: Three surprising things we learnt Nevertheless, the tech company called Phosphorus, also known as APT 35, ""highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering"". Microsoft urged all its customers to set up two-step verification for their email accounts, and suggested people worried about security to check their login history. There has been increasing concern worldwide about foreign-sponsored election interference via hacking. In July,US Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia systematically interfered in the 2016 electionwith the intention of benefitting Mr Trump - although he did not establish collusion in a crime. The same monthMicrosoft said it had told almost 10,000 customers they had been targeted or compromised,externalby nation-state attacks.

How damaging are Ukraine texts for Trump?Texts between US diplomats in Ukraine appear to show offers of US help in exchange for political dirt.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump calls for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens Kurt Volker brought receipts, as the saying goes - and it could spell real trouble for President Donald Trump. During the former US special envoy to Ukraine's private testimony to congressional committees on Thursday, he turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. They documented the Trump administration's efforts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate a Ukrainian company with ties to Joe Biden's son and conspiracy theories around Russian hacking during the 2016 US presidential election. On Thursday night, Democrats in the US House of Representatives - which is conducting an impeachment investigation of Donald Trump - made public a selection of these messages. While some Republicans are saying the release does not paint a complete picture of the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts and the motivations behind them, the messages themselves offer dramatic evidence of what Democrats view as an abuse of presidential authority. Donald Trump and his defenders have insisted there was no quid-pro-quo in his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The text messages, however, tell a different story. It was very clear to members of the administration's Ukrainian diplomatic team what Mr Trump wanted - a publicly announced Ukrainian investigation of political rival Joe Biden and the 2016 election hacking, which the intelligence community has concluded was carried out by Russia (although Mr Trump still has his doubts). Kurt Volker, Mr Trump's Ukraine envoy who resigned a week ago Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, and a significant donor to Mr Trump Bill Taylor, a top US diplomat at the US embassy in Ukraine Messages appear to show the US diplomats coordinating Ukraine's investigation announcement, saying that a draft of Mr Zelensky's statement should include references to 2016 and Burisma, the company that Mr Biden's son worked for. It also was very clear what they had to offer the Ukrainians: not only US military aid, which had been put on hold by the White House, but also a meeting between the two presidents in Washington that would have been extremely valuable in bolstering the legitimacy of the newly elected Ukrainian leader. Drawing a straight line between the offer and the ask doesn't take much imagination - and at least one American diplomat, acting US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, had serious concerns about the propriety of it all. He worried that delaying congressionally authorised US military aid to Ukraine, as the Trump administration had done in July, would be a boon to Russia - and would put Ukraine in a precarious spot. He wondered whether the aid, and a potential Zelensky visit to Washington, were being explicitly conditioned on Ukrainian ""investigations"". The Trump impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? ""I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,"" Mr Taylor texted Gordon Sondland, the deep-pocketed Republican donor who Mr Trump nominated to be US ambassador to the European Union. After five hours, Mr Sondland - whose previous messages to Mr Taylor were conversational - replied with a denial of any ""quid pro quo"" that sounded like a statement crafted by lawyers, followed by a request that they stop texting about it. Other text messages - between Mr Taylor, Mr Sondland and Mr Volker are even more direct. The team seemed intent on getting the Ukrainians to release a statement announcing a new corruption investigation into Burisma and possible Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 hacking - a move that, even if it amounted to nothing, could have provided political ammunition for Republicans to undermine Mr Biden's presidential campaign. ""Heard from the White House - assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,"" Mr Volker wrote, in which seems the clearest acknowledgement of a quid pro quo. It may not be long before the White House falls back to its final line of defence - that threatening and cajoling Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden and the 2016 hacking was a reasonable exercise of a president intent on cracking down on corruption involving a then high-ranking American official. ""We are looking at corruption, we are not looking at politics,"" Mr Trump said on Friday morning. ""I don't care if it's Biden or anybody else."" He may say he doesn't care if it involves Biden (and he dodged a question about whether he's ever asked foreign leaders for an investigation of someone who is not a political rival), but this strategy will necessitate all-out attacks on Mr Biden, his son Hunter and their reputation - despite no current evidence that the then-vice-president acted inappropriately in his interactions with Ukrainian officials. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims In the past two days, Mr Trump has said the Bidens are ""crooked"", that they are ""pillaging the country"" and that the former vice-president arranged ""sweetheart deals"" with foreign governments in order to help his son. Complicating matters for the White House, however, was Mr Trump's decision on Thursday to suggest both Ukraine and China open investigations into the Bidens - essentially saying publicly what Democrats were accusing him of doing in his private phone call with Mr Zelensky. That he made the suggestion to China less than a minute after discussing the two nations' ongoing trade negotiations and saying that the US has ""tremendous power"" will leave Democrats howling - particularly aftera report later in the day,externalthat Mr Trump brought up Mr Biden in a 18 June call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Not to be outdone, Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who has essentially served as the president's private detective investigating the Bidens,told the Wall Street Journal,externalthat Mr Trump ordered the dismissal of the previous US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, because she was insufficiently supportive of the Biden investigation. This video can not be played Mr Giuliani is alleged to have sought to dig up dirt on Democrat candidate Joe Biden All in all, the recent spate of revelations paints a picture of a White House wielding the tools of foreign policy to advance goals that could be seen as overtly political. Many Democrats have already said this is an abuse of power necessitating presidential impeachment and removal from office. A handful of Republicans have also been critical. In a series of tweets on Friday, Mitt Romney - the 2012 Republican presidential nominee -offered a stinging rebuke,externalof the president. ""When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,"" he wrote. ""By all appearances, the president's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling."" Trump urges China to investigate Bidens The reality, however, is that for all the blows Mr Trump has received and may yet endure, none of them may prove fatal. He's faced seemingly mortal crises before, only to plough through and emerge intact on the other side. Impeachment, even if it now seems like a foregone conclusion, isn't the end of the Trump presidency. That would take two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate voting for removal. As Axios's Mike Allen points out, the chamber has more than enough Republican senators from states where the president remains popular - 36 - to form a ""red firewall"" to block removal. Unless Mr Trump's approval craters, any of these senators voting to convict the president would be tantamount to political suicide. The president knows how to endure the ""political storm"", as he called it earlier this week. ""I'm used to it,"" he said. ""For me, it's like putting on a suit in the morning."" With what's coming in the days ahead, he's going to need that to be a suit of armour. Follow Anthony on Twitter,external Five things to know about Canada's election Is Justin Trudeau in trouble?
