Rail firm cancels Sunday services again,"Northern said about 5% of its Sunday services were affected Northern has cancelled about 80 rail services on Sunday for a second time, in a move branded ""outrageous"". Services across north-west England have been affected as engineering projects caused crew scheduling ""difficulties"". The RMT union said the firm was passing the ""blame"" while Greater Manchester's deputy mayor Beverley Hughes described it as a ""weekly shambles"". The Government called it unacceptable. Northern apologised and added about 5% of its Sunday services were affected. The cancellations, which affect Liverpool, Lancashire and Greater Manchester, followssimilar disruption on 5 Augustand across the country on theday of the World Cup final. More than 165 daily train services were cancelled following a chaotic timetable introduction Darren Ireland, the union's regional organiser, said it was ""ludicrous"" to blame engineering works for the latest cancellations. ""If anything, that would mean they need fewer crews because of the [resulting] cancellations. ""They are blaming everyone apart from the mismanagement of the company."" The union repeated its calls for the operator to be ""stripped of the franchise and the Northern routes should be nationalised immediately"". One passenger tweeted she had to travel to work on Saturday night to be in work in time on Sunday because of the lack of trains. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this month, the operator apologised after a passenger who is disabled wastold she could not travel with her mobility scooterdespite being sold a ticket face-to-face. Three new strikesare also planned by Northern rail workers in a dispute about the role of guards, including one over the August Bank Holiday weekend. On 5 August, Northern said the cancellations came after train workers had ""made themselves unavailable"". Staff contracts mean employees do not have to work on Sundays if they provide seven days' notice. Earlier this week,RMT general secretary Mick Cash said it was ""outrageous for Northern to try and lump the blame"" on their workforce. A Northern spokesman responded: ""We actually have more drivers than we need to run a full timetable in normal circumstances."" Ms Hughes said: ""It is outrageous that Northern think it is acceptable to keep cancelling scores of services on Sundays."" She said the firm's announcement of the cancellations late on Friday afternoon showed ""scant regard"" for rail passengers. ""Enough is enough. We need real answers and an end to this weekly shambles,"" she added. ""I want the secretary of state to step in and find out what's going on in that company and make sure we have a management in place that can deliver the services that the public need."" A Department for Transport spokeswoman: ""The disruption that passengers in the north have experienced is unacceptable and it is vital that services continue to improve and passengers are compensated fully. ""As joint managers of Northern, we continue to work closely with Transport for the North to improve services for passengers, including further timetable adjustments to improve reliability, to reduce disruption for passengers and to ensure they see the benefits of our long-term investment."" Services were amended,externalbetween: Liverpool to Manchester Airport Wigan North Western - Liverpool Blackpool South - Colne and Blackpool - Carlisle Lancaster - Morecambe Manchester Piccadilly - Hazel Grove Southport - Wigan - Manchester - Blackburn Northern said: ""Ongoing engineering projects have caused severe difficulties around the short-notice scheduling of our train crews. ""This is the root cause of what has required us to make these planned cancellations to our main Sunday timetable.

Cornwall hit by 'tourist overcrowding',"Porthcurno beach and Kynance Cove in west Cornwall are no longer being promoted by Cornwall's tourist board Cornwall is ""struggling to cope"" with ""unprecedented mass tourism"" this summer, it is being claimed. Visit Cornwall, the county's tourist board, said it had actively stopped promoting two beaches because of problems caused by overcrowding. Porthcurno beach and Kynance Cove, traditionally quieter beauty spots, have seen an influx of visitors after social media promotion, it said. Local people said traffic gridlock was making some communities unsafe. Drivers were pictured getting out of their cars as they waited in ""gridlock"" at Porthcurno Andrew Tate, who lives near Porthcurno, said an ""absolutely massive traffic jam"" was made worse by people parking along a narrow rural road. ""The result was a massive safety problem - you literally could not enter Porthcurno, it was gridlock,"" he said. Kevin Hall runs a campsite nearby and said deliveries had been late. ""It's been unprecedented... It got to the stage where we had to go down to the junction to stop people coming into the village and try to turn them around,"" he said. A spokesperson from South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said: ""This summer we have struggled to reach patients on various occasions due to vehicles being parked inappropriately... We urge people to park sensibly and to show consideration for emergency vehicle access. ""Traffic congestion and inconsiderate parking do present significant challenges to our crews, especially in tourist resorts and areas where the roads are more limited."" Perranporth experienced traffic jams in August Malcolm Bell, from Visit Cornwall, said: ""Nobody wants to see this sort of mass tourism affecting the area, affecting the tourist experience and clogging the roads"". He said he wants to see ""redistribution"", explaining that many other Cornish communities need more visitors but are not being effectively promoted on social media. He estimated visitor numbers were up by about 20% this summer on the usual 4.5 million visitors per year due to the heatwave, with people flocking to the south west to escape hot cities. He said an estimated one in three household incomes depended on tourism in Cornwall and a balance needed to be struck. ""Air bnb has gone ballistic so we've had about an extra 20,000 visitors from that every day - and when the weather is like this often relatives will come down and stay,"" he said. Mr Bell said an obvious solution to alleviate overcrowding in August was to vary school holiday periods across the country - something he said Visit Cornwall had lobbied the government about for many years. The Department for Education declined to comment. UK heatwave 2018: The winners and losers Beach lifeguards help find 7,000 lost children in five years 'Nothing but a holiday resort?' Revisiting 1939 Cornwall Bec Matthews runs a holiday park at the busy resort of Perranporth, where drivers have been queuing to enter the town. ""I am fully supportive of visitors to the area and quite frankly sick of people moaning. Without tourists we would have no business,"" she said, adding that the town ""does need a park and ride or traffic officers at peak season"". Falmouth is preparing for thousands of extra visitors for the annual Red Arrows display Deborah Hopkins, Unite union regional officer for Cornwall, said the increasing traffic created a ""nightmare"" for some health workers and trades people. ""Each summer it gets a bit worse,"" she said. ""We need to have a serious discussion about how we balance the need for tourism and the need for business to continue to run over the summer. ""We have a huge proportion of self-employed people in Cornwall who aren't able to make enough money in the summer as travel time isn't paid time if you're in self employment"". Some local people at Trevone Bay near Padstow complained that the beach was too crowded for them to enjoy ""Our infrastructure is struggling to cope. The burden needs to be recognised and the government needs to invest in Cornwall,"" she said. Liam Hunt, 33, a plumber in Newquay, said his daily journey home was delayed all summer and it was so difficult to park on his residential street that he had abandoned his vehicle on double yellow lines and paid Â£70 in parking fines. The town is expecting an extra 50,000 visitors this weekend for the annual Boardmasters festival, with drivers being warned of delays. Group Manager Mark Salter from Cornwall Fire, Rescue and Community Safety Service said: ""Popular destinations such as St Ives and Newquay do present a greater risk of responding crews being delayed as they carefully navigate through slow moving traffic"". Plan journeys well in advance Consider car sharing Avoid travelling at peak times Remain patient Adhere to road traffic regulations Observe road traffic signs Consider road conditions Listen to radio travel updates Drivers must avoid using mobile phones or other devices while they control the vehicle Use park and ride facilities if possible Vehicles must be parked in dedicated car parking spaces If a responding emergency blue light vehicle is approaching please find a safe space to slow down to allow the vehicle to pass safely.

"Turkey condemns US 'threats' over pastorPresident Erdogan says the US is trying to ""bring Turkey to its knees through threats over a priest"".Europe","The pastor is only one of a number of issues dividing Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused the US of trying to ""bring Turkey to its knees through threats over a pastor"". The US has demanded the release of Andrew Brunson and on Friday doubled tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The diplomatic spat sent the lira down 16% against the dollar on Friday. Mr Erdogan also wrote in the New York Times,externalthat unless the US changed course, Turkey would look for new friends and allies. Turkey has detained Mr Brunson for nearly two years, accusing him of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. Turkey's lira slump explained Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis? But the pastor is only one of a number of issues dividing the two Nato allies, including policy on Syria and Mr Erdogan's growing ties with Russia. He was speaking at a rally in the Black Sea town of Unye. He said: ""It is wrong to dare bring Turkey to its knees through threats over a pastor. I am calling on those in America again. Shame on you, shame on you. You are exchanging your strategic partner in Nato for a priest. You can never bring this nation in line with the language of threats. ""We have not made concessions on justice so far, and we will never make any."" Turning to the economic effects of the diplomatic row, Mr Erdogan said: ""If they have the dollar, we have Allah."" He added: ""If there are dollars under your pillow, take these out. If there are euros, take these out. Immediately give these to the banks and convert to Turkish lira and by doing this, we fight this war of independence."" Mr Erdogan said the US had ""repeatedly and consistently failed to understand and respect the Turkish people's concerns"". Turkey has urged the US to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen He added: ""Unless the United States starts respecting Turkey's sovereignty and proves that it understands the dangers that our nation faces, our partnership could be in jeopardy."" Mr Erdogan said although the nations had been allies for decades, Turkey ""now has alternatives"". ""Failure to reverse this trend of unilateralism and disrespect will require us to start looking for new friends and allies."" Pastor Andrew Brunson was moved to house arrest last month due to health issues He also condemned as ""unacceptable, irrational and ultimately detrimental"", thesanctions imposed by the US on several Turkish cabinet membersover the Brunson issue. There are quite a few, a number of them addressed by Mr Erdogan in the New York Times. He is clearly angry that the US has not taken more action against the Gulenist movement and what he said was a failure ""to unequivocally condemn"" the 2016 coup attempt. The US has refused to extradite Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. US support for Kurdish rebel groups fighting Islamic State fighters in northern Syria. is another major difficulty, given Turkey's battle against a Kurdish insurgency in its own country. On Friday Turkey made it clear Mr Erdogan had spoken on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the latest US tariffs, with the two men ""expressing pleasure"" that relations were progressing ""positively"". It's an awkward triangle, given that Turkey is a Nato member, Russia is Nato's number one threat and the organisation is obliged to defend any member that is attacked. Nato uses the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to fight against IS and there has been some domestic pressure on Mr Erdogan to close it. President Donald Trump doubled US tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, saying ""US relations with Turkey are not good at this time"". The reaction from global currency markets caused the euro to slump to a 13-month low and pushed the dollar to a one-year high. American evangelicals have pressed Mr Trump for action on Pastor Brunson, who was held in prison for almost two years but was recently moved to house arrest.

Romanians hold new protest after clashes,"Many demonstrators are calling on the government to resign Thousands of Romanians are again taking part in an anti-government rally in the capital Bucharest, a day after clashes left more than 400 people injured. So far the protest near the government offices has been noisy but peaceful. Similar demonstrations are also reported in other cities including Cluj, Sibiu, Timisoara and Iasi. On Friday, more than 50,000 people took to the streets against what they described as entrenched corruption and low wages. Many of the demonstrators are Romanian expats who have returned from across Europe to voice their anger at the government. Police held back the crowds on Saturday in Bucharest but no clashes were reported Several police officers were hurt on Friday as some protesters threw bottles and police used tear gas and water cannon. President Klaus Iohannis said the police reaction was ""disproportionate"". ""I firmly condemn riot police's brutal intervention, strongly disproportionate to the actions of the majority of people,"" he said. Romania protests grow over corruption decree Romanian stopped for number plate protest Read more about Romania The demonstration was staged in front of the government headquarters in the city centre. The protesters were demanding the resignation of the government, objecting to the perceived efforts to weaken the judiciary by the governing Social Democrats (PSD). The clashes on Friday began when some demonstrators tried to break into a government building The violence began when some in the crowd tried to break into the government building - but were held back by the police security cordon. Other protesters were seen throwing paving slabs at the police, who responded with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannon. Police said they had acted in a proportionate way, responding to the violent behaviour of hooligans in the crowd. Ileana Anghel travelled all the way from her home in Spain with her husband to take part in the demonstration. ""We want to see modern roads and schools and above all to not have to pay bribes to the left and right,"" she told AFP. Burning barricades were seen in central Bucharest late into the night Vlad, 60, flew back to Romania from New York, his home of 30 years. ""Corruption and embezzlement, which profit the ruling class, are what bothers me,"" Vlad told the same news agency. According to the World Bank, up to a quarter of the Romanian population - between three and five million people - live and work abroad, sending back around $5bn (Â£3.9bn) to one of the EU's least developed countries. Protests have been building against the PSD for months. In July, President Iohannis approved the dismissal of anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi, who had been leading corruption investigations into local and national politicians. Mr Iohannis had been under extensive pressure from the PSD government to agree to her removal. Around 150,000 gathered in Bucharest last yearafter the government passed a decree that could free those jailed on corruption charges.

Ex-monk charged with killing Coptic bishop,"Egypt's Christian minority are mostly members of the Coptic Orthodox Church Prosecutors in Egypt have charged a defrocked monk with the murder of a Coptic Christian Bishop at a desert monastery. Bishop Epiphanius, 64, was found dead in a pool of blood at Saint Macarius Monastery in Wadi Natroun, north-west of Cairo, on 29 July. Wael Saad, who had been a monk at the monastery, reportedly told prosecutors he used an iron pole to bludgeon the bishop to death. The possible motive is not yet clear. The murder of Bishop Epiphanius shocked the Coptic Church, whose adherents make up about 10% of Egypt's population. Wael Saad, who as a monk was known as Isaiah al-Makari, was stripped of his religious title following the bishop's death. The church initially said it was because he had been investigated over long-standing violations of his duties. Who are Coptic Christians? Egyptian Copt: 'I feel so scared' Prosecutors in Alexandria say he was formally charged on Friday and placed in detention pending further investigations. In the wake of the bishop's death, the Coptic Church instituted a crackdown on clergy behaviour and froze the recruitment of new monks for a year. Monks were ordered to close their social media accounts and Coptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros II also closed his official Facebook page. Correspondent say the measures suggest dissent within the Coptic Church that could be linked to the bishop's murder. The Church has not commented. Who are the Coptic Christians?

Gascoigne blames TV exit on sleeping pills,"Former footballer Paul Gascoigne has blamed his early exit from a TV show on Saturday morning on sleeping pills. The former England midfielder insisted he was not drunk on Sky's Soccer AM, where he was a guest alongside Inbetweeners actor Joe Thomas. Gascoigne, who forged his career at Newcastle and Spurs, has struggled with alcoholism for more than 20 years. His most recentspell in rehab was in 2017, after the death of his nephew. After leaving Soccer AM midway through the show, host John Fendley told viewers the 51-year-old was ""not feeling wonderful"". Gascoigne responded to concerns on social media which suggested he ""looked out of it"" during the show. Writing on Twitter, he said people were ""saying I was drunk"", but went on to explain that he had ""been taking sleeping tablets to try kip"". Allow Twitter content?

Farmer 'killed in field by cattle'A bull was destroyed by police after Stephen Sandys's body was found by his partner.,"The cows were moved to another field after Stephen Sandy's body was found A farmer whose body was found in a field may have been trampled to death by his cattle, Sussex Police said. Police were called amid concerns Stephen Sandys had not returned from feeding his livestock at Pinstraw Farm in Eridge Road, Groombridge, about 22:30 BST on Friday. The 64-year-old's body was found in a field with his Aberdeen Angus cattle and he died at the scene. Mr Sandys's partner, Christine, said a bull was destroyed by police. She told the BBC Mr Sandys had been due to collect her from the station, but failed to turn up. When she got home she went to look for him and found him on the ground in the field with the cows and a nine-year-old bull which had been born and raised on the farm, she said. The bull was snorting and stamping and it was not safe to get close to Mr Sandys, she added. Mr Sandys failed to return home after going to feed his cattle on Friday night, his partner said Neighbour Brett Walker said Mr Sandys had taken over the farm following the death of his father. ""He was a super guy, and never had a bad word to say about anybody.""

Airline employee steals and crashes plane,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons An airline employee who stole an empty passenger plane from Seattle airport has crashed on a nearby island. Authorities said the man had made ""an unauthorised take-off"" late on Friday local time, forcing Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to close. Two F15 fighter jets pursued the plane, which crashed in Puget Sound. The man is not believed to have survived. The local sheriff's office said it was ""not a terrorist incident"", adding that the man was local and aged 29. Pierce County SheriffPaul Pastor later told reporters it appeared to be ""a joyride gone terribly wrong"",external, according to ABC7 News, adding ""most terrorists don't do loops over the water"". The 76-seat, twin-engine turboprop Bombardier Q400, belonging to Alaska Airlines' sister carrier Horizon Air, took off from Seattle-Tacoma at about 20:00 local time (03:00 GMT). Ben Schaechter was on a plane which was apparently taxiing down the runway as the stolen plane took off. ""Okay this insane,"" he tweeted.,external""A pilot on the plane in front of us just went rogue and took off on an empty plane bypassing orders from the tower. The tower ordered a full stop and they're trying to communicate with that pilot. Whaaaaaat!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) issued a statement on Saturday morning saying that the two F15s were launched from Portland to intercept. A number of videos showed them following the passenger plane, which was flying in an erratic manner. Norad said the F15s were ""working to redirect the aircraft out over the Pacific Ocean when it crashed on the southern tip of Ketron island"", about 30 miles (48km) south of the airport. ""Norad fighters did not fire upon the aircraft,"" it said. Sheriff Pastor told KIRO7 news station in Seattle the man had most likely been killed in the crash. It isn't immediately clear. However, an audio recording of the conversations he had with air traffic control give some insight into what happened after the Horizon Air employee took off. In the recording, the man can be heard starting to worry about how much fuel he has on board. He also suggests he could land the aircraft by himself because he had played ""some video games"". ""This is probably jail time for life, huh?"" he asks the controller. ""I would hope it is for a guy like me."" ""Oh, Richard. We're not going to worry or think about that. But could you start a left turn please?"" the controller says. The man, who is referred to by what is believed to be his first name, also discusses: The co-ordinates foran orca carrying her dead calf on her backwhich featured in the news last week Looking at the view and possibly going to look at the Olympic Mountains, in Washington State The risk of being ""roughed up"" if he lands at a military base which he fears will have ""anti-aircraft missiles"" If he can do a barrel roll before landing and ""calling it a night"" Whether or not Alaska Airlines would give him a job after a successful landing The Seattle Times describes the man as sounding ""carefree and wild"",external. However, the tone changed later in the conversation. ""I've got a lot of people that care about me,"" he said. ""It's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologise to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it, until now."" Eyewitness John Waldron told CNN he watched the plane do ""a complete loop"", before it went ""pretty much straight up. And kind of at an angle. And almost stalled the aircraft"". ""Somehow he got it levelled back off,"" he told the broadcaster. ""And then made his way down toward the island."" At one point, he estimated, the plane was no more than 100ft (30.5m) above the water. The plane flew very low to the water Leah Morse, who filmed the plane flying overhead, told news agency Reuters she felt in her ""gut something was wrong"" after spotting the plane. Ms Morse's mother, who lives closer to the area where the plane went down, said her whole house shook. ""We saw the jets circle back after and she texted that there was no plane,"" she added. Alaska Airlines said the plane was taken from a ""maintenance position""in the airport. However, how it came to be on the runway is unclear. Planes of this size do not come with keys, aviation safety investigator David Gleave, of Loughborough University, explained to the BBC. But after he managed to start the plane, taking off and flying it around would not have been that difficult, Mr Gleave said. Footage shows a fire burning in the spot where the plane went down ""There is an awfully big amount of sky to play with,"" he explained. ""Getting the thing back down again is where all the mechanical skills come in."" As for air traffic control, it would have taken them less than a minute to realise something had gone wrong, Mr Gleave added. The FBI has taken over the investigation, according to the local police department. Alaska said it was ""working closely with the authorities and our own safety teams to thoroughly understand this incident"". Meanwhile, ""normal operations at Sea-Tac Airport"" had resumed within a few hours, accordingto a tweet sent by the airport,external. Stolen plane: Footage shows aerial stunts.

Seattle plane hijacker 'had clearance',"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons A man who stole an empty passenger plane from Seattle airport and then crashed it was an airline worker with full credentials, authorities say. The 29-year-old had worked for Horizon Air for more than three years, towing and tidying aircraft and loading bags. The man, named by US media as Richard Russell, took off late on Friday, forcing the airport to close while two fighter jets gave chase. After making ""incredible manoeuvres"", he crashed the plane and was killed. The flight lasted 90 minutes and the crash site is on Ketron Island, a sparsely populated area in Puget Sound. ""At this time, we believe he was the only one in the aircraft but of course, we haven't confirmed that at the crash site,"" said Jay Tabb, chief of the FBI's Seattle division. Transcripts of his conversation with air traffic control reveal a man who appears surprised about his feat, who is unclear as to the full operations of the plane, who has no intention to hurt anyone and who ultimately apologises to his loved ones, saying he is ""just a broken guy"". Richard Russell worked as a ground-service agent for Horizon Air The airline worker, whose nickname was Beebo, has not yet been formally named as the pilot of the plane but he has been identified as such by his family and by US media. In a statement, his family said they were ""stunned and heartbroken"". ""It may seem difficult for those watching at home to believe, but Beebo was a warm, compassionate man,"" the statement said. ""He was a faithful husband, a loving son and a good friend."" According to an online blog, Mr Russell lived in Sumner, Washington. He was born in Key West, Florida, and moved to Wasilla, Alaska, when he was seven years old. This video can not be played The family of Richard Russell released a statement His profile tells of how he met his wife in Oregon in 2010,externaland says they ran a bakery together there for three years before moving to Washington to be closer to her family. Mr Russell was active in the local Christian youth ministry, often working with troubled children. He also writes about his job with Horizon Airlines, saying he is ""able to fly to Alaska at my leisure"". Russell said he appreciated his job as it allowed him flights to Alaska ""In this season of life we enjoy exploring as much as possible, whether it's a day (or so) trip to one of Alaska Airline's destinations, or visiting a new area of Washington,"" the blog post, apparently written two years ago, says. A former airline colleague of Mr Russell described him as a ""quiet guy"". ""He was well liked by the other workers,""Rick Christenson told The Seattle Times.,external""I feel really bad for Richard and for his family. I hope they can make it through this."" Mike Ehl, director of aviation operations at the airport, said the employee ""had access legitimately"" to the plane and that ""no security violations were committed"". This video can not be played Brad Tilden (L), the CEO of Alaska Air Group speaks during a news briefing Alaska Airlines CEO Brad Tilden said the worker had been ""background checked"". ""He worked his shift yesterday and we believe he was in uniform,"" he added. Mr Tilden said planes do not have door or ignition keys, and that other airport security measures keep them safe. Gary Beck, CEO of Horizon Air, said that ""to our knowledge, he didn't have a pilot's licence"" and that he had no idea how he had gained the skills to fly such a ""complex machine"". FBI spokeswoman Ayn S Dietrich-Williams said agents were working with the transportation safety board and other groups to process the scene of the crash. The 76-seat, twin-engine turboprop Bombardier Q400, belonging to Horizon Air, took off from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport at 19:32 local time (02:32 GMT). Officials say the employee used a pushback tractor to first manoeuvre the plane 180 degrees from a maintenance location into the correct position for take-off. The plane flew very low to the water After take-off he performed at least one dramatic roll, pulling the aircraft up just metres from the water before gaining altitude again. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) issued a statement saying that two F15 fighter jets were launched from Portland to intercept. A number of videos showed them following the passenger plane. Norad said the F15s were ""working to redirect the aircraft out over the Pacific Ocean when it crashed on the southern tip of Ketron island"", about 30 miles (48km) south of the airport. ""Norad fighters did not fire upon the aircraft,"" it said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officials say they lost contact with the plane at 20:47 local time, more than an hour after it left the airport. Richard Russell's messages vary from options for landing, to apologies for what he is doing to the often bizarre. The controllers suggest he needs some help flying the plane, to which he replies: ""Nah, I mean, I don't need that much help; I've played some video games before."" But he also shows a limited knowledge of operations, acknowledging that the amount of fuel used on take-off was quite a lot more than he expected and that some instructions to him were ""mumbo jumbo"". Advised that he try to land at the US Air Force base at McChord Field, he says: ""Aw man, those guys would rough me up if I tried landing there... Oh, they've probably got anti-aircraft."" The controller asks for a left turn, receiving the reply: ""This is probably jail time for life, huh? Well I hope it would be for a guy like me."" Among the more odd exchanges, Mr Russell discusses: The co-ordinates foran orca carrying her dead calf on her backwhich featured in the news last week Looking at the view and possibly going to look at the Olympic Mountains in Washington state Whether or not Alaska Airlines would give him a job after a successful landing However, there are also indications that Mr Russell might not have been expecting to land safely. He talks of doing a barrel roll and ""calling it a night"" by going ""nose down"". Footage shows a fire burning in the spot where the plane went down When asked to land he says: ""I don't know, man. I don't want to. I was kind of hoping that was going to be it, you know."" He also says: ""I've got a lot of people that care about me. It's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this.

Council boss makes traveller apology,"Mike Bird said travellers ""run around on motorbikes shouting abuse"" A council leader has apologised for saying travellers are a ""lawless society"" who ""run around on motorbikes shouting abuse"". Mike Bird, the leader of the controlling Conservative group at Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council, made the comments duringa phone-in on BBC WM. A travellers charity previously said it was disgusted by Mr Bird's ""hate"". Mr Bird said he did not intend to cause offence. He told the BBC: ""I would like to express my sincere regret and apologies to anyone who was offended by the use of this deeply unpleasant word in relation to any community. ""I respect every community and individual equally and that is something I firmly believe in. ""I deeply regret any offence caused, it was certainly not intended or meant."" Mike Bird is leader at Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council Mr Bird drew distinction between ""their"" and ""our"" culture and also accused travellers of thefts in the borough during a phone-in on Danny Kelly's mid-morning show on Thursday. One caller labelled travellers ""parasitic"" during a long complaint to which Mr Bird responded: ""The gentleman is absolutely 100% right."" Mr Bird had said: ""The ones that I've come across, they are a lawless society, they have no respect whatsoever for our community."" A spokesperson for charity Friends, Families and Travellers, which ""seeks to end racism and discrimination against Gypsies, travellers and Roma"", said it was ""disgusted"" by Mr Bird's comments which were filled with ""hate and based upon generalisations"".

Minute's applause to remember midwife,"Samantha Eastwood's family has thanked members of the public for their support A minute's applause has been held in memory of midwife Samantha Eastwood who was found dead. Her body was found in a shallow grave in Staffordshire, on 4 August, eight days after she was reported missing. Stoke City fans clapped during the 28th minute of the Championship game, the number marking her age, and came after candle-lit vigils were held. Michael Stirling, 32, of Gratton Road, Bucknall, has been charged with her murder. Potters supporters also cheered to pay tribute to Ms Eastwood during the club's game against Brentford. Forward Benik Afobe opened the scoring for the home team as the minute's applause ended. Candlelit tributes outside Royal Stoke University Hospital The tribute followed candle-lit vigils that had taken place across Stoke-on-Trent on Friday night for Ms Eastwood, whose body was found in Caverswall. In a post with a snap of a candlelit vigil, Tracey Harrison wrote: ""Sam's night shift colleagues kept the light shining bright throughout the night. We miss her warmth, humour and friendship so very much.. RIP Sam."" A rose bush was also delivered by a maternity unit 100 miles away in a mark of solidarity. Barnsley Hospital, in South Yorkshire, made the donation to Royal Stoke University Hospital, where Ms Eastwood worked. Barnsley Hospital tweeted: ""From the team at Barnsley Hospital's maternity unit to all the team at Stoke. One of our midwives will drop off a rose bush to remember Samantha and some tea and Yorkshire food hampers to help you comfort each other. ""You're in our thoughts at this difficult time.""

Weedkiller 'doesn't cause cancer' - Bayer,"Many gardeners use the common weed killers Pharmaceutical group Bayer has dismissed claims that an ingredient used in weed killers is carcinogenic. The German company, which owns agriculture giant Monsanto, says herbicides containing glyphosate are safe. On Friday, Monsanto was ordered to pay $289m (Â£226m) damages to a man who claimed the products caused his cancer. A Californian jury said Monsanto should have warned users about the dangers of its Roundup and RangerPro weedkillers. Bayer completed its $66bn takeover of Monsanto in June. A Bayer spokesperson told the BBC the two companies operate independently. In a statement the company said: ""Bayer is confident, based on the strength of the science, the conclusions of regulators around the world and decades of experience, that glyphosate is safe for use and does not cause cancer when used according to the label."" EU settles dispute over weedkiller glyphosate UK 'will support' pesticide ban The villagers who fear herbicides The landmark lawsuit was the first to go to trial alleging a glyphosate link to cancer. The claimant, groundsman Dewayne Johnson, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2014. His lawyers said he regularly used a form of RangerPro while working at a school in Benicia, California. He is among more than 5,000 similar plaintiffs across the US. Glyphosate is the world's most common weedkiller. The California ruling could lead to hundreds of other claims against Monsanto. The company said it intends to appeal against the verdict. Glyphosate was introduced by Monsanto in 1974, but its patent expired in 2000, and now the chemical is sold by various manufacturers. In the US, more than 750 products contain it. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the World Health Organisation's cancer agency, concluded thatglyphosate was ""probably carcinogenic to humans"",external. However, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) insists it is safe when used carefully. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also says glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer in humans. Last November 2017EU countries voted to renew the licence of glyphosatedespite campaigns against it. BBC North American correspondent James Cook reported that in California - where a judge recently ruled that coffee must carry a cancer warning - the agriculture industry sued to prevent such a label for glyphosate, even thoughthe state lists it as a chemical known to cause cancer,external. What do we know about glyphosate? Jurors found on Friday that Monsanto had acted with ""malice"" and that its weed killers contributed ""substantially"" to Mr Johnson's terminal illness. Following an eight-week trial, the jury ordered the company to pay $250m in punitive damages together with other costs that brought the total figure to almost $290m. Mr Johnson's lawyer, Brent Wisner, said the jury's verdict showed that the evidence against the product was ""overwhelming"". ""When you are right, it is really easy to win,"" he said. Dewayne Johnson reacting to the verdict in a San Francisco court ""The jury got it wrong,"" vice-president Scott Partridge said outside the courthouse in San Francisco. In a written statement, the company said it was ""sympathetic to Mr Johnson and his family"" but it would ""continue to vigorously defend this product, which has a 40-year history of safe use"". ""Today's decision does not change the fact that more than 800 scientific studies and reviews - and conclusions by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US National Institutes of Health and regulatory authorities around the world - support the fact that glyphosate does not cause cancer, and did not cause Mr Johnson's cancer,"" it added.

Woakes hits century as England dominate,"This video can not be played England v India: Woakes century puts England in control Second Specsavers Test, Lord's (day three of five) India 107:Anderson 5-20, Woakes 2-19 England 357-6:Woakes 120*, Bairstow 93, Shami 3-74 England lead by 250 runs Scorecard Chris Woakes' maiden Test century put England in total control on the third day of the second Test against India. The all-rounder's unbeaten 120, coupled with 93 from Jonny Bairstow, took the hosts to 357-6, a lead of 250. England slipped to 89-4 before Bairstow and Woakes shared a sixth-wicket stand of 179 at Lord's. Heavy rain is expected for much of Sunday, but England have put themselves in an ideal position to win this Test and take a 2-0 lead in the series. Although bad light ended play early and spared India further punishment, they will need a much-improved batting performance after their first-innings 107 if they are to save  the match. Lord's century is what dreams are made of - Woakes 'Woakes is the most popular man in English cricket' It was not certain that Woakes, recently recovered from injury, would play in this Test. England decided on the second morning to select him over off-spinner Moeen Ali, with Ben Stokes on trial for affray. Woakes had already impressed with the ball, dismissing India captain Virat Kohli in taking 2-19 on Friday, but was arguably even more impressive with the bat from number seven. He immediately looked composed and his assured play calmed down Bairstow, who frequently played and missed early in his innings. Bairstow reached his half-century first, cover driving left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav for four, before Woakes outpaced him. He targeted Ravichandran Ashwin, scooping him over the wicketkeeper's head and flogging him over cow corner for four as he neared three figures. The shot that brought up his century - a pull over mid-wicket for three - was a rare mistimed stroke. Bairstow looked set to follow Woakes to his hundred before he edged a flat-footed drive at Hardik Pandya behind. India, bowled out in 35.2 overs on the second day of a rain-affected game, began the third day strongly with the ball. Keaton Jennings was lbw playing around a full ball from Mohammed Shami - he wasted one of England's reviews by challenging the decision - before Shami drew Alastair Cook forward with a wonderful leg-cutter to take the outside edge. This video can not be played Cook falls early to 'absolute beauty' Ollie Pope made a breezy start on his Test debut, flicking Ishant Sharma off his pads to get under way with a boundary, before he too was lbw playing across the line to Pandya. Joe Root looked scratchy and, when he was caught on the crease by Shami on the stroke of lunch, England appeared in trouble. Jos Buttler made 24 before he became another Shami lbw victim, but Woakes and Bairstow's partnership, which spanned 43 overs, ensured England ended the day well on top. This video can not be played Root falls to final ball before lunch India might be left to rue their team selection for this match. They dropped seamer Umesh Yadav for Kuldeep, but he was untidy and proved expensive, with his nine overs costing 44. The three seamers had the most impact on a pitch that still offered some movement and showed signs of low bounce, with four of the England top six dismissed lbw. As the day progressed, India became flatter in the field, and they were worked around with ease by Woakes and Sam Curran, who finished unbeaten on 22, in the evening. It is a tough ask for them to get something out of this Test. England's Chris Woakes on Sky Sports:""It's hard to put into words. It wasn't on my radar at the start of the day. ""But it's an incredible feeling to raise your bat at Lord's and put the team into a good position. ""We do need to take into consideration the forecast but that isn't always accurate. So I think we will want a few more and then if the conditions are right for us, happy days."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Test Match Special:""I don't think anything has gone India's way with conditions and the toss. ""India are the number one team and within three innings we are watching a talented group of batsmen look very average because the ball is moving. You can question the preparation of India but also the mentality."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""The lead already feels enough and it will be for Joe Root to decide when he unleashes his pace attack under cloudy skies. India's batsmen won't be relishing the prospect one bit.""

French theme park uses birds to clean up,"The first feathery cleaners have already been put to work in the park A theme park in France is set to deploy six ""intelligent"" birds to pick up rubbish and spruce up the grounds. The rooks at the Puy du Fou theme park in the west of the country have been taught to collect cigarette ends and other small bits of rubbish. They then deposit the litter into a small box which will deliver some bird food as a reward for their hard work. The first feathery cleaners have already been put to work, with the rest set to join them on Monday. Crow with Yorkshire accent filmed Crows reveal foundation of technology Nicolas de Villiers, the head of the park, told AFP news agency that it was not just about keeping the area clean. ""The goal is not just to clear up, because the visitors are generally careful to keep things clean"". It was also about showing ""that nature itself can teach us to take care of the environment"".

Farmer 'killed in field by cattle'A bull was destroyed by police after Stephen Sandys's body was found by his partner.Sussex,"The cows were moved to another field after Stephen Sandy's body was found A farmer whose body was found in a field may have been trampled to death by his cattle, Sussex Police said. Police were called amid concerns Stephen Sandys had not returned from feeding his livestock at Pinstraw Farm in Eridge Road, Groombridge, about 22:30 BST on Friday. The 64-year-old's body was found in a field with his Aberdeen Angus cattle and he died at the scene. Mr Sandys's partner, Christine, said a bull was destroyed by police. She told the BBC Mr Sandys had been due to collect her from the station, but failed to turn up. When she got home she went to look for him and found him on the ground in the field with the cows and a nine-year-old bull which had been born and raised on the farm, she said. The bull was snorting and stamping and it was not safe to get close to Mr Sandys, she added. Mr Sandys failed to return home after going to feed his cattle on Friday night, his partner said Neighbour Brett Walker said Mr Sandys had taken over the farm following the death of his father. ""He was a super guy, and never had a bad word to say about anybody."" Frank Langrish, from the National Farmers' Union, said: ""While this isn't an uncommon occurrence, it's unusual especially for a farmer to be killed in this situation. ""Cattle can be unpredictable but this breed of cattle are normally quite docile and easy to handle.""

Tesla's Elon Musk faces investor lawsuit,"Elon Musk has complained before about ""negative propaganda"" Elon Musk's bombshell announcement that he is thinking of taking the electric car company Tesla private has landed him a lawsuit from unhappy investors. The American entrepreneur said on Tuesday that de-listing from the stock exchange could be the ""best path forward"" for the firm. His comments caused the share price to shoot up 11% to nearly $380 (Â£298), though it has since fallen back. Short-sellers, who bet on share price falls, allege he misled the market. Mr Musk, Tesla's founder and chief executive, announced that he might take the company private in a deal worth $72 billion, valuing the company at $420 a share. However, he did not specify exactly where the money for such a deal, which would be the largest of its kind for more than a decade, would come from. Mr Musk, who owns a fifth of the company, has complained previously about ""negative propaganda"" from short-sellers. He said he hoped taking the firm private would protect Tesla from the distractions of share price volatility and pressure to meet quarterly financial targets. Elon Musk is playing a dangerous game Tesla 'removed' from fatal car crash probe Short-sellers, who make a profit by borrowing shares, selling them and then buying them back at an expected lower price, claim to have lost millions thanks to Mr Musk's comments. Plaintiff Kalman Isaacs alleges the announcement was aimed at ""completely decimating"" short-sellers. His lawsuit, and another filed by William Chamberlain, accuse Mr Musk and Tesla of violating federal securities laws and artificially inflating Tesla's share price. Neither Mr Musk nor Tesla have commented on the lawsuit, which was filed in a federal court in San Francisco. The tech entrepreneur is no stranger to controversy.

Johnson burka probe is 'show trial'Jacob Rees-Mogg defends Boris Johnson and says row is being used to stop him becoming Tory leader.UK Politics,"Jacob Rees-Mogg suggests Boris Johnson attracts extra criticism because people are envious of him A Conservative Party investigation into Boris Johnson is a ""show trial"" and is being used to stop him becoming leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg has claimed. Writing inthe Daily Telegraph,,externalthe Tory backbencher blamed Theresa May's ""personal rivalry"" with Mr Johnson for ""taking the heat off Labour"". A Downing Street source told the BBC the investigation was ""not about individuals or personalities"". Mr Johnson said women in burkas looked like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". His remarks -in a Daily Telegraph column,externallast week - have been called Islamophobic and the Tory Party has received dozens of complaints. The former foreign secretary - who argued against a ban on full-face veils in the same article - has rejected calls to apologise. Mr Rees-Mogg said it was ""hard to see"" how Mr Johnson had breached the party's code. The Downing Street source said the party is compelled to investigate any complaint. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said the support shown to Mr Johnson by some Tory MPs had ""shone a light on the underbelly of Islamophobia"" within the party. Mr Johnson is back home in Oxfordshire, after being spotted in Florence, Italy earlier on Saturday In a statement, Harun Khan of the MCB, said: ""The impact of Boris Johnson's comments are real and worrying and indicate the importance of a full, transparent and independent investigation into his conduct, in particular given the lack of action in previous cases of Islamophobia in the party."" Why some Muslim women wear the veil Watchdog criticises Johnson's burka comments The complaints are being looked at by an investigating officer, who can dismiss them if they are found to be obviously trivial, lacking in merit or unable to be fairly investigated. Should they be upheld, the complaints will then be looked at by an independent panel which could refer Mr Johnson to the party's board, which has the power to expel him. In a column in the Telegraph newspaper on Saturday, Mr Rees-Mogg said he ""entirely agrees"" with Mr Johnson over the issue and made clear that he also does not support a ban on the burka. He suggested that senior conservatives have attacked Mr Johnson because of ""envy"" of his ""many successes, popularity with voters and charisma"". Mr Johnson resigned as foreign secretary last month The North East Somerset MP wrote: ""Could it be that there is a nervousness that a once and probably future leadership contender is becoming too popular and needs to be stopped? ""This may explain the attempt to use the Conservative Party's disciplinary procedures, but it has been handled so ham-fistedly that it brings only sympathy and support for Mr Johnson,"" he wrote. Mr Rees-Mogg - a leading Brexiteer who has previously criticised the prime minister - said it would be ""absurd"" to call Mr Johnson's remarks ""either victimising or harassing"" and it was ""hard to see"" how Mr Johnson could have broken the party's code of conduct. He wrote: ""When Margaret Thatcher was leader, she and Michael Heseltine were hardly soulmates, but she would not have allowed personal rivalry to take the heat off the Labour Party... nor would she have countenanced any attempt to have a show trial. ""Attacking Boris merely helps the opposition."" This video can not be played ""There's no reason to insult people in that way,"" one woman told the BBC's Asian Network On Friday, theUK's equalities watchdog saidMr Johnson's remarks were ""inflammatory and divisive"" and his comments risked ""vilifying Muslim women"". Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis and leader Theresa May have both called on Mr Johnson to apologise for his comments. The founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum,Lord Sheikh, has written to Mr Lewisdemanding ""serious action"", while former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became prime minister. But comedian Rowan Atkinson was among those who expressed support for Mr Johnson. On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen also defended Mr Johnson. He said other prominent MPs had made remarks about Muslim women's clothing without facing an investigation. ""This isn't about Islamophobia,"" he said. ""This is about diminishing and humiliating Boris Johnson because he's seen as a political threat by those on the left and those in the Conservative Party at the moment."" The Telegraph newspaper said it had been ""inundated"" with letters in support of Mr Johnson; it gave over its whole letters page to publish them. Mr Johnson is on holiday overseas and is yet to respond to the reaction to his article.

Dave and Gold return to Virgin MediaThe UKTV channels are being restored after the two companies resolved a row over fees.Entertainment & Arts,"Comedy panel show Taskmaster is among the programmes returning to Virgin Media customers' TVs Television channels such as Dave and Gold are returning to the screens of Virgin Media customers after a fees dispute with UKTV was resolved. Virgin Media said that free-to-air channels had already been restored, with paid channels following shortly. Virgin had previously refused to pay what it called ""inflated"" fees and complained that it was not allowed to show all channels on demand. More than five times as much on-demand content will now be available, it said. About four million subscribers of the cable company lost access to 10 UKTV channels in July after talks broke down, disappointing fans of shows such as Taskmaster and Red Dwarf as well as classic comedies like Only Fools and Horses and Miranda. UKTV, which is part-owned by the BBC, had said it could not accept the ""drastic"" price cuts proposed by Virgin Media. Cable customers lost five free-to-air channels - Dave, Drama, Really and Yesterday - as well as the paid-for services Gold, Alibi, Eden, Good Food and W. A Virgin Media spokesman said the paid-for channels, which took longer to restore for ""technical reasons"", would reappear over the next few days. The new agreement increases the number of catch-up hours available, with customers on the top-tier Full House plan gaining access to ""significantly more"" boxsets, the company said. It also adds access to HD versions of Dave and Gold for customers on the cheaper Virgin Mix plans. David Bouchier, chief digital entertainment officer at Virgin Media said: ""We are sorry for what we know has been a frustrating time for our customers, but are pleased that our TV bundles are now even bigger."" Customers on social media welcomed the return of their favourite shows and channels, but some said they had already switched TV provider during the shutdown. Allow Twitter content?

Nasa postpones 'mission to the Sun',"This video can not be played Parker Solar Probe: How Nasa is trying to 'touch' the Sun A US space agency Nasa mission to send a satellite closer to the Sun than any before has been stood down. The Parker Solar Probe was set to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Saturday, but last-minute investigations have delayed it for 24 hours. It is now scheduled to blast off - on board the mammoth Delta-IV Heavy rocket - on Sunday morning. The probe is set to become the fastest-moving manmade object in history. The rocket was on the launch pad when the countdown clock was interrupted, as officials investigated an alarm. The vehicle had a weather window of 65 minutes to launch, but the time elapsed before the issue could be resolved. The probe aims to dip directly into our star's outer atmosphere, or corona. Its data promises to crack longstanding mysteries about the Sun's behaviour - assuming it can survive roasting temperatures above 1,000C. The Delta-IV Heavy rocket with the Parker Solar Probe onboard The Delta will hurl the probe into the inner Solar System, enabling the Nasa mission to zip past Venus in six weeks and make a first rendezvous with the Sun a further six weeks after that. Over the course of seven years, Parker will make 24 loops around our star to study the physics of the corona, the place where much of the important activity that affects the Earth seems to originate. The probe will dip inside this tenuous atmosphere, sampling conditions, and getting to just 6.16 million km (3.83 million miles) from the Sun's broiling ""surface"". ""I realise that might not sound that close, but imagine the Sun and the Earth were a metre apart. Parker Solar Probe would be just 4cm away from the Sun,"" explained Dr Nicky Fox, the British-born project scientist who is affiliated to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. ""It will also be the fastest man-made object ever, travelling at speeds of up to 430,000mph [690,000km/h] - New York to Tokyo in under a minute!"" she told BBC News. This video can not be played Parker scientist Dr Nicky Fox: ""Never before have we gone up and literally touched our star"" Parker will help us better understand how the Sun works. The star is constantly bombarding the Earth with charged particles and magnetic fields. This perpetual flow, or ""solar wind"", is responsible for generating the beautiful auroral lights that appear in polar skies, but there are some interactions that initiate much more troubling effects. The biggest outbursts from the Sun will rattle the Earth's magnetic field. In the process, communications may be disrupted, satellites can be knocked offline, and power grids will be vulnerable to electrical surges. Scientists try to forecast these ""storms"" and Parker promises new and valuable information to help them do that. The diffuse corona is only visible to us on Earth during a total solar eclipse Parker wants to get where the action is. The corona is a remarkable place. It's strangely hotter than the Sun's actual surface, or photosphere. While this can be 6,000 degrees, the outer atmosphere may reach temperatures of a few million degrees. The mechanisms that produce this super-heating are not fully understood. Artwork: Parker must always keep its heatshield pointed at the Sun Likewise, the corona is the place where the solar wind gets its big kick in speed, sweeping out across the Solar System at more than 500km/s (a million mph). Parker aims to solve these puzzles by directly sampling the corona's particle, magnetic and electric fields. A mission like Parker was first proposed 60 years ago, but it's only now that engineers have the technology available to keep a probe safe so close to the Sun. Nearly everything on the spacecraft must sit behind an 11.5cm-thick (4.5in) carbon-composite sunshield. This will maintain all parts behind the barrier at a tolerable 30C. The probe is solar-powered - obviously. But that in itself is a challenge because the solar cells will have to be moved into sunlight to work and they hate high temperatures. So, Parker's arrays will be water-cooled, with the onboard computer system constantly adjusting their position so that only the minimum surface area absolutely necessary to generate power is exposed beyond the shield. Autonomy is also crucial for this mission. Close to the Sun, the radio interference is intense, and Parker will be out of contact. The probe must manage any faults itself. Above all, it has to keep the shield always pointing at the Sun to avoid being destroyed. Parker has a high level of autonomy The European Space Agency has its own version of Parker. Solar Orbiter, or SolO as it's sometimes known, is undergoing final assembly and testing in the UK. It is expected to launch in 2020, arriving at its closest position to the Sun towards the end of Parker's planned seven years of operations. SolO will go to within 42 million km of the Sun's surface. That's further away than Parker but it will still need an impressive shield. Being at a more distant position, though, means SolO can do things Parker cannot - like look directly at the Sun. This enables the pair to do complementary science. ""Parker Solar Probe will get close and sit in - and make measurements of - the material coming off of the Sun. Meanwhile, Solar Orbiter, from its position, will make those measurements, too, but it will also be able to take pictures and it will be able to look at where the emissions are coming from,"" said Prof Lucie Green, from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory in the UK.

Candle-lit vigils held to remember midwife,"Samantha Eastwood's family has thanked members of the public for their support A minute's applause has been held in memory of midwife Samantha Eastwood who was found dead. Her body was found in a shallow grave in Staffordshire, on 4 August, eight days after she was reported missing. Stoke City fans clapped during the 28th minute of the Championship game, the number marking her age, and came after candle-lit vigils were held. Michael Stirling, 32, of Gratton Road, Bucknall, has been charged with her murder. Potters supporters also cheered to pay tribute to Ms Eastwood during the club's game against Brentford. Forward Benik Afobe opened the scoring for the home team as the minute's applause ended. Candlelit tributes outside Royal Stoke University Hospital The tribute followed candle-lit vigils that had taken place across Stoke-on-Trent on Friday night for Ms Eastwood, whose body was found in Caverswall. In a post with a snap of a candlelit vigil, Tracey Harrison wrote: ""Sam's night shift colleagues kept the light shining bright throughout the night. We miss her warmth, humour and friendship so very much.. RIP Sam."" A rose bush was also delivered by a maternity unit 100 miles away in a mark of solidarity.

Nasa postpones 'mission to the Sun'The US space agency delays for 24 hours the boldest mission in its history after an alarm went off.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Parker Solar Probe: How Nasa is trying to 'touch' the Sun A US space agency Nasa mission to send a satellite closer to the Sun than any before has been stood down. The Parker Solar Probe was set to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Saturday, but last-minute investigations have delayed it for 24 hours. It is now scheduled to blast off - on board the mammoth Delta-IV Heavy rocket - on Sunday morning. The probe is set to become the fastest-moving manmade object in history. The rocket was on the launch pad when the countdown clock was interrupted, as officials investigated an alarm. The vehicle had a weather window of 65 minutes to launch, but the time elapsed before the issue could be resolved. The probe aims to dip directly into our star's outer atmosphere, or corona. Its data promises to crack longstanding mysteries about the Sun's behaviour - assuming it can survive roasting temperatures above 1,000C. The Delta-IV Heavy rocket with the Parker Solar Probe onboard The Delta will hurl the probe into the inner Solar System, enabling the Nasa mission to zip past Venus in six weeks and make a first rendezvous with the Sun a further six weeks after that. Over the course of seven years, Parker will make 24 loops around our star to study the physics of the corona, the place where much of the important activity that affects the Earth seems to originate. The probe will dip inside this tenuous atmosphere, sampling conditions, and getting to just 6.16 million km (3.83 million miles) from the Sun's broiling ""surface"". ""I realise that might not sound that close, but imagine the Sun and the Earth were a metre apart. Parker Solar Probe would be just 4cm away from the Sun,"" explained Dr Nicky Fox, the British-born project scientist who is affiliated to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. ""It will also be the fastest man-made object ever, travelling at speeds of up to 430,000mph [690,000km/h] - New York to Tokyo in under a minute!"" she told BBC News. This video can not be played Parker scientist Dr Nicky Fox: ""Never before have we gone up and literally touched our star"" Parker will help us better understand how the Sun works. The star is constantly bombarding the Earth with charged particles and magnetic fields. This perpetual flow, or ""solar wind"", is responsible for generating the beautiful auroral lights that appear in polar skies, but there are some interactions that initiate much more troubling effects. The biggest outbursts from the Sun will rattle the Earth's magnetic field. In the process, communications may be disrupted, satellites can be knocked offline, and power grids will be vulnerable to electrical surges. Scientists try to forecast these ""storms"" and Parker promises new and valuable information to help them do that. The diffuse corona is only visible to us on Earth during a total solar eclipse Parker wants to get where the action is. The corona is a remarkable place. It's strangely hotter than the Sun's actual surface, or photosphere. While this can be 6,000 degrees, the outer atmosphere may reach temperatures of a few million degrees. The mechanisms that produce this super-heating are not fully understood. Artwork: Parker must always keep its heatshield pointed at the Sun Likewise, the corona is the place where the solar wind gets its big kick in speed, sweeping out across the Solar System at more than 500km/s (a million mph). Parker aims to solve these puzzles by directly sampling the corona's particle, magnetic and electric fields. A mission like Parker was first proposed 60 years ago, but it's only now that engineers have the technology available to keep a probe safe so close to the Sun. Nearly everything on the spacecraft must sit behind an 11.5cm-thick (4.5in) carbon-composite sunshield. This will maintain all parts behind the barrier at a tolerable 30C. The probe is solar-powered - obviously. But that in itself is a challenge because the solar cells will have to be moved into sunlight to work and they hate high temperatures. So, Parker's arrays will be water-cooled, with the onboard computer system constantly adjusting their position so that only the minimum surface area absolutely necessary to generate power is exposed beyond the shield. Autonomy is also crucial for this mission. Close to the Sun, the radio interference is intense, and Parker will be out of contact. The probe must manage any faults itself. Above all, it has to keep the shield always pointing at the Sun to avoid being destroyed. Parker has a high level of autonomy The European Space Agency has its own version of Parker. Solar Orbiter, or SolO as it's sometimes known, is undergoing final assembly and testing in the UK. It is expected to launch in 2020, arriving at its closest position to the Sun towards the end of Parker's planned seven years of operations. SolO will go to within 42 million km of the Sun's surface. That's further away than Parker but it will still need an impressive shield. Being at a more distant position, though, means SolO can do things Parker cannot - like look directly at the Sun. This enables the pair to do complementary science. ""Parker Solar Probe will get close and sit in - and make measurements of - the material coming off of the Sun. Meanwhile, Solar Orbiter, from its position, will make those measurements, too, but it will also be able to take pictures and it will be able to look at where the emissions are coming from,"" said Prof Lucie Green, from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory in the UK.

Dave and Gold return to Virgin MediaThe UKTV channels are being restored after the two companies resolved a row over fees.,"Comedy panel show Taskmaster is among the programmes returning to Virgin Media customers' TVs Television channels such as Dave and Gold are returning to the screens of Virgin Media customers after a fees dispute with UKTV was resolved. Virgin Media said that free-to-air channels had already been restored, with paid channels following shortly. Virgin had previously refused to pay what it called ""inflated"" fees and complained that it was not allowed to show all channels on demand. More than five times as much on-demand content will now be available, it said. About four million subscribers of the cable company lost access to 10 UKTV channels in July after talks broke down, disappointing fans of shows such as Taskmaster and Red Dwarf as well as classic comedies like Only Fools and Horses and Miranda. UKTV, which is part-owned by the BBC, had said it could not accept the ""drastic"" price cuts proposed by Virgin Media. Cable customers lost five free-to-air channels - Dave, Drama, Really and Yesterday - as well as the paid-for services Gold, Alibi, Eden, Good Food and W. A Virgin Media spokesman said the paid-for channels, which took longer to restore for ""technical reasons"", would reappear over the next few days. The new agreement increases the number of catch-up hours available, with customers on the top-tier Full House plan gaining access to ""significantly more"" boxsets, the company said. It also adds access to HD versions of Dave and Gold for customers on the cheaper Virgin Mix plans. David Bouchier, chief digital entertainment officer at Virgin Media said: ""We are sorry for what we know has been a frustrating time for our customers, but are pleased that our TV bundles are now even bigger."" Customers on social media welcomed the return of their favourite shows and channels, but some said they had already switched TV provider during the shutdown. Allow Twitter content?

Johnson burka probe is 'show trial',"Jacob Rees-Mogg suggests Boris Johnson attracts extra criticism because people are envious of him A Conservative Party investigation into Boris Johnson is a ""show trial"" and is being used to stop him becoming leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg has claimed. Writing inthe Daily Telegraph,,externalthe Tory backbencher blamed Theresa May's ""personal rivalry"" with Mr Johnson for ""taking the heat off Labour"". A Downing Street source told the BBC the investigation was ""not about individuals or personalities"". Mr Johnson said women in burkas looked like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". His remarks -in a Daily Telegraph column,externallast week - have been called Islamophobic and the Tory Party has received dozens of complaints. The former foreign secretary - who argued against a ban on full-face veils in the same article - has rejected calls to apologise. Mr Rees-Mogg said it was ""hard to see"" how Mr Johnson had breached the party's code. The Downing Street source said the party is compelled to investigate any complaint. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said the support shown to Mr Johnson by some Tory MPs had ""shone a light on the underbelly of Islamophobia"" within the party. Mr Johnson is back home in Oxfordshire, after being spotted in Florence, Italy earlier on Saturday In a statement, Harun Khan of the MCB, said: ""The impact of Boris Johnson's comments are real and worrying and indicate the importance of a full, transparent and independent investigation into his conduct, in particular given the lack of action in previous cases of Islamophobia in the party."" Why some Muslim women wear the veil Watchdog criticises Johnson's burka comments The complaints are being looked at by an investigating officer, who can dismiss them if they are found to be obviously trivial, lacking in merit or unable to be fairly investigated. Should they be upheld, the complaints will then be looked at by an independent panel which could refer Mr Johnson to the party's board, which has the power to expel him. In a column in the Telegraph newspaper on Saturday, Mr Rees-Mogg said he ""entirely agrees"" with Mr Johnson over the issue and made clear that he also does not support a ban on the burka. He suggested that senior conservatives have attacked Mr Johnson because of ""envy"" of his ""many successes, popularity with voters and charisma"". Mr Johnson resigned as foreign secretary last month The North East Somerset MP wrote: ""Could it be that there is a nervousness that a once and probably future leadership contender is becoming too popular and needs to be stopped? ""This may explain the attempt to use the Conservative Party's disciplinary procedures, but it has been handled so ham-fistedly that it brings only sympathy and support for Mr Johnson,"" he wrote. Mr Rees-Mogg - a leading Brexiteer who has previously criticised the prime minister - said it would be ""absurd"" to call Mr Johnson's remarks ""either victimising or harassing"" and it was ""hard to see"" how Mr Johnson could have broken the party's code of conduct. He wrote: ""When Margaret Thatcher was leader, she and Michael Heseltine were hardly soulmates, but she would not have allowed personal rivalry to take the heat off the Labour Party... nor would she have countenanced any attempt to have a show trial. ""Attacking Boris merely helps the opposition."" This video can not be played ""There's no reason to insult people in that way,"" one woman told the BBC's Asian Network On Friday, theUK's equalities watchdog saidMr Johnson's remarks were ""inflammatory and divisive"" and his comments risked ""vilifying Muslim women"". Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis and leader Theresa May have both called on Mr Johnson to apologise for his comments. The founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum,Lord Sheikh, has written to Mr Lewisdemanding ""serious action"", while former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became prime minister. But comedian Rowan Atkinson was among those who expressed support for Mr Johnson. On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen also defended Mr Johnson. He said other prominent MPs had made remarks about Muslim women's clothing without facing an investigation. ""This isn't about Islamophobia,"" he said. ""This is about diminishing and humiliating Boris Johnson because he's seen as a political threat by those on the left and those in the Conservative Party at the moment."" The Telegraph newspaper said it had been ""inundated"" with letters in support of Mr Johnson; it gave over its whole letters page to publish them. Mr Johnson is on holiday overseas and is yet to respond to the reaction to his article.

Alli gives Tottenham winning start,"Dele Alli scored on the opening day for the second consecutive season for Tottenham at Newcastle Tottenham opened their Premier League campaign with a victory at Newcastle for the second year running as goalline technology set them on their way. Jan Vertonghen's early header put Spurs ahead, with technology confirming his effort had crossed the goalline by 9mm. That advantage was short-lived as the hosts equalised 149 seconds later, when Joselu headed in Matt Ritchie's superb cross after being left unmarked six yards from goal. However Tottenham, fielding several of their World Cup stars including England's Harry Kane and Dele Alli, grew stronger as the game progressed. And as Newcastle's early energy began to wane, Alli put the visitors back in front, timing a back-post run to perfection to meet Serge Aurier's cross with a textbook header past home goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. New signings Ki Sung-yueng, Fabian Schar, Salomon Rondon and Yoshinori Muto all started as substitutes for Rafael Benitez's team, who threatened to level for a second time after the break. But Kenedy spurned a glorious opportunity with a poor first touch, Mohamed Diame thrashed a shot against the post and Rondon, on as a substitute, hit the crossbar with a deflected shot. It was the second season in a row that Tottenham had won their opening fixture in the north east, with Alli scoring on both occasions. All the action from the 3pm kick-offs Lawro's predictions v Inbetweeners star Despitedeclarations of contentmentby manager Mauricio Pochettino, it is difficult to imagine that the Argentine's job will not be made more difficult this term by Spurs' inactivity in the transfer market. Clubs at the top end of the Premier League all strengthened while Spurs became the first Premier League club to not make a summer signing since the current transfer window system was adopted in 2003. In a summer when nine first-choice players had a virtually non-existent pre-season - after reaching the later stages of the World Cup - Pochettino was forced to field six of them against Newcastle. This video can not be played Newcastle 1-2 Tottenham: Pochettino congratulates 'massive effort' after win France's World Cup-winning goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, Belgium's Vertonghen and England's Alli, Kane and Eric Dier all started while Mousa Dembele was introduced midway through the second period. With the familiarity of those players clear to see, Tottenham dominated possession with 60% of the ball. And Pochettino is now going to be reliant on those players to secure a top-three finish for the fourth year running. Worryingly for Tottenham, Kane's August Premier League goal drought continued into a 14th match that spans 988 minutes of action. In a largely anonymous display, the England captain managed just four touches in the Newcastle penalty area but Pochettino said it was of no concern. ""He is in his best form whether he scores or doesn't score,"" he said. ""He worked a lot for the team and I'm sure that he's going to score. But he can't score three goals in every game."" This video can not be played Alan Shearer frustrated by lack of spending at Newcastle If it was a case of same old Spurs, Newcastle also reverted to type after an acrimonious summer in which the club was forced todefend its recruitment strategyand had been embroiled in a dispute with its players over bonuses. Having outlaid just over Â£20m on players, Newcastle supporters have questioned the perceived ambition of the club. This video can not be played Newcastle 1-2 Spurs: 'We deserved more' against Spurs - Benitez And a large group of fans protested against Mike Ashley's ownership outside the city centre Sports Direct store before kick-off. Rafael Benitez deployed an XI that featured nine of the players who dispatched Chelsea 3-0 on the final day of the 2017-18 campaign. However, with four of his five new permanent signings named as substitutes, Newcastle were unable to capitalise as Tottenham tired late on. Rondon, who inherited the club's iconic number nine shirt, was introduced with 30 minutes remaining but touched the ball just 11 times. The Venezuelan, who registered 15 league goals over the previous two seasons, will have his work cut out to emulate the feats of former favourites Jackie Milburn, Malcolm Macdonald, Andy Cole and Alan Shearer. Jan Vertonghen opened the scoring for Tottenham and delivered an assured defensive display Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BBC Sport:""To connect everything and start to mould the machine again was a massive challenge for everyone. ""The effort from the players was massive, it is not easy to provide them a good holiday and rest. ""I am happy in the way the players arrived after the holidays, and Dele [Alli] was one of them. He has been strong and focused and he has shown good quality today. ""It is important to be strong from the beginning and have belief and convey a positive message. The staff and the players need to stay together and the most important thing is the fans in a difficult time because we are going to move to a new stadium."" Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez speaking to BBC Sport:""I think we deserved more. The team worked hard against a very good side. We conceded and reacted well, and then went a goal behind again and showed good fight."" Asked about his team selection, Benitez added:""We had to give something to the players that have been training for one month so it was the right thing to do. Now we have more time, and everybody has to fight for their place. You cannot complain about Joselu's work rate, and he got a goal which helped the team. ""We tried to change something and then we had a chance when [Salomon] Rondon hit the crossbar, but you can see the new players will need some time to settle and understand their team-mates."" Tottenham have won four of their past five Premier League away games against Newcastle (L1) - one more than they had won in their previous 19 trips to St James' Park in the competition (W3 D5 L11). Newcastle have lost five of their past six opening games to a league season, drawing the other vs Southampton in 2015-16. Tottenham have scored in 25 of their past 26 Premier League games against Newcastle, failing only in a 0-1 home defeat in November 2013. The first three shots on target in this match all came in the opening 18 minutes and were all scored, while none of the following four were converted.

M&S in new phase of store closuresSeven more of the retailer's clothing shops will shut their doors for the last time on Saturday.Business,"M&S wants to move a third of its sales online Marks & Spencer is implementing the latest round of its store closure programme this weekend as it battles to improve its fortunes. Seven more of the retailer's clothing shops will be shutting their doors for the last time on Saturday. The latest closures are in Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, New Mersey Speke, Northampton, Stockton and Walsall. In all, M&S plans to close 100 shops by 2022, asannounced in May. It says the turnaround is ""vital"" for its future. Profits at Marks & Spencer fell byalmost two-thirds to Â£176.4m last year, following a costly business overhaul. M&S warns more stores could close M&S 'should look at Amazon tie-up' M&S has said the vast majority of the staff working in the stores closed so far have been relocated within the business. However, it has warned that this will not always be possible and that more redundancies are likely. Under its plan, M&S wants to move a third of its sales online and plans to have fewer, larger clothing and homeware stores in better locations. It says it is facing competition from online retailers, as well as discounters such as Aldi, Lidl and Primark. M&S is attempting to re-shape itself at a time when the High Street is under unprecedented pressure. Since the start of this year, a number of retailers have collapsed, including Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld. Other stores, such as DIY chain Homebase and clothing chain New Look, have announced restructuring plans of their own that involve closing large numbers of outlets. On Friday, department store chainHouse of Fraser went into administrationand was bought by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct for Â£90m. Mr Ashley said he wants to transform the 59-store chain - which employs 16,000 people - into the ""Harrods of the High Street"". Administrators said some jobs could be preserved. House of Fraser: Five things that went wrong Which High Street shops are opening and closing? Meanwhile, speaking after the takeover, Chancellor Philip Hammond hinted at possible tax changes to ensure the playing field is ""fair"" between online and High Street businesses. In an interview with Sky News, he said: ""The European Union has been talking about a tax on online platform businesses based on the value generated. ""That's certainly something we'd be prepared to consider."" There has been a Marks & Spencer store in Northampton for 111 years. A short drive away in Kettering, there has been one for 86 years. But Saturday's final day of trading is the end of the road for the 154 members of staff, and hundreds of customers who will use the two shops for the last time. Inside the Northampton shop, many of the shelves have already been stripped back substantially, causing the voices of the final few visitors to echo around what remains. ""I don't know where it's gone wrong,"" says shopper Eileen Smith. ""It's very sad.""

Newcastle United 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur,"Dele Alli scored on the opening day for the second consecutive season for Tottenham at Newcastle Tottenham opened their Premier League campaign with a victory at Newcastle for the second year running as goalline technology set them on their way. Jan Vertonghen's early header put Spurs ahead, with technology confirming his effort had crossed the goalline by 9mm. That advantage was short-lived as the hosts equalised 149 seconds later, when Joselu headed in Matt Ritchie's superb cross after being left unmarked six yards from goal. However Tottenham, fielding several of their World Cup stars including England's Harry Kane and Dele Alli, grew stronger as the game progressed. And as Newcastle's early energy began to wane, Alli put the visitors back in front, timing a back-post run to perfection to meet Serge Aurier's cross with a textbook header past home goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. New signings Ki Sung-yueng, Fabian Schar, Salomon Rondon and Yoshinori Muto all started as substitutes for Rafael Benitez's team, who threatened to level for a second time after the break. But Kenedy spurned a glorious opportunity with a poor first touch, Mohamed Diame thrashed a shot against the post and Rondon, on as a substitute, hit the crossbar with a deflected shot. It was the second season in a row that Tottenham had won their opening fixture in the north east, with Alli scoring on both occasions. All the action from the 3pm kick-offs Lawro's predictions v Inbetweeners star Despitedeclarations of contentmentby manager Mauricio Pochettino, it is difficult to imagine that the Argentine's job will not be made more difficult this term by Spurs' inactivity in the transfer market. Clubs at the top end of the Premier League all strengthened while Spurs became the first Premier League club to not make a summer signing since the current transfer window system was adopted in 2003. In a summer when nine first-choice players had a virtually non-existent pre-season - after reaching the later stages of the World Cup - Pochettino was forced to field six of them against Newcastle. This video can not be played Newcastle 1-2 Tottenham: Pochettino congratulates 'massive effort' after win France's World Cup-winning goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, Belgium's Vertonghen and England's Alli, Kane and Eric Dier all started while Mousa Dembele was introduced midway through the second period. With the familiarity of those players clear to see, Tottenham dominated possession with 60% of the ball. And Pochettino is now going to be reliant on those players to secure a top-three finish for the fourth year running. Worryingly for Tottenham, Kane's August Premier League goal drought continued into a 14th match that spans 988 minutes of action. In a largely anonymous display, the England captain managed just four touches in the Newcastle penalty area but Pochettino said it was of no concern. ""He is in his best form whether he scores or doesn't score,"" he said. ""He worked a lot for the team and I'm sure that he's going to score. But he can't score three goals in every game."" This video can not be played Alan Shearer frustrated by lack of spending at Newcastle If it was a case of same old Spurs, Newcastle also reverted to type after an acrimonious summer in which the club was forced todefend its recruitment strategyand had been embroiled in a dispute with its players over bonuses. Having outlaid just over Â£20m on players, Newcastle supporters have questioned the perceived ambition of the club. This video can not be played Newcastle 1-2 Spurs: 'We deserved more' against Spurs - Benitez And a large group of fans protested against Mike Ashley's ownership outside the city centre Sports Direct store before kick-off. Rafael Benitez deployed an XI that featured nine of the players who dispatched Chelsea 3-0 on the final day of the 2017-18 campaign. However, with four of his five new permanent signings named as substitutes, Newcastle were unable to capitalise as Tottenham tired late on. Rondon, who inherited the club's iconic number nine shirt, was introduced with 30 minutes remaining but touched the ball just 11 times. The Venezuelan, who registered 15 league goals over the previous two seasons, will have his work cut out to emulate the feats of former favourites Jackie Milburn, Malcolm Macdonald, Andy Cole and Alan Shearer. Jan Vertonghen opened the scoring for Tottenham and delivered an assured defensive display Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BBC Sport:""To connect everything and start to mould the machine again was a massive challenge for everyone. ""The effort from the players was massive, it is not easy to provide them a good holiday and rest. ""I am happy in the way the players arrived after the holidays, and Dele [Alli] was one of them. He has been strong and focused and he has shown good quality today. ""It is important to be strong from the beginning and have belief and convey a positive message. The staff and the players need to stay together and the most important thing is the fans in a difficult time because we are going to move to a new stadium."" Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez speaking to BBC Sport:""I think we deserved more. The team worked hard against a very good side. We conceded and reacted well, and then went a goal behind again and showed good fight."" Asked about his team selection, Benitez added:""We had to give something to the players that have been training for one month so it was the right thing to do. Now we have more time, and everybody has to fight for their place. You cannot complain about Joselu's work rate, and he got a goal which helped the team. ""We tried to change something and then we had a chance when [Salomon] Rondon hit the crossbar, but you can see the new players will need some time to settle and understand their team-mates."" Tottenham have won four of their past five Premier League away games against Newcastle (L1) - one more than they had won in their previous 19 trips to St James' Park in the competition (W3 D5 L11). Newcastle have lost five of their past six opening games to a league season, drawing the other vs Southampton in 2015-16.

French theme park uses crows to clean up,"The first feathery cleaners have already been put to work in the park A theme park in France is set to deploy six ""intelligent"" birds to pick up rubbish and spruce up the grounds. The rooks at the Puy du Fou theme park in the west of the country have been taught to collect cigarette ends and other small bits of rubbish. They then deposit the litter into a small box which will deliver some bird food as a reward for their hard work. The first feathery cleaners have already been put to work, with the rest set to join them on Monday. Crow with Yorkshire accent filmed Crows reveal foundation of technology Nicolas de Villiers, the head of the park, told AFP news agency that it was not just about keeping the area clean. ""The goal is not just to clear up, because the visitors are generally careful to keep things clean"". It was also about showing ""that nature itself can teach us to take care of the environment"". He added that the rooks, which are a member of the crow family that also includes ravens and jackdaws, are ""particularly intelligent"" and ""like to communicate with humans and establish a relationship through play"".

Monsanto told to pay $289m in cancer trial,"Crops are often treated with the herbicide glyphosate Chemical giant Monsanto has been ordered to pay $289m (Â£226m) damages to a man who claimed herbicides containing glyphosate had caused his cancer. In a landmark case, a Californian jury found that Monsanto knew its Roundup and RangerPro weedkillers were dangerous and failed to warn consumers. It's the first lawsuit to go to trial alleging a glyphosate link to cancer. Monsanto denies that glyphosate causes cancer and says it intends to appeal against the ruling. ""The jury got it wrong,"" vice-president Scott Partridge said outside the courthouse in San Francisco. EU settles dispute over weedkiller glyphosate UK 'will support' pesticide ban The villagers who fear herbicides The claimant in the case, groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, is among more than 5,000 similar plaintiffs across the US. Correspondents say the California ruling is likely to lead to hundreds of other claims against Monsanto, which was recently bought by the German conglomerate Bayer AG. Mr Johnson was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2014. His lawyers said he regularly used a form of RangerPro while working at a school in Benicia, California. Analysis by James Cook, BBC North America Correspondent The implications of this verdict will be felt far beyond Monsanto's headquarters in Missouri. Glyphosate is the world's most common weedkiller and the science about its safety is still far from settled. In 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer,the World Health Organisation's cancer agency, concluded that it was ""probably carcinogenic to humans"",external. but the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continues to insist that glyphosate is safe when used carefully. Campaigners question how the EPA assessment was reached, citing evidence of what they say was inappropriate industry involvement in the decision. Some Democrats have even called for a Department of Justice investigation intoalleged collusion between government officials and Monsanto,external. In California, where a judge recently ruled that coffee must carry a cancer warning, the agriculture industry sued to prevent such a label for glyphosate even thoughthe state lists it as a chemical known to cause cancer,external. In Europe, too, the battle over glyphosate has been fierce. French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to ban it despite the resistance of some French lawmakers and the fact thatthe European Commission recently granted the weedkiller another five-year licence. Jurors found on Friday that the company had acted with ""malice"" and that its weedkillers contributed ""substantially"" to Mr Johnson's terminal illness. Following an eight-week trial, the jury ordered the agricultural multi-national to pay $250m in punitive damages together with other costs that brought the total figure to almost $290m. Mr Johnson's lawyer, Brent Wisner, said the jury's verdict showed that the evidence against the product was ""overwhelming"". ""When you are right, it is really easy to win,"" he said, adding that the ruling was just ""the tip of the spear"" of future legal cases. Dewayne Johnson (R) hugged his lawyer after hearing the verdict In a statement after the ruling, Monsanto said it was ""sympathetic to Mr Johnson and his family"" but it would ""continue to vigorously defend this product, which has a 40-year history of safe use"". ""Today's decision does not change the fact that more than 800 scientific studies and reviews - and conclusions by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US National Institutes of Health and regulatory authorities around the world - support the fact that glyphosate does not cause cancer, and did not cause Mr Johnson's cancer,"" it added. Monsanto vice-president Scott Partridge told reporters outside the court that the company would appeal UK 'will support' pesticide ban Study 'shows neonic pesticides harm bees' The villagers who fear herbicides EU allows sale of more GM food crops New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war Visa row fuels anxiety for Indians eyeing American dream 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Why can't I beat my 12-year-old at computer games?,"Fortnite is an online game in which players fight it out for survival An expert recently advised parents to play computer games along with their children - but have they any hope of winning? According to William Shakespeare: ""Cowards die many times before their deaths."" If he had been alive today, he could have added that the middle-aged computer gamer dies with even greater regularity. Every day, as I try to recapture the skills of my youth, I suffer the ignominy of being repeatedly blasted out of virtual existence, probably by a primary school pupil. Then, as I grudgingly hand over the console controller to my 12-year-old son, I watch as he makes it all look so easy. The gamers you can pay to help you win at Fortnite Fortnite 'not addictive' says researcher Schools 'could learn from Fortnite' The latest field of despair has come in the form of Fortnite - an online fight for survival that has left me tearing out the little hair I have left. It is a game which has caused some concern among parents over the time their children spend playing it and the potential for addiction. That prompted one expert to advise adopting an ""if you can't beat them, join them"" approach. However, that remains a challenge in itself as it regularly ends in embarrassment and defeat. But what is the expert advice on what causes this gaming gap and how can it be bridged? Building skills acquired in games like Minecraft can be combined with combat in Fortnite Dr Dayna Galloway, head of the division of games and arts at Abertay University, said there were a number of factors at play. ""Firstly, I'd hazard a guess that your son has more free time than you, and can spend more time either playing the game, or obsessing over strategies and tips to refine techniques that lead to increased chances of success,"" he said. ""Secondly, at 48, you may no longer be the target audience for the games you are getting 'out-performed' in. ""If you're anything like me - building AND shooting isn't easy, but for a 12-year-old exposed to Minecraft at a young age, it isn't an issue."" Dr Dayna Galloway said 48-year-olds might not be the target audience for many games Dr Galloway said a third issue was being able to spot threats from a distance which could be just a few pixels on a screen and age did play a part. ""I'd encourage playing on a Saturday afternoon in a well-lit room, instead of playing at 10pm with tired eyes after a busy day at work,"" he suggested. Online gaming tries its best to pit you against people with similar ability levels But what about the decline from your game-playing peak? ""Again, you had time to master these games in your youth,"" said Dr Galloway. ""More often than not, you'd also be playing against the computer, or friend in the same room."" He said online gaming had changed things and while developers tried to ensure things were balanced it remained ""very challenging"" to match people of similar abilities. ""In Fortnite, you are being dropped into the same game as 99 other players, so the odds of them all being the same skillset as you is highly unlikely,"" he said. However, all is not lost, he suggested. Using customisation and accessibility features to your advantage, rather than accepting default settings may help. So is there anything you can do to level that playing field? ""Yes - copy what young people (and some older people) do,"" said Dr Galloway. He said using community forums or watching other gamers on Twitch and Youtube could help develop strategies and tactics. ""You can also level the playing field a little by trying to ensure your technology setup is the same as other players,"" he said. ""So consider buying a surround sound headset so you can locate enemies before you see them."" And how worried should we be about the amount of time our children spend playing games anyway? ""Anything taken to obsessive levels by children should be a cause for concern to parents,"" said Dr Galloway. ""A child can get 'addicted' to playing football, playing videogames, watching TV, reading books etc. ""What is important is that the parent shows an interest in the activity the child is happy to immerse themselves in, and limits the duration of their engagement to appropriate healthy levels."" One part of that, he said, was joining them in the gaming world. ""So, play along with your child, show them the games you played in your youth, and have discussions about the content of games and the experiences they have within them,"" he said. ""Many games consoles and games also have fantastic parental controls - so you can set things up in a way to ensure the maximum degree of safety for your child's online activity. ""You can also limit play sessions and game access to particular times of the day if you need to establish or intervene and re-establish a specific level of engagement. ""It's also important to broaden the menu for play - so encourage your child to seek out new genres of games, participate in different sports and be open to new activities - and the best way to do this is to lead by example.""

Chuckle Brothers' brothers pay tribute,"Barry Chuckle (left) with brother Paul in 1996 Before finding fame as a duo, The Chuckle Brothers started as a four-piece with two older brothers. Brian and Jimmy have been speaking about the death of Barry Chuckle, who was known for starring in TV shows like Chucklevision with fourth brother Paul. ""He was a wonderful lad and a great comedian,"" Jimmy told BBC News. ""It's been a wonderful life together."" Tributes have been paidfor Barry, 73, who had been suffering from cancer for the past year, according to Jimmy. Jimmy (left) and Brian Patton in 1974 ""We're all a very close family,"" said Jimmy, who saw Barry for the last time on Friday. ""My wife and I went round to see him and he was really poorly. It was really sad to see him because he was such a lively, fun-loving boy."" Jimmy and Brian appeared regularly with their brothers on Chucklevision, and were known for their catchphrases ""no slacking!"" and ""get out of it!"" Barry Chuckle's career in pictures Tinchy Stryder's tribute to Barry Chuckle They shed light on the birth of The Chuckle Brothers. All four followed in the footsteps of their father Jimmy Elliott, who went into showbusiness as a comedian, whistler and singer under the stage name Gene Patton. Brian said Barry was ""a great comic"", adding: ""He picked up all things from everywhere including dad. He was the one who really looked like dad."" Jimmy and Brian were born in 1931 and '33 respectively and formed their own double act - The Patton Brothers. Barry and Paul were much younger, born in 1944 and '47. Jimmy said: ""We used to go and watch dad touring, and then Barry and Paul used to watch us in summer seasons when they were tiny little fellas, and they said they wanted to do this. We were a lovely happy family."" This video can not be played ""To me, to you"" - watch Barry Chuckle, left, in this ChuckleVision moment from 2006 In the late 1970s, an agent suggested all four brothers do an act together. ""So we found a name - the four Chuckle Brothers - and we did television shows together like 3-2-1, The Good Old Days and The Lennie and Jerry Show."" Jimmy and Brian had already been performing as The Patton Brothers and when pantomime season came around, they realised they couldn't stay together as a quartet. ""So the lads [Barry and Paul] said, 'Do you mind if we keep the name?'"" Jimmy recalled. ""And we said, 'Of course not.' So they kept the name The Chuckle Brothers and Brian and I - The Patton Brothers - carried on with our pantos and we all did great."" When Barry and Paul shot to fame on TV in the 1980s, they brought their older brothers along. Jimmy said: ""When they got their break on Chucklevision, they said, 'Oh you must come and do some parts on it', which we did. Me and Brian both had a wonderful 20-odd years in Chucklevision with them, thanks to them. ""We used to travel in a camper van all over when we did the Chucklevision stage tour, which we did for years and years. We travelled in the camper van and we all played cards together. ""That was great fun. Full of laughs, it was, all the way."" 'To me, to you!' What makes a great double act? Barry and Paul had recently returned to TV with a new show Chuckle Time. A spokeswoman for Channel 5 said the remaining episodes would be broadcast next year as planned. A statement said: ""Channel 5 is saddened to hear of the passing of Barry Chuckle. ""As one half of the Chuckle Brothers, Barry entertained audiences over a career spanning decades; more recently, Chuckle Time was a teatime family treat on our channel.

Tree flowers for first time in 100 years,"The flowers' appearance is thought to be the result of a cold winter followed by heatwave conditions A rare Chinese tree in Cardiff has flowered for the first time since it was planted more than 100 years ago. The creamy-white flowers on Roath Park's Emmenopterys henryi are thought to be the result of a cold winter followed by heatwave conditions. Botanist Ernest Wilson introduced the species to Europe in 1907, with the first known flowering in Italy in 1971.

Dave and Gold return to Virgin MediaChannels such as Dave and Gold are being restored after the two companies resolved a fees dispute.Entertainment & Arts,"Comedy panel show Taskmaster is among the programmes returning to Virgin Media customers' TVs Television channels such as Dave and Gold are returning to the screens of Virgin Media customers after a fees dispute with UKTV was resolved. Virgin Media said that free-to-air channels had already been restored, with paid channels following shortly. Virgin had previously refused to pay what it called ""inflated"" fees and complained that it was not allowed to show all channels on demand. More than five times as much on-demand content will now be available, it said. About four million subscribers of the cable company lost access to 10 UKTV channels in July after talks broke down, disappointing fans of shows such as Taskmaster and Red Dwarf as well as classic comedies like Only Fools and Horses and Miranda. UKTV, which is part-owned by the BBC, had said it could not accept the ""drastic"" price cuts proposed by Virgin Media. Cable customers lost five free-to-air channels - Dave, Drama, Really and Yesterday - as well as the paid-for services Gold, Alibi, Eden, Good Food and W. A Virgin Media spokesman said the paid-for channels, which took longer to restore for ""technical reasons"", would reappear over the next few days. The new agreement increases the number of catch-up hours available, with customers on the top-tier Full House plan gaining access to ""significantly more"" boxsets, the company said. It also adds access to HD versions of Dave and Gold for customers on the cheaper Virgin Mix plans. David Bouchier, chief digital entertainment officer at Virgin Media said: ""We are sorry for what we know has been a frustrating time for our customers, but are pleased that our TV bundles are now even bigger."" Customers on social media welcomed the return of their favourite shows and channels, but some said they had already switched TV provider during the shutdown. Allow Twitter content?

Daring mission to unlock Sun's mysteries,"This video can not be played Parker Solar Probe: How Nasa is trying to 'touch' the Sun A US space agency Nasa mission to send a satellite closer to the Sun than any before has been stood down. The Parker Solar Probe was set to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Saturday, but last-minute investigations have delayed it for 24 hours. It is now scheduled to blast off - on board the mammoth Delta-IV Heavy rocket - on Sunday morning. The probe is set to become the fastest-moving manmade object in history. The rocket was on the launch pad when the countdown clock was interrupted, as officials investigated an alarm. The vehicle had a weather window of 65 minutes to launch, but the time elapsed before the issue could be resolved. The probe aims to dip directly into our star's outer atmosphere, or corona. Its data promises to crack longstanding mysteries about the Sun's behaviour - assuming it can survive roasting temperatures above 1,000C. The Delta-IV Heavy rocket with the Parker Solar Probe onboard The Delta will hurl the probe into the inner Solar System, enabling the Nasa mission to zip past Venus in six weeks and make a first rendezvous with the Sun a further six weeks after that. Over the course of seven years, Parker will make 24 loops around our star to study the physics of the corona, the place where much of the important activity that affects the Earth seems to originate. The probe will dip inside this tenuous atmosphere, sampling conditions, and getting to just 6.16 million km (3.83 million miles) from the Sun's broiling ""surface"". ""I realise that might not sound that close, but imagine the Sun and the Earth were a metre apart. Parker Solar Probe would be just 4cm away from the Sun,"" explained Dr Nicky Fox, the British-born project scientist who is affiliated to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. ""It will also be the fastest man-made object ever, travelling at speeds of up to 430,000mph [690,000km/h] - New York to Tokyo in under a minute!"" she told BBC News. This video can not be played Parker scientist Dr Nicky Fox: ""Never before have we gone up and literally touched our star"" Parker will help us better understand how the Sun works. The star is constantly bombarding the Earth with charged particles and magnetic fields. This perpetual flow, or ""solar wind"", is responsible for generating the beautiful auroral lights that appear in polar skies, but there are some interactions that initiate much more troubling effects. The biggest outbursts from the Sun will rattle the Earth's magnetic field. In the process, communications may be disrupted, satellites can be knocked offline, and power grids will be vulnerable to electrical surges. Scientists try to forecast these ""storms"" and Parker promises new and valuable information to help them do that. The diffuse corona is only visible to us on Earth during a total solar eclipse Parker wants to get where the action is. The corona is a remarkable place. It's strangely hotter than the Sun's actual surface, or photosphere. While this can be 6,000 degrees, the outer atmosphere may reach temperatures of a few million degrees. The mechanisms that produce this super-heating are not fully understood. Artwork: Parker must always keep its heatshield pointed at the Sun Likewise, the corona is the place where the solar wind gets its big kick in speed, sweeping out across the Solar System at more than 500km/s (a million mph). Parker aims to solve these puzzles by directly sampling the corona's particle, magnetic and electric fields. A mission like Parker was first proposed 60 years ago, but it's only now that engineers have the technology available to keep a probe safe so close to the Sun. Nearly everything on the spacecraft must sit behind an 11.5cm-thick (4.5in) carbon-composite sunshield. This will maintain all parts behind the barrier at a tolerable 30C. The probe is solar-powered - obviously. But that in itself is a challenge because the solar cells will have to be moved into sunlight to work and they hate high temperatures. So, Parker's arrays will be water-cooled, with the onboard computer system constantly adjusting their position so that only the minimum surface area absolutely necessary to generate power is exposed beyond the shield. Autonomy is also crucial for this mission. Close to the Sun, the radio interference is intense, and Parker will be out of contact. The probe must manage any faults itself. Above all, it has to keep the shield always pointing at the Sun to avoid being destroyed. Parker has a high level of autonomy The European Space Agency has its own version of Parker. Solar Orbiter, or SolO as it's sometimes known, is undergoing final assembly and testing in the UK. It is expected to launch in 2020, arriving at its closest position to the Sun towards the end of Parker's planned seven years of operations. SolO will go to within 42 million km of the Sun's surface. That's further away than Parker but it will still need an impressive shield. Being at a more distant position, though, means SolO can do things Parker cannot - like look directly at the Sun. This enables the pair to do complementary science. ""Parker Solar Probe will get close and sit in - and make measurements of - the material coming off of the Sun. Meanwhile, Solar Orbiter, from its position, will make those measurements, too, but it will also be able to take pictures and it will be able to look at where the emissions are coming from,"" said Prof Lucie Green, from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory in the UK.

"Thousands flee advancing California wildfireEvacuation orders for 21,000 residents in Orange County are issued as flames threaten homes.US & Canada","Residents of Lake Elsinore are fleeing the advancing flames More than 21,000 people have been evacuated from the path of a fast-moving wildfire in Southern California. The mandatory evacuation orders were issued as the blaze, dubbed the Holy fire, threatened homes around Lake Elsinore in Riverside County. The fire, one of several across the state, has destroyed more than 19,000 acres of forest north of San Diego. Meanwhile, a man suspected of starting the Holy fire has appeared in court accused of arson. Forrest Clark made several outbursts during the hearing in Orange County, at times refusing to show his face, local media reported. His case was adjourned until 17 August and bail set at $1m (Â£783,000), at which point Mr Clark interjected: ""I can handle a million (dollars) right now, easily."" California wildfire 'largest in history' Eight images that reveal scale of California devastation The photos that explain the world's wildfires Mr Clark was arrested on Tuesday outside his cabin after a brief standoff with officers. Authorities say he intentionally started the fire on Monday after a decade-long dispute with neighbours. According to Orange County officials, Mr Clark had emailed the local volunteer fire chief to threaten ""this place will burn"". Forrest Clark, 51, is accused of starting the fire after a long dispute with neighbours The BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles says high temperatures, gusty winds and tinder dry brush have fuelled the disaster in Orange County. Steep, inaccessible terrain has hampered crews tackling the Holy fire and the blaze was only 10% contained on Friday. Experts warn that worsening weather conditions, with thunderstorms in the forecast, could lead to ""extreme fire behaviour"" over the next few days, he adds. The US National Weather Service says smoke from weeks of California wildfires, and others burning in the western US, has drifted over a vast area, affecting air quality ""across the northern Rockies into western and central Canada and south over the northern Plains"". Firefighting aircraft are dropping fire retardant around Lake Elsinore More than 600 firefighters are battling the Holy fire, which is one of at least 18 wildfires raging across California. The Mendocino Complex fire has been declared the largest in state history and has already engulfed 290,692 acres. Fire chiefs say they expect it to burn for the rest of the month. Another blaze - the Carr fire, further north - has killed at least seven people and destroyed more than 1,500 structures. On Friday it was declared 51% under control. Across the state, at least 14,000 firefighters are struggling to contain the multiple outbreaks. The crews have been boosted by US army personnel and more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates - who are considered low-risk offenders - work on a volunteer basis but also receive $2 (Â£1.50) a day, plus $1 an hour. Fire crews from Australia and New Zealand have also flown over to share their expertise in battling bush fires.

Stolen plane closes Seattle airport,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons An airline employee who stole an empty passenger plane from Seattle airport has crashed on a nearby island. Authorities said the man had made ""an unauthorised take-off"" late on Friday local time, forcing Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to close. Two F15 fighter jets pursued the plane, which crashed in Puget Sound. The man is not believed to have survived. The local sheriff's office said it was ""not a terrorist incident"", adding that the man was local and aged 29. Pierce County SheriffPaul Pastor later told reporters it appeared to be ""a joyride gone terribly wrong"",external, according to ABC7 News, adding ""most terrorists don't do loops over the water"". The 76-seat, twin-engine turboprop Bombardier Q400, belonging to Alaska Airlines' sister carrier Horizon Air, took off from Seattle-Tacoma at about 20:00 local time (03:00 GMT). Ben Schaechter was on a plane which was apparently taxiing down the runway as the stolen plane took off. ""Okay this insane,"" he tweeted.,external""A pilot on the plane in front of us just went rogue and took off on an empty plane bypassing orders from the tower. The tower ordered a full stop and they're trying to communicate with that pilot. Whaaaaaat!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) issued a statement on Saturday morning saying that the two F15s were launched from Portland to intercept. A number of videos showed them following the passenger plane, which was flying in an erratic manner. Norad said the F15s were ""working to redirect the aircraft out over the Pacific Ocean when it crashed on the southern tip of Ketron island"", about 30 miles (48km) south of the airport. ""Norad fighters did not fire upon the aircraft,"" it said. Sheriff Pastor told KIRO7 news station in Seattle the man had most likely been killed in the crash. It isn't immediately clear. However, an audio recording of the conversations he had with air traffic control give some insight into what happened after the Horizon Air employee took off. In the recording, the man can be heard starting to worry about how much fuel he has on board. He also suggests he could land the aircraft by himself because he had played ""some video games"". ""This is probably jail time for life, huh?"" he asks the controller. ""I would hope it is for a guy like me."" ""Oh, Richard. We're not going to worry or think about that. But could you start a left turn please?"" the controller says. The man, who is referred to by what is believed to be his first name, also discusses: The co-ordinates foran orca carrying her dead calf on her backwhich featured in the news last week Looking at the view and possibly going to look at the Olympic Mountains, in Washington State The risk of being ""roughed up"" if he lands at a military base which he fears will have ""anti-aircraft missiles"" If he can do a barrel roll before landing and ""calling it a night"" Whether or not Alaska Airlines would give him a job after a successful landing The Seattle Times describes the man as sounding ""carefree and wild"",external. However, the tone changed later in the conversation. ""I've got a lot of people that care about me,"" he said. ""It's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologise to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it, until now."" Eyewitness John Waldron told CNN he watched the plane do ""a complete loop"", before it went ""pretty much straight up. And kind of at an angle. And almost stalled the aircraft"". ""Somehow he got it levelled back off,"" he told the broadcaster. ""And then made his way down toward the island."" At one point, he estimated, the plane was no more than 100ft (30.5m) above the water. The plane flew very low to the water Leah Morse, who filmed the plane flying overhead, told news agency Reuters she felt in her ""gut something was wrong"" after spotting the plane. Ms Morse's mother, who lives closer to the area where the plane went down, said her whole house shook. ""We saw the jets circle back after and she texted that there was no plane,"" she added. Alaska Airlines said the plane was taken from a ""maintenance position""in the airport. However, how it came to be on the runway is unclear. Planes of this size do not come with keys, aviation safety investigator David Gleave, of Loughborough University, explained to the BBC. But after he managed to start the plane, taking off and flying it around would not have been that difficult, Mr Gleave said.

'Stolen' plane closes Seattle airport,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons An airline employee who stole an empty passenger plane from Seattle airport has crashed on a nearby island. Authorities said the man had made ""an unauthorised take-off"" late on Friday local time, forcing Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to close. Two F15 fighter jets pursued the plane, which crashed in Puget Sound. The man is not believed to have survived. The local sheriff's office said it was ""not a terrorist incident"", adding that the man was local and aged 29. Pierce County SheriffPaul Pastor later told reporters it appeared to be ""a joyride gone terribly wrong"",external, according to ABC7 News, adding ""most terrorists don't do loops over the water"". The 76-seat, twin-engine turboprop Bombardier Q400, belonging to Alaska Airlines' sister carrier Horizon Air, took off from Seattle-Tacoma at about 20:00 local time (03:00 GMT). Ben Schaechter was on a plane which was apparently taxiing down the runway as the stolen plane took off. ""Okay this insane,"" he tweeted.,external""A pilot on the plane in front of us just went rogue and took off on an empty plane bypassing orders from the tower. The tower ordered a full stop and they're trying to communicate with that pilot. Whaaaaaat!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) issued a statement on Saturday morning saying that the two F15s were launched from Portland to intercept. A number of videos showed them following the passenger plane, which was flying in an erratic manner. Norad said the F15s were ""working to redirect the aircraft out over the Pacific Ocean when it crashed on the southern tip of Ketron island"", about 30 miles (48km) south of the airport. ""Norad fighters did not fire upon the aircraft,"" it said. Sheriff Pastor told KIRO7 news station in Seattle the man had most likely been killed in the crash. It isn't immediately clear. However, an audio recording of the conversations he had with air traffic control give some insight into what happened after the Horizon Air employee took off. In the recording, the man can be heard starting to worry about how much fuel he has on board. He also suggests he could land the aircraft by himself because he had played ""some video games"". ""This is probably jail time for life, huh?"" he asks the controller. ""I would hope it is for a guy like me."" ""Oh, Richard. We're not going to worry or think about that. But could you start a left turn please?"" the controller says. The man, who is referred to by what is believed to be his first name, also discusses: The co-ordinates foran orca carrying her dead calf on her backwhich featured in the news last week Looking at the view and possibly going to look at the Olympic Mountains, in Washington State The risk of being ""roughed up"" if he lands at a military base which he fears will have ""anti-aircraft missiles"" If he can do a barrel roll before landing and ""calling it a night"" Whether or not Alaska Airlines would give him a job after a successful landing The Seattle Times describes the man as sounding ""carefree and wild"",external. However, the tone changed later in the conversation. ""I've got a lot of people that care about me,"" he said. ""It's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologise to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it, until now."" Eyewitness John Waldron told CNN he watched the plane do ""a complete loop"", before it went ""pretty much straight up. And kind of at an angle. And almost stalled the aircraft"". ""Somehow he got it levelled back off,"" he told the broadcaster. ""And then made his way down toward the island."" At one point, he estimated, the plane was no more than 100ft (30.5m) above the water. The plane flew very low to the water Leah Morse, who filmed the plane flying overhead, told news agency Reuters she felt in her ""gut something was wrong"" after spotting the plane. Ms Morse's mother, who lives closer to the area where the plane went down, said her whole house shook. ""We saw the jets circle back after and she texted that there was no plane,"" she added. Alaska Airlines said the plane was taken from a ""maintenance position""in the airport. However, how it came to be on the runway is unclear. Planes of this size do not come with keys, aviation safety investigator David Gleave, of Loughborough University, explained to the BBC. But after he managed to start the plane, taking off and flying it around would not have been that difficult, Mr Gleave said.

Romanian police clash with protesters,"Tens of thousands of Romanians, including returning expats, have joined the protests Police have clashed with tens of thousands of anti-government protesters across Romania. Between 30,000 and 50,000 people, including many returning expats, turned out nationwide, media reports say. Some protesters in the capital Bucharest threw bottles and paving slabs, while police used tear gas, pepper spray and even a water cannon. Around 100 protesters needed medical attention and 10 police were injured, emergency services said. A group of protesters tried to break into the government building in Bucharest, but were held back by the police security cordon. Others waved EU and Romanian flags, banged drums and chanted slogans. The protesters demand the resignation of the government, objecting to the perceived efforts to weaken the judiciary by the governing Social Democrats (PSD), as well as low wages and entrenched corruption in the country. Police clashed with protesters across the country Authorities used tear gas, pepper spray and water cannon to try to quell the demonstrations Read more about Romania Protests have been building against the PSD for months. In July, President Klaus Iohannis approved the dismissal of anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi, who had been leading investigations into local and national politicians for graft. President Iohannis had been under extensive pressure from the PSD government to agree to her removal. Around 150,000 gathered in Bucharest last yearafter the government passed a decree that could free those jailed on corruption charges. Many expat Romanians also returned to take part. Ileana Anghel travelled all the way from her home in Spain with her husband to take part. ""We want to see modern roads and schools and above all to not have to pay bribes to the left and right,"" she told AFP. Sixty-year-old Vlad flew back to Romania from New York, his home of 30 years. ""Corruption and embezzlement, which profit the ruling class, are what bothers me,"" Vlad told the same news agency. According to the World Bank, up to a quarter of the Romanian population - between three and five million people - live and work abroad, sending back around $5bn (Â£3.9bn) to one of the EU's least developed countries.

Thousands flee advancing California wildfire,"Residents of Lake Elsinore are fleeing the advancing flames More than 21,000 people have been evacuated from the path of a fast-moving wildfire in Southern California. The mandatory evacuation orders were issued as the blaze, dubbed the Holy fire, threatened homes around Lake Elsinore in Riverside County. The fire, one of several across the state, has destroyed more than 19,000 acres of forest north of San Diego. Meanwhile, a man suspected of starting the Holy fire has appeared in court accused of arson. Forrest Clark made several outbursts during the hearing in Orange County, at times refusing to show his face, local media reported. His case was adjourned until 17 August and bail set at $1m (Â£783,000), at which point Mr Clark interjected: ""I can handle a million (dollars) right now, easily."" California wildfire 'largest in history' Eight images that reveal scale of California devastation The photos that explain the world's wildfires Mr Clark was arrested on Tuesday outside his cabin after a brief standoff with officers. Authorities say he intentionally started the fire on Monday after a decade-long dispute with neighbours. According to Orange County officials, Mr Clark had emailed the local volunteer fire chief to threaten ""this place will burn"". Forrest Clark, 51, is accused of starting the fire after a long dispute with neighbours The BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles says high temperatures, gusty winds and tinder dry brush have fuelled the disaster in Orange County. Steep, inaccessible terrain has hampered crews tackling the Holy fire and the blaze was only 10% contained on Friday. Experts warn that worsening weather conditions, with thunderstorms in the forecast, could lead to ""extreme fire behaviour"" over the next few days, he adds. The US National Weather Service says smoke from weeks of California wildfires, and others burning in the western US, has drifted over a vast area, affecting air quality ""across the northern Rockies into western and central Canada and south over the northern Plains"". Firefighting aircraft are dropping fire retardant around Lake Elsinore More than 600 firefighters are battling the Holy fire, which is one of at least 18 wildfires raging across California. The Mendocino Complex fire has been declared the largest in state history and has already engulfed 290,692 acres. Fire chiefs say they expect it to burn for the rest of the month. Another blaze - the Carr fire, further north - has killed at least seven people and destroyed more than 1,500 structures. On Friday it was declared 51% under control. Across the state, at least 14,000 firefighters are struggling to contain the multiple outbreaks. The crews have been boosted by US army personnel and more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates - who are considered low-risk offenders - work on a volunteer basis but also receive $2 (Â£1.50) a day, plus $1 an hour. Fire crews from Australia and New Zealand have also flown over to share their expertise in battling bush fires.

Ex-Scottish Labour leader condemns Corbyn,"Jim Murphy led Scottish Labour from December 2014 to June 2015 A former Scottish Labour leader has criticised Jeremy Corbyn for what he regards as the party's failure to root out anti-semitism. In an unusual move, Jim Murphy paid fora full page advert in the Jewish Telegraph,externalto highlight his concerns. The ex-East Renfrewshire MP's article appears on page three of the paper under the headline ""In sorrow and anger - an apology."" UK Labour said they would not be commenting on the advert. Mr Murphy, who led Scottish Labour to a disastrous election result in 2015, said the current Labour leadership had done so much to damage its relationship with British Jewry. He also accused Mr Corbyn and his top team of being ""intellectually arrogant, emotionally inept and politically maladroit"". Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. Recently, the focus has been on a new code of conduct the party has adopted on anti-Semitism, with critics concerned that it does not go as far as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) guidelines. A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies have accused the Labour leader of ""ideological hostility"" to the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and its 11 examples. While Labour's code has adopted the definition, it is argued that this does not include four of the examples. However, Labour said it had ""expanded and contextualised"" the IHRA examples to provide ""legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"".

Pavement trips cost councils Â£2.1m,"More than 10,000 people claimed they were injured on uneven pavements Pedestrians were awarded at least Â£2.1m in compensation after tripping on pavements in the past year, research has revealed. The AA found that 10,572 people made claims against local councils, but only 859 - just 8% - were successful. While some councils paid compensation on more than 75% of claims, others made no payouts despite hundreds of claims. Councils blamed ""decades of underfunding by successive governments"" for their damaged pavements. The AA received responses to Freedom of Information Act requests from 365 out of 421 UK local authorities. They revealed that there had been received 10,572 compensation claims for accidents on the pavement in the 12 months before May 2018. Hillingdon Council in west London had the highest number of payouts, with 115 of 148 claimants (78%) receiving compensation and the council facing a bill of Â£346,596. But Liverpool City Council managed to decline all of its 448 claims, and did not make any payouts. Only one place reported no claims at all: the Shetland Islands. A separate AA survey of 16,000 motorists found that 73% were concerned about uneven pavements and nearly two-thirds have come across paths encroached by overgrown trees and hedges. AA president Edmund King said being a pedestrian can be ""like negotiating a minefield"", undermining the government's efforts to encourage people to walk instead of using the car. ""The state of the pavements means walkers are expected to run the gauntlet of pavement hazards that are just as dangerous as the potholes that can injure or kill cyclists and damage cars,"" he said. A spokesman for the Local Government Association - which represents councils in England and Wales - said councils did a ""huge amount"" to maintain pavements with limited resources.

Trump tariff move pushes Turkish lira down,"The two men spoke on the sidelines of a Nato summit in Brussels last month President Donald Trump has doubled US tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, as the precipitous fall of the Turkish lira accelerates. In a tweet,,externalMr Trump said the currency was weak against ""our very strong dollar"", adding that ""US relations with Turkey are not good at this time"". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech that the drop was part of a ""campaign"" led by foreign powers. Turkey also warned it would retaliate against the US tariffs move. ""The United States should know that the only result that such sanctions and pressure will bring... will be harming our relationship as allies,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. The two Nato members are at odds on a range of issues - how to fight the Islamic State group, Ankara's plans to buy Russian missile defence systems and how to punish the alleged plotters of a failed coup in Turkey in 2016. Most recently, President Trump issued sanctions on top Turkish officials over the ongoing detention of a US pastor who is facing terror and espionage charges in Turkey. In the past 24 hours, the lira has lost around 20% of its value. It had already fallen more than 40% in the past year. Turkey's lira slump explained Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis? In a televised speech on Friday, President Erdogan called on citizens to exchange foreign currency and gold for lira, calling it an ""economic war"". ""This is a domestic and national struggle,"" he said, as the lira continued to fall. Mr Erdogan addressed the currency decline earlier on Friday In a veiled attack on the US he added: ""Some countries have engaged in behaviour that protects coup plotters and knows no laws or justice."" ""Relations with countries who behave like this have reached a point beyond salvaging."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After he spoke, Mr Trump tweeted that aluminium tariffs ""with respect to Turkey"" would be raised to 20% and steel to 50%. The reaction from global currency markets to the rift caused the euro to slump to a 13-month low and pushed the dollar to a one-year high. Turks in Ankara examine the fluctuating exchange rate at a currency exchange shop The Turkish trade ministry responded that the additional tariffs were against the rules of the World Trade Organization. ""Turkey expects other member countries to abide by international rules,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding that the US remained an important trade partner. Analysis by Selin Girit, BBC News, Istanbul It has been a dramatic day in Turkey but the Turkish government has put on a brave face. President Erdogan said: ""If they have dollars, we have our people, we have our right and we have Allah"" - rhetoric that goes down well with his supporters but not necessarily with international markets. Some will adhere his call to exchange their dollars, euros or gold for Turkish lira but many others have started feeling the squeeze. Interest rate hikes, which Mr Erdogan sees as the mother of all evils, are not very likely to happen. President Erdogan may seek help from the IMF, following the example of Argentina, but that is not likely either as it would have strings attached, and would be frowned upon in Turkey. There is a feeling that the quickest and most efficient step could be to ease the tensions with Washington. Shortly after Mr Trump's tweet, Mr Erdogan spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A statement from the Kremlin said the two leaders had discussed economic and trade ties. Pastor Andrew Brunson was moved to house arrest last month due to health issues Officials from Mr Erdogan's office said the two men had ""expressed pleasure"" that relations between Turkey and Russia were progressing ""positively"" amid joint defence and energy projects. Friday's developments are the latest manifestation of growing differences between the two sides on a number of issues. Earlier this month, theWhite House hit Turkey's justice and interior ministers with sanctionsover the country's ongoing detention of an American pastor. Turkey is accusing Andrew Brunson - who operates a small church in Izmir - of having links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for the failed coup. He had been held in prison for almost two years, but was recently moved to house arrest due to health issues. Turkish carpet-makers dry out their wares American evangelicals have rallied to his cause, triggering the recent reaction from the Trump White House. Turkish officials have been in Washington this week for talks on his release but these seemed to fall apart in recent days. Last month, Mr Trump took to Twitter to threaten sanctions on Turkey if Mr Brunson was not released. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US has also been refusing to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric and former Erdogan ally who has been living in the US state of Pennsylvania. Turkey accuses him of leading the attempted ""Gulenist"" coup. In addition, Turkish politicians are furious at American military support for Kurdish militia fighting the so-called Islamic State in northern Syria. Mr Trump's rejection of the Iran nuclear deal has also been a point of contention between the two nations. Turkey has urged the US to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen Half of Turkey's oil imports come from Iran. Therefore the re-imposition of US sanctions against Iran has been seen by economists as likely to harm the Turkish economy. Then there is the Incirlik Air Base, which Nato has used extensively in the fight against IS. There has been some domestic pressure on Mr Erdogan to close the base, and last week a group of pro-government Turkish lawyers filed charges against US soldiers stationed there. They request that a judge temporarily block all flights out of the base, and that arrest warrants be issued for the group of American officers, who they claim played a role in the coup attempt.

EU settles dispute over major weedkiller,"Crop-spraying in Meteren, northern France: glyphosate can have a big impact on biodiversity EU countries have voted to renew the licence of glyphosate, a widely used weedkiller at the centre of environmental concerns. The proposal at the EU Commission's Appeal Committee received 18 votes in favour and nine against, with one abstention, ending months of deadlock. The Commission says the new five-year licence will be ready before the current one expires on 15 December. However, France plans to ban the use of glyphosate within three years. In a tweet, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had ordered a ban,externalon the use of glyphosate in France ""as soon as alternatives are found, and within three years at the latest"". Glyphosate is marketed as Roundup by the US agrochemical giant Monsanto. One UN study called the chemical ""probably carcinogenic"", but other scientists said it was safe to use. The UK was among the states in favour of glyphosate renewal. Germany and Poland were also among them - though they had previously abstained. France and Belgium were among the states that voted against. Portugal abstained. The EU Commission says the current proposal on the weedkiller ""enjoys the broadest possible support by the member states while ensuring a high level of protection of human health and the environment"". Glyphosate was introduced by Monsanto in 1974, but its patent expired in 2000, and now the chemical is sold by various manufacturers. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer in humans. Monsanto's Roundup, based on glyphosate, has been sold worldwide Critics say widespread use of glyphosate reduces biodiversity, by killing plants that are essential for many insects and other animals. Some countries and regions have banned glyphosate use in public parks and gardens. Its effect on plants is non-selective, meaning it will kill most of them when applied.

The disruption prevents plants from making certain proteins needed for their growth. The ""shikimate pathway"" involves seven enzymes, which enable the plant to form amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The pathway is not found in animals. Some crops, such as soybean, have been genetically modified to resist glyphosate. Farmers spray it on fields before their crops emerge in spring, so the crops do not have to compete with weeds. Some also use it as a pre-harvest treatment to dry out crops and make them easier to harvest. TheUK Soil Association says such use is risky,external, as it can increase glyphosate residues in food. It is described as the world's most popular weedkiller. In the US, more than 750 products contain it. Glyphosate use worldwide has risen almost 15-fold since 1996, when so-called ""Roundup Ready"" crops, genetically engineered to resist glyphosate, were introduced. A 2016 study by Environmental Sciences Europe,externalnotes growing concern about intensive glyphosate use, because some plants have developed resistance to it - meaning that farmers tend to use even more of the herbicide. Sri Lanka banned use of glyphosate in 2015 - though the tea industry opposes the ban. In 2015 too Colombia stopped aerial spraying of glyphosate - even though it had been used widely to kill illegal coca plants. Glyphosate's toxicity is reckoned to be low, in the concentrations used by farmers, although the UN International Agency for Research on Cancer called it ""probably carcinogenic"". The European Commission says,externalthat besides EFSA, the European Chemicals Agency and other scientific bodies found no link to cancer in humans. The Soil Association says glyphosate traces are regularly found in bread. According to the US National Pesticide Information Center, the chemical mostly passes through the body quickly in urine and faeces.

UK 'will support' pesticide ban,"An extended ban on controversial neonicotinoid pesticides will be supported by the UK, Environment Secretary Michael Gove says. The UK has previously resisted tighter restrictions on the pesticides, saying there was insufficient evidence. Mr Gove says that's no longer the case. Environmentalists have long said neonicotinoids are harming pollinators. But the UK government has generally backed the farmers' view that the chemicals are safe. It was overruled in 2013 when the EU banned three types of neonicotinoid pesticides for most uses in the fields. The European Commission now wants to extend that ban to all uses of ""neonics"" except for in greenhouses. This time Mr Gove says the UK won't object in principle. He'll wait to see the exact wording of the proposal but he agrees the science now suggests that the pesticides could be harming pollinators. ""The weight of evidence now shows the risks neonicotinoids pose to our environment, particularly to the bees and other pollinators which play such a key part in our Â£100bn food industry, is greater than previously understood,"" said Mr Gove. ""I believe this justifies further restrictions on their use. We cannot afford to put our pollinator populations at risk."" ""I recognise the impact further restrictions will have on farmers and I am keen to work with them to explore alternative approaches both now and as we design a new agricultural policy outside the European Union."" Mr Gove says he'll impose the same standards on neonicotinoids after Brexit. The decision comes at a time of heightened concern about a steep drop in the number of insects in the countryside. Mr Gove has confirmed to the BBC that he will resist an attempt in the EU to restrict the use of the weedkiller glyphosate, which is said by some scientists to be potentially harmful to humans.

Why can't I beat my 12-year-old at computer games?Chuckle Brothers' brothers pay tributeTree flowers for first time in 100 yearsSeal found in field 17 miles from sea,"Fortnite is an online game in which players fight it out for survival An expert recently advised parents to play computer games along with their children - but have they any hope of winning? According to William Shakespeare: ""Cowards die many times before their deaths."" If he had been alive today, he could have added that the middle-aged computer gamer dies with even greater regularity. Every day, as I try to recapture the skills of my youth, I suffer the ignominy of being repeatedly blasted out of virtual existence, probably by a primary school pupil. Then, as I grudgingly hand over the console controller to my 12-year-old son, I watch as he makes it all look so easy. The gamers you can pay to help you win at Fortnite Fortnite 'not addictive' says researcher Schools 'could learn from Fortnite' The latest field of despair has come in the form of Fortnite - an online fight for survival that has left me tearing out the little hair I have left. It is a game which has caused some concern among parents over the time their children spend playing it and the potential for addiction. That prompted one expert to advise adopting an ""if you can't beat them, join them"" approach. However, that remains a challenge in itself as it regularly ends in embarrassment and defeat. But what is the expert advice on what causes this gaming gap and how can it be bridged? Building skills acquired in games like Minecraft can be combined with combat in Fortnite Dr Dayna Galloway, head of the division of games and arts at Abertay University, said there were a number of factors at play. ""Firstly, I'd hazard a guess that your son has more free time than you, and can spend more time either playing the game, or obsessing over strategies and tips to refine techniques that lead to increased chances of success,"" he said. ""Secondly, at 48, you may no longer be the target audience for the games you are getting 'out-performed' in. ""If you're anything like me - building AND shooting isn't easy, but for a 12-year-old exposed to Minecraft at a young age, it isn't an issue."" Dr Dayna Galloway said 48-year-olds might not be the target audience for many games Dr Galloway said a third issue was being able to spot threats from a distance which could be just a few pixels on a screen and age did play a part. ""I'd encourage playing on a Saturday afternoon in a well-lit room, instead of playing at 10pm with tired eyes after a busy day at work,"" he suggested. Online gaming tries its best to pit you against people with similar ability levels But what about the decline from your game-playing peak? ""Again, you had time to master these games in your youth,"" said Dr Galloway. ""More often than not, you'd also be playing against the computer, or friend in the same room."" He said online gaming had changed things and while developers tried to ensure things were balanced it remained ""very challenging"" to match people of similar abilities. ""In Fortnite, you are being dropped into the same game as 99 other players, so the odds of them all being the same skillset as you is highly unlikely,"" he said. However, all is not lost, he suggested. Using customisation and accessibility features to your advantage, rather than accepting default settings may help. So is there anything you can do to level that playing field? ""Yes - copy what young people (and some older people) do,"" said Dr Galloway. He said using community forums or watching other gamers on Twitch and Youtube could help develop strategies and tactics. ""You can also level the playing field a little by trying to ensure your technology setup is the same as other players,"" he said. ""So consider buying a surround sound headset so you can locate enemies before you see them."" And how worried should we be about the amount of time our children spend playing games anyway? ""Anything taken to obsessive levels by children should be a cause for concern to parents,"" said Dr Galloway. ""A child can get 'addicted' to playing football, playing videogames, watching TV, reading books etc. ""What is important is that the parent shows an interest in the activity the child is happy to immerse themselves in, and limits the duration of their engagement to appropriate healthy levels."" One part of that, he said, was joining them in the gaming world. ""So, play along with your child, show them the games you played in your youth, and have discussions about the content of games and the experiences they have within them,"" he said. ""Many games consoles and games also have fantastic parental controls - so you can set things up in a way to ensure the maximum degree of safety for your child's online activity. ""You can also limit play sessions and game access to particular times of the day if you need to establish or intervene and re-establish a specific level of engagement. ""It's also important to broaden the menu for play - so encourage your child to seek out new genres of games, participate in different sports and be open to new activities - and the best way to do this is to lead by example.""

Chuckle Brothers' brothers pay tributeTree flowers for first time in 100 yearsSeal found in field 17 miles from sea,"Barry Chuckle (left) with brother Paul in 1996 Before finding fame as a duo, The Chuckle Brothers started as a four-piece with two older brothers. Brian and Jimmy have been speaking about the death of Barry Chuckle, who was known for starring in TV shows like Chucklevision with fourth brother Paul. ""He was a wonderful lad and a great comedian,"" Jimmy told BBC News. ""It's been a wonderful life together."" Tributes have been paidfor Barry, 73, who had been suffering from cancer for the past year, according to Jimmy. Jimmy (left) and Brian Patton in 1974 ""We're all a very close family,"" said Jimmy, who saw Barry for the last time on Friday. ""My wife and I went round to see him and he was really poorly. It was really sad to see him because he was such a lively, fun-loving boy."" Jimmy and Brian appeared regularly with their brothers on Chucklevision, and were known for their catchphrases ""no slacking!"" and ""get out of it!"" Barry Chuckle's career in pictures Tinchy Stryder's tribute to Barry Chuckle They shed light on the birth of The Chuckle Brothers. All four followed in the footsteps of their father Jimmy Elliott, who went into showbusiness as a comedian, whistler and singer under the stage name Gene Patton. Brian said Barry was ""a great comic"", adding: ""He picked up all things from everywhere including dad. He was the one who really looked like dad."" Jimmy and Brian were born in 1931 and '33 respectively and formed their own double act - The Patton Brothers. Barry and Paul were much younger, born in 1944 and '47. Jimmy said: ""We used to go and watch dad touring, and then Barry and Paul used to watch us in summer seasons when they were tiny little fellas, and they said they wanted to do this. We were a lovely happy family."" This video can not be played ""To me, to you"" - watch Barry Chuckle, left, in this ChuckleVision moment from 2006 In the late 1970s, an agent suggested all four brothers do an act together. ""So we found a name - the four Chuckle Brothers - and we did television shows together like 3-2-1, The Good Old Days and The Lennie and Jerry Show."" Jimmy and Brian had already been performing as The Patton Brothers and when pantomime season came around, they realised they couldn't stay together as a quartet. ""So the lads [Barry and Paul] said, 'Do you mind if we keep the name?'"" Jimmy recalled. ""And we said, 'Of course not.' So they kept the name The Chuckle Brothers and Brian and I - The Patton Brothers - carried on with our pantos and we all did great."" When Barry and Paul shot to fame on TV in the 1980s, they brought their older brothers along. Jimmy said: ""When they got their break on Chucklevision, they said, 'Oh you must come and do some parts on it', which we did. Me and Brian both had a wonderful 20-odd years in Chucklevision with them, thanks to them. ""We used to travel in a camper van all over when we did the Chucklevision stage tour, which we did for years and years. We travelled in the camper van and we all played cards together. ""That was great fun. Full of laughs, it was, all the way."" 'To me, to you!' What makes a great double act? Barry and Paul had recently returned to TV with a new show Chuckle Time. A spokeswoman for Channel 5 said the remaining episodes would be broadcast next year as planned. A statement said: ""Channel 5 is saddened to hear of the passing of Barry Chuckle.

Seal found in field 17 miles from sea,"The seal ""looked as happy as Larry"" on the banks of the River Parrett A seal has been spotted ""lounging in the mud"" 17 miles (28km) from the sea in a field in Somerset. The animal, thought to be a harbour or common seal, was spotted basking in the sun on the Somerset Levels by nature photographer Carl Bovis on Sunday. Mr Bovis said it ""looked as happy as Larry"" on the banks of the River Parrett, despite being miles inland. The RSPCA said it probably followed the fish upstream but seals were ""usually capable of finding their way back"". The RSPCA said the wayward animal is a harbour or common seal Despite low water levels, it is thought to have swum up the River Parrett through Bridgwater and on to the Somerset Levels Mr Bovis, said he was messaged on Sunday by his friend Milly Burt claiming she had seen a seal in a field as she drove past. ""I thought 'what?' but when I went to where she said she'd seen it and came back down river, it was right in front of me,"" he said. ""I was amazed.  It was lounging on the mud beside the river and it saw me straight away but didn't seemed concerned or fussed.
