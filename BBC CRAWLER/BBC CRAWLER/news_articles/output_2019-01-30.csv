Barclays in billions of pounds Brexit move,"Barclays is moving â¬190bn (Â£166bn) of assets to Dublin because it ""cannot wait any longer"" to implement its Brexit contingency plan. The High Court, which has approved the move, says the move involves 5,000 clients. However, few jobs in London are expected to be affected. The business amounts to around 15% of the bank's Â£1.2 trillion in total assets and was previously conducted in the UK through branches across the EU. The plans will be in place by 29 March. The bank's Dublin operation is expected to double in size to 300 people as a result of the business being channelled though the Irish capital. Barclays in talks to expand Dublin office post-Brexit ""As we announced in 2017, Barclays will use our existing licensed EU-based bank subsidiary to continue to serve our clients within the EU beyond 29 March 2019, regardless of the outcome of Brexit,"" the bank said. ""Our preparations are well-advanced and we expect to be fully operational by 29 March 2019,"" it added. The bank had to ask the High Court for approval to transfer the business which took place in branches in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden for corporate banking, investment banking and some wealthy private clients. The judgement from Mr Justice Snowden said: ""Due to the continuing uncertainty over whether there might be a no-deal Brexit, the Barclays group has determined that it cannot wait any longer to implement the scheme"". The scheme is based on a ""no-deal"" Brexit, the judgement said. This envisages the parts of the bank's business which is affected  losing their ""passporting"" rights which currently allow them to conduct investment services activities in the remaining 27 EU member states. ""The design of the scheme has been based upon an assumption that there will be no favourable outcome of the current political negotiations between the UK and the EU as regards passporting or the grant of equivalence status to the UK in respect of financial services,"" the judgement said.

Leaders meet after PMQs clash,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clash over Brexit policies Jeremy Corbyn says he told Theresa May ""don't bring no deal back to Parliament"" in their long-awaited face-to-face meeting on Brexit. The Labour leader said it was ""not acceptable"" for the PM to keep the no-deal option on the table after MPs voted against it on Tuesday. After the meeting, Mrs May tweeted: ""The only way to avoid No Deal is to vote for a deal."" MPs will vote on the deal again after she seeks to renegotiate with the EU. Mr Corbyn said it was a ""serious"" meeting and Mrs May had ""listened"". He had refused to meet Mrs May unless she agreed to rule out a no-deal Brexit, but changed his mind after MPs voted against the idea of leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal on Tuesday evening. What could happen next? May scores 'unconventional win' Firms 'speeding up no-deal Brexit plans' Brexit: A really simple guide Labour MPs could face disciplinary action In her tweet, Mrs May said she had been ""pleased"" to meet Mr Corbyn and had stressed the importance of the UK doing its own trade deals after Brexit. A Labour spokesperson said the two would meet again ""soon"" after the 45 minutes of ""cordial"" talks in the prime minister's Commons office. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Corbyn said: ""I set out the Labour case for a comprehensive customs union with the European Union, in order to protect jobs and trade. ""She certainly understood the point that we were making."" He added: ""The last words I said to her were 'don't bring no deal back to Parliament' because it's not acceptable - it's not a sensible or serious way of going forward."" He said he was suspicious the government was trying to ""run down the clock"", and if that appeared to be the case when Parliament discussed Brexit again next month, Labour would ""look at all the options on the table at that time"". Asked if Labour would support or table a motion to try and extend Article 50, which would delay the date of Brexit, Mr Corbyn said: ""That is a question for 13 February."" He added that it was quite possible the prime minister would return to Parliament next month ""with nothing"".

Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The two party leaders earlier clashed over Brexit at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. During the exchange, Mr Corbyn said the prime minister may have succeeded in ""temporarily uniting her very divided party"" in Tuesday's votes on amendments to her plan, but she had to make ""more important compromises"" to ""unite the country"". Mrs May said Mr Corbyn was a ""fine one to talk about coming together"", when he had only now agreed to meet her. She said the majority of MPs had identified the Irish backstop as the main sticking point preventing them from backing her deal, whereas Mr Corbyn's Brexit proposals had been rejected. ""He has no plan for Brexit, no good plan for our economy and no plan for our country,"" she told MPs. This video can not be played Mr Corbyn: 'We are prepared to meet her to put forward the points of view from the Labour Party' MPs voted 317 to 301 in favour of changing the backstop plan - the section of Mrs May's deal with the EU designed to avoid the return of Northern Ireland border checks. Five amendments, including Labour MP Yvette Cooper's bid to delay Brexit if Mrs May does not get her deal through Parliament and Mr Corbyn's own amendment, were defeated on Tuesday. Mr Corbyn asked Mrs May whether, if she did not agree a deal with Brussels that MPs would support, she would back Labour's proposals for a ""a strong single market, comprehensive customs union and the guaranteeing of rights and protections rather than the alternative she has been threatening - to crash out with no-deal"". Mrs May told him: ""You cannot just vote to reject no deal, you have to support a deal."" It was a message she repeated to Labour MP Jack Dromey, who together with Tory MP Caroline Spelman got MPs to back a non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday. Later in the session, Nigel Dodds, leader of the Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, described remarks by the  Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on the UK's approach to Brexit as ""highly reckless and extremely dangerous"". Mr Coveney likened the UK's negotiating stance to ""either you give me what I want or I'm jumping out the window"". Mr Dodds said that kind of rhetoric needed ""to be toned down"". Mrs May said she will speak to Irish premier Leo Varadkar later on Wednesday. ""It is important for us to work with the Irish government on the arrangements that will be in place in the future,"" she added. But ahead of the call, Mr Varadkar told the Irish Parliament that the EU stood by the withdrawal agreement and renegotiation was not on the table. At the moment, the UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, with or without a deal. The UK and the EU negotiated their withdrawal agreement deal over the past 18 months but it needs to be backed by MPs for it to come into force. Earlier this month, MPs voted against the plan Mrs May had proposed by 432 votes to 202. Mrs May said that, after taking Tuesday's votes into account and talking to the EU, any revised deal would be brought back to the Commons ""as soon as possible"" for a second ""meaningful vote"".

A staring match of one against 27Laura Kuenssberg asks who will look away first in the Brexit stalemate - Theresa May or the EU?UK Politics,"There will be a hunt for a new idea. Some magic new solution that might - maybe, possibly - provide a sudden surprise solution to Brexit's conundrums, in the way exhausted pilgrims might fall jubilantly on the Holy grail proclaiming, at last, that its jewels are beyond compare and a world changing treasure is now in their heroic clutches. And yes, it is absolutely the case that different technical solutions will be explored again - whether they be ways of carving out potential technological solutions to managing the Irish border or additional paragraphs of legal language that could be constructed to suit all sides. EU rejects calls to reopen Brexit deal Drop no deal, Corbyn tells May at meeting Brexit deal bid 'running out of road' And, of course, in the next fortnight the government - and everyone in Westminster and in Brussels - will spend a lot of energy trying to work out which other possible ways of fixing the acute problem with the backstop could be done. Fundamentally though, our politicians have been staring at the same problem for more than two years. I'm reminded of how many months ago, during one of the other frenzies over how to ""solve"" the border issue, one official told me that, essentially, all that could really be done was to put the same words in a different order. The next fortnight's efforts will be a bit more complex than that, but they may prove the old adage: ""There is no such thing as an original idea."" Different ways of moving different promises or verbiage around, but a bold brand new solution no one's already thought of? Don't hold your breath. But the facts of the situation in their most simple way are the same. The UK is on course to leave the EU. That means the border on the island of Ireland becomes a border between a separate country and an enormous free trade area. Everyone promises they don't want to have anything like a traditional border - but no one can agree on how to avoid that. There is only one thing now that is certain to change, and that is the power of time. The hope may be misplaced, but the hope nonetheless on the UK side is that as the clock ticks down with no solution, eventually, the fear of the consequences of the UK leaving without a deal will concentrate minds. And the pressure of the approach of a deadline could in turn shift the politics. Because it is the desire of EU leaders to avoid the worst that will either salvage Theresa May's deal, or not. Her political drive to get this over the line will determine how radical or tough she is prepared to be. And for different EU leaders, their own calculations - which are, of course, driven by politics in their home countries, as well as the role of the EU - will shape whether they are willing to flex at all. Technical and legal rules and agreements are, of course, vitally important in all of this. But if there was an easy solution in policy and precedent, it perhaps would have been found by now. It feels like we are now entering into a final staring match, where politics - not policy - will decide who has to look away. The problem, as ever, for Theresa May is that she is one against 27 others.

'Day of reckoning' for special needs,"This video can not be played The colourful 'pods' helping special needs children go to school English councils have overspent by at least Â£324m on their budgets for young adults and children with special needs this financial year, the BBC has found. Of the 136 local authorities that provided information to the BBC under Freedom of Information laws, 123 have overspent on their high needs budget. The government says it is providing an extra Â£250m to ease pressures, and Â£100m on new school places. Funding has not kept pace with the growth in extra support, say councils. Some of these extra pressures have resulted from a legal change in 2014 which handed councils responsibility for young adults' special educational needs between the ages of 18 and 25. They were already responsible for under-18s. This change led to a growth in the number of college and university students and apprentices being supported. In Dorset, since 2014, the number of under-25s on education, health and care plans - which give a legal right to specialist support - has grown by more than two-thirds. This led to the high needs budget being overspent every year, and now a Â£13m deficit is predicted for the coming financial year. Dorset county councillor Andrew Parry, who is responsible for education, said the council had run out of options. ""It is a multi-million pound problem. Up to now it's been a case of drawing on reserves, reorganising budgets. ""But there is a breaking point. ""Dorset is not alone in recognising that day of reckoning will be coming very soon,"" he said. According to the information obtained from England's councils, 76 local authorities have shifted money from other education budgets to meet their obligations to high needs children. This comes as spending per pupil in schools has fallen by 8% in real terms in England since 2010. Councils say they feel caught between legal duties and the need to balance budgets. And they are also facing growing pressure from unhappy parents, including legal challenges in the High Court. Bristol City Council had to reverse planned changes to its special needs spending, after being defeated in court last summer, over its failure to consult on the proposals. Surrey and Hackney councils are awaiting judgements in cases where parents also challenged the failure to consult and consider the needs of families who rely on special needs support.  Â£324 millionoverspend by councils in England this year (BBC FOI)* 14%of children have special needs 11%increase in special needs care plans in 2017-18 Â£250mextra promised by government over next two years The government said it was aware of the pressures on the Â£6bn high needs budget in England. An extra Â£250m was promised in December to be invested over the next two years, after intensive lobbying from councils. And more special school places to cater for those with the highest needs are being planned through the free school programme. Dorset is trying to find longer-term solutions to help it manage costs, such as reducing the need for children to travel out of its area for support. It is setting up five special needs units attached to schools across the county to ease the pressure on special schools and reduce the cost of out-of-area placements. One of these is up and running at Parley First School, in Ferndown, where a group of specially-designed classrooms run by specialist teaching staff have been built on to the existing mainstream school. They cater for 10 pupils who need extra support with complex communication needs. Malachi does not have a suitable school place Most of the pupils have autism spectrum disorder among their extra needs, so the classroom is designed to be calming. A special sensory room allows the boys to gradually increase the time they can join in classes in the rest of the school. Specialist teacher Sarah Rose said the work in the unit was about helping the pupils progress as a whole person. ""It might be something as simple as learning to say hello, maintain eye contact and show interest in the other person. ""It will help them with that social connection, now and in later life."" But six-year-old Malachi, who has multiple special needs, has been out of school since September, because of the difficulty in finding him a suitable place. This has forced his father, Alexander Lyes, to take six months of unpaid leave from work to help his wife Emma manage. Emma said: ""Malachi struggles every day of his life, because he's not getting the support and provisions he needs. ""I think he feels rejected because he can't go to school like every other child."" The government said it recognised the pressures on the Â£6bn high needs budget, and the additional Â£250m was intended to help over the next two years. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""Every parent rightly wants their child to get the support and education they deserve. My ambition for children with special educational needs is the same as theirs - that they succeed in education, find employment and lead a happy life."" The pressures on the high needs budget will be considered as part of the next government spending review. The situation will be watched with interest from Wales, which is introducing similar reforms with a transition to plans identifying additional learning needs up to the age of 25. In Scotland, where there has also been a trend of increasing demand, there is a presumption in law to educate most pupils with extra learning needs in mainstream schools. This has faced criticism. In Northern Ireland there has also been a rise in the number of pupils diagnosed with a special need. In addition, the Department of Education has a policy of inclusion, which has means many more pupils are educated in mainstream schools. No school for 4,000 special needs pupils Special needs support 'a national scandal' Special needs parents fight cuts in court Department for Education New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Two babies die after blood infection,"The Princess Royal Maternity Hospital is next to Glasgow Royal Infirmary Two premature babies have died after contracting a blood stream infection at a Glasgow hospital. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed it was initially investigating three cases in the neonatal unit at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital. But it said two of the ""extremely premature"" babies have since died and the infection was ""one of a number of contributing causes"" in both deaths. The third premature baby required treatment and is in a stable condition. Do hospitals make you sick? NHSGGC confirmed an incident management team was set up on 24 January after the staphylococcus aureus bacterium was detected. A deep clean has also taken place in the unit at the hospital in Alexandra Parade, next to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Dr Barbara Weinhardt, infection control doctor, said: ""Our thoughts are with the families affected. ""Results have today confirmed that the three cases of staphylococcus aureus are linked and our investigations continue into how they are linked. ""Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that is found on the skin and in the nasal passage of around one in four people and only causes infection when it enters the body."" Dr Weinhardt said in cases where people were vulnerable to infection, it can cause serious infection. She added: ""We have taken a number of control measures in the unit, including a deep clean, isolation and barrier nursing, safety briefs to all staff and infection control advice to all visitors."" Dr Alan Mathers, chief of medicine, women's and children's service, said national guidance sets out that an investigation should be triggered when two or more cases of the same type of bacteria are found. In this case an incident management team meeting was convened last Thursday. The team is made up of specialist clinicians, infection control doctors and nurses, occupational health clinicians, and estates and facilities staff. Dr Mathers added: ""The IMT began their investigations into possible linkages between the three cases and sent samples for testing. ""Whilst these results were awaited, we spoke to the families affected, together with the parents on the unit and staff, to let them know of our investigations. ""The results that have come back today have confirmed links between the three cases. ""Our infection control team continues to work closely with clinical colleagues and domestic staff to manage the situation and take all necessary steps to maintain patient safety."" Health secretary Jeane Freeman said: ""My thoughts are with the families affected at this time. ""NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has spoken with these families as well as other families within the unit and, with the support of Health Protection Scotland, is taking the necessary steps to ensure patient safety. ""The health board continues to be supported by Health Protection Scotland, and its infection control team is working closely with clinical and domestic staff to manage the situation."" NHSGGC is also awaiting the results of aseparate investigation into the deaths of two patientsat the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow after they contracted an infection linked to pigeon droppings. On Tuesday the Crown Office confirmed it was looking into the death of a 73-year-old woman at the Â£842m hospital earlier this month. Prosecutors were alreadyprobing the deathin December of a 10-year-old boy. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said the ""desperately tragic story"" raised ""serious questions"" about infection control in hospitals. ""Four deaths have now occurred in recent times under circumstances like these, and it's time for the SNP government to get a grip on this situation,"" he said. ""Our sympathies go out to the families involved, who are going through unimaginable trauma. Staff, patients and families need vital reassurance as a matter of urgency."" Labour MSP Monica Lennon added: ""This is utterly heartbreaking and tragic. My thoughts go out to the families of these babies who will be absolutely devastated. ""Coming so soon after the deaths of patients at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, this will leave people questioning infection control standards at hospitals in Glasgow and across the country. ""The health secretary must urgently provide the reassurance the public needs.""

Acid attack accused sent 'nailed it!' text,"The six men and one woman are charged with conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm A father accused of organising an acid attack on his three-year-old son sent a message reading ""nailed it!"" in the aftermath, a court has heard. The message was sent in the hours after the attack to one of his six co-accused currently on trial at Worcester Crown Court. The boy was splashed with acid at Home Bargains in Worcester on 21 July 2018. His father, who cannot be named, denies conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm. Three of the defendants, Adam Cech, Jan Dudi and Norbert Pulko, were seen on CCTV entering the shop in the Tallow Hill area before Mr Cech is seen approaching the boy and, the prosecution alleges, throwing acid over him before immediately leaving the area. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Referring to call log evidence, prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC said Mr Pulko then called Jabar Paktia, also on trial, who within 20 minutes of the attack rang the boy's father. Both their phones were traced to the Wolverhampton area when the father sent sticker messages to Mr Paktia, the court heard. These included a cartoon image of a deer comforting a fox and a second which features a young woman in it with the motif ""Nailed It!"". Acid attack accused 'threatened family' Acid attack boy, 3, screamed 'I hurt' Father 'plotted acid attack on own son' The prosecution also presented text messages between Mr Pulko and his sister, in which she asked him: ""Why did you do this?"", to which he replied: ""I'm stupid, I know I'm going for a minimum of 15 years to prison. ""If I go, I'm going to kill myself before they put me there."" The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused alongside Adam Cech, 27, of Farnham Road, Jan Dudi, 25, of Cranbrook Road and Martina Badiova, 22, of Newcombe Road, Handsworth all of Birmingham; Norbert Pulko, 22, of Sutherland Road and Saied Hussini, 41, of Wrottesley Road, both in London and Jabar Paktia, 41, of Newhampton Road, Wolverhampton.

E-cigarettes 'better for quitting smoking',"E-cigarettes are almost twice as effective as nicotine replacements for helping smokers quit, a study suggests. A trial found 18% of smokers who used them to quit remained smoke-free after a year, compared with 9.9% of those using nicotine-replacement treatments. The study of 886 smokers is the first to test how effective modern e-cigarettes are for quitting. Researchers hope their findings will lead to vaping devices being routinely offered by stop-smoking services. Public Health England has alreadycalled for e-cigarettes to be made available on the NHS within five years, pointing to a body of research that suggests they are at least 95% less harmful than cigarettes. However, up until now there had been a shortage of evidence on how effective they were as stop-smoking tools. Lead researcher Prof Peter Hajek, from Queen Mary University of London, said: ""Although a large number of smokers report that they have quit smoking successfully with the help of e-cigarettes, health professionals have been reluctant to recommend their use because of the lack of clear evidence from randomised controlled trials. ""This is now likely to change."" E-cigarettes 'should be on prescription' Vaping - the rise in five charts Vaping on buses 'should be considered' E-cigarettes 'more harmful than we think' Participants in the trial, who were dependent on smoking and had previously failed to give up, attended NHS stop-smoking services and were randomly assigned into two groups: those who received a nicotine-replacement treatment of their choice, which included gum, patches, lozenges, sprays and inhalators, or a combination of treatments, for up to three months those who got an e-cigarette starter pack with one or two bottles of e-liquid (two to four weeks' supply) Those given e-cigarettes were encouraged to buy future supplies of their own choice of strengths and flavours, and all participants received weekly one-on-one behavioural support for at least four weeks. The study,published in the New England Journal of Medicine,external, found that in addition to having higher rates of quitting, more e-cigarette users reduced their smoking by at least 50%. E-cigarettes also provided higher satisfaction and were rated as more helpful than nicotine-replacement treatment. A higher proportion of those who used the devices experienced mouth and throat irritation (65% v 51%), although people using the nicotine-replacement treatments were more likely to report nausea (38% v 31%). These effects were mostly mild. Prof Hajek said he hoped the results of the study would lead to stop-smoking services offering quitters an e-cigarette starter pack and guidance on how to vape, after which they could pay for their own supplies. ""This may ultimately further accelerate the reduction in smoking and in smoking-related diseases,"" said Dunja Przulj, another author of the study, also from Queen Mary University of London. This video can not be played Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results The study has some limitations. Because people had known which treatment they had received - as opposed to being ""blinded"" as they are in most randomised controlled trials - it was possible participants may have perceived nicotine replacements as an inferior option and put less effort into quitting, the authors said. They also said more work was needed to determine if their results would apply to countries outside of the UK and for less dependent smokers. The study comes after an independent review of evidence on e-cigarettes, by Public Health England, published in February last year, concluded there was ""overwhelming evidence"" they were far safer than smoking and ""of negligible risk to bystanders"". However, some experts have said e-cigarettes, while safer than normal cigarettes,are not harm-free,external, and their long-term effects are not yet known. Responding to this latest research, Public Health England said: ""All stop-smoking services should welcome smokers who want to quit with the help of an e-cigarette."" Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"'Day of reckoning' for special needsEnglish councils have overspent their special needs budget by Â£324m and are near ""breaking point"".Family & Education","This video can not be played The colourful 'pods' helping special needs children go to school English councils have overspent by at least Â£324m on their budgets for young adults and children with special needs this financial year, the BBC has found. Of the 136 local authorities that provided information to the BBC under Freedom of Information laws, 123 have overspent on their high needs budget. The government says it is providing an extra Â£250m to ease pressures, and Â£100m on new school places. Funding has not kept pace with the growth in extra support, say councils. Some of these extra pressures have resulted from a legal change in 2014 which handed councils responsibility for young adults' special educational needs between the ages of 18 and 25. They were already responsible for under-18s. This change led to a growth in the number of college and university students and apprentices being supported. In Dorset, since 2014, the number of under-25s on education, health and care plans - which give a legal right to specialist support - has grown by more than two-thirds. This led to the high needs budget being overspent every year, and now a Â£13m deficit is predicted for the coming financial year. Dorset county councillor Andrew Parry, who is responsible for education, said the council had run out of options. ""It is a multi-million pound problem. Up to now it's been a case of drawing on reserves, reorganising budgets. ""But there is a breaking point. ""Dorset is not alone in recognising that day of reckoning will be coming very soon,"" he said. According to the information obtained from England's councils, 76 local authorities have shifted money from other education budgets to meet their obligations to high needs children. This comes as spending per pupil in schools has fallen by 8% in real terms in England since 2010. Councils say they feel caught between legal duties and the need to balance budgets. And they are also facing growing pressure from unhappy parents, including legal challenges in the High Court. Bristol City Council had to reverse planned changes to its special needs spending, after being defeated in court last summer, over its failure to consult on the proposals. Surrey and Hackney councils are awaiting judgements in cases where parents also challenged the failure to consult and consider the needs of families who rely on special needs support.  Â£324 millionoverspend by councils in England this year (BBC FOI)* 14%of children have special needs 11%increase in special needs care plans in 2017-18 Â£250mextra promised by government over next two years The government said it was aware of the pressures on the Â£6bn high needs budget in England. An extra Â£250m was promised in December to be invested over the next two years, after intensive lobbying from councils. And more special school places to cater for those with the highest needs are being planned through the free school programme. Dorset is trying to find longer-term solutions to help it manage costs, such as reducing the need for children to travel out of its area for support. It is setting up five special needs units attached to schools across the county to ease the pressure on special schools and reduce the cost of out-of-area placements. One of these is up and running at Parley First School, in Ferndown, where a group of specially-designed classrooms run by specialist teaching staff have been built on to the existing mainstream school. They cater for 10 pupils who need extra support with complex communication needs. Malachi does not have a suitable school place Most of the pupils have autism spectrum disorder among their extra needs, so the classroom is designed to be calming. A special sensory room allows the boys to gradually increase the time they can join in classes in the rest of the school. Specialist teacher Sarah Rose said the work in the unit was about helping the pupils progress as a whole person. ""It might be something as simple as learning to say hello, maintain eye contact and show interest in the other person. ""It will help them with that social connection, now and in later life."" But six-year-old Malachi, who has multiple special needs, has been out of school since September, because of the difficulty in finding him a suitable place. This has forced his father, Alexander Lyes, to take six months of unpaid leave from work to help his wife Emma manage. Emma said: ""Malachi struggles every day of his life, because he's not getting the support and provisions he needs. ""I think he feels rejected because he can't go to school like every other child."" The government said it recognised the pressures on the Â£6bn high needs budget, and the additional Â£250m was intended to help over the next two years. Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""Every parent rightly wants their child to get the support and education they deserve. My ambition for children with special educational needs is the same as theirs - that they succeed in education, find employment and lead a happy life."" The pressures on the high needs budget will be considered as part of the next government spending review. The situation will be watched with interest from Wales, which is introducing similar reforms with a transition to plans identifying additional learning needs up to the age of 25. In Scotland, where there has also been a trend of increasing demand, there is a presumption in law to educate most pupils with extra learning needs in mainstream schools. This has faced criticism. In Northern Ireland there has also been a rise in the number of pupils diagnosed with a special need. In addition, the Department of Education has a policy of inclusion, which has means many more pupils are educated in mainstream schools. No school for 4,000 special needs pupils Special needs support 'a national scandal' Special needs parents fight cuts in court Department for Education New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Facebook users rise despite privacy scandals,"The number of Facebook users has continued to rise despite a series of data privacy scandals and criticism over its attempt to stem toxic content. The social media giant said the number of people who logged into its site at least once a month jumped 9% last year to 2.32 billion people. Fears the firm's scandals could put off advertisers also proved unfounded with annual revenues up 30% on last year. The rise came despite campaigns which urged people to shun the tech giant. Founder Mark Zuckerberg said the firm had ""fundamentally changed how we run the company to focus on the biggest social issues"". The strong financial performance comes amid continuing concerns over how the social media firm handles users' personal data and privacy after the Cambridge Analytica data sharing scandaland fears the network has been used as a political tool. Facebook paid teens to mine device data Facebook 'less popular with UK children' The company's shares have lost almost a third of their value since July when it warned about slowing revenue growth and they remain near a two-year low. But they jumped over 9% in after-hours trading after profit and revenue beat analyst forecasts. Facebook's total profit for 2018 was $22.1bn (Â£16.9bn), up 39% on 2017. User growth was particularly strong in India, Indonesia and the Philippines, but flat in the US and Canada. The mind boggles. In 2018 Facebook saw the Cambridge Analytica scandal, political manipulation, fake news, data breaches and accusations of deeply unethical behaviour. Despite this, profits are up by almost 40%. Facebook isn't just surviving, it's thriving. In the face of severe turbulence, Mark Zuckerberg's company has proven to be resilient. But while users appear to be turning a blind eye, the same won't be said for regulators - Facebook knows huge fines are likely coming its way. The question is how damaging those fines will be, and what other measures might be put in place that might clip the wings of a company that many lawmakers feel is too powerful. George Salmon, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Facebook's revenue growth in the final three months of the year was its weakest since the firm listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 2012, but said the figures were still ""reassuring"". ""Only time will tell if Mark Zuckerberg's ambitious plans to revolutionise Facebook pay off, but these results will go a long way towards regaining the trust of Wall Street - analysts had been jittery after a tumultuous 2018 which included the trials and tribulations of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a reset on strategy,"" he added.

Government loses criminal records appeal,"The Supreme Court has ruled in favour of three people who claimed their lives were blighted by past minor criminal convictions. The judges found the way the criminal records are disclosed to employers infringed human rights. The government will have to consider reform of the system, said BBC legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman. The charity Unlock said the ruling stands to affect thousands of people with old and minor criminal records. Christopher Stacey, co-director of Unlock, said that criminal checks leave many people ""unnecessarily anchored to their past"". He claims that in the past five years alone, more than a million youth criminal records were disclosed on standard or enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks that related to offences from more than 30 years ago. Criminal record disclosure checks ruled unlawful Supreme Court justices found that the criminal records disclosure scheme was ""disproportionate"" in two respects. These were that all previous convictions should be disclosed, however minor, where the person has more than one conviction, and also in the case of warnings and reprimands issued to young offenders. They announced their decision on Wednesday following the government challenge against a Court of Appeal judgment in 2017 over the legality of the scheme. The appeal ruling backed the High Court's 2016 finding that the scheme was ""not in accordance with the law"" within the meaning of Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to private life. The children's charity Just for Kids Law, which brought one of the cases to court, had argued that DBS checks fail to treat children differently to adults. Its CEO Enver Soloman said the ""landmark judgement"" would benefit thousands of children issued with cautions each year, a disproportionate number of whom are from Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds. ""There is now an overwhelming view shared by the higher courts and MPs that the government should act immediately to ensure no child who is given a caution ends up with a criminal record that stigmatises them for life."" One of the cases involved a woman, referred to in court as P, who was charged with shoplifting a 99p book in 1999 while suffering from untreated schizophrenia. She was bailed to appear before magistrates 18 days later, but failed to attend court, which meant she ended up with two convictions - for which she received a conditional discharge. P wants to work as a teaching assistant, having previous experience of teaching, and has sought voluntary positions in schools. However, with each application she is required to disclose her historic convictions, which has the effect of leading to the disclosure of her medical history to explain them. In another case, G was arrested at the age of 13 for sexually assaulting two younger boys, with offences involving sexual touching and attempted intercourse. Police records indicated the sexual activity was consensual and carried out as ""dares"", in the form of sexual curiosity and experimentation on the part of all three boys. The Crown Prosecution Service decided it was not in the public interest to prosecute. G received a police reprimand in Sept 2006 and has not offended since. In 2011, when working as a library assistant in a local college, he was required to apply for an enhanced criminal records check because his work involved contact with children. The police proposed to disclose the reprimand with an account of the mitigation. As a result, G withdrew his application and lost the job. He has since felt unable to apply for any job requiring an enhanced criminal records check. Their cases were heard alongside that of W, a man who - more than 35 years ago - was convicted aged 16 of actual bodily harm, and given a two-year conditional discharge. Due to the categorisation of this type of offence, under the current rules the record will never come off his standard or enhanced DBS check. However, the justices allowed the government's appeal regarding W. Those involved cannot be named for legal reasons. Bob Ashford, 65, from Somerset, says he struggled to get a job after being convicted of trespassing and possession of an offensive weapon when he was 13 years old. ""I was mucking about on a railway embankment with a group of lads and one of them had an air pistol,"" he told the BBC. ""It wasn't until I finished university and started applying for jobs I realised the impact this was going to have because I had to disclose these offences."" He said he did eventually have a successful career in the criminal justice system but as recently as six years ago he had to stand down as a candidate to be a police and crime commissioner after his past convictions were disclosed. He welcomed the Supreme Court ruling as a ""step in the right direction"" but said there should be a ""complete review"" of the whole DBS system. The Justice Committee, which published aninquiry in July,external, welcomed the ruling. Bob Neill MP, chair of the committee, said the disclosure system is ""inconsistent with the aims of the youth justice system, with mistakes made as a teenager able to follow someone around for decades, creating a barrier to rehabilitation, and preventing large numbers of people from gaining access to employment, education, and housing"". Corey Stoughton, advocacy director of Liberty which represented P, said: ""P made a mistake a long time ago and has been unfairly punished ever since. ""Using overly broad bureaucratic rules that deny people meaningful careers by forcing them to to carry a scarlet letter for life is both cruel and pointless."" Mr Stacey from Unlock, which intervened in the case, urged the government to take ""prompt and considered action"" and carry out a fundamental review of the wider DBS system.

Woman launches NI abortion law challenge,"Sarah Ewart spoke to the media before the court hearing on Wednesday morning A woman who is trying to change Northern Ireland's abortion law, with a case based on her personal experience, has begun her High Court challenge. Sarah Ewart was denied an abortion in 2013, despite doctors saying her baby would not survive outside the womb. She went to England for a termination butshe also spoke out publicly about the additional hardship, emotional and financial stress the journey caused. Northern Ireland's abortion law is much stricter than the rest of the UK. The 1967 Abortion Act, which liberalised the rules in Great Britain, was never extended to Northern Ireland. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Rape, incest or diagnoses of fatal foetal abnormality (FFA) - where medics believe that a baby will die before, during or shortly after birth - are not grounds for a legal abortion in Northern Ireland. However, anti-abortion campaigners argue that doctors cannot reliably predict the timescale of death and they point to several cases where babies have defied the prognosis and survived into adulthood. This video can not be played The law on abortion in Northern Ireland explained Sarah Ewart is an abortion activist from Belfast who has led a high-profile campaign to liberalise the law in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. In 2013, she was in her early 20s, married and pregnant with her first child. At her 20-week scan, doctors told her that her unborn child had anencephaly and there was no sign of a skull. However, as there was no risk to her own life, she was told she would have to continue with the pregnancy until miscarriage. Ms Ewart travelled to England for an abortion but since then she has campaigned for women to be given access to terminations without having to leave Northern Ireland. Speaking to reporters outside court on Wednesday, she said she hoped women ""who find themselves in the circumstances that I found myself in will get the help and the treatment that we need in our hospitals with our own medical teams"". Ms Ewart has taken the High Court case in her own name, aftera previous Supreme Court appeal, led by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) failed last year. During the June 2018 case, a majority of Supreme Court judges agreed that Northern Ireland's existing legislation was incompatible with human rights law in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and sexual crime. However, the judges dismissed the NIHRC's case on a technicality, ruling that the organisation did not have the legal standing to bring such a challenge. The Supreme Court judges said it would have required the case to have been brought by a woman who was pregnant as a result of sexual crime or who was carrying a foetus with a fatal abnormality. Ms Ewart later agreed to lead the challenge based on her own experience of a fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis. She soughta judicial review of Northern Ireland's abortion lawin the High Court in Belfast, with the aim of achieving a formal declaration of incompatibility with human rights law. Sarah Ewart was accompanied to court by her mother and Grainne Teggart of Amnesty International Before entering court, Ms Ewart said she was ""really hopeful that the High Court listens to what the Supreme Court has previously said"". ""This is a medical situation that I found myself in; five years down the line I am reliving the stress and the trauma all over again. ""I should not have to be here, sharing my story again, so I am hoping this time will be the final time through the courts, that we will get the help that we need."" Ms Ewart's legal team argued that the law in Northern Ireland which prohibits abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality was in breach of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Her lawyer Adam Straw argued that five out of seven Supreme Court judges finding that the law in cases of FFA was incompatible ""should carry great weight"". Mr Straw told the court that the adverse effect on women of having to carry on with a pregnancy in cases of FFA caused ""serious trauma to women and also put them at risk of serious harm"". He presented a witness statement from Ms Ewart in which she described her ""horror"" in finding out about her baby's diagnosis and that the legislation in Northern Ireland denied her a lawful abortion. ""This was a difficult time for her. It left her feeling traumatised, undignified and as if she was on a conveyor belt. The whole process was humiliating."" Anti-abortion campaigners protested outside court He further outlined what he argued was the negative effect on autonomy. Ms Ewart's lawyer said the High Court should follow the lead of the majority of the Supreme Court and extend a declaration of incompatibility to the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act and subordinate legislation. On the issue of standing, Mr Straw told the court Ms Ewart had sufficient interest to bring a judicial review and that she also qualified as a ""victim"" under human rights legislation. Appearing for the respondents, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, Tony McGleenan QC told the court that their long standing position had been to consider the law in cases of FFA. They had been working on policy development and this, he said, had culminated in the working group report on FFA. The question, he said, followed ""should this court proceed to take steps the Supreme Court could not and did not take regarding a declaration of incompatibility?"" Mr McGleenan told the court the FFA working group report had not been available to the Supreme Court as it had not been published at the time of the hearing. Sarah Ewart arriving at the Supreme Court in London in June He argued that further factors to weigh in the balance included that the promulgation of Department of Health guidance of termination of pregnancy in March 2016 would not have been available to the applicant and there is now access to funded NHS provision for the termination of pregnancy for women in Northern Ireland. He said: ""This is not an issue which fits naturally before the High Court. It is an issue which has been before the legislature which debated it in February 2016. The assembly rejected the proposal and mandated a course of action. ""That appears to be the democratically expressed wish of the assembly which the court will no doubt have regard to."" The Northern Ireland Attorney General John Larkin QC also began his submissions during the hearing, which is due to last two days. The case will hear interventions from the NIHRC, Amnesty International, Humanists UK, the Centre for Reproductive Rights and the anti-abortion campaign group, Precious Life. Speaking to journalists outside the High Court, Bernie Smyth from Precious Life said her organisation was opposed to any change in Northern Ireland's abortion law. Three women stand out in today's court room. Sitting in court, flanked by her mum and Amnesty's Grainne Teggart, Sarah Ewart never smiles. Clearly embarrassed when her personal details are relayed publicly, her head drops even lower. Sitting behind is Bernie Smyth from anti-abortion group Precious Life. She too believes that she is right and that her views on a foetus's right to life should be upheld. Two women, two arguments and two very different views on justice. Deciding on whether the law is incompatible is another woman - Mrs Justice Keegan. All three have a tough job. Northern Ireland's abortion law explained.

"Go back to school, Trump tells US spies","President Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 President Donald Trump has called US intelligence agencies ""naive"" on Iran and also dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. ""Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!""Mr Trump tweeted.,external The testy response came after a US intelligence report said Iran was not making nuclear weapons. It also said that North Korea remained ""unlikely to give up"" its weapons stockpiles and production abilities. National intelligence director Dan Coats and other intelligence chiefs presentedthe Worldwide Threat Assessment report,externalto the Senate on Tuesday. Last year, the US pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, triggering widespread criticism from Washington's allies. Iran nuclear deal: Key details North Korea's breakdown of communication Kim Jong-un, the king of Pyongyang Mr Trump also launched a diplomatic push to improve relations with North Korea, meeting the country's leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore last June to discuss denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. At the time, Mr Trump said this meeting had ended the North Korean nuclear threat - a claim questioned by a number of US politicians and experts. This video can not be played N Korea's leaders 'view nuclear as key to regime survival' The US intelligence report also warned that cyber threats from China and Russia were a growing concern, and both countries may be seeking to influence the 2020 US presidential elections. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump said US intelligence officials ""seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong!"" Iran, he continued, was ""making trouble all over the Middle East, and beyond"" in 2016, but had been ""much different"" since the US pullout from the ""terrible"" Iran nuclear deal.

Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? When Trump met Kim: What happened next? The White House has said there will be a second summit in February, but no date or location has yet been confirmed. Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera It used to be that finding the tiniest gap between the statements of a political leader and his intelligence chiefs would make for front-page news. Yet these days a gaping chasm between President Trump and the heads of his intelligence agencies has almost become a new normal. The willingness of Donald Trump to attack intelligence assessments began after his election and before he took office, when the intelligence community at the tail end of the Obama administration produced an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the 2016 election. Rather than see the legitimacy of his victory undermined, he targeted the credibility of the spies. That trend has continued in office even with intelligence chiefs who now serve at his pleasure. They have to tread a thorny path (easier walked together than alone) between being seen to maintain their integrity in telling ""truth to power"", and not risking the wrath of a president which in turn could undermine their work. No. Last year, Mr Trump faced a barrage of criticism from both Democrats and Republicans after he defended Russia over claims it meddled in the 2016 US presidential elections. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. But after face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July 2018, Mr Trump said there had been no reason for Russia to interfere. Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" Mr Trump told a news conference. Just 24 hours later, the US president said he misspoke and should have said, ""I don't see any reason why itwouldn'tbe"" Russia.

Council's transgender wig image 'bigoted',"The image appeared on the Essex County Council public consultation on library cuts A council has been accused of ""institutionalised bigotry"" after using a picture of a person removing a wig to depict transgender people. The image was published in an ""easy read"" online version of an Essex County Council consultation document on library cuts, but has now been removed. Equality campaigner Zoe O'Connell said the mistake was ""indicative of a wider problem"". A spokeswoman for the council apologised ""for any offence caused"". The image was provided by a company that specialises in producing easy read versions of documents for the government and NHS England, according to the council. The questionnaire asks participants about their gender, with boxes for male and female. A third box, labelled transgender, has an image of a man removing a long wig. Questions transgender people hear Should the NHS pay for transgender fertility treatment? The picture was circulated on Twitter on Wednesday, with The Save Our Libraries Essex campaign describing it as ""looking like institutionalised bigotry"". One Twitter user described it as a ""gross misrepresentation with zero bearing on any transgender person"". Another said: ""The depiction is not only awful but 'man, woman or transgender' is an extremely ignorant choice of genders."" Ms O'Connell, who ran for the parliamentary seat of Maldon in 2015 and 2017 for the Liberal Democrats, said: ""I'm trans myself and we all know the problems with funding cuts facing councils but they view expertise in these areas as somehow optional. ""These are the basics and they need to be right. ""It feels to me like Essex County Council is not as safe as it should be, because their own consultations are portraying a negative gender stereotype,"" she added. A spokeswoman for the council said: ""This image was specifically chosen to help communicate with people with learning disabilities. ""It was supplied by an organisation called Inspired Services, who work with people with learning disabilities to produce images for the Government and NHS England for easy read publications.

"Drop no deal, Corbyn tells May at meetingTheresa May and Jeremy Corbyn agreed to meet again soon after ""serious"" Brexit talks, Labour says.","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clash over Brexit policies Jeremy Corbyn says he told Theresa May ""don't bring no deal back to Parliament"" in their long-awaited face-to-face meeting on Brexit. The Labour leader said it was ""not acceptable"" for the PM to keep the no-deal option on the table after MPs voted against it on Tuesday. After the meeting, Mrs May tweeted: ""The only way to avoid No Deal is to vote for a deal."" MPs will vote on the deal again after she seeks to renegotiate with the EU. Mr Corbyn said it was a ""serious"" meeting and Mrs May had ""listened"". He had refused to meet Mrs May unless she agreed to rule out a no-deal Brexit, but changed his mind after MPs voted against the idea of leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal on Tuesday evening. What could happen next?

Mr Corbyn said: ""I set out the Labour case for a comprehensive customs union with the European Union, in order to protect jobs and trade. ""She certainly understood the point that we were making."" He added: ""The last words I said to her were 'don't bring no deal back to Parliament' because it's not acceptable - it's not a sensible or serious way of going forward."" He said he was suspicious the government was trying to ""run down the clock"", and if that appeared to be the case when Parliament discussed Brexit again next month, Labour would ""look at all the options on the table at that time"". Asked if Labour would support or table a motion to try and extend Article 50, which would delay the date of Brexit, Mr Corbyn said: ""That is a question for 13 February.""

Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The two party leaders earlier clashed over Brexit at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. During the exchange, Mr Corbyn said the prime minister may have succeeded in ""temporarily uniting her very divided party"" in Tuesday's votes on amendments to her plan, but she had to make ""more important compromises"" to ""unite the country"". Mrs May said Mr Corbyn was a ""fine one to talk about coming together"", when he had only now agreed to meet her. She said the majority of MPs had identified the Irish backstop as the main sticking point preventing them from backing her deal, whereas Mr Corbyn's Brexit proposals had been rejected. ""He has no plan for Brexit, no good plan for our economy and no plan for our country,"" she told MPs. This video can not be played Mr Corbyn: 'We are prepared to meet her to put forward the points of view from the Labour Party' MPs voted 317 to 301 in favour of changing the backstop plan - the section of Mrs May's deal with the EU designed to avoid the return of Northern Ireland border checks. Five amendments, including Labour MP Yvette Cooper's bid to delay Brexit if Mrs May does not get her deal through Parliament and Mr Corbyn's own amendment, were defeated on Tuesday. Mr Corbyn asked Mrs May whether, if she did not agree a deal with Brussels that MPs would support, she would back Labour's proposals for a ""a strong single market, comprehensive customs union and the guaranteeing of rights and protections rather than the alternative she has been threatening - to crash out with no-deal"". Mrs May told him: ""You cannot just vote to reject no deal, you have to support a deal."" It was a message she repeated to Labour MP Jack Dromey, who together with Tory MP Caroline Spelman got MPs to back a non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday. Later in the session, Nigel Dodds, leader of the Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, described remarks by the  Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on the UK's approach to Brexit as ""highly reckless and extremely dangerous"". Mr Coveney likened the UK's negotiating stance to ""either you give me what I want or I'm jumping out the window"". Mr Dodds said that kind of rhetoric needed ""to be toned down"". Mrs May said she will speak to Irish premier Leo Varadkar later on Wednesday. ""It is important for us to work with the Irish government on the arrangements that will be in place in the future,"" she added. But ahead of the call, Mr Varadkar told the Irish Parliament that the EU stood by the withdrawal agreement and renegotiation was not on the table. At the moment, the UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, with or without a deal. The UK and the EU negotiated their withdrawal agreement deal over the past 18 months but it needs to be backed by MPs for it to come into force. Earlier this month, MPs voted against the plan Mrs May had proposed by 432 votes to 202. Mrs May said that, after taking Tuesday's votes into account and talking to the EU, any revised deal would be brought back to the Commons ""as soon as possible"" for a second ""meaningful vote"".

'Lenient zombie knife' sentence overturned,"This video can not be played The attack happened on London Road in Croydon A man who tried to smash a car window with a ""zombie knife"" has been jailed after appeal judges overturned his ""lenient"" sentence. Joshua Gardner, 18, who wasfilmed using the weaponin a Croydon street, admitted three charges when he appeared at the Old Bailey in November. He received a two-year suspended sentence, which the attorney general referred to the Court of Appeal. Gardner has now been jailed for three and a half years. Lord Justice Leveson said the previous sentence was unduly lenient. ""There can never be any excuse for carrying a weapon of the type this offender carried,"" he said. Gardner gave a ""no comment"" interview following his arrest On 30 May, Gardner, from Thornton Heath, was on a bicycle when he pulled up alongside a car with a 19-year-old man inside. The man tried to drive off and almost made contact with Gardner's bike, which led to him to attack the car and smash the passenger window with the large knife. In November, he was found guilty of attempting to cause GBH with intent. He had previously admitted affray and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. Judge Anuja Dhir QC sentenced him to two years in prison for the GBH offence to run concurrently with 12 months in jail for the knife and affray offences, suspended for two years.

Inflatable pill inspired by puffer fish,"The jelly-like pill has been tested in pigs but not yet in humans Scientists say they have designed a jelly-like pill that inflates to the size of a ping-pong ball when it reaches the stomach, and could be used to monitor tumours or ulcers. The soft, squishy device was inspired by the puffer fish, which inflates quickly like a balloon when threatened. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology team behind the pill says it can last for a month. The pill has been tested in pigs but not yet in humans. The pill is made from two types of hydrogels - an inner layer of absorbent particles and an outer protective membrane. This gives it the consistency of jelly, helping it to expand quickly in the stomach and therefore stopping it from passing out the other end. The inflated pill could be removed at any time by drinking a solution of calcium that makes it quickly shrink to its original size, the scientists claim. It can then pass safely out of the body. In the lab, researchers put the pill in solutions of water resembling gastric stomach juices and found it inflated to 100 times its original size in 15 minutes. But they also found it was strong enough to survive regular contractions in the stomach. The device starts as a small pill, swells quickly and deswells again The researchers say the pill is softer and lasts longer than current alternatives, which are often made of hard plastic or metal. When temperature sensors inside pills were fed to pigs - which have very similar stomachs and intestines to humans - the team was able to track the animals' daily activities for up to 30 days. ""The dream is to have a smart pill, that once swallowed stays in the stomach and monitors the patient's health for a long time, such as a month,"" says Xuanhe Zhao, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. The researchers,whose work is reported in the journal Nature Communications,,externalenvisage putting various different sensors inside the puffer pills and delivering them to the stomach. These sensors could monitor signs of bacteria and viruses. In the long term, with tiny cameras inside them, the pills might also be used to check the progress of tumours or ulcers over several weeks, the research team said. And Prof Zhao said the pill could potentially be used as an alternative to the gastric balloon, which is inserted into the stomach to encourage weight loss.

BBC boss apologises to stars over tax,"Lord Hall said he wanted to ""repair that relationship"" with presenters The BBC director general has said sorry to presenters who are facing big tax bills after being given no choice about changes to the way they were employed. Tony Hall admitted some stars had been told they would only have a career in the BBC if they were paid through their own personal service companies (PSCs). That led to around 100 presenters being investigated by tax authorities. Labour MP Caroline Flint said stars had been ""hounded for not paying tax when they didn't really have a choice"". The BBC has come under fire for telling some presenters they had to be paid through their own companies - meaning they were responsible for their own tax and didn't get benefits like sick pay or maternity leave. Meg Hillier MP, chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, told a hearing on Wednesday the fallout had ""caused a lot of misery and hardship"". The presenters include BBC Radio 4 Front Row host Kirsty Lang, whohas previously spokenabout having to work through cancer treatment after being taken off a staff contract. This video can not be played March 2018: Radio 4 Front Row presenter speaks to DCMS committee Speaking to the committee on Wednesday, Lord Hall admitted ""people were pushed into"" the arrangements in the past but said he wanted to ""repair that relationship"" with the top talent. The corporation has identified 800 people whose employment had changed, including 300 with PSCs. Last October, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs [HMRC] said it had opened investigations into around 100 BBC-related PSCs. The BBC is now trying to reach a deal with HMRC to settle all the cases and Lord Hall said he had apologised to the affected presenters in person. ""After April 2017, the meetings we've had with people who have been directly affected have allowed me to directly apologise to as many of those who were affected by this as we could do,"" he said. ""I'm very happy to repeat that again today. But what we've been trying to do over last two years since April 2017 is to work with those people. ""We've had some very tough and hard meetings with some of the people who are affected by IR35 [tax laws] - very hard meetings. ""Our aim is to get these things sorted. Why I put a huge amount of impetus on trying to sort this with HMRC is because I think that will actually allow these people to get on with their work and us to have a proper relationship with our presenters. ""I take no joy at all from being at odds with people who are our front line to our to our viewers and listeners. None. And I want to repair that relationship."" The National Audit Office (NAO) has said some BBC News presenters were employed through PSCs from 2004-12, and other radio and TV hosts with contracts of more than six months and/or Â£10,000 per year were employed that way from 2008-12. A year ago, former Look North presenter Christa Ackroyd, who was among those who set up personal service companies, was left with a tax bill of up to Â£420,000 after losing a case against HMRC. Ex-BBC presenter facing Â£420k tax bill The BBC was also questioned over theEastEnders set rebuild going Â£27m over budget. The original 2015 forecast for the scheme was Â£59.7m, but the revised budget is now Â£86.7m, the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed last year. The corporation is building a new Albert Square and extending the set. Lord Hall explained there had been ""issues round inflation"" and ""around the nature of the contract. And we came across problems to do with asbestos which we couldn't have foreseen"". A brand new Queen Vic pub is being built as part of the new set But he added that having the new set should help increase audience figures for the soap, saying: ""I believe in this investment hugely."" Richard Dawkins, chief operating officer of BBC Content, explained that 18% of the budget had been set aside as contingency money to deal with asbestos etc. He was then asked by Labour MP Chris Evans why the project went so over budget, given the contingency plans. ""The risk was known and money was set aside to deal with it, but the full extent of the work required cannot be defined until you're in the ground and on site,"" Mr Dawkins said. ""It has taken longer as we know, and the budget is higher at the end than where we started, but these are factors driven by the market, which I think has been experienced by many organisations over recent years."" The BBC's deputy director general Ann Bulford said: ""We haven't wasted money, we just didn't estimate enough money for it at the start."" Asked if they could have moved EastEnders from Elstree to another site, Ms Bulford said they did look at that as an option ""but the conclusion was the best value for money... was to continue where we were"". Mr Evans than asked if flying an aeroplane into the EastEnders set and then starting over - in the style of an Emmerdale plotline a few years ago - might have made more financial sense. Lord Hall joked: ""I think we are now in W1A territory and I don't blame you for suggesting that but no,"" referring to the BBC's spoof comedy drama.

"Boy, 17, stabbed to death in street attack","Nedim Bilgin died at the scene in north London Three teenagers have been arrested after a 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in a street attack in north London. The victim, who died at the scene on Caledonian Road, Islington, on Tuesday, has been named as Nedim Bilgin. Two male suspects, aged 16 and 17, were arrested nearby on suspicion of murder, and an 18-year-old man was arrested at an address in Islington, the Met Police said. All three remain in custody. The stabbing happened at about 19:00 GMT, just over a mile (1.6km) away from The Emirates stadium, where Arsenal played Cardiff City. Supporters were told to avoid Caledonian Road after the match. How London's deadliest year in a decade began Can Chicago cure London's violence? Murder victim's family leave UK and say London 'too dangerous' A post-mortem examination is due to be held, Scotland Yard said. The teenage victim is the fifth person to be fatally stabbed in London so far this year. The attack happened in Caledonian Road just before 19:00 GMT on Tuesday Islington councillor Paul Convery said Caledonian Road had been blighted by tensions between gang rivalries for years. ""There is long-running antagonism between the Cally Boyz and EC1,"" he said. ""Violence in this area has been happening quite regularly and there has been a growing concern something more tragic could happen. ""I arrived at the scene about an hour after the stabbing and saw the distressed relatives."" Two teenagers were arrested close to the crime scene and a third was later arrested at a home in Islington Mr Convery said the fatal stabbing had ""unpleasant parallels"" with the death of another teenager, Alan Cartwright,who was murdered on Caledonian Road in 2015. Ch Supt Nick Davies confirmed the victim lived in Islington and that police patrols in the area would be ""stepped up"". He said: ""I completely understand the alarm and concern it has raised from those who live and work in the area. ""Tragically the local community is now coming to terms with the senseless loss of life of a young man who had everything to live for."" Detectives are expected to be at Caledonian Road for the rest of the day Elsewhere in the capital on Tuesday, a woman was found with stab injuries in Baring Road, Bromley, and in a separate attack a man was stabbed in Spray Street, Woolwich. Both victims were taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

Jermaine Jackson: 'Michael is innocent',"Jermaine Jackson: ""We're living in a time where people can say anything and it's taken as truth."" Jermaine Jackson has said there is ""no truth"" to allegations in a controversial new documentary about his brother Michael. In Leaving Neverland, James Safechuck and Wade Robson claim they were abused by the singer as children. Mr Robson acted as a main witness for Michael Jackson at his 2005 trial, but has now changed his story. Jermaine told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""Michael was tried by a jury of his peers and he was acquitted."" He added: ""There was no real evidence, there was nothing there and I will say this - our family are tired."" The four-hour documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last week and was seen to be so shocking that audiences were offered emotional support in the interval. Mr Robson and Mr Safechuck were aged seven and 10 when the singer befriended them and their families. Mr Robson said under oath in 2005 that the pop star never abused him, but has now rowed back on this. Jackson's estate has previously condemned the film, saying it is ""an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in"" on the singer, who died in 2009 at the age of 50. Jackson died in 2009 at the age of 50 The film's director Dan Reed defended the documentary, saying he believed what the men were alleging in the film. ""Neither Wade, James or any members of their families were paid for their participation in the film, directly or indirectly,""he told Rolling Stone.,external ""This is not a story about Michael Jackson. It's a story about child sexual abuse that happened to two families whose lives intersected with Jackson. The fact that the abuser is Michael Jackson gives the film a reach and a relevance that I welcome."" 'Let this man rest' Jermaine Jackson maintained Michael's innocence during his interview on Wednesday. ""There were slumber parties, there were girls there with their parents watching movies and eating cookies... ""Let this man rest. He did a lot for the world, let him rest. I'll just say this, there is no truth to this documentary... ""We're living in a time where people can say anything and it's taken as truth.

Gay dating app Scruff bans underwear photos,"Gay dating app Scruff has banned images of men in underwear or swimming trunks, after it was suspended from the Google Play app store several times. Scruff said it had changed its profile picture rules after ""repeated suspensions by app store distributors"" but declined to specify which stores. The app was most recently suspended from Google Play in January, when it disappeared for three days. Google told BBC News it did not comment on individual apps. Several Scruff members responded to the policy change on social media, threatening to delete their accounts. ""Craigslist, Backpage, Tumblr, now even Scruff, a gay dating app you have to be of consenting age to use, is censoring how its users can post photos? This isn't looking so good guys,"" said vlogger Amp Somers, who runs the sex education YouTube channel Watts The Safeword, which has 170,000 subscribers. Scruff is a social network and dating app for gay, bisexual and trans men. Members can browse a grid of profiles and speak to people in their area, or explore other locations. However, it has disappeared from Google Play several times in recent months. In ablog post,externalthat referred to the app's temporary disappearance from Google Play in January, the company said: ""Had this removal been permanent, it would have been devastating to our company and our community."" It had now enacted ""wide-ranging changes to its profile photo content guidelines"" in order to ""ensure continued and full compliance"", the blog post added. The company also told BBC News it took content moderation seriously. Scruff is a location-based social network Google declined to tell BBC News why Scruff had been removed from the app store several times. Part of the challenge facing Scruff and similar apps ""is the fact that different app stores publish guidelines with varying degrees of specificity"", chief executive Eric Silverberg told BBC News. Google does publish a policy for app developers regarding sexually explicit content but it is very short and subject to interpretation. While images of sex toys, sex acts and sex with animals are expressly forbidden, the policy otherwise bans only ""sexually suggestive poses"". Prior to the change, Scruff's policies already forbade: suggestive or explicit sexual acts exposed buttocks covering the genitals with hands, towels or other objects Its updated policy also bans: photos taken in the shower photos in swimming trunks or underwear lowering the waistband to draw attention to the groin Last week, when the updated policy was introduced, it also banned photos of ""hugging and kissing"" but his has now been changed to ""sexually suggestive embraces"" following criticism from its members. Scruff said existing profile photos would be rechecked to ensure compliance with the new policy. Rival dating app Grindr does not allow underwear photos but does allow swimwear ""in context"", such as photos taken on the beach. Tinder's profile guidelines do not give specific examples but do state ""no nudity, no sexually explicit content"". Both Grindr and the LGBT social network Hornet told BBC News they had not been suspended from Google Play. The fetish app Recon is not available on Google Play, although a tamer version of Recon, which filters more explicit profile images, is available on Apple's App Store. While Google declined to comment, it made clear that its moderators did not discriminate based on sexuality or gender identity. In his blog explaining the new policy, Mr Silverberg said the criticism from its members was ""not unfounded"". ""Given that Scruff is a community that speaks openly and positively about sex, bodies, and intimacy, some feel that such policies are at odds with those values,"" he wrote. ""Scruff respects the concerns voiced by our community on this matter, and we encourage everyone to continue to hold us, and all tech companies, accountable for the content and conduct standards we enforce.""

May and Corbyn meet after Commons clash,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clash over Brexit policies Jeremy Corbyn says he told Theresa May ""don't bring no deal back to Parliament"" in their long-awaited face-to-face meeting on Brexit. The Labour leader said it was ""not acceptable"" for the PM to keep the no-deal option on the table after MPs voted against it on Tuesday. After the meeting, Mrs May tweeted: ""The only way to avoid No Deal is to vote for a deal."" MPs will vote on the deal again after she seeks to renegotiate with the EU. Mr Corbyn said it was a ""serious"" meeting and Mrs May had ""listened"". He had refused to meet Mrs May unless she agreed to rule out a no-deal Brexit, but changed his mind after MPs voted against the idea of leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal on Tuesday evening. What could happen next? May scores 'unconventional win' Firms 'speeding up no-deal Brexit plans' Brexit: A really simple guide Labour MPs could face disciplinary action In her tweet, Mrs May said she had been ""pleased"" to meet Mr Corbyn and had stressed the importance of the UK doing its own trade deals after Brexit. A Labour spokesperson said the two would meet again ""soon"" after the 45 minutes of ""cordial"" talks in the prime minister's Commons office. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Corbyn said: ""I set out the Labour case for a comprehensive customs union with the European Union, in order to protect jobs and trade. ""She certainly understood the point that we were making."" He added: ""The last words I said to her were 'don't bring no deal back to Parliament' because it's not acceptable - it's not a sensible or serious way of going forward."" He said he was suspicious the government was trying to ""run down the clock"", and if that appeared to be the case when Parliament discussed Brexit again next month, Labour would ""look at all the options on the table at that time"". Asked if Labour would support or table a motion to try and extend Article 50, which would delay the date of Brexit, Mr Corbyn said: ""That is a question for 13 February."" He added that it was quite possible the prime minister would return to Parliament next month ""with nothing"".

Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The two party leaders earlier clashed over Brexit at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. During the exchange, Mr Corbyn said the prime minister may have succeeded in ""temporarily uniting her very divided party"" in Tuesday's votes on amendments to her plan, but she had to make ""more important compromises"" to ""unite the country"". Mrs May said Mr Corbyn was a ""fine one to talk about coming together"", when he had only now agreed to meet her. She said the majority of MPs had identified the Irish backstop as the main sticking point preventing them from backing her deal, whereas Mr Corbyn's Brexit proposals had been rejected. ""He has no plan for Brexit, no good plan for our economy and no plan for our country,"" she told MPs. This video can not be played Mr Corbyn: 'We are prepared to meet her to put forward the points of view from the Labour Party' MPs voted 317 to 301 in favour of changing the backstop plan - the section of Mrs May's deal with the EU designed to avoid the return of Northern Ireland border checks. Five amendments, including Labour MP Yvette Cooper's bid to delay Brexit if Mrs May does not get her deal through Parliament and Mr Corbyn's own amendment, were defeated on Tuesday. Mr Corbyn asked Mrs May whether, if she did not agree a deal with Brussels that MPs would support, she would back Labour's proposals for a ""a strong single market, comprehensive customs union and the guaranteeing of rights and protections rather than the alternative she has been threatening - to crash out with no-deal"". Mrs May told him: ""You cannot just vote to reject no deal, you have to support a deal."" It was a message she repeated to Labour MP Jack Dromey, who together with Tory MP Caroline Spelman got MPs to back a non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday. Later in the session, Nigel Dodds, leader of the Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, described remarks by the  Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on the UK's approach to Brexit as ""highly reckless and extremely dangerous"". Mr Coveney likened the UK's negotiating stance to ""either you give me what I want or I'm jumping out the window"". Mr Dodds said that kind of rhetoric needed ""to be toned down"". Mrs May said she will speak to Irish premier Leo Varadkar later on Wednesday. ""It is important for us to work with the Irish government on the arrangements that will be in place in the future,"" she added. But ahead of the call, Mr Varadkar told the Irish Parliament that the EU stood by the withdrawal agreement and renegotiation was not on the table. At the moment, the UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, with or without a deal. The UK and the EU negotiated their withdrawal agreement deal over the past 18 months but it needs to be backed by MPs for it to come into force. Earlier this month, MPs voted against the plan Mrs May had proposed by 432 votes to 202. Mrs May said that, after taking Tuesday's votes into account and talking to the EU, any revised deal would be brought back to the Commons ""as soon as possible"" for a second ""meaningful vote"".

EU rejects calls to reopen Brexit deal,"Michel Barnier speaks in the European Parliament, as MEP Nigel Farage takes notes The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier says the Irish backstop is ""part and parcel"" of the UK's Brexit deal and will not be renegotiated. Speaking at the European Parliament, Mr Barnier said it was a ""realistic solution"" to preventing a hard border. British MPs voted earlier this month against the deal agreed by the UK and EU during 18 months of negotiations. Instead, on Tuesday, they voted for PM Theresa May to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop. The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March. The backstop is an ""insurance"" policy to stop the return of checks on goods and people along the Northern Ireland border. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments May and Corbyn meet after Commons clash Brexit: What could happen next? As it stands, the backstop would effectively keep the UK inside the EU's customs union, but with Northern Ireland also conforming to some rules of the single market. It was one of the main reasons Mrs May's Brexit deal was voted down in Parliament by an historic margin earlier in January as critics say a different status for Northern Ireland could threaten the existence of the UK and fear that the backstop could become permanent. Mrs May has said there are several possible alternatives to the backstop that she wanted to discuss with EU leaders. These include a ""trusted trader"" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border, ""mutual recognition"" of rules with the EU and ""technological"" solutions. However, Business Secretary Greg Clark told ITV's Peston programme that he did not think ""those technical possibilities are there yet"". Mrs May also wants to discuss a time limit on the backstop and a ""unilateral exit"" mechanism - both options ruled out by the EU in the past. May scores 'unconventional win' Firms 'speeding up no-deal Brexit plans' Brexit: A really simple guide The message from the EU though was the backstop remained an integral part of the withdrawal agreement - the so-called ""divorce deal"" agreeing the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. Mr Barnier said: ""Calmly and clearly, I will say right here and now - with this withdrawal agreement proposed for ratification - we need this backstop as it is. ""Rejecting the backstop as it stands today boils down to rejecting the solution which has been found with the British, but the problem remains."" Mrs May had a 45-minute phone call with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, on Wednesday evening, described as ""open and frank"" by one source. They told BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming that the PM had explained the result of the votes, but Mr Tusk reiterated the withdrawal agreement was not up for renegotiation. The source also said Mrs May was told the EU could not keep guessing what might work, so it was up to the UK to provide solutions that could get a majority in the Commons. The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, also spoke to Mrs May and said the latest developments had ""reinforced the need for a backstop which is legally robust and workable in practice"". Earlier, his deputy, Simon Coveney, gave a warning over Mrs May's future plans for the backstop, saying that anyone who allowed the ""borders and divisions of the past"" to return would be ""judged harshly in history"". He added: ""There are some things that are more important than economic relationships and this is one of them."" This video can not be played Border more important than ""economic relationships"" President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said he believed Mrs May's ""personal commitment"" to avoid ""slipping back to darker times past"", but he said the ""safety net"" of the backstop was necessary to prevent it. He added: ""We have no desire to use this safety net, [but] no safety net can be truly safe if it can just be removed at any time."" But UK MEP Nigel Farage attacked the EU, claiming it had pushed Mrs May into the backstop in the first place. The former UKIP leader told the European Parliament: ""I accept [Mrs May] made a dreadful mistake by signing up to the backstop, [but] you summoned her at 04:15 in the morning, she left Downing Street, she went to meet the ultimatum you set her. ""She signed up to something that has proved to be a disaster. She signed up to something that no country, unless it had been defeated in war, would have signed up to. ""We now realise that mistake and the House of Commons, the country is overall looking for a deal."" And Conservative MEP Ashley Fox said the backstop would create a hard border, rather than prevent one, unless it was amended. At the same time as the European Parliament was discussing Brexit, Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were holding their long-awaited meeting on the issue, following an earlier clash at Prime Minister's Questions. In the Commons Mr Corbyn repeatedly urged Mrs May to rule out a no-deal Brexit after a majority of MPs voted against the prospect in another vote on Tuesday. But Mrs May said: ""You cannot just vote to reject no deal, you have to support a deal."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clash over Brexit policies Their later meeting, away from the cameras, was ""very cordial"", according to a Labour spokesperson. ""There was a useful exchange of views. We made the case for our plan. There was a detailed exchange of views on a customs union and single market relationship."" The pair agreed to meet again soon, the spokesperson added. The European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, echoed his colleagues by criticising the UK for not being clear about what they wanted from the deal. He said the two years had been ""exhausting"" on both sides of the Channel, and called for Mrs May and Mr Corbyn to work together - ""not only eating biscuits and drinking tea"" - to come to a cross-party solution and to stop ""using and abusing Brexit to get rid of each other"". Mr Juncker said the votes in the Commons on Tuesday increased the risk of a ""disorderly"" Brexit, but he still believed there could be a deal done between the EU and UK, adding: ""We will work day and night to make it happen, and to ensure we are ready in case it does not.""

Cushions 'from missing Sala plane' found,"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson (right) An underwater search for footballer Emiliano Sala's plane will take place after cushions were found on a beach. They were discovered near Surtainville on France's Cotentin Peninsula, on Monday, by French authorities. Following this, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has identified an area of four square nautical miles for a search. The plane disappeared with Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, on board last week. Nantes pay tribute to missing Sala Due to weather and sea conditions, an underwater search is not expected to start until the end of the week and will take up to three days, an AAIB spokesman said. Unverified photographs of cushions, taken on Wednesday, were captured by a woman taking a walk on the beach near Surtainville. Investigators believe the two seat cushions pictured came from the aircraft. Josette Bernard shows a photograph she took of debris she found on the beach at Surtainville This unverified image shows a cushion which was found on the beach, believed to be from the plane Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson were flying on The AAIB will now use sonar equipment to locate any wreckage on the sea bed. A spokesman said French safety authorities found the two seat cushions, which preliminary examinations suggested were likely from the missing aircraft. Following this, detailed assessments of the flight path and last known radar position were carried out, which identified the search area. The PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft Sala and Mr Ibbotson were on board Through the Ministry of Defence's salvage and marine operations team, a special survey vessel has now been commissioned to look for wreckage. If it is found, a remotely operated vehicle will be sent down to examine it. Emiliano Sala: Tributes to striker at Arsenal v Cardiff game Emiliano Sala's family view search area off Guernsey Argentine Sala signed for Cardiff City and was travelling from Nantes, where he previously played, when the flight was lost over the English channel. An official search for it was called off with Guernsey officials saying there was little chance those on board survived, however,more than Â£290,000 was raisedfor a private search to continue. The cushions were found on a stretch of the Normandy coast near Surtainville ""We are aware that a privately operated search is also being conducted in the area,"" an AAIB statement said.

Triple baby killer may go to open prison,"Simon Smith was pictured the night before murdering his three-month-old daughter Lauren A triple killer who murdered his own babies by suffocating them is set to be moved to an open prison. Simon Smith killed three-month-old Lauren, six-month-old Jamie and Eleisha, 10 months, between 1989 and 1994 in Staffordshire. The Parole Board said Smith was ""suitable"" for the move, which would prepare him for possible release. Lauren's mum Rachel Playfair said Smith was pure evil and she would do anything she could to ""get this overturned"". ""For him to have robbed me of my one chance to be a mother is really difficult to live with,"" she said. Eleisha and Jamie, his children by a previous marriage, were initially believed to have suffered cot deaths. But an investigation began when his third child, Lauren, died of asphyxiation a year after Jamie. Rachel Playfair said justice for her, would be for Smith to stay in a ""secure environment"" Smith was jailed in 1996 and Mr Justice McKinnon told him he would be failing in his duty if he did not recommend that in this case a life sentence should mean life. But at the time decisions on the minimum length of a life sentence were made by the home secretary - the responsibility was handed to judgeswhen the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was implemented,external- and Smith was told he would serve at least 24 years. Mrs Playfair said she believed Smith had been in Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire. The killer was seen by a parole board two years ago, Mrs Playfair told the BBC, but ""my victim impact [statement] played a big part in keeping him in a secure jail"". ""How, in two years, can he suddenly not be a risk to the public?"" Simon Smith is ""pure evil"", Mrs Playfair said ""My biggest fear is that he will be released from prison and find another woman. He's only 50, so he can father another child. ""He is pure evil. He only killed his own flesh and blood. ""The judge repeatedly said life means life. What he did was premeditated. He knew exactly what he was doing."" Police led an inquiry into the deaths of Eleisha (left) and Jamie His trial at Stafford Crown Court heard that because Lauren was crying, Smith had taken her to Westbridge Park in Stone, where he pushed her face into a car seat before taking her home and suffocating her with his hand. Smith, who was a trainee assistant in a care home, admitted to police he had killed her but insisted his two other babies had suffered cot deaths. Latest news from the West Midlands Police led an inquiry and brought expert witnesses to court, who said the infants could have been suffocated. Mrs Playfair said she believed her daughter had been born to get justice for the two other babies. ""If Lauren had not died, they would not have investigated the other two deaths.""

Cushions from Sala plane found,"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson (right) An underwater search for footballer Emiliano Sala's plane will take place after cushions were found on a beach. They were discovered near Surtainville on France's Cotentin Peninsula, on Monday, by French authorities. Following this, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has identified an area of four square nautical miles for a search. The plane disappeared with Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, on board last week. Nantes pay tribute to missing Sala Due to weather and sea conditions, an underwater search is not expected to start until the end of the week and will take up to three days, an AAIB spokesman said. Unverified photographs of cushions, taken on Wednesday, were captured by a woman taking a walk on the beach near Surtainville. Investigators believe the two seat cushions pictured came from the aircraft. Josette Bernard shows a photograph she took of debris she found on the beach at Surtainville This unverified image shows a cushion which was found on the beach, believed to be from the plane Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson were flying on The AAIB will now use sonar equipment to locate any wreckage on the sea bed. A spokesman said French safety authorities found the two seat cushions, which preliminary examinations suggested were likely from the missing aircraft. Following this, detailed assessments of the flight path and last known radar position were carried out, which identified the search area. The PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft Sala and Mr Ibbotson were on board Through the Ministry of Defence's salvage and marine operations team, a special survey vessel has now been commissioned to look for wreckage. If it is found, a remotely operated vehicle will be sent down to examine it. Emiliano Sala: Tributes to striker at Arsenal v Cardiff game Emiliano Sala's family view search area off Guernsey Argentine Sala signed for Cardiff City and was travelling from Nantes, where he previously played, when the flight was lost over the English channel. An official search for it was called off with Guernsey officials saying there was little chance those on board survived, however,more than Â£290,000 was raisedfor a private search to continue. The cushions were found on a stretch of the Normandy coast near Surtainville ""We are aware that a privately operated search is also being conducted in the area,"" an AAIB statement said.

Wrongly jailed men lose compensation fight,"Sam Hallam speaking outside the Supreme Court after losing his fight for compensation Two men who were wrongly jailed for a total of 24 years have lost their fight for compensation from the government. Sam Hallamserved seven years after being convicted of murderand Victor Nealonserved 17 years after being found guilty of attempted rape. Despite their convictions being overturned, current legislation requires them to prove their innocence in order to claim compensation. The Supreme Court dismissed claims this violated ""presumption of innocence"". Speaking after the ruling on Wednesday, Mr Hallam said the law was ""terrible"". Wrongfully jailed man gets apology Court quashes murder conviction Mr Hallam, of Hoxton, east London, was sentenced to a minimum of 12 years in prison for the murder of trainee chef Essayas Kassahun, 21, in Clerkenwell, central London, in 2004. Mr Nealon, who is originally from Dublin, was given a life sentence after he was found guilty of the attempted rape of a woman in Redditch, Worcestershire. His conviction was quashed in 2013, and Mr Hallam's in 2012, after appeal judges ruled that fresh evidence made their convictions unsafe. Victor Nealon was convicted of attacking a woman outside a nightclub The two men took their legal battle to the UK's highest court following defeats at the High Court and the Court of Appeal after each had their applications for compensation rejected by the government. On Wednesday, seven Supreme Court justices dismissed their appeals by a majority of five to two. The court declined to make a declaration that the refusal to award them compensation was incompatible with their human rights. In a statement after the ruling, Mr Hallam said he was ""completely innocent"", adding: ""In 2019 I am still having to fight to prove my innocence. This is a very disappointing decision. ""My lawyers will look at an appeal or what I can do next. This terrible law needs to be changed."" A charity which works on miscarriages of justice cases criticised the ruling. Emily Bolton, legal director of law charity the Centre for Criminal Appeals, said: ""The Supreme Court was wrong not to declare this shameful law incompatible with the presumption of innocence. ""Miscarriages of justice destroy lives. Victims of them can never be truly 'compensated' but the current law needs to be scrapped. ""The government should act to ensure all miscarriage of justice victims get the apologies they deserve as well as the support they need to help rebuild their lives."" Students' high court bid to clear man's name Was this woman wrongly convicted of murder? When the men's challenges were originally aired at the High Court in 2015, they asked judges to rule that UK law is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) because it wrongly restricts compensation in miscarriage of justice cases. Their lawyers argued that amendments to the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which governs compensation payments, violated Article 6 (2) of the ECHR - the presumption of innocence - because it meant a person seeking compensation had to prove their innocence. But their claims were rejected on the basis that it was not the case - as required by the act - that a ""new or newly discovered fact"" showed beyond reasonable doubt that there had been a miscarriage of justice.

Gay dating app Scruff bans underwear,"Gay dating app Scruff has banned images of men in underwear or swimming trunks, after it was suspended from the Google Play app store several times. Scruff said it had changed its profile picture rules after ""repeated suspensions by app store distributors"" but declined to specify which stores. The app was most recently suspended from Google Play in January, when it disappeared for three days. Google told BBC News it did not comment on individual apps. Several Scruff members responded to the policy change on social media, threatening to delete their accounts. ""Craigslist, Backpage, Tumblr, now even Scruff, a gay dating app you have to be of consenting age to use, is censoring how its users can post photos? This isn't looking so good guys,"" said vlogger Amp Somers, who runs the sex education YouTube channel Watts The Safeword, which has 170,000 subscribers. Scruff is a social network and dating app for gay, bisexual and trans men. Members can browse a grid of profiles and speak to people in their area, or explore other locations. However, it has disappeared from Google Play several times in recent months. In ablog post,externalthat referred to the app's temporary disappearance from Google Play in January, the company said: ""Had this removal been permanent, it would have been devastating to our company and our community."" It had now enacted ""wide-ranging changes to its profile photo content guidelines"" in order to ""ensure continued and full compliance"", the blog post added. The company also told BBC News it took content moderation seriously. Scruff is a location-based social network Google declined to tell BBC News why Scruff had been removed from the app store several times. Part of the challenge facing Scruff and similar apps ""is the fact that different app stores publish guidelines with varying degrees of specificity"", chief executive Eric Silverberg told BBC News. Google does publish a policy for app developers regarding sexually explicit content but it is very short and subject to interpretation. While images of sex toys, sex acts and sex with animals are expressly forbidden, the policy otherwise bans only ""sexually suggestive poses"". Prior to the change, Scruff's policies already forbade: suggestive or explicit sexual acts exposed buttocks covering the genitals with hands, towels or other objects Its updated policy also bans: photos taken in the shower photos in swimming trunks or underwear lowering the waistband to draw attention to the groin Last week, when the updated policy was introduced, it also banned photos of ""hugging and kissing"" but his has now been changed to ""sexually suggestive embraces"" following criticism from its members. Scruff said existing profile photos would be rechecked to ensure compliance with the new policy. Rival dating app Grindr does not allow underwear photos but does allow swimwear ""in context"", such as photos taken on the beach. Tinder's profile guidelines do not give specific examples but do state ""no nudity, no sexually explicit content"". Both Grindr and the LGBT social network Hornet told BBC News they had not been suspended from Google Play. The fetish app Recon is not available on Google Play, although a tamer version of Recon, which filters more explicit profile images, is available on Apple's App Store. While Google declined to comment, it made clear that its moderators did not discriminate based on sexuality or gender identity. In his blog explaining the new policy, Mr Silverberg said the criticism from its members was ""not unfounded"". ""Given that Scruff is a community that speaks openly and positively about sex, bodies, and intimacy, some feel that such policies are at odds with those values,"" he wrote. ""Scruff respects the concerns voiced by our community on this matter, and we encourage everyone to continue to hold us, and all tech companies, accountable for the content and conduct standards we enforce.""

Bus journeys fall by 90 million,"About 4.8bn journeys were made by bus in Great Britain in 2017-18 The number of bus journeys taken in Great Britain fell by more than 90 million in one year, official figures show. In 2017-18 there were 4.8bn bus journeys made, down 2% on 2016-17. Councils say they are ""desperate"" to protect services but funding cuts forced ""difficult decisions"". The Department for Transport (DfT) said it helped subsidise buses with Â£250m a year in investment. South-east and south-west England are the only regions to see the number of journeys increase in the past decade. The latest figures published by theDepartment for Transport,external(DfT) show bus fares across Great Britain have risen by 21% in real terms since 2008. Councils say they have had to reduce subsidies for bus routes due to cuts to their own budgets, which has led to services being withdrawn. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said: ""Councils know how important buses are for their residents and local economies and are desperate to protect them. ""It's nearly impossible for councils to keep subsidising free travel while having to find billions of pounds worth of savings and protect other vital services like caring for the elderly and disabled, protecting children, filling potholes and collecting bins. ""Faced with significant funding pressures, many across the country are being forced into taking difficult decisions to scale back services and review subsidised routes."" In England, the number of journeys fell by almost 85m. Scotland saw a drop of 6m while Wales recorded a fall of 267,000 journeys. Figures for England were broken down by local authority and showed nine local where journeys dropped by at least 10% in the past year. In Hertfordshire, the DfT figures showed there were 28.6m journeys made in 2017-18, down from 37.8m the year before and a fall of 24%. Hertfordshire County Council said: ""The reduction in bus use is likely to be lower than suggested by this analysis, but is part of a national trend in declining use. We are working with bus operators and local authorities to put in place measures to increase use of bus services."" 'Not good enough' Maureen Crowther from Bradford says cuts to bus services have angered many people in her community Bus user Maureen Crowther said services in and around Bradford, West Yorkshire have been ""drastically"" cut in recent years. ""I moved here 30 years ago and back then we had a bus every 20 minutes,"" she said. ""People need a good bus service to get to work, school or just go to the shops. It makes me very angry because we need a bus service and the one we've now got is just not good enough"". Mrs Crowther, 71, gathered a petition of nearly 900 signatures opposing a decision by First Buses to reduce the 671 service in Bradford, from a half hour service to an hourly one. ""Elderly people have been really badly affected by cuts to bus services,"" she said. ""An hourly service has left people isolated and stuck in their house."" Martin Hirst, commercial director at First West Yorkshire, said: ""We are committed to providing reliable and affordable bus services across Bradford and we worked hard to ensure that all network connections remained in place and that nobody was left without a bus service in their local area."" He said the company had to balance the level of service with ""customer demand"". Government loses criminal records appeal Travellers face delay amid snow and ice In England, more than half of all bus journeys are made within London. Bus use outside London has been falling since 2008-09, from a peak of 2.41bn journeys to 2.13bn in 2017-18. Journeys in London have also declined but are still higher than in 2005. Darren Shirley, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said bus cuts were making it harder for people to get to work or school, to visit friends and family, or to access shops and services. ""We want to see a national strategy for buses, like already exists for road and rail, backed up by proper funding from central government, to start to reverse their decline,"" he said. Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said cuts to bus services had had a ""devastating impact"". ""People are being denied opportunities in work and education and are cut off from friends and family, particularly those in rural areas or from low income backgrounds,"" he said. ""At the same time, cutting and withdrawing services is worsening congestion, air pollution and our impact on climate change."" A DfT spokeswoman said: ""It is for councils to decide which bus operations to support in their areas, but we help to subsidise costs through around Â£250 million worth of investment every year. ""Â£42 million of this is already devolved to local authorities and a further Â£1 billion funds the free bus pass scheme, benefiting older and disabled people across the country.""

EU waits in silence for UK's grand plan,"EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier chats with commissioner and former Irish minister Phil Hogan After a public shout-out of ""no way!"" to renegotiating the Brexit backstop plan or draft withdrawal agreement, the EU now waits for the British prime minister to come to Brussels. Parliament appeared to lob the ball back in the EU's court last night, with the majority of MPs uniting around a request for alternatives to the backstop. But the EU is preparing to swing it back to the UK pronto, with a direct question to Theresa May: ""What concrete alternative do you have worked out?"" Remember that EU and UK negotiators spent 18 difficult months trying to come up with a bilaterally acceptable fallback mechanism to keep the Irish border open, in case their (still to be negotiated) post-Brexit trade deal wasn't up and running in time, or didn't fully resolve the issue. The UK-wide customs aspect of the backstop plan - where the whole of the UK would stay in a customs agreement with the EU to avoid Northern Ireland being ""isolated"" from Great Britain by remaining under EU regulations to avoid border checks - came at the prime minister's insistence, not the EU's. UK PM scores ""unconventional win"" European press lose patience with UK Brexit: All you need to know Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? No other workable alternative was found and the document was signed off by the cabinet and 27 EU leaders in late November. Touching the backstop text risks the EU seeming disloyal to member state Ireland, while caving in to departing member UK. That's a message of ""weakness"" Brussels does not want to send to international trade partners, or to the not-exactly-EU-enthusiastic governments of Poland and Italy, for example. It also risks contravening the Good Friday Agreement and the integrity of the single market. But... when push comes to shove, EU leaders want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. If it comes about, they will be answerable to their voters whose lives and businesses could well be affected. So, while taking a hard line in public, those leaders are also doing some hard thinking behind closed doors. This does not mean Brussels will do anything to get a deal. This video can not be played Numbers and nods: MPs back May's bid to change deal When it comes to the backstop, EU leaders will resist compromising on core principles. Theresa May has spoken again of seeking a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit mechanism for the UK. EU diplomats tell me she has to be more realistic. Brussels intends to stonewall her until ""the message is driven home"", they say. Expect the EU to stand very firm for now and for some tense days ahead. Brussels' deadline is 29 March, whereas the prime minister, who has promised to hold another vote on the Brexit deal, has a self-imposed deadline of mid-February. The EU will not rush to help her with that one. Brussels takes heart from the fact that the Brady amendment on the backstop, passed last night by a majority of MPs, is actually pretty ambiguous. ""If Theresa May seeks changes to the backstop,"" according to one diplomat I spoke to, ""then that might be fine if she widens her thinking as to what constitutes a 'change'."" The amendment talks about finding ""alternatives"" to the backstop. And this is something the Withdrawal Agreement already says both the EU and UK would be open to if alternatives became viable. One thought doing the EU rounds is to attach a list of possible alternatives to the backstop text. This could include technological solutions the more hard-line conservative MPs are so keen on. The EU has said time and again that technology alone is not adequate to totally do away with physical checks on the border but the option could be placed on a list of potential alternatives to be judged - as to whether they are actually workable or not - at a later stage were the backstop ever to be needed. Another idea is to take the UK-wide customs aspect out of the backstop, seeing that it provoked so much opposition in the UK, adding it instead to the above-mentioned list of ""alternatives"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. There is at the moment a huge amount of resentment in EU circles that so much about Brexit seems to them to be ""all about appeasing the Conservative Party"": the referendum itself, Theresa May's ""red lines"" on leaving the customs union and single market, and now the push for more on the divorce deal which UK civil servants negotiated and which the Prime Minister herself signed off on. EU leaders are in no hurry to convene another Brussels summit - which they would need to do if the withdrawal agreement text were to be changed. The last thing they want is to be holding one every two weeks for Theresa May until Brexit day, should she be pushed by MPs to keep coming back for more. They hope EU unity - so palpable until now - will hold while the pressure mounts. At some point in the near future, Europe's leaders will decide the right time has come to engage. To their mind, that's clearly not now. For the prime minister it will be an uncomfortable wait. Europe papers lose patience with UK Brexit amendments: How did my MP vote?

Facebook paid teens to mine device data,"Facebook denies it specifically targeted teens with its research programme Facebook is halting a scheme that gathered highly personal data from paid volunteers, after it was exposed. TechCrunch said,externalparticipants - including those aged 13-17 - had been paid up to $20 (Â£15.30) a month to open up their phones to deep analysis. Apple has said Facebook misused its privileges to distribute the app involved. The iPhone-maker has now restricted Facebook's ability to issue iOS apps that are not listed on its App Store. This will disrupt the social network's ability to distribute test versions of its software among staff and for the employees to run apps designed for their exclusive use, which are used to do things such as book transportation. This could add to tensions between the two companies. A spokeswoman for the social network was unable to say whether it ran the programme in the UK or other countries outside the US. TechCrunch reported that Facebook used social media ads to target teenagers for the scheme. Facebook denies this. On Wednesday, it was also revealed that Google maintained an app that paid some users to monitor their usage habits. Google says it has now disabled the app. The app had the potential to provide Facebook with ""nearly limitless access"" to a user's device including: the contents of private messages in chat apps including photos and videos emails web browsing activity logs of what apps were installed, and when they were used a location history of where the owner had physically been data usage In addition, TechCrunch reported that users were asked to provide screenshots of their Amazon orders. When the BBC visited one of the sign-up pages, it stated that Facebook would use the information to improve its services. It added that ""there are some instances when we will collect this information even where the app uses encryption, or from within secure browser sessions"". It added that participants had to agree not to disclose ""any information about this project to third parties"". The social network said everyone involved in the programme had consented, and that market research was standard practice. However, in the hours after TechCrunch's report was published, Facebook said it would end the programme on Apple devices. It has not, however, suspended a parallel effort on Android. The research focused on users aged 13-35, and those under 18 were asked to get signed parental consent, Facebook said. Facebook remains the most popular social media app among UK 12-to-15-year-olds according to a recent Ofcom report However, when the BBC identified itself as a 14-year-old boy during its test, it was able to download the app without any parental consent being sought. A page did state, however, that users should be over the age of 18. A reporter from BuzzFeed Newstried signing up via an alternative registration page,external, where obtaining parental consent involved sharing an email address and clicking a tick box. He said this form did not mention Facebook by name. In a statement, Facebook took issue with TechCrunch's characterisation of the programme. ""Key facts about this market research programme are being ignored,"" a spokeswoman said via email. ""Despite early reports, there was nothing 'secret' about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App. It wasn't 'spying' as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate. ""Finally, less than 5% of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms."" Facebook 'less popular with UK children' Children 'afterthought' for social media companies Facebook defends Mark Zuckerberg's exposed emails Meet the data guardians taking on the tech giants When asked by the BBC how exactly the parental consent was obtained, Facebook said it was handled by a third party and did not elaborate. Apple has accused Facebook of abusing a system designed to distribute software to staff to carry out the scheme. ""We designed our Enterprise Developer Programme solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organisation,"" it said in a statement. ""Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple. ""Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data."" Facebook has yet to respond to the punishment. There is also an app for devices running on Android distributed outside of Google's Play Store. TechCrunchâs detailed report explained Facebook had previously conducted market research using a virtual private network (VPN) app called Onavo, which it acquired in 2013. Internal documents,published online in December, revealed Facebook had used the data gathered to decide to takeover WhatsApp and track usage of rivals including Snapchat and Twitter's former video service Vine. But in August last year, Facebook removed the app from the App Storeafter Apple complained that violated its data-collection rules,external. However, Facebook had another research app that it had been running since 2016. It circumvented Appleâs App Store by using testing tools typically used to install software that is still in development. The app installed a âroot certificateâ, which enabled deeper access to a phoneâs software including functions not reachable by typical apps. Apple allows the installation of root certificates in narrow cases, such as for companies that provide employees with iPhones but want to install internal apps, monitoring capabilities and extra security. But Appleâs Developer Enterprise Program License Agreement makes it clear that these certificates must only be used for âspecific business purposesâ and âonly for use by your employeesâ. There are scenarios that allow exceptions to the rule, the policy goes on to say. But market research is not one of them. Facebook had earlier insisted its market research policies were not unusual. ""Like many companies, we invite people to participate in research that helps us identify things we can be doing better,â it said. ""Since this research is aimed at helping Facebook understand how people use their mobile devices, we've provided extensive information about the type of data we collect and how they can participate. ""We don't share this information with others and people can stop participating at any time."" ________ Additional reporting by Leo Kelion Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

No-deal medicine shortage 'could cancel ops',"NHS trusts could ""quickly run out of vital medicine"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the chief executive of a leading hospital group has warned. Dr David Rosser of University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) said that, despite NHS stockpiling, shortages would likely occur due to ""unprecedented"" distribution challenges. Medicine shortages could lead to some operations being postponed, he said. The Department of Health said planning for a no-deal Brexit was ""ongoing"". It added: ""We are working closely with the NHS, industry and the supply chain to make detailed plans to ensure continued access to healthcare, medical devices and clinical supplies in the event of no deal."" No-deal Brexit: Should NHS patients be worried? Brexit: MPs back May's bid to change deal Is the NHS already finding it hard to get medicines? Pharmacists warn of a 'surge' in shortage of common medicines Six key questions Brexit poses for the NHS Dr Rosser, chief executive officer of the Birmingham trust, made the warning ina paper presented to the trust's board,externallast week. In his memo, Dr Rosser said: ""In terms of the potential for major operational impact and severe and widespread risks to public safety, by far the greatest concern is the availability of medicines, devices and clinical supplies."" He added that a Department of Health report into which medicines were likely to face shortages had ""not been made available"" to NHS trusts but that ""it is assumed that a significant proportion of the medicines and consumables we use at UHB on a daily basis may be at risk"". Dr Rosser pointed to the possibility that equipment and medicines may not be available to manage the care of patients having complex surgery. ""In the context of an individual, no-urgent case, there would be no question that the correct decision would be to postpone the intervention,"" he said. This could ""significantly affect waiting times"" for patients, he said in his memo. We have heard plenty about the risk to staffing and supply of medicines when it comes to a no-deal Brexit - so the cancelling of operations is, in some ways, a logical extension of that. The paper produced by this trust acknowledges that, saying the risk is ""unquantifiable"". Hospitals regularly cancel non-urgent operations, like minor hip and knee procedures, as a way of managing pressure. Last winter, operations were cancelled en-masse as A&E struggled. Even this winter, which has been somewhat easier for the NHS, has seen some cancellations. If medicines ran short, this would be a tried-and-tested approach to ensuring the sickest were prioritised. But a lot of things have to take place first for that to start happening. On Tuesday, MPs backed an amendment in Parliament rejecting a no-deal Brexit, but the vote was not binding - meaning the date for exit remains 29 March. MPs also backed seeking ""alternative arrangements"" to replace the Irish backstop in Theresa May's Brexit plan - but the EU has said it will not change the legal text agreed with the UK PM. Dr Rosser also warned ""a fractious no-deal scenario"" could have a ""major impact"" on EU staff working in the NHS. ""We employ around 1,200 EU staff, of whom 262 are doctors, 375 are nurses or midwives, 320 are scientific or other clinical staff, and the balance are in support services,"" he said. ""All of these people are vital and highly valued colleagues."" No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry? Pharmacists warn of medicine shortage Is NHS finding it hard to get medicines?

Support for actor after 'despicable' attack,"This video can not be played Attacked actor 'has tasted brutality of hatred' Stars are showing their support for actor Jussie Smollett after he was the victim of a suspected hate crime in Chicago. The 35-year-old Empire actor was attacked by two men ""yelling out racial and homophobic slurs"", police say. He was hit in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope was wrapped around his neck. Jussie has told police his attackers also made reference to ""MAGA"" (Make America Great Again). The slogan was used by Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell are among those sharing their support. Naomi Campbell, who starred in the first two seasons of the musical show about a hip-hop mogul whose sons and ex-wife fight over his business, said that one of the most beautiful things to happen to her when working on Empire was meeting Jussie Smollett. Alongside a picture of the two of them, she called on the Mayor of Chicago to catch the ""despicable people"" who have committed this ""act of hate"". Oscar winner Viola Davis shared a photo of Jussie on her Instagram page. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Apple hints at lower iPhone prices,"The global smartphone market is contracting Apple boss Tim Cook has hinted it could lower iPhone prices in some places in an attempt to boost falling sales. Revenue from the iPhone, responsible for most of the firm's profits, fell 15% in its latest financial quarter. Overall the firm's revenue was down 5% from a year ago to about $84.3bn (Â£64.5bn). The slowdown had been expected after the tech giant warned investors earlier this month that revenue would be about $84bn, lower than expected. The firm had blamed the issuespartly on an economic slowdown in China. But chief executive Tim Cook said customers were also struggling with the firm's high prices. He said a strong dollar, which makes its products comparatively more expensive, had hurt its sales in emerging markets. At the moment, according to Apple's official website, an iPhone Xs with a 5.8in display costs from $999 (Â£763) in the US compared with Â£999 in the UK and 8,699 Yuan (Â£989) in China. Mr Cook said the tech giant had started this month to re-price its phones to shield customers from the impact of currency fluctuations. ""What we have done in January in some locations and [for] some products is essentially absorb part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year,"" he said. Still, executives said they expected the firm's challenges to continue. Apple predicted revenue for the three months to 31 March of $55bn-$59bn - suggesting a drop of at least 3.4% year-on-year. ""The macroeconomic environment, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to be there,"" Luca Maestri, the firm's chief financial officer, said. Apple's struggles are not unique. Global smart phone shipments contracted 5% in 2018, according to Canalys, a market analyst firm. But the firm's share price has dropped by around one third since October, amid investor concerns that buyer appetite for iPhones is weakening. Fears intensified after the firm said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sold each quarter. However, Apple shares gained more than 4% in after-hours trade on Tuesday, as the firm proved more resilient than expected. Quarterly sales revenue dropped by more than 25% in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, compared to the year before. Sales also slipped about 3% year-on-year in Europe. But in the Americas - the firm's single biggest region - sales were up almost 5%. Revenue from the services business also jumped 19% to a record $10.9bn in the quarter, which ended on the 31 December. It's Apple's worst performing quarter for years, but that's not to say investors won't be mildly relieved. After the firm's warning earlier this month that it would be posting earnings well below expectations for what is typically its blockbuster quarter, investors were well-prepared to see the drop in iPhone sales, and as a result, revenues overall. That bad news was balanced out - perhaps even cancelled out - by the good news on services. A big increase compared to this time last year - 19% - and a very healthy gross margin of 62.8%. Apple is transitioning, slowly, into a different kind of company that isn't so reliant on hardware, and these numbers show that so far that transition is going well. With $245bn cash in hand, it can afford to splash out and make investors even happier with a major acquisition or two in the entertainment space (but then, I've been saying that for a while now!). Mr Cook said he remained confident in the business, pointing to strong sales of iPad and Macs, as well as growth in its services division, which includes Apple Pay. Overall profit in the quarter fell less than 1% to $19.97bn. ""While it was disappointing to miss our revenue guidance, we manage Apple for the long term, and this quarter's results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide,""  he said.

Firms 'speeding up no-deal Brexit plans',"This video can not be played Carolyn Fairbairn said a plan to renegotiate the UK's withdrawal deal ""feels like a real throw of the dice"" UK companies are likely to speed up plans for a no-deal Brexit in response to Tuesday's votes in Parliament, the head of the CBI has told the BBC. Carolyn Fairbairn said a plan to renegotiate the UK's withdrawal deal ""feels like a real throw of the dice"". ""I don't think there will be a single business this morning who is stopping or halting their no-deal planning,"" she said in response to the idea. ""I fear they may even be accelerating it,"" she added. Other business groups endorsed the CBI's view that Parliament's opposition to a no-deal Brexit was welcome, while a Northern Ireland business group said there was ""despair"" that commitments to protect its members' interests could be removed. May set for further talks with EU leaders Brexit: What happens now? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' Theresa May is expected to seek further talks with EU leaders in the coming days after MPs voted 317 to 301 in favour of replacing the backstop - the insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland in the event of no deal. The backstop is the main objection that Brexiteers in the Conservative party have to the deal negotiated by Mrs May, which was heavily rejected by MPs earlier this month in the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. The EU has already said it will not change the legal text of the deal. This video can not be played Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop Ms Fairbairn said the reaction of businesses to the outcome of Tuesday's voting would be one of ""rising frustration and concern"". She said Parliament had shown that there was ""a consensus against no-deal"", but added: ""It does nothing to take no-deal off the table and it does feel like hope rather than strategy."" The CBI head said businesses in Northern Ireland were ""incredibly concerned"" about the turn that events were taking, adding: ""The backstop is there for a purpose."" One day, technology might be able to solve the Irish border problem, she said, but until that was possible, there had to be ""other arrangements in place"". Ms Fairbairn said many small and medium-sized businesses had done nothing to prepare for the ""shock"" of a ""cliff-edge"" departure from the EU on 29 March. ""I think the kind of concerns that people have around disruption are absolutely right,"" she said. ""No deal is just not manageable at this stage."" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, told the BBC that firms there were ""in despair and really confused"" about what was going on. He said more than 90% of the organisation's members supported the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, and they felt ""let down"" by Tuesday's events in Parliament. He added: ""A deal that doesn't work for Northern Ireland isn't a deal."" Other business groups expressed opposition to a no-deal Brexit. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, called on Mrs May to ""confirm that she will not allow us to slide over the no-deal cliff"". Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said MPs had ""at least made some movement on breaking the Brexit deadlock"". Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Neither government nor many businesses are ready for a no-deal exit in two months' time, and it must not be allowed to happen by default."" Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ""While it is something that MPs have managed to form a majority in any vote, the path ahead is still far from clear.""

Europe papers lose patience with UK,"Newspapers across Europe are scrutinising what just happened inthe latest Brexit story twistand weighing up likely consequences for the European Union. ""The fog over London's government district just will not clear,"" says Germany's Tagesspiegel, calling the House of Commons voting last night ""nothing less than the biggest political crisis on the island since World War II"" and declaring that ""those responsible, especially Theresa May, are unable to implement the choice the British made in June 2016"". ""Two months before Brexit,it seems as if she wants to now challenge the EU to a game of chicken,external: whoever blinks first loses,"" the daily says. Another German publication, Der Spiegel, sees furious lobbying from Spain to put the question of Gibraltar back on the table should the Withdrawal Agreement be reopened. ""If the British now demand further concessions on the Irish question,the Spaniards would probably bring the British overseas territory back into play,external- as before. And other EU countries could make new demands, such as the fishing rights in British waters."" Spain's El Pais says reopening the deal at this stage is a nightmare scenario for Brussels. ""The European Union has run into one of the most feared Brexit scenarios at only 60 days before the deadline set for UK's departure from the EU."" It puts the EU in a difficult position - exposing itself to a no-deal Brexit or ""accepting a very delicate renegotiation that could open a Pandora's Box,external"", the paper says. In an editorial, The Irish Times warns that the ongoing stalemate between London and Brussels raises the risk of what both want to avoid: ""a damaging no-deal exit,external"". ""It appeared up to recently that Theresa May accepted the need for the backstop guarantees. Her volte face, ironically, only underlines the need for a legally operable backstop guarantee."" In France - where President Macron has already delivered a resounding ""Non"" to any backstop unpicking -  Le Figaro says last night's House of Commons vote was ""a way of throwing the ball back in the Europeans' court to push them up against the wall,external, so close to the fatal date of 29 March they give in"". Over in the Netherlands, De Volkskrant is scathing about the warring factions inside the House of Commons. ""The MPs are unable to agree about much and weremaking more noise than the proponents and opponents of Brexit who were protesting outside,external. The Scots do not want a Brexit at all, Labour wants to keep one leg in the EU, the Brexiteers want to go into battle against the EU like Don Quixote, and the Northern Irish unionists want to drag as much money out of London as possible."" Italy's Corriere della Sera paints a truly bleak picture. ""Brexit is not to be delayed andthe spectre of London's no-deal, catastrophic exit from the EU is getting closer,external. If no way out is found at this point, Great Britain will fall into the abyss on 29 March."" Romania's Evenimentul Zilei refers angrily to what it sees as the knock-on effect for EU citizens living in the UK. ""We are facing the second moment ofBritish political obduracy combined with stubbornness,externaland the constraints of a minority government that is exported to the entire European Union, British citizens in the EU and Europeans in the UK,"" it seethes.

"Firms 'speeding up no-deal Brexit plans'A plan to renegotiate the UK's withdrawal deal ""feels like a real throw of the dice"", the CBI says.","This video can not be played Carolyn Fairbairn said a plan to renegotiate the UK's withdrawal deal ""feels like a real throw of the dice"" UK companies are likely to speed up plans for a no-deal Brexit in response to Tuesday's votes in Parliament, the head of the CBI has told the BBC. Carolyn Fairbairn said a plan to renegotiate the UK's withdrawal deal ""feels like a real throw of the dice"". ""I don't think there will be a single business this morning who is stopping or halting their no-deal planning,"" she said in response to the idea. ""I fear they may even be accelerating it,"" she added. Other business groups endorsed the CBI's view that Parliament's opposition to a no-deal Brexit was welcome, while a Northern Ireland business group said there was ""despair"" that commitments to protect its members' interests could be removed. May set for further talks with EU leaders Brexit: What happens now? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' Theresa May is expected to seek further talks with EU leaders in the coming days after MPs voted 317 to 301 in favour of replacing the backstop - the insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland in the event of no deal. The backstop is the main objection that Brexiteers in the Conservative party have to the deal negotiated by Mrs May, which was heavily rejected by MPs earlier this month in the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. The EU has already said it will not change the legal text of the deal. This video can not be played Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop Ms Fairbairn said the reaction of businesses to the outcome of Tuesday's voting would be one of ""rising frustration and concern"". She said Parliament had shown that there was ""a consensus against no-deal"", but added: ""It does nothing to take no-deal off the table and it does feel like hope rather than strategy."" The CBI head said businesses in Northern Ireland were ""incredibly concerned"" about the turn that events were taking, adding: ""The backstop is there for a purpose."" One day, technology might be able to solve the Irish border problem, she said, but until that was possible, there had to be ""other arrangements in place"". Ms Fairbairn said many small and medium-sized businesses had done nothing to prepare for the ""shock"" of a ""cliff-edge"" departure from the EU on 29 March. ""I think the kind of concerns that people have around disruption are absolutely right,"" she said. ""No deal is just not manageable at this stage."" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, told the BBC that firms there were ""in despair and really confused"" about what was going on. He said more than 90% of the organisation's members supported the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, and they felt ""let down"" by Tuesday's events in Parliament. He added: ""A deal that doesn't work for Northern Ireland isn't a deal."" Other business groups expressed opposition to a no-deal Brexit. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, called on Mrs May to ""confirm that she will not allow us to slide over the no-deal cliff"". Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said MPs had ""at least made some movement on breaking the Brexit deadlock"". Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Neither government nor many businesses are ready for a no-deal exit in two months' time, and it must not be allowed to happen by default."" Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ""While it is something that MPs have managed to form a majority in any vote, the path ahead is still far from clear.""

Travel ban for Venezuela opposition head,"This video can not be played Mr GuaidÃ³ urged Venezuelans to ""choose freedom, democracy and prosperity"" Venezuela's Supreme Court has banned opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ from leaving the country and frozen his bank accounts. The move comes amid an escalating power struggle, after Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim president last week. He has been backed by the US and other countries. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has major allies too, including Russia. Mr Maduro said in an interview that he was prepared to hold negotiations with the opposition. Why does the military back Maduro? What's behind the political crisis? ""I am ready to sit down at the negotiating table with the opposition so that we could talk for the good of Venezuela,"" he told the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti in Caracas. Mr Maduro ruled out an early presidential election - saying the next one was not due until 2025 - but said he would support early parliamentary elections as ""a good form of political discussion"". On Saturday, the European Union gave President Maduro an ultimatum to call elections within eight days, or the bloc would recognise Mr Guaido as president. The opposition has asked supporters to take part in a two-hour peaceful protest on Wednesday. It is as yet unclear if Mr GuaidÃ³ will attend. A group of North and South American countries has meanwhile opposed any outside military involvement in the country. This video can not be played Desperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border Peru's Foreign Minister Nestor Popolizio said the Lima Group - a 14-country body including Canada set up in 2017 to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Venezuela - was opposed to ""military intervention"". US officials have stated that all options to resolve the crisis ""are on the table"". Venezuela has been facing acute economic problems and there has been an upsurge in violence in recent weeks. Protests have been held across the country since Mr Maduro began his second term on 10 January. He was elected last year during a controversial vote in which many opposition candidates were barred from running, or jailed. At least 40 people are believed to have died and hundreds have been arrested since 21 January, the UN says. Hyperinflation and shortages of essentials such as food and medicine have forced millions to flee the nation. The Supreme Court, which is loyal to Mr Maduro, quickly approved the measures on Tuesday after Attorney General Tarek William Saab asked it to take ""precautionary measures"" against Mr GuaidÃ³. The opposition leader ""is prohibited from leaving the country"" until a preliminary investigation is complete after he ""caused harm to peace in the republic"", court head Maikel Moreno said. Dictator or defender of socialism? How Venezuelans stave off hunger As leader of the National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ has immunity from prosecution unless subject to a ruling by the country's top court. Speaking to journalists as he arrived at the parliament, the opposition leader reportedly said the moves were ""nothing new"". ""I'm not dismissing the threats, the persecution at this time, but we're here, we're continuing to do our jobs,"" he said. The court decision comes shortly after the US said it had handed control of Venezuela's US bank accounts to Mr GuaidÃ³, whom it now regards as the country's legitimate president. US National Security Adviser John Bolton responded with a tweet warning of ""serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm GuaidÃ³"". Allow Twitter content?

He says the constitution allows him, as the head of the National Assembly, to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? The crisis in seven charts ""My duty is to call for free elections because there is an abuse of power and we live in a dictatorship,"" Mr GuaidÃ³ told the BBC on Monday. He added: ""In Venezuela, we either accept domination, total oppression and torture... from Maduro's regime, or we choose freedom, democracy and prosperity for our people."" Mr GuaidÃ³ said the Maduro administration was ""killing young poor people"" in the streets. This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains On Monday Mr Bolton announced sanctions against Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA to ensure that President Maduro could ""no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people"". He also hinted at possible military action, reiterating that ""all options are on the table"". Mr Bolton appeared at a news briefing with a notepad containing the words ""5,000 troops to Colombia"", which borders Venezuela. On Tuesday acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan declined to say whether the Pentagon was considering sending troops. ""I haven't discussed that with Secretary Bolton,"" he told reporters. Also on Tuesdaythe state department issued a travel advisory,externalurging US nationals not to go to Venezuela because of ""civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and arbitrary arrest and detention of US citizens"". More than 20 nations have followed the US in recognising Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president. But other powers including Russia, China and Turkey have publicly backed Mr Maduro. On Tuesday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the US sanctions violated ""all possible international norms"" and ""pledged to do everything to support the legitimate government of President Maduro"".

Social media companies 'failing children',"Ms Longfield says: ""With great power comes great responsibility"" Children ""remain an afterthought"" for leading social media companies, England's Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, has said. And she has written to the biggest companies, urging them to commit to tackling issues of disturbing content. Her letter follows the suicide of14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing distressing self-harm images on Instagram. The companies say they are working hard to keep their platforms safe. Ms Longfield's letter is addressed to YouTube, Pinterest, Facebook, which also own WhatsApp and Instagram, and Snapchat. It urges them to back the introduction of a statutory duty of care where they would have to prioritise the safety and wellbeing of children using their platforms. She also calls for a digital ombudsman - paid for by the industry - who would act as an independent arbiter between young users and technology companies. Facebook pledges to do more on self-harm Children at 'significant' social media risk 'Schools should have consistent policy on phones' The letter says: ""The tragic suicide of Molly Russell and her father's appalled response to the material she was viewing on social media before her death have again highlighted the horrific amount of disturbing content that children are accessing online. ""I do not think it is going too far to question whether even you, the owners, any longer have any control over their [platforms'] content. ""If that is the case, then children should not be accessing your services at all and parents should be aware that the idea of any authority overseeing algorithms and content is a mirage."" Ms Longfield says she believes that, while she has been told by the industry that the issue is being taken seriously, there is ""still a failure to engage and that children remain an afterthought"". The commissioner calls on the industry to ""accept there are problems and to commit to tackling them - or admit publicly that you are unable to"". Her letter ends: ""With great power comes great responsibility and it is your responsibility to support measures that give children the information and tools they need growing up in this digital world - or to admit that you cannot control what anyone sees on your platforms."" A spokesman for Instagram and Facebook acknowledged the company had a ""huge responsibility"" to make sure young people were safe. ""Our thoughts are with Molly's family and with the other families who have been affected by suicide or self-harm,"" he said. ""We are undertaking a full review of our policies, enforcement and technologies and are consulting further with mental health experts to understand what more we can do. ""In the meantime, we are taking measures aimed at preventing people from finding self-harm related content through search and hashtags."" YouTube says it has policies that prohibit videos that promote self-harm and will remove flagged videos that violate this policy. A spokeswoman for Snapchat said: ""We work hard to keep Snapchat a safe and supportive place for everyone. ""From the outset, we have sought to connect our community with content that is authoritative and credible and safeguard against harmful content and disinformation."" The promotion of self-injury or eating disorders was not allowed, she added. A spokeswoman for Pinterest said : ""We don't want people to ever see disturbing content on our platform, and it is deeply upsetting to us if they do. ""We have assembled a special team that is urgently working to strengthen our technology that helps keep unwanted content off Pinterest. ""In addition, we are working with more outside groups with expertise in these issues to review our policy and enforcement guidelines and ensure we get this right.""

Ingram won his second Grammy for the song Yah Mo B There which he sang with Michael McDonald - but in the UK, he was best known for Somewhere Out There, a duet with Linda Ronstadt from the children's film An American Tail. The track reached number eight in 1987 - his only UK top 10 hit - and went on to beat U2's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For to win best song at the 1988 Grammys. However, his solo albums failed to match the success of his duets; and he stopped releasing new albums in the early 1990s, turning his attention to film soundtracks, with great success. Ingram received Oscar nominations in 1994 and 1995 for The Day I Fall In Love, a duet with Dolly Parton from Beethoven's 2nd, and Look What Love Has Done, from the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy Junior. In recent years, he had largely stepped away from music, with the exception of the 2008 gospel album Stand (in the Light), which was produced by Jones. His survivors include his wife, Debra, to whom he had been married since 1975. Tributes from fans and friends have been posted on social media. Allow Twitter content?

Kuenssberg: Unconventional win,"When things seem confusing, make a list. Theresa May was heading for another defeat, but she ended up with an unconventional win - a win nonetheless. The Tory Party that was visibly split in two a fortnight ago is giving the impression of being largely united, even if that is temporary. Yet the prime minister only won because she gave into Brexiteer and DUP demands, by making a promise that she can't be sure she can keep - one the EU says at the moment is impossible. MPs back May's bid to change Brexit deal Guide: The Brexit amendments and results Will Brussels budge on the Irish backstop? Parliament made it clear that it does not want to leave the EU without a deal. Right now, that's not something No 10 is willing to promise. But MPs could have made that demand more convincingly. Parliament had the option to vote to take control of the Brexit process if the government failed to get it sorted by the end of next month, and it did not. Again, former Remainers failed to coalesce around a single plan. And again, Theresa May has had to budge to keep Brexiteers on board. But that buys her a little more time, and a little more political momentum. This video can not be played Numbers and nods: MPs back May's bid to change deal This process has for a long time been about No 10 stumbling, often seriously, then getting up again to try to take another step. There is a valid question - to what end? Neither time nor momentum provides a solution on its own.

Three charged with doorman's murder,"Tudor Simionov was photographed working as a security guard hours before he was attacked Three men have been charged with the murder of a doorman who was stabbed to death at a private party in London's West End on New Year's Day. Security guard Tudor Simionov, 33, was attacked outside Fountain House at around 05:30 GMT on 1 January. The Romanian, who lived in Ilford, was attacked by a group of men who tried to enter the party, police said. Three men, aged between 20 and 25, are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. Scotland Yard named the trio as Haroon Akram, 25, Adham Khalil, 20 and Adham Elshalakany, 23. All three are charged with Mr Simionov's murder, as well as four counts of grievous bodily harm and one count of violent disorder. Three others were stabbed during the attack outside the private party in Park Lane Detectives are still appealing for information to help trace Ossama Hamed, 25, and 23-year-old Nor Aden Hamada in connection with the murder investigation.

No-deal warning over NHS operation delays,"NHS trusts could ""quickly run out of vital medicine"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the chief executive of a leading hospital group has warned. Dr David Rosser of University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) said that, despite NHS stockpiling, shortages would likely occur due to ""unprecedented"" distribution challenges. Medicine shortages could lead to some operations being postponed, he said. The Department of Health said planning for a no-deal Brexit was ""ongoing"". It added: ""We are working closely with the NHS, industry and the supply chain to make detailed plans to ensure continued access to healthcare, medical devices and clinical supplies in the event of no deal."" No-deal Brexit: Should NHS patients be worried? Brexit: MPs back May's bid to change deal Is the NHS already finding it hard to get medicines? Pharmacists warn of a 'surge' in shortage of common medicines Six key questions Brexit poses for the NHS Dr Rosser, chief executive officer of the Birmingham trust, made the warning ina paper presented to the trust's board,externallast week. In his memo, Dr Rosser said: ""In terms of the potential for major operational impact and severe and widespread risks to public safety, by far the greatest concern is the availability of medicines, devices and clinical supplies."" He added that a Department of Health report into which medicines were likely to face shortages had ""not been made available"" to NHS trusts but that ""it is assumed that a significant proportion of the medicines and consumables we use at UHB on a daily basis may be at risk"". Dr Rosser pointed to the possibility that equipment and medicines may not be available to manage the care of patients having complex surgery. ""In the context of an individual, no-urgent case, there would be no question that the correct decision would be to postpone the intervention,"" he said. This could ""significantly affect waiting times"" for patients, he said in his memo. We have heard plenty about the risk to staffing and supply of medicines when it comes to a no-deal Brexit - so the cancelling of operations is, in some ways, a logical extension of that. The paper produced by this trust acknowledges that, saying the risk is ""unquantifiable"". Hospitals regularly cancel non-urgent operations, like minor hip and knee procedures, as a way of managing pressure. Last winter, operations were cancelled en-masse as A&E struggled. Even this winter, which has been somewhat easier for the NHS, has seen some cancellations. If medicines ran short, this would be a tried-and-tested approach to ensuring the sickest were prioritised. But a lot of things have to take place first for that to start happening. On Tuesday, MPs backed an amendment in Parliament rejecting a no-deal Brexit, but the vote was not binding - meaning the date for exit remains 29 March. MPs also backed seeking ""alternative arrangements"" to replace the Irish backstop in Theresa May's Brexit plan - but the EU has said it will not change the legal text agreed with the UK PM. Dr Rosser also warned ""a fractious no-deal scenario"" could have a ""major impact"" on EU staff working in the NHS. ""We employ around 1,200 EU staff, of whom 262 are doctors, 375 are nurses or midwives, 320 are scientific or other clinical staff, and the balance are in support services,"" he said.

North Korea 'unlikely to abandon nukes',"Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday North Korea is unlikely to fully give up its nuclear weapons, a US intelligence report says, despite the hopes of the Trump administration. The Worldwide Threat Assessment report,externalalso says Iran is not making nuclear weapons, but that cyber threats from China and Russia are a growing concern. Both countries may be seeking to influence the 2020 election, it says. National intelligence director Dan Coats and other intelligence chiefs presented it to the Senate on Tuesday. North Korea remains ""unlikely to give up"" its weapon stockpiles and production abilities while it tries to negotiate ""partial denuclearisation steps to obtain key US and international concessions"", the report says. Having nuclear weapons is seen as ""critical to regime survival"", it reads. North Korea's breakdown of communication Kim Jong-un, the king of Pyongyang President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un met in Singapore last June to discuss denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. At the time, Mr Trump claimed this meeting had ended the North Korean nuclear threat: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The two leaders signed an agreementpledging to ""work toward complete denuclearisation"" but there was no agreed pathway and little progress has been made since then on the issue. Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? When Trump met Kim: What happened next? North Korea has always insisted it will not unilaterally give up its nuclear arsenal unless the US removes its own nuclear threat. The White House has said they will meet for a second time in February, but no date or location has yet been confirmed. Notrh Korea's Kim Yong-chol (left) travelled to the US for talks in December The new US report highlights a growing threat from China and Russia, which are ""more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s"". Both countries have sophisticated ""cyber espionage"" capabilities, which they may try to use to influence the 2020 US presidential election. The report also says Iran is not currently making nuclear weapons, although it says the country's ""regional ambitions and improved military capabilities"" will probably threaten US interests in the future. Trump re-imposes Iran sanctions: Now what? Iran nuclear deal: Key details President Trump withdrew the US in 2018 from a landmark deal on curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions, and has imposed stricter sanctions to try to thwart its actions. He had denounced the 2015 agreement as a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"". At the Senate hearing CIA director Gina Haspel said Iran was ""technically... in compliance"" with the 2015 nuclear deal, despite the US withdrawal. President Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 Elsewhere in the Middle East, the report stresses that the so-called Islamic State group (IS) is not yet defeated, despite the Trump administration's claims to the contrary. While the group will probably not aim to take new territory, the report assesses IS will try to ""exploit Sunni grievances, societal instability, and stretched security forces to regain territory in Iraq and Syria in the long term"". President Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syriashocked allies at home and abroad. Mr Trump said the group had been defeated. The administration has since agreed to slow down the withdrawal. Acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan however told reporters on Tuesday that IS is close to losing its remaining territory in Syria. ""I'd say 99.5% plus of the IS-controlled territory has been returned to the Syrians. Within a couple of weeks, it'll be 100%,"" he is quoted as saying.

The victim, who died at the scene on Caledonian Road, Islington, on Tuesday, has been named as Nedim Bilgin. Two male suspects, aged 16 and 17, were arrested nearby on suspicion of murder, and an 18-year-old man was arrested at an address in Islington, the Met Police said. All three remain in custody.

Travel ban for Venezuela opposition headThe country's Supreme Court approves a travel ban and an asset freeze on Juan GuaidÃÂ³.,"This video can not be played Mr GuaidÃ³ urged Venezuelans to ""choose freedom, democracy and prosperity"" Venezuela's Supreme Court has banned opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ from leaving the country and frozen his bank accounts. The move comes amid an escalating power struggle, after Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim president last week. He has been backed by the US and other countries. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has major allies too, including Russia. Mr Maduro said in an interview that he was prepared to hold negotiations with the opposition. Why does the military back Maduro? What's behind the political crisis? ""I am ready to sit down at the negotiating table with the opposition so that we could talk for the good of Venezuela,"" he told the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti in Caracas. Mr Maduro ruled out an early presidential election - saying the next one was not due until 2025 - but said he would support early parliamentary elections as ""a good form of political discussion"". On Saturday, the European Union gave President Maduro an ultimatum to call elections within eight days, or the bloc would recognise Mr Guaido as president. The opposition has asked supporters to take part in a two-hour peaceful protest on Wednesday. It is as yet unclear if Mr GuaidÃ³ will attend. A group of North and South American countries has meanwhile opposed any outside military involvement in the country. This video can not be played Desperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border Peru's Foreign Minister Nestor Popolizio said the Lima Group - a 14-country body including Canada set up in 2017 to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Venezuela - was opposed to ""military intervention"". US officials have stated that all options to resolve the crisis ""are on the table"". Venezuela has been facing acute economic problems and there has been an upsurge in violence in recent weeks. Protests have been held across the country since Mr Maduro began his second term on 10 January. He was elected last year during a controversial vote in which many opposition candidates were barred from running, or jailed. At least 40 people are believed to have died and hundreds have been arrested since 21 January, the UN says. Hyperinflation and shortages of essentials such as food and medicine have forced millions to flee the nation. The Supreme Court, which is loyal to Mr Maduro, quickly approved the measures on Tuesday after Attorney General Tarek William Saab asked it to take ""precautionary measures"" against Mr GuaidÃ³. The opposition leader ""is prohibited from leaving the country"" until a preliminary investigation is complete after he ""caused harm to peace in the republic"", court head Maikel Moreno said. Dictator or defender of socialism? How Venezuelans stave off hunger As leader of the National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ has immunity from prosecution unless subject to a ruling by the country's top court. Speaking to journalists as he arrived at the parliament, the opposition leader reportedly said the moves were ""nothing new"". ""I'm not dismissing the threats, the persecution at this time, but we're here, we're continuing to do our jobs,"" he said. The court decision comes shortly after the US said it had handed control of Venezuela's US bank accounts to Mr GuaidÃ³, whom it now regards as the country's legitimate president. US National Security Adviser John Bolton responded with a tweet warning of ""serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm GuaidÃ³"". Allow Twitter content?

He says the constitution allows him, as the head of the National Assembly, to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? The crisis in seven charts ""My duty is to call for free elections because there is an abuse of power and we live in a dictatorship,"" Mr GuaidÃ³ told the BBC on Monday. He added: ""In Venezuela, we either accept domination, total oppression and torture... from Maduro's regime, or we choose freedom, democracy and prosperity for our people."" Mr GuaidÃ³ said the Maduro administration was ""killing young poor people"" in the streets. This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains On Monday Mr Bolton announced sanctions against Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA to ensure that President Maduro could ""no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people"". He also hinted at possible military action, reiterating that ""all options are on the table"". Mr Bolton appeared at a news briefing with a notepad containing the words ""5,000 troops to Colombia"", which borders Venezuela. On Tuesday acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan declined to say whether the Pentagon was considering sending troops. ""I haven't discussed that with Secretary Bolton,"" he told reporters. Also on Tuesdaythe state department issued a travel advisory,externalurging US nationals not to go to Venezuela because of ""civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and arbitrary arrest and detention of US citizens"". More than 20 nations have followed the US in recognising Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president. But other powers including Russia, China and Turkey have publicly backed Mr Maduro. On Tuesday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the US sanctions violated ""all possible international norms"" and ""pledged to do everything to support the legitimate government of President Maduro"".

""I arrived at the scene about an hour after the stabbing and saw the distressed relatives."" Two teenagers were arrested close to the crime scene and a third was later arrested at a home in Islington Mr Convery said the fatal stabbing had ""unpleasant parallels"" with the death of another teenager, Alan Cartwright,who was murdered on Caledonian Road in 2015. Ch Supt Nick Davies confirmed the victim lived in Islington and that police patrols in the area would be ""stepped up"". He said: ""I completely understand the alarm and concern it has raised from those who live and work in the area. ""Tragically the local community is now coming to terms with the senseless loss of life of a young man who had everything to live for."" Detectives are expected to be at Caledonian Road for the rest of the day Elsewhere in the capital on Tuesday, a woman was found with stab injuries in Baring Road, Bromley, and in a separate attack a man was stabbed in Spray Street, Woolwich. Both victims were taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. BBC London's Greg McKenzie Some residents have told the BBC they want to move out of the area Some residents waking up today have spoken to me about how terrified they are of living in the area. One described this part of Islington as ""lawless"" and said there had been another stabbing a few months ago. There is a massive police cordon along the normally busy Caledonian Road - it stretches about 200m.

MPs back May's bid to change Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Theresa May: We will seek changes to EU withdrawal agreement MPs have backed seeking ""alternative arrangements"" to replace the Irish backstop in Theresa May's Brexit plan. The proposal - put forward by Tory MP Sir Graham Brady - had the support of the government and won by 16 votes. Theresa May had urged MPs to vote in favour of it, to give her a mandate to return to Brussels and re-open negotiations in order to secure a ""legally binding change"". But the EU has said it will not change the legal text agreed with the UK PM. MPs voted on a string of amendments to Mrs May's plan to change the direction of Brexit. Mrs May said that, after taking the votes into account and talking to the EU, her revised deal would be brought back to the Commons ""as soon as possible"" for a second ""meaningful vote"". Live: Reaction after MPs' Brexit votes Guide: The Brexit amendments and results Brexit: What could happen next? May scores 'unconventional win' Brexit: A really simple guide Another amendment, rejecting a no-deal Brexit, also won the support of Parliament on Tuesday, but the vote was not binding - meaning the date for exit remains 29 March. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said as a result of the message from MPs rejecting no deal, he would now meet the prime minister to discuss the next steps. He had previously refused to meet her unless she ruled out a no-deal Brexit herself. Mr Corbyn said: ""After months of refusing to take the chaos of no deal off the table, the prime minister must now face the reality that no deal is not an option."" Five other amendments, including Labour MP Yvette Cooper's bid to delay Brexit if Mrs May does not get her deal through Parliament, were defeated. Tory MP Nick Boles, who worked with her on the amendment, tweeted out a joint statement, saying they ""remain deeply concerned that there is no safeguard in place"" to stop a no deal and said Mrs May's revised plan would have to ""reflect the Commons opposition to no deal"". This video can not be played Mr Corbyn: 'We are prepared to meet her to put forward the points of view from the Labour Party' Mrs May hopes the support for Sir Graham's amendment - which won by 317 votes to 301 - to look at alternatives to the backstop gives her a stronger negotiating position with the EU. The controversial element of Mrs May's original plan is the insurance policy to prevent checks on goods and people returning to the Northern Ireland border. It would effectively keep the UK inside the EU's customs union, but with Northern Ireland also conforming to some rules of the single market. It was one of the main reasons her Brexit deal was voted down in Parliament by an historic margin earlier in January as critics say a different status for Northern Ireland could threaten the existence of the United Kingdom and fear that the backstop could become permanent. She told the Commons there was now a ""substantial and sustainable"" majority of MPs supporting leaving the EU with a deal, but admitted renegotiation ""will not be easy"". The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party in Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said it was a ""significant night"" and his MPs would work with the prime minister ""to deliver the right deal for the United Kingdom"". But the leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said that passing the amendment had seen the government ""rip up the Good Friday Agreement"" - integral to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the Commons had given the prime minister ""contradictory instructions to have no deal but pursue a course of action that will lead to a no deal"". Theresa May was heading for another defeat, but she ended up with an unconventional win - a win nonetheless. The Tory Party that was visibly split in two a fortnight ago is giving the impression of being largely united, even if that is temporary. Yet the prime minister only won because she gave into Brexiteer and DUP demands, by making a promise that she can't be sure she can keep - one the EU says at the moment is impossible. This process has for a long time been about No 10 stumbling, often seriously, then getting up again to try to take another step. There is a valid question - to what end? Read more from Laura's blog here. Speaking after the result, President of the European Council Donald Tusk said the withdrawal deal was ""not open for re-negotiation"" and ""remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union"". But he said the EU would be willing to look at the political declaration again - the part of the deal that makes a pledge on the future relationship between the UK and the EU - and that the EU would ""stand ready"" to consider any ""reasoned request"" for an extension to the leave date of 29 March. The Brexit Coordinator for the European Parliament, Guy Verhofstadt, welcomed Parliament's rejection of a no deal, but also said there was no majority in the EU to re-open or dilute the withdrawal agreement .

A statement from the Irish government said the withdrawal agreement ""is not open for renegotiation... The best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify this agreement,"" the statement said. And Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz also ruled out further negotiations on the withdrawal agreement. The prime minister has invited Tory MP Caroline Spelman, Labour MP Jack Dromey and others who tabled amendments to prevent a no deal to discuss how to move forward and secure a deal for Brexit. She also invited Mr Corbyn for talks and promised the government would ""redouble its efforts to get a deal this House can support"". The so-called Brady amendment could pave the way for a plan known as the ""Malthouse compromise"" as an alternative to the backstop. Engineered by both Leavers and Remainers - and led by Tory minister Kit Malthouse - the proposal includes extending the transition period for a year and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. This video can not be played Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop. The deputy chairman of the pro-Leave European Research Group, Tory MP Steve Baker, said he hoped by the group giving its support to the amendment, MPs could ""now make rapid progress towards the Malthouse compromise"". But fellow ERG member Mark Francois warned there was no guarantee the group would back the PM, and said he would wait to see what she comes back with from Brussels. Mrs May's spokesman said she would ""engage"" with colleagues proposing the compromise, but would also look at other options - including putting a time limit on the backstop and seeking a way to exit it. The PM's revised deal will return to the Commons to be voted on. But, if it is again rejected, the government will table an amendable motion - meaning MPs can put forward more amendments as they did earlier - for debate the following day. And if no new deal is agreed by Parliament by 13 February, she will make a statement and, again, table an amendable motion for debate the next day.

May set for further talks with EU leaders,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clash over Brexit policies Jeremy Corbyn says he told Theresa May ""don't bring no deal back to Parliament"" in their long-awaited face-to-face meeting on Brexit. The Labour leader said it was ""not acceptable"" for the PM to keep the no-deal option on the table after MPs voted against it on Tuesday. After the meeting, Mrs May tweeted: ""The only way to avoid No Deal is to vote for a deal."" MPs will vote on the deal again after she seeks to renegotiate with the EU. Mr Corbyn said it was a ""serious"" meeting and Mrs May had ""listened"". He had refused to meet Mrs May unless she agreed to rule out a no-deal Brexit, but changed his mind after MPs voted against the idea of leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal on Tuesday evening.

Mr Corbyn said: ""I set out the Labour case for a comprehensive customs union with the European Union, in order to protect jobs and trade. ""She certainly understood the point that we were making."" He added: ""The last words I said to her were 'don't bring no deal back to Parliament' because it's not acceptable - it's not a sensible or serious way of going forward."" He said he was suspicious the government was trying to ""run down the clock"", and if that appeared to be the case when Parliament discussed Brexit again next month, Labour would ""look at all the options on the table at that time"". Asked if Labour would support or table a motion to try and extend Article 50, which would delay the date of Brexit, Mr Corbyn said: ""That is a question for 13 February.""

Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The two party leaders earlier clashed over Brexit at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. During the exchange, Mr Corbyn said the prime minister may have succeeded in ""temporarily uniting her very divided party"" in Tuesday's votes on amendments to her plan, but she had to make ""more important compromises"" to ""unite the country"". Mrs May said Mr Corbyn was a ""fine one to talk about coming together"", when he had only now agreed to meet her. She said the majority of MPs had identified the Irish backstop as the main sticking point preventing them from backing her deal, whereas Mr Corbyn's Brexit proposals had been rejected. ""He has no plan for Brexit, no good plan for our economy and no plan for our country,"" she told MPs. This video can not be played Mr Corbyn: 'We are prepared to meet her to put forward the points of view from the Labour Party' MPs voted 317 to 301 in favour of changing the backstop plan - the section of Mrs May's deal with the EU designed to avoid the return of Northern Ireland border checks. Five amendments, including Labour MP Yvette Cooper's bid to delay Brexit if Mrs May does not get her deal through Parliament and Mr Corbyn's own amendment, were defeated on Tuesday. Mr Corbyn asked Mrs May whether, if she did not agree a deal with Brussels that MPs would support, she would back Labour's proposals for a ""a strong single market, comprehensive customs union and the guaranteeing of rights and protections rather than the alternative she has been threatening - to crash out with no-deal"". Mrs May told him: ""You cannot just vote to reject no deal, you have to support a deal."" It was a message she repeated to Labour MP Jack Dromey, who together with Tory MP Caroline Spelman got MPs to back a non-binding amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday. Later in the session, Nigel Dodds, leader of the Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, described remarks by the  Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on the UK's approach to Brexit as ""highly reckless and extremely dangerous"". Mr Coveney likened the UK's negotiating stance to ""either you give me what I want or I'm jumping out the window"". Mr Dodds said that kind of rhetoric needed ""to be toned down"". Mrs May said she will speak to Irish premier Leo Varadkar later on Wednesday. ""It is important for us to work with the Irish government on the arrangements that will be in place in the future,"" she added. But ahead of the call, Mr Varadkar told the Irish Parliament that the EU stood by the withdrawal agreement and renegotiation was not on the table. At the moment, the UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, with or without a deal. The UK and the EU negotiated their withdrawal agreement deal over the past 18 months but it needs to be backed by MPs for it to come into force. Earlier this month, MPs voted against the plan Mrs May had proposed by 432 votes to 202. Mrs May said that, after taking Tuesday's votes into account and talking to the EU, any revised deal would be brought back to the Commons ""as soon as possible"" for a second ""meaningful vote"".

William 'optimistic' for Michelin workers,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a meeting of the Michelin Action Group The Duke of Cambridge has said he is ""optimistic"" about the future for workers at a tyre factory in Dundee which is set to close. Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge met staff from the Michelin premises during a visit on Tuesday. They joined workers at the Crescent community centre and asked how the closure was affecting them. The couple, known in Scotland as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn, also opened Dundee's V&A Museum of Design. Speaking at the Michelin Action Group meeting, Prince William said: ""The factory has been a huge part of Dundee's very fabric.  It has been a key employer for generations and has helped sustain the local economy for nearly 50 years. ""For everyone affected, the hope is that all of you sat in this room can find a positive way forward. ""You all deserve enormous credit for sitting around this table together to find a constructive way forward. It is understandable that there are different views about what is the right course to take."" The duke and duchess spoke to Michelin workers He added: ""As I have just heard, when a community faces uncertainty, people feel more optimistic when leaders such as yourselves work together for that community. ""Because of the collaborative approach adopted by the people in this room, I am optimistic that a good outcome is possible with the site at Michelin."" Prince William said he was encouraged by the fact that a taskforce had been established with all the key players represented. ""As a result of you working together responsibly to find a long-term solution, you have already reached agreement on developing the site into a manufacturing, recycling and low-carbon transport hub. ""The workers we spoke to just now were encouraged to hear about this. They look forward to hearing further detail about how this will affect them directly. Catherine and I look forward to learning more about your plans in this discussion. ""Both of us, and all of the people that we have spoken to today, are willing you to succeed.""

The closure will take place by mid-2020 after it was deemed ""unsuitable"" in the current climate. Since then it has joined the taskforce - along with the local authority and Scottish Enterprise, among others - to find a solution for the site and its staff. Brian Cairns is the firm's HR business partner, working on the My Future programme to help reskill and retrain staff. The 54-year-old from Alva, Clackmannanshire, said: ""(The duke) was interested in who we are and the service with Michelin. ""One of the comments he made is how there seemed to be a lot of camaraderie still at the table. ""The problem we have in Dundee is we have people who have been employed for 30, 40 years and have never written a CV, have never had an interview and the job market has changed dramatically. ""What Dundee are offering its employees I've never heard of before. It's absolutely fantastic."" The Royal couple were welcomed to the museum by Dundee lord provost Ian Borthwick Scottish Economy Secretary Derek Mackay added: ""I want to thank the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for attending the Michelin Dundee Action Group and for recognising the collaborative approach we have taken to secure a long-term future for the Michelin Dundee site. ""The Scottish government will continue to do everything we can to support the repurposing of the Michelin Dundee site as an Innovation Parc, as it becomes a key location for low carbon energy and low carbon transport development in Scotland.""
