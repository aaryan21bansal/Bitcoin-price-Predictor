Driveway row neighbour cuts tree in half,"The tree was cut down following a row about pigeons nesting A neighbourly dispute over a tree between two drives turned into a ""war"" when one homeowner cut the intrusive evergreen in half. Bharat Mistry, 56, said his next-door neighbour had complained of nesting pigeons dirtying his side of the divide in Waterthorpe, Sheffield. The two tried to reach an ""amicable"" solution, he said, before the other resident called a tree surgeon. Mr Mistry's neighbour was unavailable for comment. The other couple first asked for the tree to be removed last March, Mr Mistry said. This led to ""several discussions"" about trimming it back or installing nets to prevent birds from nesting. Level crossing shut over 'too quiet' train horn Postman returns Father's Day letter sent to heaven Moment cricketer hits six through own car window A neighbour on the street said the tree looked ""awful"" Mr Mistry made inquiries with tree surgeons and gardeners, but his neighbour of 28 years took it upon himself to call his own arborist. ""You can imagine when he first did it we were angry,"" he said. ""Obviously after a couple of days we calmed down a bit."" The tree has since become a tourist attraction after photos of it were shared online, with people making trips to see it. Half of the tree, which overhung a neighbour's driveway, has been removed Fellow neighbour Brian Parkes said the issue had been ""going on a bit"", adding: ""You've got to feel sorry for both of them. ""It looks awful. They're going to be at one another's throats now, but it's done, you can't undo it. We've got a war on our hands with them two."" More stories from across Yorkshire Ann Wiles, who also lives on the street, said the neighbours had previously organised children's parties together. ""As far as I know they got on well together,"" she said. ""We've got a lot of pigeons, hundreds of them. We live in the country and you've got to accept these things."" The tree might have to be cut down if it does not survive, Mr Mistry said, but he is hopeful it can be further trimmed or reshaped. His wife said: ""I am genuinely really sad that it's come to this."" Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Microsoft unveils Windows 11,"Microsoft's Panos Panay introduced Windows 11 at a live-streamed virtual event. Microsoft has unveiled Windows 11, its ""next generation"" operating system, at a virtual event. The new software will let Android apps run on the Windows desktop. Product manager Panos Panay promised smaller, faster security updates - a common complaint for Windows users - and said they would happen in the background. Windows 11 will also let users configure multiple desktops for work, home, and gaming, like on a Mac. Microsoft says there are currently about 1.3 billion devices running Windows 10. An early preview version of the new system will be released for app developers next week. Windows 11 will be available as a free update to existing Windows 10 users - although some devices will not have the right specifications.These include,externala minimum of 64 gigabytes of storage and 4 gigabytes of RAM. One cosmetic change is putting the ""Start"" button at the bottom-centre of the screen rather than left-hand side. The 'Start' menu is now centre-aligned and available in a dark mode A new widgets window will provide personalised updates Microsoft Teams chat will be built-in In addition, Windows 11 will feature tighter integration with Microsoft's communications platform Teams. Xbox Games Pass, a subscription service offering access to hundreds of games, will also be pre-installed. The tech giant said it would share more profits from its app store with creators and developers - as rival Applecontinues to face challenges over its business model.,external When Windows 10 launched in 2015, Microsoft said it would be the final version of the operating system. It has since announcedWindows 10 will be retired in 2025. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella described the launch as ""a major milestone in the history of Windows"", but analyst Geoff Blaber from CCS Insight said he did not consider it to be  ""a revolutionary step"". ""Windows 11 is an iterative release that pinpoints where Windows needs greater ambition, rather than introducing the sweeping changes seen with its predecessor,"" he said. ""The end game for Microsoft is ensuring that the step up from Windows 10 to Windows 11 provides significant enough improvements to offset any complaints."" Forrester's principal analyst JP Gownder noted that the new operating system was based on the code of Windows 10, which should prevent upgrade glitches such as those seen in the past with Windows Vista. ""These user-friendly nods to the past are a double-edged sword, though,"" he added. ""They're great for continuity of experience, but they make you wonder what the 11 really stands for. Is this really more of an admittedly feature-rich Windows 10 update than a full-version release?""

Canada Goose to end the use of all fur on coats,"Canada Goose, the maker of luxury-priced winter coats, has announced it will no longer use animal fur on its clothing. The firm said it will cease buying fur by the end of this year and stop using it on its products by the end of 2022. Humane Society International said the decision was a ""momentous step in the demise of cruel fur fashion"". Canada Goose has long been criticised by campaigners for using coyote fur on its parkas. Claire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society, said: ""For years, Canada Goose's trademark parka jackets with coyote fur trim have been synonymous with fur cruelty but their announcement today is another major blow to the global fur trade."" The move is part of Canada Goose's strategy to become more environmentally conscious and extend the use of sustainable materials as well as low carbon methods of making its coats. A spokesperson for the British Fur Trade Association said: ""The animals that would have been used by Canada Goose will still have to be culled to control numbers as part of managed conservation programmes. ""The fur sector operates under stringent national and international laws and regulations."" A number of luxury fashion brands have stopped using fur in their clothing in recent years. Nordstrom, the upmarket US department store, said it would stop selling products made with fur or exotic animal skin by the end of this year. Canada Goose uses coyote fur on its trademark parkas Under its then new chief creative officer, Riccardo Tisci, Burberry announced back in 2018 it would stop using rabbit, fox, mink and raccoon fur in its collections. Italy's Prada also committed to end the use of fur. Ms Bass said fur was a ""dying industry on its knees from the punches of so many top designers and retailers walking away from the PR-nightmare of fur"". ""Canada Goose's fur-free policy will spare untold thousands of coyotes from being maimed and killed in cruel metal leg-hold traps,"" she said.

How a village is changing to meet staycation demand,"Ullapool and the surrounding area in Wester Ross have grown in popularity in recent years Tourism businesses in and around Ullapool are expecting a busy summer, with the area a popular destination for people who choose to holiday closer to home amid the pandemic. Will Copestake, an outdoor instructor and former Scottish and UK Adventurer of the Year, runs sea kayaking classes and trips off Achiltibuie, about 40 minutes by car from Ullapool. He says the popularity of the whole Wester Ross area for staycations is plain to see - with demand for the activities he offers increasing. ""Bookings this year have definitely been elevated over what we would normally expect,"" he says, with ""sometimes well in excess of"" 50 emails a day from potential customers. Rural areas expect influx as travel rules ease Your pictures: Scotland's staycation summer Plea to visitors to 'leave only footprints' Before Covid, many of Will's clients were people who had kayaked before and wanted to explore the Summer Isles just off the coast. He says: ""The difference this year and last year is that it is new people, who are wanting to go camping and kayaking for the first time."" Will Copestake says he is seeing clients this year who want to try new outdoor pursuits But some businesses are facing challenges as they prepare for the influx of staycation visitors. Robert Hicks, of the Arch Inn in Ullapool, says he does not have enough people to run the business normally, and has had to make adjustments to his offering. ""We are open seven days a week for accommodation and drinks, but we have had to stop serving food two days a week for the welfare of staff,"" he says. Robert believes staff shortages in the hospitality industry are not just a Highland problem, but a UK-wide one with workers leaving the trade to pursue other careers. He says: ""Furlough has been really wonderful, but I think it was maybe a mistake allowing people to pick up second jobs. Some people have kept that second job and given up the job they were furloughed from."" Robert Hicks says a staff shortage has had an impact on his business Di Rusling, who runs about 30 self-catering properties around the village, is also experiencing staff shortages. She says: ""We would usually try and do some lets for three or four nights, but this year can only do seven night lets or longer due to the changeovers. ""There just isn't the staff to be able to manage that part of the business."" Last year, post-lockdown, some tourism hotspots became crowded and communities spoke out about a lack of facilities to cope with the demand. Will describes the popularity of Wester Ross as a ""mixed blessing"". He says: ""There was definitely elevated pressure [last year], but on the other hand I think the community has been fairly shut down for over a year now and it's really good to have a bit of business back and a little bit more activity."" Di Rusling says she does not have enough staff to handle shorter stays at her self-catering properties Di says there was ""a lot of negativity"" last year around tourism, though agrees some concerns about excessive numbers of visitors remain. But she says: ""The village really needs to have visitors to survive."" Robert is also keen to find the positives in the area's popularity. He says it is ""shining a light"" on a part of the country which had been forgotten until recently. ""I think very much the positives outweigh the negatives,"" he adds.

Its owner Pepco said sales continued to grow in the past six months despite the Covid pandemic. Poundland and European sister firm Dealz saw like-for-like sales rise 1.4% in the six months to the end of March. This was despite many of its stores being hit by pandemic restrictions.

"Travel rules to be updated amid industry pressureTravel bosses want more countries on the green list, as the government carries out its three-week review.UK","The last review, which was three weeks ago, saw Portugal removed from the green list Changes to the UK's rules on foreign travel are set to be announced later, after industry bosses united in a plea for the green list to be widened. There has been speculation Malta and the Spanish islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Minorca could be green listed. Travel bosses are also calling for an exemption to quarantine for fully-vaccinated people from amber countries. PM Boris Johnson said there was a ""real opportunity to open up travel"" this summer for those who have had two jabs. But the prospect of European holidays could face another hurdle, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested all EU countries should make British travellers quarantine on arrival to slow the spread of the Delta variant. On Thursday, theUK reported,external16,703 cases and 21 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. LIVE: Travel sector hoping rules relaxed for fully-jabbed What are the green, amber and red rules? How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? What's happening with foreign travel? Mrs Merkel told Germany's parliament: ""In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that's not the case in every European country, and that's what I would like to see."" Currently,people travelling from the UK to Greece, Spain and Portugal are not required to quarantine. Those going to Italy have to self-isolate for five days then take a test, while fully-vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining. By contrast, when returning to the UK from most holiday hotspots on the amber list, travellers have to self-isolate for 10 days, as well as pay for tests. Asked about Mrs Merkel's remarks on the Delta variant meaning more restrictions on British travellers going abroad, Mr Johnson said: ""The most important thing is that we think double jabs do offer a good way forward, we think they offer the hope of travel this summer. ""More than 60% of our population have now had two jabs, I think 83% have had one jab, we're really getting through it now. The crucial thing is, come forward and get your second jab,"" he said. He added that he wasn't going to claim the summer would be like any other. ""I don't want to cast a pall over things but, as I said the other day, it will be different."" Tom Singleton, from Derby, is on a family holiday with his wife and four-year-old daughter on the very quiet Greek island of Kos. They had originally planned to go to Cyprus but had to cancel three times. Determined to get away before their daughter starts school in September, the family flew to Kos - on the amber list - on a virtually empty plane to stay in a deserted hotel. ""Until yesterday we were the only British people in our hotel,"" he told the BBC. Tom and his wife are both fully-vaccinated and hopeful - if a little doubtful - Kos might be moved on to the safer green list which would save them from quarantining. ""Cases are very minimal here and it's safer here than at home - it makes no sense why it can't be green,"" he said. He highlighted some of the apparent contradictions in the travel rules, asking how Uefa VIPs, sponsors, staff and guests could come into the UK ""from wherever"" without quarantining. ""It begs the question why one rule for the few and another for everyone else."" Can you go on holiday to Malta, Spain or Portugal? Just 11 destinations are on the green list - including Israel and Australia - although neither has opened up its borders to tourists. Travellers do not need to quarantine when they get back from green-list countries, but they do have to pay for tests. Countries on the red list are considered the highest risk, and travel from those nations is more strictly limited. The UK government reviews which countries are on which list every three weeks, and the last update - when Portugal was stripped from the green list - was three weeks ago on 3 June. As well as today's review, the government has also said there will be a ""checkpoint"" review of the rules for each category on Monday 28 June. That could be when ministers decide whether to relax quarantine for fully-vaccinated travellers. On Wednesday, Mr Shapps told the BBC: ""If you've been double vaccinated then of course we need to look at what the science says. We've said that Monday is the point to review that data, so we are coming up to having a look at it. ""We're looking at it in the next few days and I'll have more to say."" The UK government's traffic light system applies toEngland,,externalwithScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalable to make their own rules. However, the rules are broadly the same and previous changes to the lists have been adopted by all four nations. The issues around international travel in Europe are tricky, complex and ever-changing. In the spring the UK had one of the lowest infection rates in Europe - so it was perhaps understandable that ministers did not want Britons going abroad where there would be a greater risk of infection. The opposite is true now following the rise of the Delta variant. So in theory a Briton in France, Germany, Spain or Italy is less likely to get infected than they are here. But that means there is a stronger argument for countries in continental Europe to restrict access for Britons. Indeed, a number of countries have already started, citing concern about the Delta variant. Although with clusters of it found across Europe it's probably only a matter of time before it takes off. The fact remains holidaying in continental Europe could still be very difficult regardless of what ministers decide here. Earlier this week,Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidministers were ""working on"" plans for fully-vaccinated people to be exempt from quarantine if they returned from amber-list countries. More than 60% of UK adults have now been fully vaccinated, while 82.9% have had their first jab. On Wednesday, workers in the travel industry including cabin crew, pilots, travel agents and airport staffheld a series of protests against the rules. They called on the government to offer the industry more financial support and increase the number of countries on the UK's green list. And industry body Abta, representing travel agents and tour operators, estimated 195,000 travel jobs have been lost during the pandemic or are at risk. The government said its international travel policy was guided by ""one overwhelming priority - protecting public health"". It said a range of factors were considered when making decisions about countries - including how capable a country is at genomic sequencing, the risk of transmission and the risk from any variants of concern. The government added it was keeping all possible travel measures under review, and that economic support for the sector included the furlough scheme.

Stormont diverts Â£30m to tackle waiting lists,"The Stormont Executive is to divert funding of more than Â£30m in a bid to tackle Northern Ireland's growing waiting lists. The move is part of a reallocation exercise known as a monitoring round. It will also see extra funding of Â£10.7m diverted to the Department of Health to cope with pharmaceutical pressures linked to Brexit. Finance Minister Conor Murphy presented details of his proposed June monitoring round at Thursday's executive meeting. Other reallocations include Â£19m to the Executive Office to pay first-year costs of the Troubles compensation scheme, in which money will go to eligible victims and survivors of the conflict. Mr Murphy said long-term funding for the scheme would continue to be discussed with the Treasury. The Department of Education is also in line for almost Â£36m to provide additional support for children with special educational needs (SEN). Other allocations include: Â£39m to the Department for Communities, including urban renewable programmes funding and property adaptions for tenants living with disabilities Â£19.7m to the Department for Infrastructure for roads maintenance and NI Water Â£11.5m to the Department of Justice for legal service and PSNI protocol costs Â£3.5m for the Central Government Transformation Programme and IT costs across departments Â£0.9m for the Department for the Economy for Tourism NI Mr Murphy said the detail of what areas in elective care the funding will be allocated to ""is a matter for the health department"". He said a long-term strategy for investment will require ""very substantial intervention over a long number of years"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy said a long-term strategy for investment will require ""very substantial intervention"" He added that the Troubles compensation scheme is due to open in July after a slight delay. ""We haven't yet resolved the issue of who's responsible for the scheme, who pays for the scheme, that dialogue is ongoing and I hope to resolve that in the not-so-distant future,"" he said. He said the money would go directly to those applying for the scheme ""so victims won't have to wait further"". ""It was never our desire to get into a financial wrangle over this but the British government changed the scheme substantially and handed the cost over to the executive and we've been having dialogue ever since."" In recent weeks, it has emerged that some people arewaiting seven years for medical procedures in Northern Ireland. The latest waiting list figures, from January to March 2021, indicated that: More than 335,000 people were waiting for a first consultant-led appointment More than 189,000 people had been waiting longer than a year for a first outpatient appointment The departmental target is that at least half of all patients should wait no longer than nine weeks for a first appointment and no-one should wait longer than 52 weeks. It prompted Health Minister Robin Swann to suggest the size of Northern Ireland's waiting lists was ""undermining"" the principle of a free health service. He had previously said it could take up to 10 years to tackle the issue and that many people were waiting ""too long for treatment"". Northern Ireland has the worst waiting times of any UK region, with problems exacerbated by the restructuring of the health service to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Swann said the additional waiting list funding will go towards areas including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychological therapies. ""This will be in addition to our ongoing investment in elective care for the highest priority cases in terms of clinical need,"" Mr Swann said. ""While additional one-off allocations will always be welcome, a long-term solution to waiting lists requires sustained and guaranteed funding over a number of years."" Other health allocations also include Â£4.5m for Muckamore Abbey Hospital support costs, including funding for the alternative location of patients who might previously have been treated at Muckamore, Â£1m for cyber security and Â£11.5m capital funding. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said ""Â£31.5m is welcome but it is a far cry from what is needed. ""The truth is that this is not simply a waiting list issue; it represents a serious collapse in health services for far too many people who have been told that they have to wait for years for elective care that will improve their quality of life."" ""What we need is a longer-term strategic resource plan to deal with this crisis. ""The Department of Health and Royal College of Surgeons have identified Â£1bn is needed over the next five years to address waiting times alone. ""That critical resource needs to be accompanied by a strong political agreement to transform our health service so that patients can access treatment at the point of need."" Education Minister Michelle McIlveen welcomed the funding for children with special educational needs ""after an extremely challenging year for the education sector"". She said the money will be used ""to deal with the pressures caused by Covid-19"". Ms McIlveen said the funding will ""support pressures relating to special schools and specialist support in mainstream schools, SEN support services and SEN transport"" and includes a further Â£8m to support implementation of the new special educational needs framework.

U-turn over Premium Bond prizes paid by cheque,"Plans that would have ended the surprise arrival of a Premium Bonds prize on the doormat have been scrapped. National Savings and Investments (NS&I) said it had responded to customer feedback by changing plans to axe prizes paid by cheque. Savers can choose whether to have their prize through the door, paid directly into a bank account, or reinvested. Premium Bonds are the most popular savings product in the UK. They were launched by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in April 1956. The first winning Premium Bond number in 1957 NS&I, which provides Premium Bonds, has come under severe criticism during the Covid crisis, particularly for poor customer service. In September, it announced plans to phase out paper warrants - like a cheque - which are sent in the post to some Premium Bonds winners. It has encouraged people to receive payouts directly into bank accounts, claiming that system was more efficient and that fewer prizes would go unclaimed. However, complaints from savers who were worried about the changes flooded in, at a time when NS&I's call centres were facing their own Covid-related staffing pressures. NS&I 'must work hard to win back customers' Fed-up savers may test their luck in prize draws NS&I chief executive Ian Ackerley admitted to MPs that the timing of the proposed change had been an error, By December, the plan had been put on hold and it has now been scrapped entirely. ""We have responded to feedback from some of our customers and we have decided to retain the option for them to receive Premium Bonds prizes through the post,"" Mr Ackerley said. ""We will continue to encourage customers to have their prizes paid directly into their bank account, as many have done so in the last 12 months."" He apologised to customers who had been forced to wait for a long time for their calls to be answered, but said service levels were now back to normal.

EE to reintroduce Europe roaming charges,"Mobile operator EE will charge new UK customers extra to use their mobile phones in Europe from January. Those joining or upgrading from 7 July 2021 will be charged Â£2 a day to use their allowances in 47 European destinations from January 2022. EE, which is part of BT Group, previously said it had no plans to reintroduce roaming charges in Europe. It is the first UK operator to reintroduce the charges since the EU trade deal was signed in December. Since 2017, mobile networks in EU countries have not been allowed to charge customers extra to use their phones in other EU countries. There are some ""fair use"" limits, for example, you cannot get a mobile phone contract from Romania and then use it all year round in Italy. In January 2021, EE, O2, Three and Vodafone all stated they hadno plans to reintroduce roaming charges, despite Brexit giving them the option to do so. EE said on Thursday that introducing the charges would ""support investment into our UK based customer service and leading UK network"". However, it will not charge UK customers extra to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland. Customers travelling to the 47 affected European destinations will also be able to buy 30-day passes for Â£10 to use their home tariff abroad. On Wednesday, it wasreported,externalthat O2 was going to reintroduce roaming charges. However, it is merely adding a ""fair use"" data cap of 25GB a month and will not charge customers more to use their phones in the EU. Fair use limits are normal and were allowed when the UK was still part of the EU. From next month, Three will be reducing its fair use limit from 20GB a month to 12GB. The UK's trade deal,externalwith the EU says that both sides will encourage operators to have ""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming, but it did not ban charges. Thegovernment's guidelines,externalencouraged people traveling in Europe to check with their mobile operators to find out about any roaming charges. Which mobile providers have roaming charges?

Bank boss says staff work better in the office,"The UK boss of banking giant Citigroup has said its ""business works best from being together"" as the firm plans for staff to work from the office for three days a week. James Bardrick said workers needed to be together ""to get the best out of yourself and for the team"". His comments come as other firms such asGoldman Sachs plan to get all staff back in the office after 19 July. Some firms are also instructing staff to register their vaccine status. Mr Bardrick, Citi's country officer for the UK, said after restrictions were eased, the ""vast majority"" of staff would work from the office three days a week and have two days a week elsewhere. However, Mr Bardrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We strongly believe that our business works best from being together. ""We think that we are better together. We think we succeed for our clients and for our organisation together. ""So what we are saying is that, yes, use greater flexibility, but to do your job well, to develop as an employee, to get the best out of yourself and for the team, we need to be together."" Mr Bardrick said the bank was not copying JP Morgan's policy on vaccination status, but added anyone entering a company building had to ""demonstrate that they have got a negative test result"". JP Morgan, the biggest bank in the US,has instructed its US staff to register their vaccine status on an internal web portal, with its boss Jamie Dimon previously saying he wanted staff back in the office from July. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs told the BBC it was mandatory for US staff to share their vaccine status but voluntary for UK workers. NatWest has said just over a third of its 59,300 full-time employees in the UK would continue to work remotely. Some 55% of its staff would adopt a hybrid model of working, splitting their time between the office and home. Morgan Stanley has barred staff and clients from entering its New York offices if they are not fully vaccinated. An internal memo,first reported by the Financial Times,external, said: ""Starting July 12 all employees, contingent workforce, clients and visitors will be required to attest to being fully vaccinated to access Morgan Stanley buildings in New York City and Westchester."" A person familiar with the policy told the BBC: ""Operating within a fully vaccinated environment allows us to lift restrictions like the use of face coverings and the need to maintain physical distancing, returning to more normal office conditions."" Some banks are telling staff they can work from home on certain days Mark Dixon, chief executive of global workspace provider IWG, said his company was working with firms to ""provide hybrid working solutions"". He said having all staff working from one office building made ""no sense"" in a digital world. ""Everyone has worked out they can do their job from anywhere,"" he added. ""They want to go into the office some of the time, not all the time. ""The geography of work is going to change,"" he added. ""It's simply technology allowing people to work from anywhere they want. ""It saves the company money and reduces their carbon footprint."" ""Ultimately, the answer is yes,"" according to Shah Qureshi, partner and head of employment at law firm Irwin Mitchell. ""There is an obligation to return to the office where an employer requires you to do so, and your normal workplace is the office, but there is a duty of care that the employer has to ensure that everything is safe as far as possible."" Mr Qureshi said that when a person is under a contract of employment, they are required to attend the workplace in order to undertake their duties. However, he added that under the Health and Safety at Work Act, ""employers have an obligation to ensure that there is a safe working environment, a safe workplace, to which an employee returns"", which is irrespective of whether restrictions are abolished on 19 July. Shah Qureshi is a partner and head of employment at law firm Irwin Mitchell ""The duty of care (from employers) still remains and has always been there,"" he said. Measures put in place by companies would include spacing desks out, enforcing one-way walking systems and ensuring adequate sanitary facilities. ""Some employers are bringing in separate bubbles and they're planning on having different bubbles in at different times."" Mr Qureshi said that as the law currently stands, there is no legal right for employees to work from home. Despite debates around such a right being made into law,it was ""very difficult to predict"" what would happen, he added. ""I think it depends on whether there is a groundswell of public opinion in favour of that.""

Accounts show Charles funded Harry until mid-2020,"The Prince of Wales continued to support the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with a ""substantial sum"" in the months after they stood down as senior royals, Clarence House has said. Prince Harry told Oprah Winfrey his family ""cut me off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020. A Clarence House spokesman said Prince Charles continued to fund the Sussexes until that summer. The Sussexes deny there is a difference in timelines. A spokesperson for them said Prince Harry was referring in his Oprah interview to the first quarter of the fiscal reporting period - the period from April to the start of July. The comments by Clarence House - the office of Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall - were made as the annual royal accounts were published. Accounts for the Sovereign Grant show the monarchy cost Â£87.5m during 2020-21, an increase of Â£18.1m on the previous financial year. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace hasrevealed its proportion of ethnic minority staff (8.5%) for the first time. Where do Harry and Meghan get their money? Where does the Queen get her money? 2020 royal accounts show potential Â£35m Covid shortfall Funding for both of Prince Charles's sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and their families contributed to a Â£4.5m bill for the prince, his Clarence House financial accounts showed. Harry and Meghan were still listed as receiving money from Charles's Duchy of Cornwall income, despite quitting the monarchy at the end of March last year. The funding bill - plus other expenditure, including Prince Charles's capital expenditure and transfer to reserves - dropped by around Â£1.2m in the financial year after the Sussexes stopped being senior royals. A senior Clarence House spokesperson said: ""As we'll all remember in January 2020 when the duke and duchess announced that they were going to move away from the working royal family, the duke said that they would work towards becoming financially independent. ""The Prince of Wales allocated a substantial sum to support them with this transition. ""That funding ceased in the summer of last year. The couple are now financially independent."" During the couple's interview with Winfrey in March, Harry said ""my family literally cut me off financially"" in ""the first quarter of 2020"". Quizzed about the timeframes, the Clarence House spokesperson said: ""I wouldn't acknowledge that they are dramatically different. All I can tell you are the facts."" A spokeperson for the Sussexes told reporters: ""You are conflating two different timelines and it's inaccurate to suggest that there's a contradiction. ""The duke's comments during the Oprah interview were in reference to the first quarter of the fiscal reporting period in the UK, which starts annually in April."" Harry and Meghan signed multimillion-pound deals with Netflix and Spotify, with the duke telling Winfrey he secured these to pay for his security. He said he had what Diana left him - Â£7m at the time - and ""without that we would not have been able to do this"". Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has said it ""must do more"" and is ""not where it would like to be"" in terms of diversity. The Royal Household has revealed in its annual financial accounts for 2020-2021 that its proportion of ethnic minority employees stands at 8.5%, with a target of 10% for 2022. In the UK, around 13% of the UK population is from a minority ethnic background, according to the latest 2011 Census data. A total of 8.5% of Buckingham Palace staff are drawn from ethnic minorities. That compares to 13% of the UK's population at the time of the 2011 census and just under 40% of the population of London, where the majority of staff are based. ""Could do better"" is Palace's own verdict. ""We recognise we are not where we want to be"", said a senior Palace source; next year's target is 10%. But change may be hard to achieve. While public funding has remained steady, the extra money the monarch made from things like paid visits to the palaces fell by half. A Â£10m shortfall was covered by cutting back on some events like garden parties and by a recruitment freeze. Without new faces it is difficult to change the profile of household staff; and the Palace reckons that Covid restrictions will hit its supplementary income for some time to come. The Sovereign Grant is funded by profits from the Crown Estate - a multibillion-pound property portfolio that ranges from London's Regent Street to Ascot Racecourse. The estate is managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers.

Uefa scraps away goals rule,"Porto beat Juventus on away goals in the 2020-21 Champions League The away goals rule in European club football is to be abolished from the start of next season, governing body Uefa has confirmed. The rule, used since 1965, decided drawn two-legged games by favouring the team that scored the most away goals. All ties level on aggregate at the end of the second leg will instead go to extra time and potentially penalties. ""It is no longer appropriate for an away goal to carry more weight,"" said Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin. Uefa's club competitions committee made the proposal in May and it has now been approved by the body's executive committee. It means games in the Champions League, Europa League, Europa Conference League and Women's Champions League will no longer use the rule. Uefa says there is now a smaller gap between the number of home and away wins as well as home and away goals scored in European competitions compared to when the rule was introduced, reducing home advantage. It says that is down to a number of factors including pitch quality, improved stadium infrastructure and new technology such as the video assistant referee. ""The impact of the rule now runs counter to its original purpose as, in fact, it now dissuades home teams - especially in first legs - from attacking, because they fear conceding a goal that would give their opponents a crucial advantage,"" Ceferin added. ""There is also criticism of the unfairness, especially in extra time, of obliging the home team to score twice when the away team has scored. ""It is fair to say that home advantage is now no longer as significant as it once was."" May 2019: Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (3-3 on aggregate - Tottenham win on away goals) Lucas Moura is one of only five players to score a Champions League semi-final hat-trick Tottenham reached their first Champions League final in the most dramatic of circumstances in May 2019. Trailing Ajax 1-0 from the first leg, Mauricio Pochettino's side trailed 2-0 at half-time of the return game in Amsterdam and looked all certain to be knocked out. Step forward Lucas Moura, who scored two goals in four second-half minutes to bring Spurs level on the night, before firing home a 96th-minute winner to complete his hat-trick and send them through to the final. April 2019: Man City 4-3 Tottenham (4-4 on aggregate - Tottenham win on away goals) Fernando Lorente's goal sent Tottenham through a Champions League/European Cup semi-final for the second time in their history With Tottenham protecting a 1-0 lead from their quarter-final first leg against Manchester City, the two sides shared five goals inside a chaotic opening 21 minutes of the second leg. Sergio Aguero made it 4-2 on the night and 4-3 on aggregate in the second half to put Pep Guardiola's side on course for the last four, before Fernando Llorente's header edged Spurs ahead on away goals. To add to the drama, Raheem Sterling saw his stoppage-time strike ruled out by VAR, leaving Guardiola on his knees in despair. March 2019: Paris Saint-Germain 1-3 Man Utd (3-3 on aggregate - Man Utd win on away goals) Marcus Rashford had never previously taken a penalty in a competitive game for Manchester United before his winner at PSG Manchester United became the first team in Champions League/European Cup history to overcome a 2-0 or greater home first-leg deficit when they stunned Paris Saint-Germain in March 2019. Marcus Rashford was the hero with a nerveless 94th-minute penalty to level the tie at 3-3 on aggregate and send the Red Devils through on away goals, arguably securing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the manager's job on a permanent basis in the process. April 2018: Roma 3-0 Barcelona (Aggregate 4-4 - Roma win on away goals) Kostas Manolas' header sent Roma through to their first Champions League/European Cup semi-final since 1984 Another thrilling second-leg comeback, this time from Roma as they overturned a 4-1 first-leg deficit to progress past Barcelona and go through to the semi-finals. Defender Kostas Manolas scored the crucial third goal, heading in at the near post with eight minutes remaining to spark scenes of delirium inside the Stadio Olimpico. May 2009: Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona (1-1 on aggregate - Barcelona win on away goals) Andres Iniesta's shot was Barcelona's first on target and was enough to send them through to the final A stoppage-time strike from Andres Iniesta cancelled out Michael Essien's early goal and edged Barcelona past Chelsea and through to the final on away goals back in 2009, sparking scenes of chaos inside Stamford Bridge at full time. It was all too much for a furious Didier Drogba who, frustrated at a number of refereeing decisions, launched a verbal tirade to referee Tom Ovrebo after the final whistle before swearing directly down a TV camera as he made his way off the pitch.

Ministers 'should urge public to eat less meat',"The UK public should be urged by the government to protect the climate by eating less meat and dairy produce, advisers say. Cattle are a major source of planet-heating gases, but ministers fear a backlash if they ask people to cut down on steak. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says people should reduce meat-eating for their health, as well as for the planet. It says the issue's one of many failings of a government which is delivering only a fifth of its pledges on climate change. People should be asked to eat 20% less meat and dairy produce by 2030, and 35% less by 2050, the CCC insists. The CCC says Boris Johnson must devise evidence-based policies to encourage healthier diets and set clear targets. Its report says the PM's ""remarkable"" climate leadership is undermined by inadequate policies and poor implementation in many areas of policy. A government spokesman said its net zero strategy, due in the Autumn, would show where carbon cuts would be imposed across the economy. Net zero refers to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases as much as possible and then balancing out any remaining releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere - by, for example, planting trees. UK warned it is unprepared for climate chaos Climate change 'driving UK's extreme weather' Extreme weather causes major global losses in 2020 But the committee complains that the public hasn't been engaged to make changes essential for protecting the climate. In addition to meat and dairy, they are: Sales of new gas boilers should be stopped by 2033. People will mostly convert to heat pumps instead. This will involve disruption - and the CCC says ministers will have to subsidise the installation cost. Committee members want to see taxes taken off clean electricity - and maybe shifted on to more polluting gas - although power bills for poor households should not rise. Frequent fliers will need to be curbed, the CCC believes. Even if low-carbon planes are developed, the UK still cannot let demand for aviation grow unconstrained. People will need to be consulted over changes ahead - perhaps by groups such as the UK climate assembly. The government has plans for a net zero aviation strategy The report says the government currently lacks policies on these issues and many others. Waste and low-carbon heat networks are said to need policies too. The committee chairman Lord Deben said the prime minister's commitments on the international stage to cut emissions 78% by 2035 are ""remarkable decisions"". He added that the objective of achieving near zero emissions by 2050 sets a major example to other nations. ""The trouble,"" he said, is that the delivery has not been there. Almost all things that should have happened have either been delayed or not hit the mark. They need to step up very rapidly."" The CCC's chief executive Chris Stark said he was ""very concerned by the gulf between promises and actions"". His report laid down some fundamental principles for the journey towards a near zero-carbon economy. It urges the Treasury to protect the poorest from the cost of climate policies. It says: ""The net zero strategy must be underpinned by an approach that distributes the costs, savings and wider benefits of decarbonisation fairly. ""It must encourage action across society, while protecting vulnerable people and companies at risk of adverse impacts."" A government spokesman said: ""Any suggestion we have been slow to deliver climate action is widely off the mark. Over the past three decades, we have driven down emissions by 44% - the fastest reduction of any G7 country. A really simple guide to climate change ""We have set some of the most ambitious targets in the world for the future. ""In recent months, we've made clear with record investment in wind power, a new UK Emissions Trading Scheme, Â£5.2bn investment in flood and sea defences, clear plans to decarbonise heavy industry and North Sea oil, and businesses pledging to become net zero by 2050 or earlier. ""Our strategies this year will set out more of the very policies the Climate Change Committee is calling for as we redouble our efforts to end the UK's contribution to climate change."" This video can not be played What is climate change? But environmental group Friends of the Earth said: ""The committee's criticisms are spot on. Without a detailed strategy for combating the climate crisis, government promises to decarbonise the economy are simply more hot air. ""With no climate action plan and his government's support for more roads, runways and an overseas gas project, Boris Johnson risks being a laughing stock at the UN climate summit [which the UK is hosting]."" The CCC insists ministers must commit all policies to a ""net zero test"" to ensure that decisions are compatible with the emissions targets. But there is a Whitehall logjam of decarbonisation initiatives in the pipeline. They include the Environment Bill and several strategies for different sectors, such as a transport decarbonisation plan and a net zero aviation strategy. Mr Stark says the environment Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is lagging with policies, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is failing to integrate climate change into the Planning Bill. All these policies, though, are over-shadowed by the delayed Treasury net zero review, which will determine how much cash is invested into the projected zero-carbon economy. Some key policies are being delayed by the Treasury, and environmentalists fear that the Chancellor Rishi Sunak may be jockeying for influence with the climate sceptic wing of the Conservative Party by withholding funds needed for the PM's ""green revolution"". It is a huge challenge for the Treasury, which will also need to take into account anotherrecent CCC report warning that the nation unprepared for the inevitable impactof a heating climate on the UK.

Bank boss says staff work better in the officeJames Bardrick says most UK staff at bank Citi will work from the office three days a week.,"The UK boss of banking giant Citigroup has said its ""business works best from being together"" as the firm plans for staff to work from the office for three days a week. James Bardrick said workers needed to be together ""to get the best out of yourself and for the team"". His comments come as other firms such asGoldman Sachs plan to get all staff back in the office after 19 July. Some firms are also instructing staff to register their vaccine status. Mr Bardrick, Citi's country officer for the UK, said after restrictions were eased, the ""vast majority"" of staff would work from the office three days a week and have two days a week elsewhere. However, Mr Bardrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We strongly believe that our business works best from being together. ""We think that we are better together. We think we succeed for our clients and for our organisation together. ""So what we are saying is that, yes, use greater flexibility, but to do your job well, to develop as an employee, to get the best out of yourself and for the team, we need to be together."" Mr Bardrick said the bank was not copying JP Morgan's policy on vaccination status, but added anyone entering a company building had to ""demonstrate that they have got a negative test result"". JP Morgan, the biggest bank in the US,has instructed its US staff to register their vaccine status on an internal web portal, with its boss Jamie Dimon previously saying he wanted staff back in the office from July. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs told the BBC it was mandatory for US staff to share their vaccine status but voluntary for UK workers. NatWest has said just over a third of its 59,300 full-time employees in the UK would continue to work remotely. Some 55% of its staff would adopt a hybrid model of working, splitting their time between the office and home. Morgan Stanley has barred staff and clients from entering its New York offices if they are not fully vaccinated. An internal memo,first reported by the Financial Times,external, said: ""Starting July 12 all employees, contingent workforce, clients and visitors will be required to attest to being fully vaccinated to access Morgan Stanley buildings in New York City and Westchester."" A person familiar with the policy told the BBC: ""Operating within a fully vaccinated environment allows us to lift restrictions like the use of face coverings and the need to maintain physical distancing, returning to more normal office conditions."" Some banks are telling staff they can work from home on certain days Mark Dixon, chief executive of global workspace provider IWG, said his company was working with firms to ""provide hybrid working solutions"". He said having all staff working from one office building made ""no sense"" in a digital world. ""Everyone has worked out they can do their job from anywhere,"" he added. ""They want to go into the office some of the time, not all the time. ""The geography of work is going to change,"" he added. ""It's simply technology allowing people to work from anywhere they want. ""It saves the company money and reduces their carbon footprint."" ""Ultimately, the answer is yes,"" according to Shah Qureshi, partner and head of employment at law firm Irwin Mitchell. ""There is an obligation to return to the office where an employer requires you to do so, and your normal workplace is the office, but there is a duty of care that the employer has to ensure that everything is safe as far as possible."" Mr Qureshi said that when a person is under a contract of employment, they are required to attend the workplace in order to undertake their duties. However, he added that under the Health and Safety at Work Act, ""employers have an obligation to ensure that there is a safe working environment, a safe workplace, to which an employee returns"", which is irrespective of whether restrictions are abolished on 19 July. Shah Qureshi is a partner and head of employment at law firm Irwin Mitchell ""The duty of care (from employers) still remains and has always been there,"" he said. Measures put in place by companies would include spacing desks out, enforcing one-way walking systems and ensuring adequate sanitary facilities. ""Some employers are bringing in separate bubbles and they're planning on having different bubbles in at different times."" Mr Qureshi said that as the law currently stands, there is no legal right for employees to work from home. Despite debates around such a right being made into law,it was ""very difficult to predict"" what would happen, he added. ""I think it depends on whether there is a groundswell of public opinion in favour of that.""

Bank of England shrugs off inflation fears,"The Bank of England has shrugged off concerns over a pick-up in inflation as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Consumer price inflation hita two-year high of 2.1%in the year to May, exceeding the Bank's 2% target. In its latest statement, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it expected inflation to go above 3% ""for a temporary period"". The MPC voted 9-0 to keep interest rates steady at the historic low of 0.1%. Rates have been unchanged since March last year, when they were reduced to help contain the economic shock of Covid-19. ""Financial market measures of inflation expectations suggest that the near-term strength in inflation is expected to be transitory,"" the Bank said. High inflation is ""transitory"" and has not yet affected the need for ongoing stimulus of the economy - that is the judgement of the Bank of England's key interest rate-setting committee. The recovery around the world has been stronger than expected and the UK's growth prospects this year have been upgraded. House prices are strongly up in the year. However, uncertainty over the impact on the economy of the withdrawal of furlough support, the new pandemic variant and other factors means they are keeping their foot on the accelerator pedal. Only departing chief economist Andy Haldane sounded a note of caution, saying the Bank should buy Â£50bn less in government bonds. He was again outvoted 8-1. The bounce back is certainly real, but there is a statistical fog about what actually happens in this unprecedented situation. The Bank's decision-makers have decided to wait and see what actually happens to jobs and growth, rather than act now on inflation. The reopening bounce back is not a boom. Not yet. The Bank said it now expected the UK economy to recover faster than it had previously predicted. It said output in June was now expected to be about 2.5% below its pre-Covid level. ""Output in a number of sectors is now around pre-Covid levels, although it remains materially below in others.  The housing market remains strong, and indicators of consumer confidence have increased,"" it said. Inflation fears grow as UK factory prices surge Clothes and fuel costs push prices to 2-year high The MPC said the direct economic implications of delaying the final relaxation of Covid restrictions to 19 July were likely to be ""relatively small"" compared with the impact of previous stages. ""The Committee's central expectation is that the economy will experience a temporary period of strong GDP growth and above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation will fall back,"" it added. ""There are two-sided risks around this central path, and it is possible that near-term upward pressure on prices could prove somewhat larger than expected. ""Taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judges that UK inflation expectations remain well anchored."" MPC members also voted 8-1 to continue with the Bank's existing asset purchase scheme, maintaining its bond-buying target at Â£895bn. Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, highlighted the fact that departing chief economist Andy Haldane was once again the dissenting voice on the Bank's quantitative easing programme, voting for a reduction in bond purchases. ""It will be extremely interesting to see who replaces [Mr] Haldane in the chief economist role following his imminent departure,"" he said. ""It is likely the Bank will drift back into a more relaxed tone on the transitory nature of any inflation pressure once [Mr] Haldane's voice and vote has moved on.""

Britney Spears in blistering attack on guardianship,"The singer said she felt ""forced"" to perform and was punished when she spoke out US pop star Britney Spears has launched a blistering attack on the ""abusive"" conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years. She said she was traumatised and cried every day, telling a judge in Los Angeles: ""I just want my life back"". Spears, 39, also said she had been denied the right to have more children and was put on the psychiatric drug lithium against her wishes. Her father was granted control over her affairs by court order in 2008. The order was granted after the star was put in hospital amid concerns over her mental health, and it has been extended for more than a decade since. Britney Spears: Everything she said in court Timberlake leads outpouring of support for Britney The conservatorship case explained The special hearing on Wednesday was the first time Spears has spoken in open court about her case. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny thanked Spears for her ""courageous"" words during the proceedings. It followed much speculation about the pop star's situation, with fans eagerly combing her social media output for clues. A fan-led movement, known as #FreeBritney, has campaigned for her legal freedom for years. But along legal process is likely before any decision is made on ending the conservatorship,external, the Associated Press reports. Spears delivered an impassioned address which lasted for more than 20 minutes. After launching into her speech, she was asked by the judge to slow down and later said she wished she could stay on the phone ""forever"" to avoid returning to her life where she was surrounded by people who said no to her. Spears told the court she wanted the conservatorship to end and described the arrangement as ""embarrassing and humiliating"". This video can not be played Britney Spears: Fans speak out against conservatorship Referring to past Instagram posts, the singer said: ""I've lied and told the whole world I'm okay and I'm happy. ""I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,"" she said. ""I'm not happy. I can't sleep. I'm so angry it's insane. And I'm depressed. I cry every day."" Spears, a mother of two, said she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to. She accused her conservator of stopping her from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed so she could get pregnant. ""I feel ganged up on and I feel bullied and I feel left out and alone,"" she told the court. ""I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does, by having a child, a family, any of those things."" Spears said she felt ""forced"" to tour by her management. She said she spoke out against going straight onto a Las Vegas residency, and her therapist was falsely told she was not co-operating or taking her medication. She alleged she was then put on the drug lithium -a common medicine for bipolar disorder,external- against her wishes and it had made her feel drunk and unable to converse. Spears said it was her belief that the conservatorship was doing her ""way more harm than good"" and said she ""honestly didn't know"" she could petition for the arrangement to end. The full extent of why the court order was extended has never been made public. But Spears has maintained a public career, including a Las Vegas residency and a stint as an X-Factor judge, leading many to question the validity of the arrangement. #FreeBritney campaigners gathered on Wednesday in support of Ms Spears A lawyer for her father, Jamie Spears, said he had been troubled by the singer's allegations in court. ""He is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain,"" the lawyer said in a statement read out in court. ""Mr Spears loves his daughter, and he misses her very much."" A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, such as those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Spears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one is for her estate and financial affairs, the other is for her as a person. Under the agreement, the pop star has not controlled her finances since 2008. That is around the time she began to behave erratically amid her divorce from Kevin Federline and a custody battle over their children. The star made headlines in a series of public incidents, including shaving her head, and she was twice admitted to hospital. 1998 Britney Spears, 16, catapults to the top of global pop charts with her debut single ...Baby One More Time. More than 20 years later, her debut album of the same name remains the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. February 2007 Spears is hounded by the press amid a tumultuous custody dispute with ex-husband Kevin Federline, allegations that she is an unfit mother and questions about her mental health. Amid the tabloid frenzy, she is captured on camera shaving her head. A few days later, she smashes a paparazzoâs SUV repeatedly with an umbrella. 2008 After stints in hospital and rehab, Spearsâ father Jamie petitions a Los Angeles court to place his daughter under a temporary conservatorship. He is charged with making decisions about her career, as well as her estate and financial affairs. The conservatorship is extended indefinitely later that year. 2013 Despite being unable to handle her own affairs, Spears continues to work. After rehabilitating her image with a successful seventh studio album and several appearances on television, she begins a four-year concert residency in Las Vegas. 2019-2020 Spears says she is taking a break from work because of her fatherâs health issues. Later in the year, Jamie Spears steps away as her conservator temporarily, citing his poor health. Britney Spears indicates through her lawyers that she no longer wants her father to be involved in handling her career. A lawyer says Spears is “afraid of her father” and will not return to the stage as long as he retains control. February 2021 A New York Times documentary about the pop starâs rise and fall, as well as about her treatment by the media, generates mass public interest in her conservatorship. June-July 2021 In explosive court testimony, Britney Spears alleges she was drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having more children under the conservatorship. She says she will not perform again while her father retains control over her career, and officially requests for him to be replaced as her conservator. August 2021 Jamie Spears says he is ready to step down as his daughter's conservator “when the time is right"" and pledges to participate in an ""orderly transition”. He later asks the court if the conservatorship itself should continue, saying his daughter should be given the chance to manage her own affairs. September 2021 At a court in Los Angeles, a judge suspends Jamie Spears from the legal arrangement that gave him control over his daughterâs life. Jamie Spears stepped down temporarily as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 due to health reasons. She sought to permanently install Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, into the role instead of reinstating her father - but on Wednesday she said Ms Montgomery was ""even starting to take it too far"". Her father remains co-conservator of her estate, along with the financial firm the Bessemer Trust. Mr Spears's legal team has insisted he has done a good job of managing his daughter's finances. But a court-appointed lawyer for the pop star said she is afraid of him and will not return to the stage as long as he remains in control of her career. Spears said Wednesday that she believed her father ""he loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%"". Dozens of fans gathered outside court on Wednesday, holding signs that read ""Free Britney now!"" and ""Get out of Britney's life!"" ""Everything she said was absolutely heartbreaking and it was actually even worse than I really thought it was,"" Megan Radford, one of the movement's founders, told the BBC. David Willis, BBC News, Los Angeles Britney Spears unleashed on a stunned courtroom the equivalent of 13 years of pent-up frustration - a torrent of accusation, anger and regret, all delivered in such a breathless monologue that at times the judge had to ask her to slow down. She came across as isolated, lost and lonely; a superstar that has been relentlessly manipulated. We knew that she had asked to put her case directly to the judge, but few could have predicted such a tirade. It amounted to a withering critique of the conservatorship process and the motives of many - members of her family chief among them - who were supposed to have been caring for her. Both the #FreeBritney movement and the recent release of a New York Times documentary about the singer have renewed public interest in the case. The pop star has never commented directly on her conservatorship battle, with her online persona remaining upbeat. A lawyer for the singer's mother, Lynne, has asked for her daughter's wishes to be heard Court records from 2019, the last time she spoke in court, have never been made public.But earlier this week the New York Times said it had obtained confidential court documents,externalthat showed the singer had opposed the restrictions since 2014. The newspaper also reported that the singer felt she was forced to stay at a mental health facility in 2019 on exaggerated grounds which she viewed as punishment for standing up for herself. In April, the pop star asked to address the court through her court-appointed attorney. A number of celebrities have posted messages of support. Pop star Justin Timberlake, her boyfriend in the 1990s, posted a thread of tweets,externalcalling for people to stand by her: ""We should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it wasâ¦ what's happening to her is just not right."" Timberlake made a public apology to Spearsearlier this year after the New York Times documentary suggested he had treated her disrespectfully by discussing their sex life on the radio. Spears's current boyfriend, the personal trainer and actor Sam Asghari, posted a picture on Instagram of himself in Free Britney T-Shirt. Singer Mariah Carey tweeted: ""We love you Britney!!! Stay strong."" Rose McGowan, the actor and MeToo activist, said Spears had every right to be angry, adding: ""How would you feel if your life was stolen, dissected, mocked? STOP CONTROLLING WOMEN.""

EE to reintroduce Europe roaming chargesThe mobile operator EE is to charge new customers to use their phones in Europe.Technology,"Mobile operator EE will charge new UK customers extra to use their mobile phones in Europe from January. Those joining or upgrading from 7 July 2021 will be charged Â£2 a day to use their allowances in 47 European destinations from January 2022. EE, which is part of BT Group, previously said it had no plans to reintroduce roaming charges in Europe. It is the first UK operator to reintroduce the charges since the EU trade deal was signed in December. Since 2017, mobile networks in EU countries have not been allowed to charge customers extra to use their phones in other EU countries. There are some ""fair use"" limits, for example, you cannot get a mobile phone contract from Romania and then use it all year round in Italy. In January 2021, EE, O2, Three and Vodafone all stated they hadno plans to reintroduce roaming charges, despite Brexit giving them the option to do so. EE said on Thursday that introducing the charges would ""support investment into our UK based customer service and leading UK network"". However, it will not charge UK customers extra to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland. Customers travelling to the 47 affected European destinations will also be able to buy 30-day passes for Â£10 to use their home tariff abroad. On Wednesday, it wasreported,externalthat O2 was going to reintroduce roaming charges. However, it is merely adding a ""fair use"" data cap of 25GB a month and will not charge customers more to use their phones in the EU. Fair use limits are normal and were allowed when the UK was still part of the EU. From next month, Three will be reducing its fair use limit from 20GB a month to 12GB. The UK's trade deal,externalwith the EU says that both sides will encourage operators to have ""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming, but it did not ban charges. Thegovernment's guidelines,externalencouraged people traveling in Europe to check with their mobile operators to find out about any roaming charges. Which mobile providers have roaming charges?

George Osborne named British Museum chairman,"George Osborne is a former Conservative MP and editor of The Evening Standard Former chancellor George Osborne has been named as the next chairman of the British Museum. The 50-year-old, who stepped down as The Evening Standard's editor earlier this year, will join the museum's board of trustees on 1 September. A month later, on 4 October, he will formally succeed Sir Richard Lambert as chairman. It is an unpaid role. Osborne said he was ""absolutely thrilled to be joining the team"" at the British Museum. ""[I'm] so honoured to have had the opportunity to apply for this role, and to have been chosen by the trustees to become their chair,"" Osborne added in his statement. ""All my life I have loved the British Museum. To my mind, it is quite simply the greatest museum in the world. It's a place that brings cultures together and tells the story of our common humanity."" The British Museum is one of the top visitor attractions in the UK The board approved his appointment unanimously, according to the museum. Osborne, who used to be a Conservative MP, also became a partner at investment bank Robey Warshaw in April and remains chairman of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. Baroness Minouche Shafik, deputy chair of the British Museum, said Mr Osborne would be working with the board to expand the institution's audience as it embarked on a ""major programme of renewal"". Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, said the museum was undergoing the ""biggest transformative project"" in its history. He added: ""George Osborne knows the museum well and values the trust the museum enjoys around the world. ""He understands the active role the British Museum is playing in the recovery of the country, creating opportunities for everyone to discover the collection as their own - onsite, through loans to their local museums and online.""

After the government said museums could lose taxpayer support if they remove artefacts, the British Museum reassured the public it had ""no intention of removing controversial objects from display"". But, it said, it would seek to ""contextualise"" such items ""in a way that enables the public to learn about them in their entirety"".

Can you go on holiday to France or Spain?,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country.

"Travel rules to be updated amid industry pressureTravel bosses want more countries on the green list, as the government carries out its three-week review.","The last review, which was three weeks ago, saw Portugal removed from the green list Changes to the UK's rules on foreign travel are set to be announced later, after industry bosses united in a plea for the green list to be widened. There has been speculation Malta and the Spanish islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Minorca could be green listed. Travel bosses are also calling for an exemption to quarantine for fully-vaccinated people from amber countries. PM Boris Johnson said there was a ""real opportunity to open up travel"" this summer for those who have had two jabs. But the prospect of European holidays could face another hurdle, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested all EU countries should make British travellers quarantine on arrival to slow the spread of the Delta variant. On Thursday, theUK reported,external16,703 cases and 21 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. LIVE: Travel sector hoping rules relaxed for fully-jabbed What are the green, amber and red rules? How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? What's happening with foreign travel? Mrs Merkel told Germany's parliament: ""In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that's not the case in every European country, and that's what I would like to see."" Currently,people travelling from the UK to Greece, Spain and Portugal are not required to quarantine. Those going to Italy have to self-isolate for five days then take a test, while fully-vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining. By contrast, when returning to the UK from most holiday hotspots on the amber list, travellers have to self-isolate for 10 days, as well as pay for tests. Asked about Mrs Merkel's remarks on the Delta variant meaning more restrictions on British travellers going abroad, Mr Johnson said: ""The most important thing is that we think double jabs do offer a good way forward, we think they offer the hope of travel this summer. ""More than 60% of our population have now had two jabs, I think 83% have had one jab, we're really getting through it now. The crucial thing is, come forward and get your second jab,"" he said. He added that he wasn't going to claim the summer would be like any other. ""I don't want to cast a pall over things but, as I said the other day, it will be different."" Tom Singleton, from Derby, is on a family holiday with his wife and four-year-old daughter on the very quiet Greek island of Kos. They had originally planned to go to Cyprus but had to cancel three times. Determined to get away before their daughter starts school in September, the family flew to Kos - on the amber list - on a virtually empty plane to stay in a deserted hotel. ""Until yesterday we were the only British people in our hotel,"" he told the BBC. Tom and his wife are both fully-vaccinated and hopeful - if a little doubtful - Kos might be moved on to the safer green list which would save them from quarantining. ""Cases are very minimal here and it's safer here than at home - it makes no sense why it can't be green,"" he said. He highlighted some of the apparent contradictions in the travel rules, asking how Uefa VIPs, sponsors, staff and guests could come into the UK ""from wherever"" without quarantining. ""It begs the question why one rule for the few and another for everyone else."" Can you go on holiday to Malta, Spain or Portugal? Just 11 destinations are on the green list - including Israel and Australia - although neither has opened up its borders to tourists. Travellers do not need to quarantine when they get back from green-list countries, but they do have to pay for tests. Countries on the red list are considered the highest risk, and travel from those nations is more strictly limited. The UK government reviews which countries are on which list every three weeks, and the last update - when Portugal was stripped from the green list - was three weeks ago on 3 June. As well as today's review, the government has also said there will be a ""checkpoint"" review of the rules for each category on Monday 28 June. That could be when ministers decide whether to relax quarantine for fully-vaccinated travellers. On Wednesday, Mr Shapps told the BBC: ""If you've been double vaccinated then of course we need to look at what the science says. We've said that Monday is the point to review that data, so we are coming up to having a look at it. ""We're looking at it in the next few days and I'll have more to say."" The UK government's traffic light system applies toEngland,,externalwithScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalable to make their own rules. However, the rules are broadly the same and previous changes to the lists have been adopted by all four nations. The issues around international travel in Europe are tricky, complex and ever-changing. In the spring the UK had one of the lowest infection rates in Europe - so it was perhaps understandable that ministers did not want Britons going abroad where there would be a greater risk of infection. The opposite is true now following the rise of the Delta variant. So in theory a Briton in France, Germany, Spain or Italy is less likely to get infected than they are here. But that means there is a stronger argument for countries in continental Europe to restrict access for Britons. Indeed, a number of countries have already started, citing concern about the Delta variant. Although with clusters of it found across Europe it's probably only a matter of time before it takes off. The fact remains holidaying in continental Europe could still be very difficult regardless of what ministers decide here. Earlier this week,Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidministers were ""working on"" plans for fully-vaccinated people to be exempt from quarantine if they returned from amber-list countries. More than 60% of UK adults have now been fully vaccinated, while 82.9% have had their first jab. On Wednesday, workers in the travel industry including cabin crew, pilots, travel agents and airport staffheld a series of protests against the rules. They called on the government to offer the industry more financial support and increase the number of countries on the UK's green list. And industry body Abta, representing travel agents and tour operators, estimated 195,000 travel jobs have been lost during the pandemic or are at risk. The government said its international travel policy was guided by ""one overwhelming priority - protecting public health"". It said a range of factors were considered when making decisions about countries - including how capable a country is at genomic sequencing, the risk of transmission and the risk from any variants of concern. The government added it was keeping all possible travel measures under review, and that economic support for the sector included the furlough scheme.

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.1%,"The Bank of England has shrugged off concerns over a pick-up in inflation as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Consumer price inflation hita two-year high of 2.1%in the year to May, exceeding the Bank's 2% target. In its latest statement, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it expected inflation to go above 3% ""for a temporary period"". The MPC voted 9-0 to keep interest rates steady at the historic low of 0.1%. Rates have been unchanged since March last year, when they were reduced to help contain the economic shock of Covid-19. ""Financial market measures of inflation expectations suggest that the near-term strength in inflation is expected to be transitory,"" the Bank said. High inflation is ""transitory"" and has not yet affected the need for ongoing stimulus of the economy - that is the judgement of the Bank of England's key interest rate-setting committee. The recovery around the world has been stronger than expected and the UK's growth prospects this year have been upgraded. House prices are strongly up in the year. However, uncertainty over the impact on the economy of the withdrawal of furlough support, the new pandemic variant and other factors means they are keeping their foot on the accelerator pedal. Only departing chief economist Andy Haldane sounded a note of caution, saying the Bank should buy Â£50bn less in government bonds. He was again outvoted 8-1. The bounce back is certainly real, but there is a statistical fog about what actually happens in this unprecedented situation. The Bank's decision-makers have decided to wait and see what actually happens to jobs and growth, rather than act now on inflation. The reopening bounce back is not a boom. Not yet. The Bank said it now expected the UK economy to recover faster than it had previously predicted. It said output in June was now expected to be about 2.5% below its pre-Covid level. ""Output in a number of sectors is now around pre-Covid levels, although it remains materially below in others.  The housing market remains strong, and indicators of consumer confidence have increased,"" it said. Inflation fears grow as UK factory prices surge Clothes and fuel costs push prices to 2-year high The MPC said the direct economic implications of delaying the final relaxation of Covid restrictions to 19 July were likely to be ""relatively small"" compared with the impact of previous stages. ""The Committee's central expectation is that the economy will experience a temporary period of strong GDP growth and above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation will fall back,"" it added. ""There are two-sided risks around this central path, and it is possible that near-term upward pressure on prices could prove somewhat larger than expected. ""Taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judges that UK inflation expectations remain well anchored."" MPC members also voted 8-1 to continue with the Bank's existing asset purchase scheme, maintaining its bond-buying target at Â£895bn. Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, highlighted the fact that departing chief economist Andy Haldane was once again the dissenting voice on the Bank's quantitative easing programme, voting for a reduction in bond purchases. ""It will be extremely interesting to see who replaces [Mr] Haldane in the chief economist role following his imminent departure,"" he said. ""It is likely the Bank will drift back into a more relaxed tone on the transitory nature of any inflation pressure once [Mr] Haldane's voice and vote has moved on.""

PM not delivering on climate promises - advisers,"The UK public should be urged by the government to protect the climate by eating less meat and dairy produce, advisers say. Cattle are a major source of planet-heating gases, but ministers fear a backlash if they ask people to cut down on steak. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says people should reduce meat-eating for their health, as well as for the planet. It says the issue's one of many failings of a government which is delivering only a fifth of its pledges on climate change. People should be asked to eat 20% less meat and dairy produce by 2030, and 35% less by 2050, the CCC insists. The CCC says Boris Johnson must devise evidence-based policies to encourage healthier diets and set clear targets. Its report says the PM's ""remarkable"" climate leadership is undermined by inadequate policies and poor implementation in many areas of policy. A government spokesman said its net zero strategy, due in the Autumn, would show where carbon cuts would be imposed across the economy. Net zero refers to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases as much as possible and then balancing out any remaining releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere - by, for example, planting trees. UK warned it is unprepared for climate chaos Climate change 'driving UK's extreme weather' Extreme weather causes major global losses in 2020 But the committee complains that the public hasn't been engaged to make changes essential for protecting the climate. In addition to meat and dairy, they are: Sales of new gas boilers should be stopped by 2033. People will mostly convert to heat pumps instead. This will involve disruption - and the CCC says ministers will have to subsidise the installation cost. Committee members want to see taxes taken off clean electricity - and maybe shifted on to more polluting gas - although power bills for poor households should not rise. Frequent fliers will need to be curbed, the CCC believes. Even if low-carbon planes are developed, the UK still cannot let demand for aviation grow unconstrained. People will need to be consulted over changes ahead - perhaps by groups such as the UK climate assembly. The government has plans for a net zero aviation strategy The report says the government currently lacks policies on these issues and many others. Waste and low-carbon heat networks are said to need policies too. The committee chairman Lord Deben said the prime minister's commitments on the international stage to cut emissions 78% by 2035 are ""remarkable decisions"". He added that the objective of achieving near zero emissions by 2050 sets a major example to other nations. ""The trouble,"" he said, is that the delivery has not been there. Almost all things that should have happened have either been delayed or not hit the mark. They need to step up very rapidly."" The CCC's chief executive Chris Stark said he was ""very concerned by the gulf between promises and actions"". His report laid down some fundamental principles for the journey towards a near zero-carbon economy. It urges the Treasury to protect the poorest from the cost of climate policies. It says: ""The net zero strategy must be underpinned by an approach that distributes the costs, savings and wider benefits of decarbonisation fairly. ""It must encourage action across society, while protecting vulnerable people and companies at risk of adverse impacts."" A government spokesman said: ""Any suggestion we have been slow to deliver climate action is widely off the mark. Over the past three decades, we have driven down emissions by 44% - the fastest reduction of any G7 country. A really simple guide to climate change ""We have set some of the most ambitious targets in the world for the future. ""In recent months, we've made clear with record investment in wind power, a new UK Emissions Trading Scheme, Â£5.2bn investment in flood and sea defences, clear plans to decarbonise heavy industry and North Sea oil, and businesses pledging to become net zero by 2050 or earlier. ""Our strategies this year will set out more of the very policies the Climate Change Committee is calling for as we redouble our efforts to end the UK's contribution to climate change."" This video can not be played What is climate change? But environmental group Friends of the Earth said: ""The committee's criticisms are spot on. Without a detailed strategy for combating the climate crisis, government promises to decarbonise the economy are simply more hot air. ""With no climate action plan and his government's support for more roads, runways and an overseas gas project, Boris Johnson risks being a laughing stock at the UN climate summit [which the UK is hosting]."" The CCC insists ministers must commit all policies to a ""net zero test"" to ensure that decisions are compatible with the emissions targets. But there is a Whitehall logjam of decarbonisation initiatives in the pipeline. They include the Environment Bill and several strategies for different sectors, such as a transport decarbonisation plan and a net zero aviation strategy. Mr Stark says the environment Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is lagging with policies, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is failing to integrate climate change into the Planning Bill. All these policies, though, are over-shadowed by the delayed Treasury net zero review, which will determine how much cash is invested into the projected zero-carbon economy. Some key policies are being delayed by the Treasury, and environmentalists fear that the Chancellor Rishi Sunak may be jockeying for influence with the climate sceptic wing of the Conservative Party by withholding funds needed for the PM's ""green revolution"". It is a huge challenge for the Treasury, which will also need to take into account anotherrecent CCC report warning that the nation unprepared for the inevitable impactof a heating climate on the UK.

Harry supported until summer 2020 - Clarence House,"The Prince of Wales continued to support the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with a ""substantial sum"" in the months after they stood down as senior royals, Clarence House has said. Prince Harry told Oprah Winfrey his family ""cut me off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020. A Clarence House spokesman said Prince Charles continued to fund the Sussexes until that summer. The Sussexes deny there is a difference in timelines. A spokesperson for them said Prince Harry was referring in his Oprah interview to the first quarter of the fiscal reporting period - the period from April to the start of July. The comments by Clarence House - the office of Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall - were made as the annual royal accounts were published. Accounts for the Sovereign Grant show the monarchy cost Â£87.5m during 2020-21, an increase of Â£18.1m on the previous financial year. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace hasrevealed its proportion of ethnic minority staff (8.5%) for the first time. Where do Harry and Meghan get their money? Where does the Queen get her money? 2020 royal accounts show potential Â£35m Covid shortfall Funding for both of Prince Charles's sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and their families contributed to a Â£4.5m bill for the prince, his Clarence House financial accounts showed. Harry and Meghan were still listed as receiving money from Charles's Duchy of Cornwall income, despite quitting the monarchy at the end of March last year. The funding bill - plus other expenditure, including Prince Charles's capital expenditure and transfer to reserves - dropped by around Â£1.2m in the financial year after the Sussexes stopped being senior royals. A senior Clarence House spokesperson said: ""As we'll all remember in January 2020 when the duke and duchess announced that they were going to move away from the working royal family, the duke said that they would work towards becoming financially independent. ""The Prince of Wales allocated a substantial sum to support them with this transition. ""That funding ceased in the summer of last year. The couple are now financially independent."" During the couple's interview with Winfrey in March, Harry said ""my family literally cut me off financially"" in ""the first quarter of 2020"". Quizzed about the timeframes, the Clarence House spokesperson said: ""I wouldn't acknowledge that they are dramatically different. All I can tell you are the facts."" A spokeperson for the Sussexes told reporters: ""You are conflating two different timelines and it's inaccurate to suggest that there's a contradiction. ""The duke's comments during the Oprah interview were in reference to the first quarter of the fiscal reporting period in the UK, which starts annually in April."" Harry and Meghan signed multimillion-pound deals with Netflix and Spotify, with the duke telling Winfrey he secured these to pay for his security. He said he had what Diana left him - Â£7m at the time - and ""without that we would not have been able to do this"". Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has said it ""must do more"" and is ""not where it would like to be"" in terms of diversity. The Royal Household has revealed in its annual financial accounts for 2020-2021 that its proportion of ethnic minority employees stands at 8.5%, with a target of 10% for 2022. In the UK, around 13% of the UK population is from a minority ethnic background, according to the latest 2011 Census data. A total of 8.5% of Buckingham Palace staff are drawn from ethnic minorities. That compares to 13% of the UK's population at the time of the 2011 census and just under 40% of the population of London, where the majority of staff are based. ""Could do better"" is Palace's own verdict. ""We recognise we are not where we want to be"", said a senior Palace source; next year's target is 10%. But change may be hard to achieve. While public funding has remained steady, the extra money the monarch made from things like paid visits to the palaces fell by half. A Â£10m shortfall was covered by cutting back on some events like garden parties and by a recruitment freeze. Without new faces it is difficult to change the profile of household staff; and the Palace reckons that Covid restrictions will hit its supplementary income for some time to come. The Sovereign Grant is funded by profits from the Crown Estate - a multibillion-pound property portfolio that ranges from London's Regent Street to Ascot Racecourse. The estate is managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers.

"Britney Spears in blistering attack on guardianship""I just want my life back,"" the US pop star says in a highly anticipated public testimony.US & Canada","The singer said she felt ""forced"" to perform and was punished when she spoke out US pop star Britney Spears has launched a blistering attack on the ""abusive"" conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years. She said she was traumatised and cried every day, telling a judge in Los Angeles: ""I just want my life back"". Spears, 39, also said she had been denied the right to have more children and was put on the psychiatric drug lithium against her wishes. Her father was granted control over her affairs by court order in 2008. The order was granted after the star was put in hospital amid concerns over her mental health, and it has been extended for more than a decade since. Britney Spears: Everything she said in court Timberlake leads outpouring of support for Britney The conservatorship case explained The special hearing on Wednesday was the first time Spears has spoken in open court about her case. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny thanked Spears for her ""courageous"" words during the proceedings. It followed much speculation about the pop star's situation, with fans eagerly combing her social media output for clues. A fan-led movement, known as #FreeBritney, has campaigned for her legal freedom for years. But along legal process is likely before any decision is made on ending the conservatorship,external, the Associated Press reports. Spears delivered an impassioned address which lasted for more than 20 minutes. After launching into her speech, she was asked by the judge to slow down and later said she wished she could stay on the phone ""forever"" to avoid returning to her life where she was surrounded by people who said no to her. Spears told the court she wanted the conservatorship to end and described the arrangement as ""embarrassing and humiliating"". This video can not be played Britney Spears: Fans speak out against conservatorship Referring to past Instagram posts, the singer said: ""I've lied and told the whole world I'm okay and I'm happy. ""I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,"" she said. ""I'm not happy. I can't sleep. I'm so angry it's insane. And I'm depressed. I cry every day."" Spears, a mother of two, said she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to. She accused her conservator of stopping her from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed so she could get pregnant. ""I feel ganged up on and I feel bullied and I feel left out and alone,"" she told the court. ""I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does, by having a child, a family, any of those things."" Spears said she felt ""forced"" to tour by her management. She said she spoke out against going straight onto a Las Vegas residency, and her therapist was falsely told she was not co-operating or taking her medication. She alleged she was then put on the drug lithium -a common medicine for bipolar disorder,external- against her wishes and it had made her feel drunk and unable to converse. Spears said it was her belief that the conservatorship was doing her ""way more harm than good"" and said she ""honestly didn't know"" she could petition for the arrangement to end. The full extent of why the court order was extended has never been made public. But Spears has maintained a public career, including a Las Vegas residency and a stint as an X-Factor judge, leading many to question the validity of the arrangement. #FreeBritney campaigners gathered on Wednesday in support of Ms Spears A lawyer for her father, Jamie Spears, said he had been troubled by the singer's allegations in court. ""He is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain,"" the lawyer said in a statement read out in court. ""Mr Spears loves his daughter, and he misses her very much."" A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, such as those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Spears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one is for her estate and financial affairs, the other is for her as a person. Under the agreement, the pop star has not controlled her finances since 2008. That is around the time she began to behave erratically amid her divorce from Kevin Federline and a custody battle over their children. The star made headlines in a series of public incidents, including shaving her head, and she was twice admitted to hospital. 1998 Britney Spears, 16, catapults to the top of global pop charts with her debut single ...Baby One More Time. More than 20 years later, her debut album of the same name remains the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. February 2007 Spears is hounded by the press amid a tumultuous custody dispute with ex-husband Kevin Federline, allegations that she is an unfit mother and questions about her mental health. Amid the tabloid frenzy, she is captured on camera shaving her head. A few days later, she smashes a paparazzoâs SUV repeatedly with an umbrella. 2008 After stints in hospital and rehab, Spearsâ father Jamie petitions a Los Angeles court to place his daughter under a temporary conservatorship. He is charged with making decisions about her career, as well as her estate and financial affairs. The conservatorship is extended indefinitely later that year. 2013 Despite being unable to handle her own affairs, Spears continues to work. After rehabilitating her image with a successful seventh studio album and several appearances on television, she begins a four-year concert residency in Las Vegas. 2019-2020 Spears says she is taking a break from work because of her fatherâs health issues. Later in the year, Jamie Spears steps away as her conservator temporarily, citing his poor health. Britney Spears indicates through her lawyers that she no longer wants her father to be involved in handling her career. A lawyer says Spears is “afraid of her father” and will not return to the stage as long as he retains control. February 2021 A New York Times documentary about the pop starâs rise and fall, as well as about her treatment by the media, generates mass public interest in her conservatorship. June-July 2021 In explosive court testimony, Britney Spears alleges she was drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having more children under the conservatorship. She says she will not perform again while her father retains control over her career, and officially requests for him to be replaced as her conservator. August 2021 Jamie Spears says he is ready to step down as his daughter's conservator “when the time is right"" and pledges to participate in an ""orderly transition”. He later asks the court if the conservatorship itself should continue, saying his daughter should be given the chance to manage her own affairs. September 2021 At a court in Los Angeles, a judge suspends Jamie Spears from the legal arrangement that gave him control over his daughterâs life. Jamie Spears stepped down temporarily as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 due to health reasons. She sought to permanently install Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, into the role instead of reinstating her father - but on Wednesday she said Ms Montgomery was ""even starting to take it too far"". Her father remains co-conservator of her estate, along with the financial firm the Bessemer Trust. Mr Spears's legal team has insisted he has done a good job of managing his daughter's finances. But a court-appointed lawyer for the pop star said she is afraid of him and will not return to the stage as long as he remains in control of her career. Spears said Wednesday that she believed her father ""he loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%"". Dozens of fans gathered outside court on Wednesday, holding signs that read ""Free Britney now!"" and ""Get out of Britney's life!"" ""Everything she said was absolutely heartbreaking and it was actually even worse than I really thought it was,"" Megan Radford, one of the movement's founders, told the BBC. David Willis, BBC News, Los Angeles Britney Spears unleashed on a stunned courtroom the equivalent of 13 years of pent-up frustration - a torrent of accusation, anger and regret, all delivered in such a breathless monologue that at times the judge had to ask her to slow down. She came across as isolated, lost and lonely; a superstar that has been relentlessly manipulated. We knew that she had asked to put her case directly to the judge, but few could have predicted such a tirade. It amounted to a withering critique of the conservatorship process and the motives of many - members of her family chief among them - who were supposed to have been caring for her. Both the #FreeBritney movement and the recent release of a New York Times documentary about the singer have renewed public interest in the case. The pop star has never commented directly on her conservatorship battle, with her online persona remaining upbeat. A lawyer for the singer's mother, Lynne, has asked for her daughter's wishes to be heard Court records from 2019, the last time she spoke in court, have never been made public.But earlier this week the New York Times said it had obtained confidential court documents,externalthat showed the singer had opposed the restrictions since 2014. The newspaper also reported that the singer felt she was forced to stay at a mental health facility in 2019 on exaggerated grounds which she viewed as punishment for standing up for herself. In April, the pop star asked to address the court through her court-appointed attorney. A number of celebrities have posted messages of support. Pop star Justin Timberlake, her boyfriend in the 1990s, posted a thread of tweets,externalcalling for people to stand by her: ""We should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it wasâ¦ what's happening to her is just not right."" Timberlake made a public apology to Spearsearlier this year after the New York Times documentary suggested he had treated her disrespectfully by discussing their sex life on the radio. Spears's current boyfriend, the personal trainer and actor Sam Asghari, posted a picture on Instagram of himself in Free Britney T-Shirt. Singer Mariah Carey tweeted: ""We love you Britney!!! Stay strong."" Rose McGowan, the actor and MeToo activist, said Spears had every right to be angry, adding: ""How would you feel if your life was stolen, dissected, mocked? STOP CONTROLLING WOMEN.""

"Can you go on holiday to France, Spain or Portugal?","Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations.

"Gulf between words and action on climate, PM toldThe Climate Change Committee says the PM's climate leadership is undermined by inadequate policies.Science & Environment","The UK public should be urged by the government to protect the climate by eating less meat and dairy produce, advisers say. Cattle are a major source of planet-heating gases, but ministers fear a backlash if they ask people to cut down on steak. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says people should reduce meat-eating for their health, as well as for the planet. It says the issue's one of many failings of a government which is delivering only a fifth of its pledges on climate change. People should be asked to eat 20% less meat and dairy produce by 2030, and 35% less by 2050, the CCC insists. The CCC says Boris Johnson must devise evidence-based policies to encourage healthier diets and set clear targets. Its report says the PM's ""remarkable"" climate leadership is undermined by inadequate policies and poor implementation in many areas of policy. A government spokesman said its net zero strategy, due in the Autumn, would show where carbon cuts would be imposed across the economy. Net zero refers to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases as much as possible and then balancing out any remaining releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere - by, for example, planting trees. UK warned it is unprepared for climate chaos Climate change 'driving UK's extreme weather' Extreme weather causes major global losses in 2020 But the committee complains that the public hasn't been engaged to make changes essential for protecting the climate. In addition to meat and dairy, they are: Sales of new gas boilers should be stopped by 2033. People will mostly convert to heat pumps instead. This will involve disruption - and the CCC says ministers will have to subsidise the installation cost. Committee members want to see taxes taken off clean electricity - and maybe shifted on to more polluting gas - although power bills for poor households should not rise. Frequent fliers will need to be curbed, the CCC believes. Even if low-carbon planes are developed, the UK still cannot let demand for aviation grow unconstrained. People will need to be consulted over changes ahead - perhaps by groups such as the UK climate assembly. The government has plans for a net zero aviation strategy The report says the government currently lacks policies on these issues and many others. Waste and low-carbon heat networks are said to need policies too. The committee chairman Lord Deben said the prime minister's commitments on the international stage to cut emissions 78% by 2035 are ""remarkable decisions"". He added that the objective of achieving near zero emissions by 2050 sets a major example to other nations. ""The trouble,"" he said, is that the delivery has not been there. Almost all things that should have happened have either been delayed or not hit the mark. They need to step up very rapidly."" The CCC's chief executive Chris Stark said he was ""very concerned by the gulf between promises and actions"". His report laid down some fundamental principles for the journey towards a near zero-carbon economy. It urges the Treasury to protect the poorest from the cost of climate policies. It says: ""The net zero strategy must be underpinned by an approach that distributes the costs, savings and wider benefits of decarbonisation fairly. ""It must encourage action across society, while protecting vulnerable people and companies at risk of adverse impacts."" A government spokesman said: ""Any suggestion we have been slow to deliver climate action is widely off the mark. Over the past three decades, we have driven down emissions by 44% - the fastest reduction of any G7 country. A really simple guide to climate change ""We have set some of the most ambitious targets in the world for the future. ""In recent months, we've made clear with record investment in wind power, a new UK Emissions Trading Scheme, Â£5.2bn investment in flood and sea defences, clear plans to decarbonise heavy industry and North Sea oil, and businesses pledging to become net zero by 2050 or earlier. ""Our strategies this year will set out more of the very policies the Climate Change Committee is calling for as we redouble our efforts to end the UK's contribution to climate change."" This video can not be played What is climate change? But environmental group Friends of the Earth said: ""The committee's criticisms are spot on. Without a detailed strategy for combating the climate crisis, government promises to decarbonise the economy are simply more hot air. ""With no climate action plan and his government's support for more roads, runways and an overseas gas project, Boris Johnson risks being a laughing stock at the UN climate summit [which the UK is hosting]."" The CCC insists ministers must commit all policies to a ""net zero test"" to ensure that decisions are compatible with the emissions targets. But there is a Whitehall logjam of decarbonisation initiatives in the pipeline. They include the Environment Bill and several strategies for different sectors, such as a transport decarbonisation plan and a net zero aviation strategy. Mr Stark says the environment Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is lagging with policies, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is failing to integrate climate change into the Planning Bill. All these policies, though, are over-shadowed by the delayed Treasury net zero review, which will determine how much cash is invested into the projected zero-carbon economy. Some key policies are being delayed by the Treasury, and environmentalists fear that the Chancellor Rishi Sunak may be jockeying for influence with the climate sceptic wing of the Conservative Party by withholding funds needed for the PM's ""green revolution"". It is a huge challenge for the Treasury, which will also need to take into account anotherrecent CCC report warning that the nation unprepared for the inevitable impactof a heating climate on the UK.

Britney Spears speaks out on 'abusive' guardianship,"The singer said she felt ""forced"" to perform and was punished when she spoke out US pop star Britney Spears has launched a blistering attack on the ""abusive"" conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years. She said she was traumatised and cried every day, telling a judge in Los Angeles: ""I just want my life back"". Spears, 39, also said she had been denied the right to have more children and was put on the psychiatric drug lithium against her wishes. Her father was granted control over her affairs by court order in 2008. The order was granted after the star was put in hospital amid concerns over her mental health, and it has been extended for more than a decade since. Britney Spears: Everything she said in court Timberlake leads outpouring of support for Britney The conservatorship case explained The special hearing on Wednesday was the first time Spears has spoken in open court about her case. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny thanked Spears for her ""courageous"" words during the proceedings. It followed much speculation about the pop star's situation, with fans eagerly combing her social media output for clues. A fan-led movement, known as #FreeBritney, has campaigned for her legal freedom for years. But along legal process is likely before any decision is made on ending the conservatorship,external, the Associated Press reports. Spears delivered an impassioned address which lasted for more than 20 minutes. After launching into her speech, she was asked by the judge to slow down and later said she wished she could stay on the phone ""forever"" to avoid returning to her life where she was surrounded by people who said no to her. Spears told the court she wanted the conservatorship to end and described the arrangement as ""embarrassing and humiliating"". This video can not be played Britney Spears: Fans speak out against conservatorship Referring to past Instagram posts, the singer said: ""I've lied and told the whole world I'm okay and I'm happy. ""I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,"" she said. ""I'm not happy. I can't sleep. I'm so angry it's insane. And I'm depressed. I cry every day."" Spears, a mother of two, said she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to. She accused her conservator of stopping her from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed so she could get pregnant. ""I feel ganged up on and I feel bullied and I feel left out and alone,"" she told the court. ""I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does, by having a child, a family, any of those things."" Spears said she felt ""forced"" to tour by her management. She said she spoke out against going straight onto a Las Vegas residency, and her therapist was falsely told she was not co-operating or taking her medication. She alleged she was then put on the drug lithium -a common medicine for bipolar disorder,external- against her wishes and it had made her feel drunk and unable to converse. Spears said it was her belief that the conservatorship was doing her ""way more harm than good"" and said she ""honestly didn't know"" she could petition for the arrangement to end. The full extent of why the court order was extended has never been made public. But Spears has maintained a public career, including a Las Vegas residency and a stint as an X-Factor judge, leading many to question the validity of the arrangement. #FreeBritney campaigners gathered on Wednesday in support of Ms Spears A lawyer for her father, Jamie Spears, said he had been troubled by the singer's allegations in court. ""He is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain,"" the lawyer said in a statement read out in court. ""Mr Spears loves his daughter, and he misses her very much."" A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, such as those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Spears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one is for her estate and financial affairs, the other is for her as a person. Under the agreement, the pop star has not controlled her finances since 2008. That is around the time she began to behave erratically amid her divorce from Kevin Federline and a custody battle over their children. The star made headlines in a series of public incidents, including shaving her head, and she was twice admitted to hospital. 1998 Britney Spears, 16, catapults to the top of global pop charts with her debut single ...Baby One More Time. More than 20 years later, her debut album of the same name remains the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. February 2007 Spears is hounded by the press amid a tumultuous custody dispute with ex-husband Kevin Federline, allegations that she is an unfit mother and questions about her mental health. Amid the tabloid frenzy, she is captured on camera shaving her head. A few days later, she smashes a paparazzoâs SUV repeatedly with an umbrella. 2008 After stints in hospital and rehab, Spearsâ father Jamie petitions a Los Angeles court to place his daughter under a temporary conservatorship. He is charged with making decisions about her career, as well as her estate and financial affairs. The conservatorship is extended indefinitely later that year. 2013 Despite being unable to handle her own affairs, Spears continues to work. After rehabilitating her image with a successful seventh studio album and several appearances on television, she begins a four-year concert residency in Las Vegas. 2019-2020 Spears says she is taking a break from work because of her fatherâs health issues. Later in the year, Jamie Spears steps away as her conservator temporarily, citing his poor health. Britney Spears indicates through her lawyers that she no longer wants her father to be involved in handling her career. A lawyer says Spears is “afraid of her father” and will not return to the stage as long as he retains control. February 2021 A New York Times documentary about the pop starâs rise and fall, as well as about her treatment by the media, generates mass public interest in her conservatorship. June-July 2021 In explosive court testimony, Britney Spears alleges she was drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having more children under the conservatorship. She says she will not perform again while her father retains control over her career, and officially requests for him to be replaced as her conservator. August 2021 Jamie Spears says he is ready to step down as his daughter's conservator “when the time is right"" and pledges to participate in an ""orderly transition”. He later asks the court if the conservatorship itself should continue, saying his daughter should be given the chance to manage her own affairs. September 2021 At a court in Los Angeles, a judge suspends Jamie Spears from the legal arrangement that gave him control over his daughterâs life. Jamie Spears stepped down temporarily as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 due to health reasons. She sought to permanently install Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, into the role instead of reinstating her father - but on Wednesday she said Ms Montgomery was ""even starting to take it too far"". Her father remains co-conservator of her estate, along with the financial firm the Bessemer Trust. Mr Spears's legal team has insisted he has done a good job of managing his daughter's finances. But a court-appointed lawyer for the pop star said she is afraid of him and will not return to the stage as long as he remains in control of her career. Spears said Wednesday that she believed her father ""he loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%"". Dozens of fans gathered outside court on Wednesday, holding signs that read ""Free Britney now!"" and ""Get out of Britney's life!"" ""Everything she said was absolutely heartbreaking and it was actually even worse than I really thought it was,"" Megan Radford, one of the movement's founders, told the BBC. David Willis, BBC News, Los Angeles Britney Spears unleashed on a stunned courtroom the equivalent of 13 years of pent-up frustration - a torrent of accusation, anger and regret, all delivered in such a breathless monologue that at times the judge had to ask her to slow down. She came across as isolated, lost and lonely; a superstar that has been relentlessly manipulated. We knew that she had asked to put her case directly to the judge, but few could have predicted such a tirade. It amounted to a withering critique of the conservatorship process and the motives of many - members of her family chief among them - who were supposed to have been caring for her. Both the #FreeBritney movement and the recent release of a New York Times documentary about the singer have renewed public interest in the case. The pop star has never commented directly on her conservatorship battle, with her online persona remaining upbeat. A lawyer for the singer's mother, Lynne, has asked for her daughter's wishes to be heard Court records from 2019, the last time she spoke in court, have never been made public.But earlier this week the New York Times said it had obtained confidential court documents,externalthat showed the singer had opposed the restrictions since 2014. The newspaper also reported that the singer felt she was forced to stay at a mental health facility in 2019 on exaggerated grounds which she viewed as punishment for standing up for herself. In April, the pop star asked to address the court through her court-appointed attorney. A number of celebrities have posted messages of support. Pop star Justin Timberlake, her boyfriend in the 1990s, posted a thread of tweets,externalcalling for people to stand by her: ""We should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it wasâ¦ what's happening to her is just not right."" Timberlake made a public apology to Spearsearlier this year after the New York Times documentary suggested he had treated her disrespectfully by discussing their sex life on the radio. Spears's current boyfriend, the personal trainer and actor Sam Asghari, posted a picture on Instagram of himself in Free Britney T-Shirt. Singer Mariah Carey tweeted: ""We love you Britney!!! Stay strong."" Rose McGowan, the actor and MeToo activist, said Spears had every right to be angry, adding: ""How would you feel if your life was stolen, dissected, mocked? STOP CONTROLLING WOMEN.""

Old hospital oxygen systems a patient risk - review,"Life-saving oxygen is at risk of not getting to patients in hospital because of problems with how it is piped around wards, a safety watchdog is warning. A Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) review said a number of hospitals in England faced difficulties during the winter Covid wave. It said outdated systems used to pump oxygen around wards could not always cope with the surges in demand. This is the case even if there is excess supply on site. Investigators said it was vital that hospitals made adjustments to cope with future outbreaks. HSIB director of investigations, Dr Stephen Drage, said the supply of oxygen was clearly a ""critical"" issue, adding: ""If it fails the impact is significant."" The problem particularly affects hospitals that use an older piping system, known as a radial system, which just pumps the oxygen one way. Newer systems pump oxygen into the piping system at both ends - but the majority of hospitals are thought to use a radial system. More than two million may have had long Covid The HSIB was set up to investigate safety issues in the NHS in England. It carried out an in-depth investigation into problems reported at one hospital where a major incident was declared when the oxygen supply to wards, including the high dependency unit, dropped. The trust ended up diverting patients to nearby hospitals and cancelling non-emergency surgery. The HSIB said the problems were not unique to this trust, which was not named, as it was aware of similar issues in at least a dozen hospitals. It said long-term investment was needed to upgrade the supply systems - with experts who gave evidence describing the equipment being used in many parts of the NHS as ""unbelievably old"". But there were also steps that could be taken immediately, including getting doctors and engineers to work more closely to try to even out demand across the hospital site, as well as using cylinders to pump oxygen into the pipes at points where pressure is at risk of dropping.

"Gulf between words and action on climate, PM told","The UK public should be urged by the government to protect the climate by eating less meat and dairy produce, advisers say. Cattle are a major source of planet-heating gases, but ministers fear a backlash if they ask people to cut down on steak. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says people should reduce meat-eating for their health, as well as for the planet. It says the issue's one of many failings of a government which is delivering only a fifth of its pledges on climate change. People should be asked to eat 20% less meat and dairy produce by 2030, and 35% less by 2050, the CCC insists. The CCC says Boris Johnson must devise evidence-based policies to encourage healthier diets and set clear targets. Its report says the PM's ""remarkable"" climate leadership is undermined by inadequate policies and poor implementation in many areas of policy. A government spokesman said its net zero strategy, due in the Autumn, would show where carbon cuts would be imposed across the economy. Net zero refers to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases as much as possible and then balancing out any remaining releases by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere - by, for example, planting trees.

Outdated hospital oxygen supply ârisk to patientsâ,"Life-saving oxygen is at risk of not getting to patients in hospital because of problems with how it is piped around wards, a safety watchdog is warning. A Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) review said a number of hospitals in England faced difficulties during the winter Covid wave. It said outdated systems used to pump oxygen around wards could not always cope with the surges in demand. This is the case even if there is excess supply on site. Investigators said it was vital that hospitals made adjustments to cope with future outbreaks. HSIB director of investigations, Dr Stephen Drage, said the supply of oxygen was clearly a ""critical"" issue, adding: ""If it fails the impact is significant."" The problem particularly affects hospitals that use an older piping system, known as a radial system, which just pumps the oxygen one way.

Travel rules to be reviewed amid industry pressure,"The last review, which was three weeks ago, saw Portugal removed from the green list Changes to the UK's rules on foreign travel are set to be announced later, after industry bosses united in a plea for the green list to be widened. There has been speculation Malta and the Spanish islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Minorca could be green listed. Travel bosses are also calling for an exemption to quarantine for fully-vaccinated people from amber countries. PM Boris Johnson said there was a ""real opportunity to open up travel"" this summer for those who have had two jabs. But the prospect of European holidays could face another hurdle, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested all EU countries should make British travellers quarantine on arrival to slow the spread of the Delta variant. On Thursday, theUK reported,external16,703 cases and 21 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. LIVE: Travel sector hoping rules relaxed for fully-jabbed What are the green, amber and red rules? How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? What's happening with foreign travel? Mrs Merkel told Germany's parliament: ""In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that's not the case in every European country, and that's what I would like to see."" Currently,people travelling from the UK to Greece, Spain and Portugal are not required to quarantine. Those going to Italy have to self-isolate for five days then take a test, while fully-vaccinated UK visitors to France can enter without quarantining. By contrast, when returning to the UK from most holiday hotspots on the amber list, travellers have to self-isolate for 10 days, as well as pay for tests. Asked about Mrs Merkel's remarks on the Delta variant meaning more restrictions on British travellers going abroad, Mr Johnson said: ""The most important thing is that we think double jabs do offer a good way forward, we think they offer the hope of travel this summer. ""More than 60% of our population have now had two jabs, I think 83% have had one jab, we're really getting through it now. The crucial thing is, come forward and get your second jab,"" he said. He added that he wasn't going to claim the summer would be like any other. ""I don't want to cast a pall over things but, as I said the other day, it will be different."" Tom Singleton, from Derby, is on a family holiday with his wife and four-year-old daughter on the very quiet Greek island of Kos. They had originally planned to go to Cyprus but had to cancel three times. Determined to get away before their daughter starts school in September, the family flew to Kos - on the amber list - on a virtually empty plane to stay in a deserted hotel. ""Until yesterday we were the only British people in our hotel,"" he told the BBC. Tom and his wife are both fully-vaccinated and hopeful - if a little doubtful - Kos might be moved on to the safer green list which would save them from quarantining. ""Cases are very minimal here and it's safer here than at home - it makes no sense why it can't be green,"" he said. He highlighted some of the apparent contradictions in the travel rules, asking how Uefa VIPs, sponsors, staff and guests could come into the UK ""from wherever"" without quarantining. ""It begs the question why one rule for the few and another for everyone else."" Can you go on holiday to Malta, Spain or Portugal? Just 11 destinations are on the green list - including Israel and Australia - although neither has opened up its borders to tourists. Travellers do not need to quarantine when they get back from green-list countries, but they do have to pay for tests. Countries on the red list are considered the highest risk, and travel from those nations is more strictly limited. The UK government reviews which countries are on which list every three weeks, and the last update - when Portugal was stripped from the green list - was three weeks ago on 3 June. As well as today's review, the government has also said there will be a ""checkpoint"" review of the rules for each category on Monday 28 June. That could be when ministers decide whether to relax quarantine for fully-vaccinated travellers. On Wednesday, Mr Shapps told the BBC: ""If you've been double vaccinated then of course we need to look at what the science says. We've said that Monday is the point to review that data, so we are coming up to having a look at it. ""We're looking at it in the next few days and I'll have more to say."" The UK government's traffic light system applies toEngland,,externalwithScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalable to make their own rules. However, the rules are broadly the same and previous changes to the lists have been adopted by all four nations. The issues around international travel in Europe are tricky, complex and ever-changing. In the spring the UK had one of the lowest infection rates in Europe - so it was perhaps understandable that ministers did not want Britons going abroad where there would be a greater risk of infection. The opposite is true now following the rise of the Delta variant. So in theory a Briton in France, Germany, Spain or Italy is less likely to get infected than they are here. But that means there is a stronger argument for countries in continental Europe to restrict access for Britons. Indeed, a number of countries have already started, citing concern about the Delta variant. Although with clusters of it found across Europe it's probably only a matter of time before it takes off. The fact remains holidaying in continental Europe could still be very difficult regardless of what ministers decide here. Earlier this week,Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidministers were ""working on"" plans for fully-vaccinated people to be exempt from quarantine if they returned from amber-list countries. More than 60% of UK adults have now been fully vaccinated, while 82.9% have had their first jab. On Wednesday, workers in the travel industry including cabin crew, pilots, travel agents and airport staffheld a series of protests against the rules. They called on the government to offer the industry more financial support and increase the number of countries on the UK's green list. And industry body Abta, representing travel agents and tour operators, estimated 195,000 travel jobs have been lost during the pandemic or are at risk. The government said its international travel policy was guided by ""one overwhelming priority - protecting public health"". It said a range of factors were considered when making decisions about countries - including how capable a country is at genomic sequencing, the risk of transmission and the risk from any variants of concern. The government added it was keeping all possible travel measures under review, and that economic support for the sector included the furlough scheme.

"Biden backs funding more police to fight crime waveAmid claims his party is soft on crime, the president backs hiring more police beyond pre-pandemic levels.US & Canada","This video can not be played Watch Biden talk about the ""blood of patriots"" President Joe Biden has unveiled a plan that includes funding more police to combat a nationwide surge in homicides, which he blamed on lax gun control. He said officials in high crime areas can hire more law-enforcement personnel using coronavirus relief funding. Mr Biden's crime-fighting strategy calls for curtailing rogue gun dealers and firearms trafficking. Republicans are depicting Mr Biden's Democrats as weak on crime, amid calls by left-wingers to defund the police. Announcing his five-point strategy at the White House on Wednesday, the president urged cities and states to use $350bn (Â£250bn) of funding from a Covid-19 relief bill on public safety efforts, including adding more police officers, even beyond pre-pandemic levels. ""It means more police officers, more nurses, more counsellors, more social workers or community violence interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes,"" the president said. Some members of Mr Biden's party have amplified calls by Black Lives Matter activists to defund the police, though the president himself has resisted the slogan, which is unpopular with most voters. Mr Biden - who as a senator wrote a 1994 crime bill widely blamed for mass incarceration of black people - said on Wednesday: ""This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities."" Unless tamed, the crime wave is likely to become a major issue ahead of next year's congressional mid-term elections. America's gun culture in charts Is the US seeing a surge in violent crime? Former officers explain killings by police During his remarks at the White House, the president also took aim at armed insurrectionists, saying they would ""need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons"" to take on the US government. The Biden administration has proposed gun control as a remedy for violent crime, although Democratic bills in Congress to limit Americans' access to firearms have been blocked by Republicans. The administration's strategy also proposes investing in community violence intervention programmes, employment opportunities and summer activities for teenagers and young adults, and support for formerly incarcerated Americans re-entering their communities. The president recently hosted several big city mayors at the White House for a discussion on crime prevention. In March, the FBI released preliminary 2020 statistics showing a significant jump - 25% - in murders from the year before. So far, the upward trend has continued into 2021. The bureau will release its official numbers in September. If early projections bear out, it will be one of the largest homicide increases ever reported. ""This was a large scale national increase in violence,"" Jeff Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former analyst for the CIA and Department of Defense, told the BBC. Some analysts have blamed the wave of homicides on the Covid-19 pandemic, althoughresearch indicates,externalthat global crime rates outside the US fell or were stable amid all the lockdowns. Other analysts see the cause as low police morale after the murder of George Floyd last year in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the ensuing civil unrest that swept US cities. A University of Utah study pinpointed,externalthe spike in US homicides to late May 2020, when Mr Floyd was killed by an officer. But even with this steep rise, the murder rate is still far lower than in the early 1990s, when it was almost double the current figure. And crime overall - including rapes, robbery and other property crime - dropped by about 6% in 2020, among the largest decreases on record. There are a few political issues that, when they reach a boiling point, crowd out just about every other subject in national discussion. The economy is one. Crime is another. And while things seem to be looking fairly good for Joe Biden on the former, an uptick in violent crime could be a serious challenge for Democrats ahead of next year's mid-term elections. Criminal statisticians will point out that the current murder rates are still low compared to previous decades, including the 1990s, when Biden - then a senator - made ""getting tough on crime"" one of his top issues. The general public, however, typically doesn't have such long-term perspective. Republicans have offered an explanation - that the anti-law-enforcement rhetoric and ""defund the police"" efforts from last year's Black Lives Matters demonstrations have led to the current situation. On Wednesday, Biden offered a counter-argument, that lax gun regulations are to blame, creating an environment where even minor arguments can turn deadly. He also promised to boost funding for the police - a move that may anger some on the left. With an eye on 2022, however, the White House may be calculating that inoculating itself from Republican attacks is worth the risk of intra-party unrest. Gun sales increased last year, as did reports of domestic violence. According to Mr Asher, there was also evidence that Americans carried firearms more frequently in 2020. Data on the causes of murders in 2020 is not yet widely available, Mr Asher said, but in 2019, 74% of homicides were gun-related. On the eve of Mr Biden's speech, the Department of Justice announced a new team aimed at tackling gun trafficking in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington DC and San Francisco. In New York City, Democratic politicians vying to become the next mayor have largely focused on the issue of law and order, which was widely condemned as a racial dog whistle when it was the theme of Republican former President Donald Trump's election campaign. Ex-police officer Eric Adams is currently in the lead as results are being tallied. This video can not be played What's at stake in the NYC mayoral election? New Yorkers explain.

"Biden backs funding more police to fight crime waveAmid claims his party is soft on crime, the president backs hiring more police beyond pre-pandemic levels.","This video can not be played Watch Biden talk about the ""blood of patriots"" President Joe Biden has unveiled a plan that includes funding more police to combat a nationwide surge in homicides, which he blamed on lax gun control. He said officials in high crime areas can hire more law-enforcement personnel using coronavirus relief funding. Mr Biden's crime-fighting strategy calls for curtailing rogue gun dealers and firearms trafficking. Republicans are depicting Mr Biden's Democrats as weak on crime, amid calls by left-wingers to defund the police. Announcing his five-point strategy at the White House on Wednesday, the president urged cities and states to use $350bn (Â£250bn) of funding from a Covid-19 relief bill on public safety efforts, including adding more police officers, even beyond pre-pandemic levels. ""It means more police officers, more nurses, more counsellors, more social workers or community violence interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes,"" the president said. Some members of Mr Biden's party have amplified calls by Black Lives Matter activists to defund the police, though the president himself has resisted the slogan, which is unpopular with most voters. Mr Biden - who as a senator wrote a 1994 crime bill widely blamed for mass incarceration of black people - said on Wednesday: ""This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities."" Unless tamed, the crime wave is likely to become a major issue ahead of next year's congressional mid-term elections. America's gun culture in charts Is the US seeing a surge in violent crime? Former officers explain killings by police During his remarks at the White House, the president also took aim at armed insurrectionists, saying they would ""need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons"" to take on the US government. The Biden administration has proposed gun control as a remedy for violent crime, although Democratic bills in Congress to limit Americans' access to firearms have been blocked by Republicans. The administration's strategy also proposes investing in community violence intervention programmes, employment opportunities and summer activities for teenagers and young adults, and support for formerly incarcerated Americans re-entering their communities. The president recently hosted several big city mayors at the White House for a discussion on crime prevention. In March, the FBI released preliminary 2020 statistics showing a significant jump - 25% - in murders from the year before. So far, the upward trend has continued into 2021. The bureau will release its official numbers in September. If early projections bear out, it will be one of the largest homicide increases ever reported. ""This was a large scale national increase in violence,"" Jeff Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former analyst for the CIA and Department of Defense, told the BBC. Some analysts have blamed the wave of homicides on the Covid-19 pandemic, althoughresearch indicates,externalthat global crime rates outside the US fell or were stable amid all the lockdowns. Other analysts see the cause as low police morale after the murder of George Floyd last year in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the ensuing civil unrest that swept US cities. A University of Utah study pinpointed,externalthe spike in US homicides to late May 2020, when Mr Floyd was killed by an officer. But even with this steep rise, the murder rate is still far lower than in the early 1990s, when it was almost double the current figure. And crime overall - including rapes, robbery and other property crime - dropped by about 6% in 2020, among the largest decreases on record. There are a few political issues that, when they reach a boiling point, crowd out just about every other subject in national discussion. The economy is one. Crime is another. And while things seem to be looking fairly good for Joe Biden on the former, an uptick in violent crime could be a serious challenge for Democrats ahead of next year's mid-term elections. Criminal statisticians will point out that the current murder rates are still low compared to previous decades, including the 1990s, when Biden - then a senator - made ""getting tough on crime"" one of his top issues. The general public, however, typically doesn't have such long-term perspective. Republicans have offered an explanation - that the anti-law-enforcement rhetoric and ""defund the police"" efforts from last year's Black Lives Matters demonstrations have led to the current situation. On Wednesday, Biden offered a counter-argument, that lax gun regulations are to blame, creating an environment where even minor arguments can turn deadly. He also promised to boost funding for the police - a move that may anger some on the left. With an eye on 2022, however, the White House may be calculating that inoculating itself from Republican attacks is worth the risk of intra-party unrest. Gun sales increased last year, as did reports of domestic violence. According to Mr Asher, there was also evidence that Americans carried firearms more frequently in 2020. Data on the causes of murders in 2020 is not yet widely available, Mr Asher said, but in 2019, 74% of homicides were gun-related. On the eve of Mr Biden's speech, the Department of Justice announced a new team aimed at tackling gun trafficking in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington DC and San Francisco. In New York City, Democratic politicians vying to become the next mayor have largely focused on the issue of law and order, which was widely condemned as a racial dog whistle when it was the theme of Republican former President Donald Trump's election campaign. Ex-police officer Eric Adams is currently in the lead as results are being tallied. This video can not be played What's at stake in the NYC mayoral election? New Yorkers explain.
