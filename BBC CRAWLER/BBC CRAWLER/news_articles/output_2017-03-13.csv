Durban will not host 2022 Commonwealths,"The 2022 Commonwealth Games was to be the first time the event has been held in Africa The 2022 Commonwealth Games will no longer be held in Durban, South Africa. David Grevemberg, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, said the city did not meet the criteria set by his organisation, and the search for a new host city had already begun. Durban was awarded the Games in September 2015 and was due to be the first African city to host the event, which was first held in 1930. Liverpool and Birmingham haveexpressed interestin staging the 2022 edition. The Commonwealth Games are held every four years and feature athletes from more than 50 countries, mostly former British colonies. Last month, South Africa's sports minister Fikile Mbalula indicated Durban may not be able to host the 2022 event because of financial constraints. ""We gave it our best shot but we can't go beyond. If the country says we don't have this money, we can't,"" he said. Grevemberg said: ""We are disappointed but it does not diminish our commitment to the African continent. ""We have had to postpone these ambitions to a later time. We all share disappointment that this ambition needs to be postponed right now. ""We remain committed to the inspiring potential of a Games in the continent."" Grevemberg said the South African government had never signed off on the decision for Durban to host the Games. ""We have a host city contract,"" he said. ""It was signed by all parties on the day except for the South African government. ""We have engaged with the government to really try to work with their current circumstances but also uphold the commitments that were outlined in their bid. They were unable to do that at this time and we have had to look after the citizens and communities that our events serve."" Grevemberg said an announcement on a new host city would be made by the end of the year. ""Discussions with a number of interested parties are under way,"" he said. ""I am confident an alternative host city will be found and that we will have an inspirational Games for the athletes and fans across the Commonwealth."" A spokesperson for Liverpool City Council said: ""We had heard rumours that Durban might be unable to deliver the Commonwealth Games in 2022 and have already indicated to the government that we are very willing to host them instead."" Birmingham had already expressed an interest in hosting the 2026 Games. Councillor Ian Ward, deputy leader of the city council, said: ""We are aware of the decision from the Commonwealth Games Federation to seek a new host for the 2022 Games. ""Here in Birmingham we are already in the advanced stages of producing a detailed feasibility study on what would be needed for a truly memorable Games in the city. ""That is due to be completed in the coming weeks and we are in close contact with the government about the developing situation.""

'LED street lights are disturbing my sleep',"In towns and cities across the world, the colour of night is changing. Traditional yellow sodium street lights are steadily being replaced by white LED lamps. The new lights use less energy, dramatically cutting carbon emissions and saving money. But not everybody is happy. ""When the leaves left the trees and I tried to sleep, I turned to one side and the light's shining right in my eyes."" Like most of us, Karen Snyder had never really paid much attention to street lights. But that all changed last year when the city council began installing LED lights outside her home in a quiet corner of Washington DC. In addition to the light shining into her bedroom, the 63-year-old teacher's guest room, where she watches TV, is now bathed in something akin to strong moonlight. ""It's like there's a ray coming in. Like a blue ray. Right directly on to the couch.  If you are sitting down, the moon would be above the house and you'd get the beautiful feel of the moon. This is shining right in your eyes so it's pretty different than a moon. Moons don't go this low into the windows."" An LED light (left) shines directly into Snyder's guest room, while a sodium light glows on the other side of the house Her friend, Delores Bushong, says her sleep has also been disturbed by the LED street lights outside her home, and is now one of the main opponents of the new lighting in the city. She fears they will ruin the atmosphere on her back porch, where she likes to relax after dark in a hammock in the sweltering summer months. ""In some kinds of torture they put a light on someone's face all the time,"" she says. ""Am I going to be subjected to a kind of torture forever? It doesn't make sense to me. Just because we have a new technology and you can save money."" Bushong has become well-versed in the jargon of colour temperature (measured in degrees Kelvin) and light intensity (measured in Lumens), as she battles to get the city to take her concerns seriously. At the very least, she wants the 4,000-Kelvin bulbs in her neighbourhood, which she compares to the harsh lighting in a prison yard, to be replaced by bulbs with lower Kelvin ratings, closer in look and feel to the old high-pressure sodium bulbs. The city insists it is listening to her campaign group's concerns but there is no turning back the march of the LEDs. ""There are many reasons why cities are switching to LED lights,"" says Seth Miller Gabriel, the director of Washington DC's Office of Public Private Partnerships. ""One, not be looked over, is cost - 50% or more over the life cycle of this new light. The lights last a lot longer. So we save electricity, by at least 50%, we save on the maintenance costs and we get a better lighting solution."" Then there are the environmental benefits: ""We estimate that in the District of Columbia by switching our 71,000 street lights over to LEDs we can save upwards of 30 million pounds (13,600 tonnes) of coal a year, in electricity we won't be using for the lights,"" he says. Lionel Shriver misses the moody urban glow of sodium street lights Miller Gabriel argues that many city-dwellers are blundering around in neighbourhoods that have never been properly lit, allowing crime to fester in the shadows. He dreams of a world where every street light is an LED. He may live long enough to see that happen. About 10% of America's street lights have so far been converted, but the Department of Energy has estimated that if the whole country switched to LEDs over the next two decades it would save $120bn over that 20-year period. Cities across Europe and the Asia Pacific region are going down the LED route and, in China, the central planning agency is in the middle of a conversion programme it expects will cut annual carbon emissions by 48 million tonnes. Against these sort of statistics, those campaigning against LEDs can sound like Luddites, railing against scientific progress, but they insist they have a strong case. They point to a recent report by the American Medical Association (AMA), which warns that the blue light emitted by first generation high-intensity LEDs, used in many cities around the world including New York, can adversely affect circadian sleep rhythms, leading to reduced duration and quality of sleep, ""impaired daytime functioning"" and obesity. The AMA report calls on cities to use the lowest-intensity LEDs possible and shade them better to reduce glare, which it warns can also harm wildlife. Light emitting diodes - or LEDs - first appeared as red lights in pocket calculators and digital watches in the 1960s Now white LEDs are used in everything from car headlights to camera flashes and home lighting The first LED street lights were rated 4,000 Kelvin or higher on the temperature chart used to describe colour The latest LEDs have lower Kelvin ratings and produce a softer, amber light and less potentially harmful blue light Manufacturers claim they are are up to 50% more energy-efficient than traditional yellow sodium lights and last for up 20 years, instead of two to five Seth Miller Gabriel says the report does not contain original research and is ""more of a literature review of what's been published elsewhere"". ""We would really like to see more concrete evidence of what's going on with these lights,"" he says. ""If it's really a problem, based on a particular intensity of lights, we want to know that. That AMA report really didn't give us the kind of hard data we would need [on which] to base a large scale procurement."" He is overseeing the tendering process for the next phase of Washington's LED conversion which he promises will be done in a more sensitive way, with lower Kelvin ratings, better shading and remote controls, so that lights can be dimmed or increased in intensity at different times to suit the needs of particular neighbourhoods. But he adds: ""Let's be honest, humans are not engineered for change. So when we come home and see a different light. Even if it's a much better light, there's going to be a reaction - 'Oh my goodness, it's a different light, what happened?'"" It is true that many of the same arguments being made against LED lights were heard in the early 1970s, when cities were converting to the yellow sodium lights we are so familiar with today. There was no LED lighting in Edward Hopper's day High-pressure sodium bulbs used less energy than the mercury vapour bulbs they replaced. But some campaigners, most notably a Vancouver-based artist called Ralf Kelman, argued at the time that their ""antiseptic orange"" glow was too bright and would damage growth in young trees, as well as blocking out the stars in the night sky. The light pollution argument has also been used against LEDs, althoughsome researchers say that properly directed, they could dramatically improve the visibility of stars. But, for some people, the debate goes beyond dry arguments about Kelvin ratings, light pollution and carbon emissions and touches on questions about the quality of life city-dwellers should expect. ""When the lighting is right you have a sense of peace and contemplation, of aesthetic joy in the world,"" says novelist Lionel Shriver, who is campaigning against LEDs in the South Brooklyn neighbourhood where she spends part of the year. ""I am not someone who believes she can stand in the way of the march of the LEDs. The savings in energy are too great. The savings in money are too great. And if we just say 'but it's not pretty' that's not going to stop these things. ""The truth is that the technology of LEDs has advanced fantastically so that it is no longer necessary to make a stark choice between economy and the environment and aesthetics. You can have both. ""What is going on in some cities, in New York especially, that is what I am most familiar with, amounts to a kind of widespread civic vandalism.""

Indyref2: Your questions answered,"MSPs voted for the motion after a lengthy debate at Holyrood On Monday, 13 March, Nicola Sturgeon announced her intention to holda second Scottish independence referendum. The first minister said it was needed to protect Scottish interests in light of Brexit - she said Scottish voters must be offered an ""informed choice"" between the path the UK government was taking, and independence. But by Thursday, 16 March, Prime Minister Theresa May said""now is not the time""for a referendum, saying all attention should be on the Brexit negotiations in the coming years. The two have sincemet for talks in Glasgow, without any significant progress being made. MSPs have now passed a motioncalling for Westminster to grant a ""Section 30 order"" giving permission for a new vote. The power to call a referendum is reserved to Westminster.Section 30 of the 1998 Scotland Act,externalis the mechanism by which Holyrood can legislate on reserved areas. For the 2014 vote, David Cameron and Alex Salmond, the then-leaders of the UK and Scottish governments,signed the Edinburgh Agreementto give Holyrood the power to call the referendum. Nicola Sturgeon - also a signatory of the Edinburgh Agreement, as deputy first minister - wants to get a similar deal from the current PM, Mrs May. After a debate delayed by the terror attack at Westminster, she has got backing for this from MSPs - although they were split along party lines in the final vote, unlike the unanimous backing for the Edinburgh Agreement. Ms Sturgeonhas sent a letter to Theresa Mayunderlining ""the will of parliament"" and asking for permission to hold a referendum. She says there's ""no rational reason"" for Mrs May to ""stand in the way"". However, Theresa May's position remains that ""now is not the time"", a phrase fast becoming a mantra. Following the letter, a UK government spokesman said ""we will not be entering into negotiations on the Scottish Government's proposal"". Scottish Secretary David Mundell has put it in even clearer terms; he says there will not be any talks ""at all"" over indyref2 ""until the Brexit process is complete"". So again, it is not a case of ""never"" - but rather ""not now"". Ms Sturgeon plans to come back to Holyrood after the Easter recess to set out how she will ""move forward"" towards a referendum. Ms Sturgeon outlined a window towards the end of the Brexit process in which she wants the vote to take place, between Autumn 2018 and Spring 2019 - a window now endorsed by Holyrood. The first minister wants the picture of the final Brexit deal to become clear, so that she can offer Scottish voters an ""informed choice"" before the UK leaves the EU. But her timetable has been rejected by the UK government, which doesn't believe the picture of Brexit will be clear until well after the UK is out of the EU - effectively, they say Brexit needs time to ""bed in. Does this mean there could be a referendum later, in 2019 or 2020? Mr Mundell has refused to speculate about possible dates - he says he doesn't have a ""crystal ball"" - but he doesn't want there to be any talks during the Brexit process.Ms Sturgeon meanwhile said her talks with Mrs May""underlined"" her belief in her stated timetable. The two governments are at something of an impasse over this - but Ms Sturgeon argues the Scottish Parliamentshould have the final say. At this point, it is not particularly obvious. Ms Sturgeon says she has a ""clear idea"" of what steps she will take next, but will not be drawn on what they are. The Scottish government believe Mrs May's position is untenable, especially in the face of the Holyrood vote, and reckon she will have to back down sooner or later. How could they force her hand? Options suggested and broadly discarded by the government includeholding a new electionon a specific platform of holding a referendum soon afterward, or holding an unauthorised ""wildcat"" vote. Neither appears likely. Nor is Ms Sturgeonplanning to go to court. The Brexit process throws up various points at which Holyrood's consent will be needed for legislation, which could provide bargaining chips for the Scottish government - not least the Great Repeal Bill. Mr Mundell has said there would be ""significant implications"" were Holyrood to refuse permission for such legislation. The Supreme Court hasrejected the ideathat Holyrood could halt the Brexit process outright, but it could give Mrs May a significant headache. Ms Sturgeon could offer to let the Brexit legislation pass relatively unimpeded - in exchange for a referendum sometime in 2019. That is one potential bargaining position. But as things stand, there is no clear route out of the current standoff.

'Why I thought I'd killed my baby',"Mother's Day is approaching but as any mother knows, stepping in to the role can be a turbulent time. For some it can be devastating. As many as one in 500 are thought to suffer from post-partum psychosis. University lecturer Sally Wilson was one of them. The photo shown above is of me, my husband Jamie and our two-year-old daughter, Ella, taken on a skiing break in France a few weeks ago. It looks no different to any other happy family holiday snap does it? But the events leading up to it, the beginning of our family life, is wildly different to that of other new parents. It is a story of ruin, of living the most terrifying, inescapable nightmare day after day, of being in such utter pain and despair that I constantly thought of walking into the sea near our home in north Wales. Before giving birth to Ella I was totally unaware of a condition called post-partum psychosis (PP). Newlyweds Sally and Jamie, huge sports enthusiasts who met at university, walk under an arch of climbing axes and hockey sticks Two years on, I have virtually fully recovered. It's not been easy and involved some controversial treatment. But the day I thought would never come is here; when I enjoy the familiarity of the old me. In 2013, Jamie and I got married and, as planned, started a family a year-or-so later. My pregnancy was good. I was a week overdue and had some signs of pre-eclampsia, a condition in late pregnancy which can be dangerous if not treated, so I was induced. Five months pregnant: Sally with Jamie, who also works as an academic, in Greece My labour was painful, no shock there. But as the hours went by, things began to deteriorate. I became terribly confused. I had difficulty grasping the notion of time. I barely slept and felt feverish. The medics ramped up hormones for induction and I was given gas and air and pethidine. Ella's heart rate kept dropping and she was in distress. She was born early in the morning in March 2015 by Caesarean section. As I came round from the anaesthetic, something very sinister was unfolding. My confusion was by now off the scale. I kept saying I didn't understand what was going on, asking why there were doctors in the room. A brain scan for a suspected stroke and blood tests came back negative. A new-born Ella who was initially being treated in special care for breathing difficulties At one point I remember my eyes rolling back in my head and I slumped onto the bed. At night I pleaded with the nurses to sit with me as I was so scared. I was also paranoid that the midwives were talking about me. By now I was very panicky, convinced I was doing something wrong and would get upset. A few days later things got a lot worse. I got up to go to the toilet and collapsed. I was sobbing and refused to get up. In my mind there was a strange realisation that I'd died. I could see everyone around me, the midwives and Jamie behind me. I saw a midwife take Ella away, I believed they were taking her to be resuscitated because I'd harmed her. This video can not be played Sally Wilson explains her experience of suffering from postpartum psychosis I now know that I was having a psychotic episode. My reality had shifted, I believed I had died and was living in an afterlife. I began to hallucinate. The sound of babies crying was deafening, the whirr of air conditioning unit overwhelmed me and the canteen trolleys sounded like trains crashing through the ward; lights being switched were like explosions and I could see shadows on the wall. I was convinced that because I'd hurt my baby I had died and was now living in the 'after life', a kind of hell. The most terrifying nightmare imaginable was now my reality. The nurses brought Ella to see me, to reassure me she was ok. I was convinced they'd swapped her. This wasn't my baby. My baby was dead. I had killed her.

He's not crying Sally, look he's fine. ""Who are those people outside the door in white coats?"" There's no one outside the door Sally. ""Yes, there are. They've come to get me and take me to prison. Oh Godâ¦ how could I have harmed my baby?"" It was horrific. I was transferred to the psychiatric ward and Jamie was told I was suffering from PP. I was prescribed anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety medication. All I can recall is being led into a terrifying maze where I'd see people pacing around as grotesquely exaggerated caricatures. I would refuse to have bloods taken, convinced there was a conspiracy against me. Jamie and my parents would visit with Ella and I'd hold her but couldn't understand that she was mine. I felt no connection. We went to the cafÃ© and she needed her nappy changed. The toilets were near to the labour ward and I became really stressed out and upset as I didn't want to go anywhere near there. I thought I couldn't be trusted on the labour ward as I was convinced I'd hurt my own baby. A month-old Ella's first experience of the Snowdonia National Park A week later I had a review with the consultant and I told him things were better than they were just to be allowed out of there. A home treatment team was arranged to visit me every day but things didn't improve much. I'd manage to help meet Ella's basic needs, change and feed her. But I was going through the motions. I still 100% believed that I'd killed my baby. I hit an extreme low, a bleak depression punctuated with psychotic symptoms. I'd read a news article about a murder at a caravan park which had happened on the day I had the psychotic episode in hospital. In my mind I'd committed the murder. The sound of birds was really loud, particularly crows. I then discovered the collective noun for crows is 'murder' - I interpreted meaning to that, of what I'd done in the hospital. Sally on holiday a few months after embarking on ECT and around the time she began to feel better I had an obsession with a certain number bus which always seemed to pass when I left the house. This was part of the conspiracy and had a hidden meaning. Over-powering, intrusive images constantly flashed into my mind, of walking out into the sea near our home and ending it all. Ten months after coming home, I told Jamie that I couldn't go on. My husband, who'd done so much to help me, was distraught. Determined to help, Jamie did a literature review on PP treatments. Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) came up a lot. My psychiatrist contacted Ian Jones, Professor of psychiatry at Cardiff University, National Centre for Mental Health director and a world expert in PP. He agreed that ECT might help me. You immediately think it's a barbaric, horrible treatment, involving being strapped to a chair and electrocuted. It's fairly dramatic - you're anaesthetised and electrical currents are passed through your brain to trigger a seizure. Half way through the 10 sessions, there was a shift in my thinking. Something terrible was being lifted from me. It saved my life. Gradually I've grown stronger and bonded with Ella. It's sad to think about what I've missed out on but now I look at her and get excited that everything's ok, we're here, happy and healthy. I can't say I'm the same person. But I'm back at work a few days a week and I'm pre-occupied with the everyday challenges of parenting. Once you've suffered from PP there's a very high chance of it recurring with subsequent pregnancies. It's a very personal choice, but even if there was only a slight risk of going through that again, for us, it's just not worth it. But it's very important to me to give hope to others going through the horrors of PP. You'll be convinced it will never, ever end. I was convinced too. But this is a day I thought would never come when life feels good once again. The facts on PP What exactly is it? Of wide spectrum of post-natal mental health problems, PP is one of the most severe. Post-natal depression affects something like one in 10 women, and PP one in 500 to 1000. Includes psychotic symptoms, believing things that are not true and prominent mood symptoms - both high and low How does it manifest? PP can come on quickly, out of the blue. Within hours women can go from perfectly well to as ill as we see people needing psychiatric care. In others, it might not be so rapid or obvious Who is vulnerable? For around 50% PP is the first episode of mental illness they've had. The other 50% will have had previous psychiatric illnesses. Bi-polar disorder are at particularly high risk, a 20% (1 in 5) chance. Extremely high risk are those with previous PP episodes with a 50-60% chance of reoccurrence What causes it? There are many hypotheses - big hormonal changes, sleep disruption or immunological changes. An important role, and an aspect of our ongoing research, are genetic factors.

Is government giving away Â£70bn to the rich?,"The claim:The government is giving away Â£70bn to corporations and the country's wealthiest people. Reality Check verdict:Labour's estimate of Â£70bn in lost revenue does come from official forecasts, but it includes tax cuts going back to 2010 and does not take into account other changes to corporation tax reliefs and allowances, which will bring in revenue. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has attacked the government for planning to give away Â£70bn to companies and rich people by 2022. His party says it reached the figure in consultation with the House of Commons Library, based on data about the cost of policy decisions collected by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), an official economic watchdog. The overwhelming majority of Labour's Â£70bn figure comes from cuts to corporation tax: the tax that businesses pay on their profits. Labour says this alone will result in lost revenue of more than Â£60bn between 2016 and 2022. George Osborne repeatedly announced reductions to corporation tax when he was chancellor, taking the tax rate from 28% to a planned 17% by 2020. Looking at these cuts, and other changes to allowances and reliefs that reduce bills for businesses, the total cost to the public purse is estimated at about Â£62bn between 2016-17 and 2021-22. Although the Â£62bn loss is incurred in these years, Labour is actually talking about policy changes that were announced as far back as 2010, when the party lost power. Labour also points to cuts to three other taxes, which are predominantly paid by banks and wealthy people: inheritance tax capital gains tax the bank levy These smaller changes take the total giveaway to about Â£70bn. So taken on its own terms, Labour's figure makes sense. But it only gives one side of the story. Over the same period the government also announced other changes to corporation tax allowances and reliefs that will recoup Â£32bn, about half the headline cut. Furthermore, on Sunday, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show six times the government was giving away Â£70bn in tax breaks ""by 2020"". But Labour's own analysis is clear: the figure covers the cost over six years.

How the invention of paper changed the world,"The Gutenberg printing press - invented in the 1440s by Johannes Gutenberg, a goldsmith from Mainz in Germany - is widely considered to be one of humanity's defining inventions. Gutenberg figured out how to make large quantities of durable metal type and how to fix that type firmly enough to print hundreds of copies of a page, yet flexibly enough that the type could be reused to print an entirely different page. His famous bibles were objects beautiful enough to rival the calligraphy of the monks. The crisp black Latin script is perfectly composed into two dense blocks of text, occasionally highlighted with a flourish of red ink. Actually, you can quibble with Gutenberg's place in history. The movable type press was originally developed in China. Even as Gutenberg was inventing in Germany, Koreans were ditching their entire method of writing to make printing easier, cutting tens of thousands of characters down to only 28. It is also not true that Gutenberg single-handedly created mass literacy. It was common 600 or 700 years earlier in the Abbasid Caliphate, spanning the Middle East and North Africa. Still, the Gutenberg press did change the world. It led to Europe's reformation, science, the newspaper, the novel, the school textbook, and much else. But it could not have done so without another invention, just as essential but much more often overlooked: paper. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in.

Paper was another Chinese idea, from 2,000 years ago. Initially it was used for wrapping precious objects, but soon people began to write on it because it was lighter than bamboo and cheaper than silk. This Chinese worker makes paper using techniques devised almost 2,000 years ago Soon the Arabic world embraced it, but Christians in Europe did not. Paper came to Germany only a few decades before Gutenberg's press. Why? For centuries, Europeans did not need the stuff. They had parchment, made from animal skin. It was pricey - a parchment bible required the skins of 250 sheep - but since so few people could read or write, that hardly mattered. But as a commercial class arose, needing contracts and accounts, cheaper writing material looked more attractive. And cheap paper made the economics of printing more attractive too: the cost of typesetting could easily be offset by a long print run, with no need to slaughter a million sheep. Printing is only the start of paper's uses. We decorate our walls with wallpaper, posters and photographs, we filter tea and coffee through it, package milk and juice in it and as corrugated cardboard, we use it to make boxes. We use wrapping paper, greaseproof paper, sandpaper, paper napkins, paper receipts and paper tickets. In the 1870s - the same decade that produced the telephone and the light bulb - the British Perforated Paper Company produced a kind of paper that was soft, strong, and absorbent. It was the world's first dedicated toilet paper. In fact, paper is the quintessential industrial product, churned out at incredible scale and when Christian Europeans finally embraced paper, they created arguably the continent's first heavy industry. Initially, paper was made from pulped cotton. Some kind of chemical was required to break down the raw material. The ammonia from urine works well, so for centuries the paper mills of Europe were powered by human waste. Pulping also needs a tremendous amount of mechanical energy. One of the early sites of paper manufacture, Fabriano in Italy, used fast-flowing mountain streams to power massive drop-hammers. The papermaking process saw endless innovation Once finely macerated, the cellulose from the cotton breaks free and floats around in a kind of thick soup. Thinned and allowed to dry, the cellulose reforms as a strong, flexible mat. Over time, the process saw endless innovation: threshing machines, bleaches and additives helped to make paper more quickly and cheaply, even if the result was often a more fragile product. By 1702, paper was so cheap, it was used to make a product explicitly designed to be thrown away after only 24 hours: the Daily Courant, the world's first daily newspaper. When it began, The Daily Courant only covered foreign news And then, an almost inevitable industrial crisis: Europe and America became so hungry for paper that they began to run out of rags. The situation became so desperate that scavengers combed battlefields after wars, stripping the dead of their bloodstained uniforms to sell to paper mills. An alternative source of cellulose was found - wood. The Chinese had long since known how to do it, but Europeans were slow to catch up. Why the falling cost of light matters The compiler: Computing's hidden hero How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream In 1719, a French biologist, Rene Antoine Ferchault De Reaumur, wrote a scientific paper pointing out that wasps could make paper nests by chewing wood, so why couldn't humans? When his idea was rediscovered years later, paper makers found that wood is not an easy raw material and contains much less cellulose than cotton rags. It was the mid-19th century before wood became a significant source for paper production in the West. Today, paper is increasingly made out of paper itself, often recycled - appropriately enough - in China. A cardboard box emerges from the paper mills of Ningbo, 130 miles (200km) south of Shanghai, and is used to package a laptop. The box is shipped across the Pacific, the laptop is extracted and the box is thrown into a recycling bin in Seattle or Vancouver. Then it's shipped back to Ningbo, to be pulped and turned into another box. When it comes to writing, though, some say paper's days are numbered, believing the computer will usher in the ""paperless office"". But this has been predicted since Thomas Edison, in the late 19th century, who thought office memos would be recorded on his wax cylinders instead. The idea really caught on as computers started to enter the workplace in the 1970s and it was repeated in breathless futurologists' reports for the next decades. Meanwhile, paper sales stubbornly continued to boom. Yes, computers made it simple to distribute documents without paper, but printers made it equally easy for recipients to put them on paper anyway. America's copiers, fax machines and printers continued to spew out enough sheets of paper to cover the country every five years. After a while, the paperless office became less a prediction, more a punchline. But perhaps things are finally changing: in 2013, the world hit peak paper. Many of us may still prefer the feel of a book or a physical newspaper to swiping a screen, but the cost of digital distribution is now so much lower that we are increasingly choosing the cheaper option. Finally, digital is doing to paper what paper did to parchment with the help of the Gutenberg press: outcompeting it, not on quality, but on price. Paper may be on the decline, but it will survive not only on the supermarket shelf or beside the lavatory, but in the office too. Old technologies have a habit of enduring. We still use pencils and candles and the world still produces more bicycles than cars. Paper was never only a home for beautiful typesetting, it was everyday stuff. And for jottings, lists and doodles, you still can't beat the back of the envelope.

Turkey row: Why has Erdogan riled Nato allies?,"Dutch police clashed with some ethnic Turkish protesters in Rotterdam on Saturday night Turkey is furious with the Netherlands for having prevented Turkish ministers from rallying support for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Dutch soil. It is very rare for relations between two Nato members to become so toxic. But similar restrictions in Austria and Germany have also soured their relations with Turkey. Freedom of assembly is enshrined inArticle 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights,external, which all EU member states have to respect. But that freedom is not unqualified. The article allows authorities to impose restrictions if they believe a rally could be a risk to national security or public safety. President Erdogan denounced the Netherlands as ""Nazi remnants"" and a ""banana republic"" for its restrictions. He also riled Germany earlier by making a comparison with the Nazis. He is in a hurry to woo Turks living abroad in the run-up to a key constitutional referendum on 16 April. If he wins, he will get sweeping new presidential powers greater than those enjoyed by US or French presidents. The Netherlands argues that pro-Erdogan campaigning by Turkish ministers risks whipping up tensions, with a Dutch general election set for Wednesday. The Freedom Party (PVV) of anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders is tipped to poll strongly - and immigration is high among voters' concerns. Dutch PM Mark Rutte wants Mr Erdogan to apologise for the ""Nazi"" slur against his country The Turkish government accuses the Dutch of violatingthe Vienna Convention,external- an international rulebook on diplomatic relations. Turkey says its Families Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya was not allowed into the consulate, and was then expelled from the country to stop her addressing a pro-Erdogan rally. The host country can argue, however, that unscheduled, overtly political visits by foreign government officials are an unwelcome breach of diplomatic protocol. Moreover, Article 94/A of Turkey's electoral law says ""no election propaganda can take place"" among Turks abroad or at Turkish diplomatic missions. That article was approved in 2008 by Mr Erdogan's AK Party. It has not bothered Turkish ministers, however, who claim to have a right to speak at Turkish ""cultural"" events. Dutch warn citizens after Erdogan threat Reality Check: Is banning Turkish rallies EU policy? Turkish-German ties fray as Erdogan seeks votes President Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AKP has been in power since 2002 The accusation that Europeans are treating Turkey in a racist way, as ""second-class"", reflects long-running Turkish frustration with the EU. It is a candidate for EU membership, but the negotiations - which began in 2005 - have gone at a glacial pace. Mr Erdogan is also bitter because, in his view, EU countries showed little or no solidarity with him after the abortive coup against him last July. A state of emergency remains in force in Turkey. Mr Erdogan says security is his priority becauseKurdish rebels, hostile forces in Syria and theGulen movementall threaten the Turkish state. Europe, in his view, chooses to ignore those perils. He also accuses Europe of reneging on promises it made - including visa-free travel - when theEU-Turkey deal,externalwas agreed in March 2016. That deal cut the flow of illegal migrants into the EU - but meant more of them returning to Turkey. A brief guide to Turkey's coup Since the coup attempt, more than 100,000 suspected opponents have been dismissed or imprisoned. Turkey's armed forces, judiciary, police and education system have been purged. Dozens of journalists have been jailed. A Yes vote in the referendum will further boost Mr Erdogan's powers. Legal experts at Europe's main human rights watchdog, the Council of Europe,say the proposed changes,externalwill create an ""authoritarian"" system, ""removing necessary checks and balances"". Turkish police outside Ankara University: Education has been targeted in the government crackdown Why is Turkey holding a referendum? Turkey says 'No' to saying 'No', ahead of its referendum Germany hosts the largest Turkish diaspora community - about three million, of whom 1.4m can vote in Turkish elections and referendums. In the November 2015 Turkish election the vote for the AKP among German Turks was 59.7%. In Turkey itself, the AKP vote was 49.5%. So Mr Erdogan is very interested in the Turkish diaspora vote. Turkish ministers were barred from addressing rallies in Gaggenau and Cologne, though Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was allowed to address one in Hamburg. In 2015 the AKP also polled strongly among Turks living in the Netherlands, France and Austria. More than half of the estimated 400,000 Dutch Turks are registered to vote in Turkey. The Turkish diaspora in France is reckoned to number more than 600,000, while the figure for Austria is an estimated 300,000. France allowed Foreign Minister Cavusoglu to address a rally on Sunday in the eastern city of Metz, where he called the Netherlands ""the capital of fascism"". Last month Austria banned Erdogan campaign rallies, on the grounds that they could increase friction and hinder integration. And Denmark has asked Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim to postpone a visit.

The wine boss who was glad to be sacked,"Mr Gormley has set up and grown two separate wine firms - Virgin Wines and Naked Wines Rowan Gormley says he had no idea that he was about to be sacked. Back in June 2008, as the founder and boss of Virgin Wines, he was trying to lead a management buyout from its then-parent group Direct Wines. ""I got called into a meeting, I thought it was to discuss the purchase price,"" says Mr Gormley, now 54. ""Instead, a letter was pushed across the table to me, which said I was being dismissed. ""I immediately walked out of the room and tried to use my [company] mobile phone, but it had been barred while I had been in the meeting."" Mr Gormley says he immediately decided that as buying back Virgin Wines was now impossible, he would instead set up a rival business. But he faced a race against time to get key staff to leave with him. ""I went across the road to a shop and bought another telephone as quickly as I could,"" he says. ""I phoned the office, and the guy I spoke to said, 'oh my God, there is an army of people here trying to get us to sign bits of paper saying we are not going to talk to you, and all sorts of things.' ""So I gave him a list of 17 people and said, 'tell these 17 not to sign anything.'"" Mr Gormley has also been the boss of Majestic since April 2015 Thankfully for Mr Gormley, the staff that he most wanted to keep decided to follow him out the door, and six months later he launched his new venture - Naked Wines. Today he is the boss of both Naked Wines and fellow UK wine retailer Majestic Wine, which have combined annual sales of more than Â£300m. ""I think I was sacked because of a clash of personalities, or perhaps egos, but it was honestly the best thing that ever happened to me,"" says Mr Gormley. ""Otherwise Naked would never have happened, nor would I have gone on to also lead Majestic."" Born and bred in South Africa, Mr Gormley says he first became interested in wine as a teenager. But before he started selling it in his late 30s, he spent almost two decades working in finance. After going to university in Cape Town, he trained as an accountant, and moved to the UK in his mid-20s. Mr Gormley then worked in private equity for seven years before joining Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. It was Mr Gormley's idea for Sir Richard to move into offering financial services, and Virgin Money was born in 1995. Five years later Mr Gormley said he came up with the idea for Virgin Wines, saying he recognised the opportunity of selling wine via the then-still nascent internet. ""I pitched the idea to the Virgin guys but they weren't very excited about it. So I started just selling wine at nights and weekends with my brother and friend to prove that it worked,"" he says, ""and six months later Virgin Wines was born."" But he says he and Virgin Wines immediately ""made all the classic dotcom mistakes"". ""We did everything wrong - we had a flash London headquarters, a huge IT office, a big advertising campaign, and absolutely nothing worked."" Mr Gormley says he has worked hard to boost morale at Majestic Ultimately, Mr Gormley says that for Virgin Wines to survive it had to cut its workforce by 90%, ""retreat to Norwich with our tails between our legs"", and start again from the very bottom. In addition to cutting costs, Mr Gormley says he turned around the company by focusing on selling interesting wines from small producers instead of selling the same big brands that people could buy from the supermarkets. By the time he and his team had managed to make Virgin Wines profitable, it was sold to larger UK firm Direct Wines in 2005, only for Mr Gormley to be sacked three years later. At Naked, Mr Gormley's big idea was to encourage customers to become ""angels"", who pay a direct debit of Â£20 a month, in exchange for getting wine at reduced prices. Naked then uses this money to pay independent wine producers in advance, so that they can focus all their energies on making the wine instead of worrying about being able to sell it. Naked Wines gives winemakers money upfront Winemakers are also profiled extensively on Naked's website (it is an online only operation), and customers are encouraged to review each wine, including saying whether they would buy it again. To drive sales the company gave away free samples, and today it has more than 320,000 angels. Such has been the growth of the business since it was founded in 2008 that it wasbought in 2015 by wine giant Majestic for Â£70m. The deal made Mr Gormley many millions, but instead of retiring to count his cash, he was given the top job at Majestic, and tasked with turning around its fortunes after three years of poor sales and weak profits at its UK stores and website. Mr Gormley's action plan has seen him focus on raising staffing levels at Majestic's 211 UK shops to try to boost both customer service and staff morale, and allowing customers to buy just one bottle of wine rather than the previous minimum order of six. The average cost of a bottle of wine at Majestic is Â£8, compared with Â£4.60 at supermarkets ""Majestic has to offer better service, and give people the type of help and advice that they don't get in a supermarket,"" he says. While the company is still struggling to make a profit, and an expansion into the US has not been successful, group sales are now rising strongly again. Retail analyst Jonathan Pritchard of stockbrokerage Peel Hunt says he would score Mr Gormley's first two years leading Majestic as ""eight out of 10"". He adds: ""He is a fabulous entrepreneur, and a very good presenter - he is excellent at getting his message across - but there have been a few bumps in the road since he took over."" UK wine journalists have mixed opinions. The Daily Mail's Olly Smith says Mr Gormley is ""something of a visionary and powerhouse in connecting wine directly with consumers"", but Jamie Goode from the Wine Anorak blog complains that the pre-discount prices at Naked are too high. Mr Gormley says his focus is always on selling enjoyable wines. ""I don't regard myself as having a great palate, but I consider that to be an advantage,"" he says. ""Too many people who are really into wine see their tastes become so esoteric and refined that normal people don't like what they drink. I'm not like that at all.""

SportDurban will not host 2022 Commonwealths13 March 2017 (17:09:42),"The 2022 Commonwealth Games was to be the first time the event has been held in Africa The 2022 Commonwealth Games will no longer be held in Durban, South Africa. David Grevemberg, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, said the city did not meet the criteria set by his organisation, and the search for a new host city had already begun. Durban was awarded the Games in September 2015 and was due to be the first African city to host the event, which was first held in 1930. Liverpool and Birmingham haveexpressed interestin staging the 2022 edition. The Commonwealth Games are held every four years and feature athletes from more than 50 countries, mostly former British colonies. Last month, South Africa's sports minister Fikile Mbalula indicated Durban may not be able to host the 2022 event because of financial constraints. ""We gave it our best shot but we can't go beyond. If the country says we don't have this money, we can't,"" he said. Grevemberg said: ""We are disappointed but it does not diminish our commitment to the African continent. ""We have had to postpone these ambitions to a later time. We all share disappointment that this ambition needs to be postponed right now. ""We remain committed to the inspiring potential of a Games in the continent."" Grevemberg said the South African government had never signed off on the decision for Durban to host the Games. ""We have a host city contract,"" he said. ""It was signed by all parties on the day except for the South African government. ""We have engaged with the government to really try to work with their current circumstances but also uphold the commitments that were outlined in their bid. They were unable to do that at this time and we have had to look after the citizens and communities that our events serve."" Grevemberg said an announcement on a new host city would be made by the end of the year. ""Discussions with a number of interested parties are under way,"" he said. ""I am confident an alternative host city will be found and that we will have an inspirational Games for the athletes and fans across the Commonwealth."" A spokesperson for Liverpool City Council said: ""We had heard rumours that Durban might be unable to deliver the Commonwealth Games in 2022 and have already indicated to the government that we are very willing to host them instead."" Birmingham had already expressed an interest in hosting the 2026 Games. Councillor Ian Ward, deputy leader of the city council, said: ""We are aware of the decision from the Commonwealth Games Federation to seek a new host for the 2022 Games. ""Here in Birmingham we are already in the advanced stages of producing a detailed feasibility study on what would be needed for a truly memorable Games in the city. ""That is due to be completed in the coming weeks and we are in close contact with the government about the developing situation.""
