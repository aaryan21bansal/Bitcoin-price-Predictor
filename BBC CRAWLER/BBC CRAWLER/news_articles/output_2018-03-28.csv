We've not got enough beds or staff - NHS bosses,"The NHS in England does not have enough beds or staff, health bosses say, ahead of the new financial year next week. NHS Providers, which represents chief executives, warned the service was facing an impossible task in 2018-19. The group said it meant hospital waiting lists would grow and long A&E waits continue. But the government said it was taking steps to support the NHS, including pay rises for staff and the promise of a long-term funding settlement. The pay rise - if agreed by the workforce by the summer - will be backdated to April and guarantees staff, excluding doctors, a minimum pay rise of 6.5% over three years. Meanwhile, on Wednesday Prime Minister Theresa May committed the government to a long-term funding plan in the near future to end what she called annual ""cash top-ups"".

New charge over Hatton Garden heist,"The vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd was breached over the 2015 Easter weekend A man has been charged in connection with the Hatton Garden heist three years ago in which Â£13.7m worth of valuables were stolen. Michael Seed, 57, was arrested after police searched a property in Islington at 07:30 BST on Tuesday. Mr Seed was charged on Wednesday with one count of conspiracy to burgle and one count of conspiracy to conceal or disguise criminal property. He will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday. Six men have already been jailed for their part in the raid over Easter weekend in 2015. Disguised as workmen, they entered through a lift shaft and used a heavy duty diamond-tipped drill to cut a hole through the vault wall which was big enough for two men to squeeze through. The gang then raided 73 safety deposit boxes, stealing valuables including gold, diamonds and sapphires. The raid was one of the biggest in UK history.

Government aid 'could be causing harm'International aid fund that focuses on promoting peace in conflict zones criticised in report.,"A government-run international aid fund could actually be causing harm, the UK's aid watchdog has warned. The Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF), which has a yearly budget of Â£1.2bn, focuses on projects promoting peace in conflict zones. But the Independent Commission for Aid Impact says it is not known if the projects are achieving results. The government said the report had also highlighted some successes but it would consider the ICAI's findings. A government statement read: ""As the CSSF grows, we will continue to act on lessons learnt including considering the findings of this report."" The ICAI, which scrutinises taxpayer-funded UK aid, said shortcomings at the CSSF, which will have an annual budget of Â£1.3bn by 2021, meant the effects of the fund's work were unclear. The ICAI report stated: ""As human rights risk assessments are inconsistent and programme monitoring is often weak, we do not know if CSSF programming is causing harm."" According to the report, CSSF projects sometimes went against evidence of what worked, which was likely ""to lead to sub-optimal results"". The morality of international aid The report also stated CSSF programming demonstrated insufficiently rigorous monitoring systems, weak programme delivery and rushed timelines. A project in Colombia to promote ""reconciliation activities"" was deemed to be not much more than an opportunity ""for elites to give speeches"". Recommendations in the report include addressing gaps in management, assessing value for money and better understanding the risks of, and potential for, doing harm. Richard Gledhill, the ICAI commissioner who led the review, said: ""Increasingly the world's poorest people are living in conflict zones, so it is right that the UK government is attempting to address conflict and instability. ""While we saw some good work, too many programmes showed signs of basic design errors with poor delivery and a lack of quality control. ""For a fund of its size this is worrying, and raises important concerns about its potential impact and value for money."" Labour's shadow international development secretary Kate Osamor said: ""The commission's review reveals that in their sample, every human rights assessment resulted in a green light for the proposed activity, without even a single modification to its design. ""It raises urgent questions for the government on how it will now ensure that human rights safeguards are taken seriously, and do not serve merely as a rubber stamp."" Tamsyn Barton, chief executive of Bond, the UK's network of International Development NGOs, said: ""At a time when aid and development are under intense scrutiny, it is critical that the CSSF rapidly puts into effect the recommendations of this report.""

Ecuador cuts Assange's embassy internet,"Mr Assange has been holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy since 2012 Ecuador has cut Julian Assange's internet connection at its embassy in London, preventing him from communicating with the outside world. The move is to prevent the WikiLeaks founder from interfering in other countries' affairs, Ecuador said. It comes after Mr Assange questioned accusations that Moscow was responsible for the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in the UK on 4 March. Mr Assange was granted political asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in 2012. He was initially staying in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sex crimes, which the 46-year-old has always denied. The Swedish authorities have since dropped their investigation, but Mr Assange believes he will be extradited to the US for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks if he leaves the building. Campaigner or attention-seeker? Baywatch star's 'love' for Assange On Monday, Mr Assange used Twitter to question the decision by the UK and more than 20 other countries to retaliate against a nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the UK city of Salisbury by expelling Russian diplomats.

UK Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan responded to his comments by branding the Australian  a ""miserable little worm"" who needs to turn himself over to authorities. In 2016, Ecuador briefly suspended Mr Assange's internet connection after he published hacked emails from the campaign team of Hillary Clinton, a move seen as having an impact on the US presidential election campaign. In May 2017, Ecuadorean President LenÃ­n Moreno asked Mr Assange to refrain from expressing his public support for the independence campaign in Spain's Catalonia region after he tweeted that Madrid was guilty of ""repression"". Mr Assange was granted asylum by President Moreno's predecessor, Rafael Correa. Mr Moreno's government has said it will maintain Mr Assange's asylum. But it has also sought ways for him to leave the embassy without risking arrest for breaching his bail conditions, and possible extradition to the US over the 2010 publication of classified information by WikiLeaks.

Future of Bargain Booze owner in doubt,"Bargain Booze owner Conviviality could face administration after failing to secure emergency funding. The firm, which is also a major supplier to chains like Wetherspoons, has suffered a string of profit warnings in recent weeks and revealed a Â£30m tax bill. It sought Â£125m from investors but said it had been unable to raise the cash. It is now looking at other options, including a ""potential sale of all or parts of the business"". If that fails, the company, which employs 2,500 staff, is unlikely to be able to continue trading. A statement from Convivialty read: ""Despite a significant number of meetings with potential investors resulting in good levels of demandâ¦ there was ultimately insufficient demand to raise the full Â£125m. ""The board wishes to thank its customers, suppliers and employees for their  continued support during this difficult period for the company. Conviviality also owns Wine Rack ""The company is in discussions with its lending banks and advisers regarding other possible options and is in receipt of a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business."" It is understood accountancy giant PwC is being lined up as administrator should a buyer not be found. Conviviality - which also owns Wine Rack - supplies over 25,000 restaurants, hotels and bars, more than 700 franchised retail outlets, and over 400 independent specialists. It also caters to festivals and events, as well as major supermarkets. The firm's shares have been suspended since an unexpected tax bill, due to be paid by the end of March, left it low on short term funding. Last week, chief executive Diana Hunter stepped down with ""immediate effect"", with non-executive chairman David Adams stepping into the breach until further notice. It comes amid a wider High Street slowdown that has seen a host of big businesses shut stores or go bust. Since January, Toys R Us and electronics retailer Maplin have filed for administration, while fashion retailers New Look and Select have promised to close hundreds of stores. Restaurant chains Prezzo, Byron and Jamie's Italian are also shutting outlets and laying off staff. Retailers have been buffeted by higher overheads, changing consumer habits and the rise of online spending. Many also embarked on debt-fuelled expansions that left them dangerously exposed.

Man has 'world's worst' super-gonorrhoea,"A man in the UK has caught the world's ""worst-ever"" case of super-gonorrhoea. He had a regular partner in the UK, but picked up the superbug after a sexual encounter with a woman in South East Asia. Public Health England says it is the first time the infection cannot be cured with first choice antibiotics. Health officials are now tracing any other sexual partners of the man, who has not been identified, in an attempt to contain the infection's spread. He picked up the infection earlier in the year. The main antibiotic treatment - a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone - has failed to treat the disease. Dr Gwenda Hughes, from Public Health England, said: ""This is the first time a case has displayed such high-level resistance to both of these drugs and to most other commonly used antibiotics."" Discussions with the World Health Organization and the European Centres for Disease Control agree this is a world first. The disease is caused by the bacterium calledNeisseria gonorrhoeae. The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Of those infected, about one in 10 heterosexual men and more than three-quarters of women, and gay men, have no easily recognisable symptoms. But symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods. Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy. Analysis of the man's infection suggests one last antibiotic could work. He is currently being treated and doctors will see if it has been successful next month. So far no other cases - including in the British partner - have been discovered, but the investigation is still under way. Dr Hughes added: ""We are following up this case to ensure that the infection was effectively treated with other options and the risk of any onward transmission is minimised."" Doctors have long been warning this could happen. In 2015,there was an outbreak of azithromycin-resistant gonorrhoea centred on Leeds. The fear is the bug could eventually become untreatable by any antibiotic. Teen hits lottery jackpot on 18th birthday Mum's tough love lesson divides parents Ask the French: Are they really rude? Dr Olwen Williams, the president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said: ""The emergence of this new strain of highly resistant gonorrhoea is of huge concern and is a significant development. ""We are concerned that the problem will worsen due to the dramatic cuts that have been delivered to the public health budget. ""Worryingly this has left sexual health services at 'tipping point', with clinic closures coming at the worst possible time."" Follow James on Twitter,external.

MPs to probe Russian money laundering,"MPs are to probe the scale of money laundering in the UK, including property bought with suspected Russian ""dirty money"". It follows claims that Â£4.4bn of UK property may have been bought with suspicious wealth, with more than a fifth, or Â£880m, purchased by Russians. UK and Russia relations are at a low point after a nerve agent attack on British soil. The Treasury Select Committee inquiry will also look at terrorist financing. Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan said: ""It has been claimed that the UK, particularly the London property market, is becoming a destination of choice to launder the proceeds of overseas crime and corruption - so-called 'dirty money'. ""Given the threats that face the UK, the effectiveness of the regimes that we use to protect our financial system from misuse have never been more important."" A report by anti-corruption group Transparency International,externalin March alleged that London ""has routinely been the choice destination for Russians with suspicious wealth to move and they have had little trouble doing so, taking advantage of lax regulation and offshore secrecy"". In response to the MPs' probe, Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said: ""Recent events seemed to have propelled some much needed new impetus into the UK's fight against dirty money and we very much welcome the Treasury Committee holding this inquiry."" The Treasury Committee will also look at sanctions, and how money laundering regulations have affected ""individuals, firms and the wider economy"". In addition, the committee will try to gauge ""the scale and nature of economic crime faced by consumers"", how banks deal with economic crime, and consumer data security. Relations between the UK and Russia have been at a low ebb since theattempted murder of former Russian agent Sergei Skripaland his daughter in Salisbury using the Novichok nerve agent.

US cop kills unarmed man with pants down,"This video can not be played Video shows unarmed man before fatal shooting A US police officer shot dead an unarmed man walking in traffic with his trousers down, and his family says it looks like ""premeditated murder"". Police dashcam video shows Danny Ray Thomas, 34, walking towards the officer on a road in Houston, Texas, last Thursday before a gunshot rings out. Deputy Cameron Brewer repeatedly shouts ""get down on the ground"" before firing. Both the officer and victim are black. Mr Thomas' family say he suffered from depression after his children died. His sister, Kita Thomas-Smith, attended a Houston City Council meeting on Tuesday where she tearfully urged politicians do to something about ""police brutality"". Mayor Sylvester Turner told her: ""I certainly feel your pain. We are certainly sorry for any life that is taken."" Outside city hall, Ms Thomas-Smithtold the Houston Chronicle,externalof the dashcam video. ""It feels like premeditated murder. ""He was clearly walking, not running, toward the deputy not trying to hurt or harm him."" Deputy Brewer, who had a Taser with him, has been placed on administrative leave as police investigate the shooting. Houston Police Department said in a statement,externallast week that Mr Thomas was found ""walking in the middle of the intersection"" of a busy road in the city. Deputy Brewer noticed him with ""his pants around his ankles, talking to himself and hitting vehicles as they passed by"". ""Thomas then struck a white vehicle, and the driver exited and engaged in a physical altercation with the suspect,"" Houston police said. The Harris County Sheriff's deputy saw the fracas and stopped his car to intervene. ""Fearing for his safety, the deputy discharged his duty weapon, striking Thomas once in the chest,"" said Houston police, which is leading the investigation. In a different video taken by a bystander and published by the Chronicle last week, onlookers at a bus stop are heard laughing as they predict the officer will use a stun gun on the jaywalker. ""He's about to get tased,"" says Kaaryn Young as she films. Gunfire rings out. She is heard asking in disbelief: ""He shot that man? ""He should have gotten tased! ""He shouldn't have shot that man in the street."" According to relatives, Mr Thomas' partner murdered his two children in 2016. She is awaiting trial for the deaths, which happened while Mr Thomas was in prison serving a three-year drug-related sentence.

Decision on engineering giant GKN's future,"By one o'clock this afternoon the fate of Britain's biggest engineering group, GKN will be decided. Investors will have voted on whether it is to stay independent or come under the control of turnaround specialist Melrose Industries. It is the biggest UK hostile takeover bid since Kraft took over Cadbury's in 2010. Several investors have already said which way they will jump. But they appear evenly divided. GKN is about as good an advertisement for British engineering as you can get. Its roots lie in the 18th century industrial revolution and there's not much it hasn't had a hand in making, from cannonballs for Wellington's army to Spitfires, Minis and the Ariane 5 rocket. Why the the GKN bid battle matters Its Driveline business makes systems for roughly half the world's passenger cars and light trucks. VW, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler are all customers. GKN is a partner on the F-35 joint strike aircraft And it is big in defence, a major supplier to the US military and a key partner on defence programmes such as the F-35 joint strike aircraft in which the UK government has a stake. However, it's not quite as British as it looks. Its head office is in Redditch in Worcestershire, but of GKN's 58,000 employees, only 6,000 work in Britain. The rest are spread around 30 countries. At the end of last year GKN seemed to have got itself into a mess. In October it warned profits would be lower than expected, and there was another warning in November. The company announced there was going to be ""detailed review"" of its US aerospace business and the division's head, Kevin Cummings, would resign. In the end the results came in better than expected, but there was still an underlying problem - GKN simply wasn't as profitable as it ought to have been. Margins hadfallen to 6.4% from 8.2%,external, and Melrose believed it could do better. So in JanuaryMelrose launched its bid,external, initially at Â£7bn, increased this month to Â£8.1bn, with up to another billion offered to help out the pension fund. It says it will keep the business together - for now. Its target, it says, is ""to re-energise and re-purpose GKN's operations"". It says it can beat GKN's own 10% target when it comes to profit margins. Melrose Industries is a British-based ""turnaround specialist"", listed on the London Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation over Â£4bn. Brush has had Â£96m invested in it by Melrose Its strategy is to find ""good manufacturing businesses with strong fundamentals"" and then ""buy, sell, improve"" them within three to five years. Its string of turnaround successes has been hugely profitable. If you had invested Â£1 in Melrose in 2005 it would be worth Â£18 today. Executive chairman of Melrose, Christopher Millerwrote to GKN shareholders explaining his strategy,externaland insisting his firm was not an asset-stripper. ""Unlike private equity companies, we do not rely on debt to boost returns and use only modest and prudent levels of leverage, well within UK industrial norms."" But Melrose's record has been tarnished of late by problems at the manufacturer Brush, which it bought eight years ago and where it has invested some Â£96m. Earlier this month it started negotiations with unions to lay off over a third of its British workforce in Leicestershire. GKN wants to merge its Driveline business with Dana in the US GKN has proposed far more drastic changes than anything Melrose is suggesting. It will, it says, split itself in two, sell non-core businesses, concentrate on its aerospace division and take steps to revive its margins. Driveline would merge,externalwith the American car components group Dana to create a new company. GKN would get a 47% stake in it and $1.8bn (Â£1.28bn) in cash from Dana. This new business would be listed on the New York and London stock exchanges. That, says GKN, would give it the wherewithal to hand shareholders Â£700m ""as soon as practicably possible"". Over the next three years it hopes to return in total Â£2.5bn cash to investors. In answer to Melrose's bid GKN said,external: ""Melrose is not the right owner for GKN. It lacks experience in relevant high technology businesses and of investing for the long-term. GKN is a much larger and more complex business than anything acquired by Melrose in the past."" Melrose said GKN's reaction was ""panicked and fraught with contradictions"". The Unite union is not happy. In a letter to GKN shareholders it said: ""GKN is a major tier one supplier in the automotive and aerospace sectors. ""This means that the company needs to work closely both with manufacturers and with government and make significant investments in innovation for the future. Airbus says it opposes the Melrose bid ""These are cyclical industries, and Melrose's experience with Brush has not demonstrated that they have the ability to react to these cycles."" Some of GKNs customers are also worried. Airbus said it would be ""practically impossible"" to give new business to GKN if the takeover went ahead because it damaged long-term investment prospects in GKN, which could reduce research and development (R&D) budgets and limit innovation. The government has also stepped in. Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, wrotea letter to Melrose,externalasking for ""commitments, which would need to be binding in the event that your bid was successful"". These include maintaining the workforce, headquarters and R&D in the UK, and not selling defence businesses off in the short term. In reply Melrosesaid it agreed with the Business Secretary's requests,externaland added: ""Melrose has offered a legally binding commitment to the secretary of state to stand behind its intention to hold the GKN aerospace business as it delivers the improvement necessary to unlock its potential.""

Ghost galaxy prompts cosmic mystery,"Hubble image: The galaxy is so faint that other spiral galaxies can been seen through it An unusually transparent galaxy about the size of the Milky Way is prompting new questions for astrophysicists. The object, with the catchy moniker of NGC1052-DF2, appears to contain no dark matter. If this turns out to be true, it may be the first galaxy of its kind - made up only of ordinary matter. Currently, dark matter is thought to be essential to the fabric of the Universe as we understand it. The study is published inNature,external. A new map of the Universe's dark matter Hubble scores unique view of distant galaxy Artwork: A dark matter halo (blue) is thought to extend beyond the visible star population of galaxies The authors of the study weren't initially on the hunt for a dark matter-free galaxy; instead they had set out to take a closer look at large, ultra-diffuse galaxies. These are similar in size to the spiral galaxies we're more familiar with, but have a fraction of the number of stars. When Prof Pieter van Dokkum, lead author of the study, first spotted NGC1052-DF2, ""I stared a lot at that image and just marvelled at it... It's like this ghostly glow in the sky."" The galaxy has very few stars, but many of them are grouped together in unusually bright clusters. When the team studied the behaviour of these clusters, they found that the stars seemed to account for all of the galaxy's mass. Leaving no room for dark matter. Artwork: a map of dark matter in the local universe This is not the case for most galaxies. ""There's about five times more dark matter in a galaxy than regular matter,"" explained Dr Michelle Collins, a physicist at the University of Surrey who was not involved in the study. ""As you go further out from the galaxy you have fewer stars and more dark matter. The dark matter halo is much more extended than the stars are in a galaxy,"" she added. As it has greater mass than normal matter, dark matter is believed to hold the necessary gas together while galaxies are forming. ""So this galaxy would have to form a different way: maybe from interactions within gas that's flowing into or blowing out of a larger galaxy,"" North Carolina State University astrophysicist Dr Katherine Mack told BBC News. Andromeda: most galaxies have five times more dark matter than regular matter ""It's not just galaxies,"" explains van Dokkum. ""The entire fabric of the universe is really the scaffolding of dark matter and everything else is pasted on it."" For Mack, the most exciting aspect of this galaxy is its potential to prove that dark matter - until now widely theorised but not directly observed - is real. If dark matter were just an unexplained effect of the gravity from regular matter, its effects would be visible in this galaxy. ""So it only makes sense if dark matter is a real substance, that can be present or not, separately from the regular matter,"" Mack added. The team has another paper forthcoming that will take a closer look at the bright star clusters, and may unravel more of NGC1052-DF2's mystery. More work remains to be done on this and similar objects before dark matter theory needs to be fundamentally altered, however. Once launched, the James Webb Space Telescope will offer a better look at distant galaxies ""You always have to be careful to say it's the first of anything,"" says van Dokkum. ""It's certainly the best candidate for a baryonic [ordinary matter] galaxy."" Dr Collins is cautious to conclude that the galaxy has no dark matter halo, based on the current evidence. She notes that there may be other galaxies with unusual and unexplained features, but technology will need to improve before they can be properly observed. ""We have some galaxies nearby that show some similar properties but they're much fainter. They're much smaller objects,"" she told BBC News. Dr Richard Massey, a physicist at Durham University, agrees: ""I'm genuinely very impressed with the work, and I'd use the conclusions to say that we should stare at these objects a lot harder for a lot longer - but I wouldn't conclude anything profound about dark matter quite yet,"" he told BBC News.

Row over deposit demands on tenants,"Tenants with pets are often charged a bigger deposit MPs and landlords are at loggerheads over the acceptable level of deposits demanded of tenants in England. Deposits should be capped at five weeks' worth of rent, according to the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee. The government's latest plan has been to cap the deposit at six weeks' worth of rent. Landlords groups believe that six weeks' worth is realistic, otherwise ""riskier"" tenants could be blocked. For example, the National Landlords Association (NLA) said a shorter cap would reduce landlords' willingness to allow pets ""by removing their flexibility to take a higher deposit to cover for pet damage"". Initially, the government had favoured a much more stringent cap on landlords, planning to allow them to charge four weeks' worth of rent as a deposit. Tenants in Scotland do not pay fees to letting agents The disagreement has emerged during scrutiny of the government's draft Tenant Fees Bill. The law change is aimed at introducing a ban on fees imposed on tenants by landlords and letting agents in England. A ban is already in place in Scotland. The draft proposes prohibiting payments with the exception of rent, security deposits of up to six weeks' rent, holding deposits of up to one week's rent, and default fees. The commitment was announced by the Conservatives in the 2016 Autumn Statement. The committee argued that security deposits set at six weeks' worth of rent could cause financial difficulties for tenants. At five weeks' worth, the private rented sector would become more affordable while also protecting landlords from rogue tenants, it argued. Clive Betts, who chairs the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, said: ""Moving home is already an expensive time and many people struggle to find large sums of money at the start of their tenancies to put down as a deposit."" However Richard Lambert, chief executive of the NLA said: ""There is no doubt that some agents have got away with excessive fees and double-charging landlords and tenants for far too long, but agents play a key role in managing properties and the ban will eventually boomerang back on tenants."" Housing charity Shelter suggested that the average cost of fees had risen to Â£272 per person. It warned that the committee's proposals could still allow agents to charge through default fees. These fees allowed agents to charge tenants potentially unlimited sums for such things as letters sent for chasing late rent, it said. ""This ban was wildly popular with renters, which is why it's so important that it does exactly what it says on the tin by completely scrapping rip-off letting agent fees,"" said Greg Beales, director of policy and campaigns at Shelter. ""It is good to see the ban moving forward, but these proposals would leave the back door open for agents to continue charging tenants in different ways and let down the renters it was supposed to help.""

May: I'll keep UK united after Brexit,"This video can not be played Theresa May: Brexit will offer new opportunities for the UK Theresa May has said that Brexit means there will be more money available to spend on the NHS and schools. The prime minister told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Brexit ""would deliver a country that will be different"" but with the chance ""of a bright future"". The PM visited England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with one year to go to the UK leaving the EU. Meanwhile ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair said Brexit could still be stopped, saying it was ""not too late"". Mr Blair, a strong backer of UK membership of the EU, told BBC Radio 4's Today the ""sensible"" option was to ""take a final decision"" once the terms of the deal have been set out. Blair: It is not too late to stop Brexit UK hopes to 'roll over' 40 EU trade deals What do people think about Brexit? Reality Check: Can I keep my citizenship? On 29 March 2019, the UK will formally leave the EU and is due to enter a 21-month transition period during which much of the current arrangements continue, before the final permanent post-membership relationship is due to kick-in. Since formal negotiations began between the two sides last June, an agreement has been struck on a Brexit ""divorce bill"" - but the crucial issue of how they will trade together in the longer term has yet to be settled. In her interview with the BBC's political editor, Mrs May was asked if there would be a ""Brexit dividend"". She replied: ""Of course when we leave the European Union, we'll no longer be spending vast sums of money, year in and year out, sending that money to the European Union, so there will be money available here in the UK to spend on our priorities like the NHS and schools."" Mrs May said she was confident of securing a deal which was good for all parts of the UK. Asked if she thought Brexit was worth it, she added: ""I think there are real opportunities for the UK, I think there's a bright future out there and, yes, I think Brexit is going to deliver a country that will be different, for us to be an independent nation for the future."" This video can not be played With a year until our departure, what do voters make of the Brexit progress so far? The issue of whether there would be a Brexit dividend was a contentious issue during the 2016 EU referendum. The Leave campaign said money sent to the EUshould be spent on the NHSinstead, while the Remain side said the economic impact of leavingwould mean less moneybeing available to spend on public services. At some stage - most likely in October - the PM will have to put an outline of the Brexit deal to Parliament, with some opponents seeing that as a chance to force a rethink. The government only has a majority in the Commons with the support of DUP MPs so Labour's position in that vote will be important. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Labour's ""tests"" on any proposed deal were ""nowhere near being met"" and insisted Labour would not vote for the deal unless ""the government are sensible and they negotiate properly... [so we can] get a deal that meets the six tests"". Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: A timeline Why is leaving the EU taking so long? Quick guide to Brexit - in 300 words Mrs May began her tour by visiting a textile factory in Ayrshire with other stops at a parent and toddler group in Newcastle, lunch with farmers near Belfast before meeting businesses in Barry, south Wales. She vowed to regain control of ""our laws, our borders and our money"" and that the UK will ""thrive as a strong and united country that works for everyone, no matter whether you voted Leave or Remain"". The prime minister has been accused of a power grab by the Scottish and Welsh governments over plans to repatriate some powers from Brussels to Westminster rather than to the devolved administrations. She insisted each of the devolved administrations would see ""an increase in their decision-making powers"" and that her government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the devolution settlements. But Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones warned that Mrs May's Brexit plan would ""do serious damage to our economy"". And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted to see progress in the talks over devolving powers to UK nations from Brussels. ""This is about powers over the environment, agriculture, fishing, justice - perhaps whether in future trade deals, our health service could be put up for grabs,"" she said. ""These things really matter and that's why this is such an issue of importance for us."" By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Voters were promised an additional Â£350m a week to fund the NHS As was crystal clear with a focus group in Coventry last night, for many voters, Brexit was a demand for something else, a response to big promises made by politicians. With only a year to go, and the government's main achievement so far being establishing a grace period that will pretty much keep us in the EU for another couple of years, I can't help using the phrase that haunted the prime minister in the election: ""Nothing has changed."" And nothing will change any time soon either. But the argument over how to keep perhaps the biggest of those promises is alive and kicking. Without mentioning the bus (yes, that bus), the boldest promise in the referendum that sticks in people's minds was to provide more money for the NHS. Read more from Laura's blog. The PM also promised to ""protect the integrity of the United Kingdom as a whole"", restating her opposition to a controversial EU ""backstop"" option which effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside its customs union.

Triple death crash driver jailed,"George Wilkinson, Harry Rice and Josh McGuinness were killed on their way to a five-aside football centre A drink-driver who hit and killed three teenage boys as they walked to a birthday party in west London, has been jailed for 13 years. Harry Rice, 17, George Wilkinson and Josh McGuinness, both 16, died instantly when Jaynesh Chudasama struck them at more than 70mph in Hayes. Chudasama had admitted three counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He was described by one of the boys' parents as ""a coward"" after he ran away from the scene. Reacting to the sentencing at the Old Bailey, the victims' parents said the jail term was ""an insult to the lives of their children"". Hayes triple death crash victims 'incredible boys' Man admits boys' bus stop death crash Chudasama, 28, of Hayes, had traces of cannabis in his system whenhe ploughed into the boys in his Audi on Shepiston Lane, on 26 January. Chudasama was more than two-and-a-half times the legal drink-drive limit when he crashed the Audi, the court heard The court heard in February that Josh was struck with such force he was thrown over a fence and into a nearby cemetery. Harry was carried on the bonnet of the car until it crashed into the cemetery wall, and a girl held George's hand as he lay half in the road and half on the pavement. Chudasama fled the scene, but was pursued and caught by two boys before subsequently being arrested by police. As he was sentenced Tracy Blackwell - Josh's mother - told him ""you are going to rot in hell, mate"". Eight hours after the crashthe defendant had 79 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood - one milligram below the legal limit. Jaynesh Chudasama had alcohol and cannabis in his system when he crashed, the court heard It was therefore estimated that at the time of the crash his level would have been at 213 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, the court heard. As she sentenced Chudasama, Judge Wendy Joseph QC said: ""It is obvious that nothing any court can do can measure the loss of Josh, Harry and George for the obvious reason that their loss is immeasurable."" She jailed him for 13 years and disqualified him from driving for 13 years and six months. The maximum punishment for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years in prison, however the court heard Parliament isconsidering proposals for life sentences for the most serious cases. This video can not be played 'This is all that's left of our son' Harry's father, Ian Rice, said the boys' friends cleaned up the crash scene themselves. ""They came across a lot of things that you wouldn't want to see - the remains of the boys for instance,"" he said. ""Blood on the railings where our sons were. ""The boys and girls, their friends, went back to the Goals, got some equipment, came back, and cleaned the railings of our children's blood."" He and other parents said police kept them waiting for about five hours after the crash without telling them what was going on. Mr Rice said the police response to the crash has been ""a shambles"". Josh's mother Tracy Blackwell said family liaison officers did not come to the Premier Inn where she and other parents had been told to wait - so a police officer who was ""not trained"" to break bad news had to tell the parents their sons were dead. ""It's not just been one mistake,"" she said. A Met statement said a specially trained family liaison officer was assigned to each of the three families to provide support during the investigation and court case. It added: ""We are concerned to hear that the families have not been satisfied with aspects of the police investigation and will endeavour to speak to them about these issues and address their concerns.""

Worboys ruling quashed as parole head quits,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women A decision by the Parole Board to release the rapist John Worboys has been quashed, prompting the board's chairman Nick Hardwick to resign. A legal challenge by two victims was upheld by the High Court, and the Parole Board praised the ""bravery"" of the women who brought the action. Worboys, 60, has served 10 years, including remand time, of an indeterminate prison sentence. ""A lot of women will be sleeping a lot easier tonight,"" one victim said. The victim - known as DSD - said she was thrilled with the result and was confident the Parole Board would ""make the right decision next time because the information will be put in front of them"". Mr Worboys' case will now be referred back to the Parole Board, where a new panel will make a ""fresh determination"". In Professor Hardwick'sletter of resignation, he said he was ""sorry for the mistakes that were made in this case"", adding that Justice Secretary David Gauke had told him his position was now ""untenable"". That the Parole Board did not take into account the dozens of alleged offences that Worboys was not prosecuted for was acknowledged by the High Court. But barrister Phillippa Kaufmann QC, who represented the two victims, said the problem did not lie ""solely at the feet of the Parole Board"". She said Prof Hardwick had been ""scapegoated"" for wider failings in the system. After the High Court hearing Ms Kaufmann said: ""That material [on Worboys' alleged offences] was not put in by the Ministry of Justice itself. ""So Gauke has a responsibility here; the Ministry of Justice has a responsibility here,"" she said. Worboys, who is now known as John Radford, was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges - but police believe he committed crimes against more than 100 women between 2002 and 2008. Analysis: Legal implications of the judgement Parole Board chairman's resignation letter The cabbie who preyed on young women In November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions, arguing its decision was based on appropriate evidence. But the High Court judges said the Parole Board ""should have undertaken further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending"". The case will now be referred back to the Parole Board and considered by a new panel, while Worboys remains in prison. This video can not be played Victim: 'The police assumed I was some drunk' Justice Secretary Mr Gauke congratulated the victims on the ""unprecedented legal action"" and announced plans to make the Parole Board system more transparent. Responding to a question at PMQs, Prime Minister Theresa May said the ruling raised ""serious concerns"" and agreed the victims should never have had to face their attacker in court during their legal challenge. Mrs May also said she had full confidence in Mr Gauke, who had decided it ""would not be appropriate"" for the government to seek a judicial review earlier in the year. Nick Hardwick said he had been told his position as chairman of the Parole Board had become ""untenable"" But shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon has called for an independent review of the Parole Board's handling of the case. He added: ""It can't be right that women victims have to go to judicial review before the reasons for the release of John Worboys became available."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who brought the challenge with the two victims, said the decision would bring ""some reassurance to the victims and to all Londoners,external"". At a court hearing this month, lawyers for Worboys' victims and Mr Khan had argued the former cab driver had been dishonest with the Parole Board and had crafted an account to convince the panel he was a changed man. Victims told Worboys would serve life-sentence Worboys review: What we have learned They said the ""wider allegations"" against Worboysshould have been taken into account. During his original trial, jurors heard Worboys - who became known as the black-cab rapist - had picked up his victims in London's West End and given them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos. Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw This is a landmark ruling that will shape the way future parole hearings are conducted. It makes clear that when assessing a prisoner's suitability for release, details of alleged offences, as well as convictions, can be considered - as long as they're dealt with fairly. In the John Worboys case, the judges were clearly concerned that allegations for which he was not prosecuted weren't addressed by the panel that directed his release. As a result, his apparent ""honesty"" wasn't subjected to sufficient scrutiny. It remains something of a puzzle why the psychologists and parole panel members didn't examine those issues. Were they confused about the legality of doing so? Or were they taken in by the arch manipulator, Worboys? Some may regard it as unfortunate that Nick Hardwick, who'd steered through changes to reduce parole delays, won't be in place to see through the further reforms necessary. But the high-profile nature of the case, and the clear failings highlighted in the judgment, made it difficult for him to continue in such a febrile atmosphere. In a further move on Wednesday, the High Court judges found the rules which stop Parole Board decisions from being made public were unlawful. It came after the Sun newspaper, along with Mr Khan and the victims, also challenged the Parole Board's lack of openness and its failure to give reasons for its decisions. Following the judgement, Mr Gauke said such rules would be abolished. A spokesman from the Sun praised it as ""a victory for transparency and for the free press"". The Victims' Commissioner, Baroness Newlove, also said the parole process should be more victim-focussed. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith praised the victims who brought the case forward, but said the decision ""must now provoke a rethink of a criminal justice system"" in which many lacked ""confidence"". Fellow Conservative Dominic Grieve said some aspects of the case were ""quite astonishing"". He said it was difficult to understand why the Parole Board did not probe into Worboys' background. But he added that because of the number of indeterminate sentences - where no date is set for a prisoner's release - the Parole Board deals with more cases than it was designed to handle.

'Deeply sorry' Labour disputes chief quits,"Christine Shawcroft became head of the disputes committee in January The head of the Labour Party's disputes panel has quit after it emerged she opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. Christine Shawcroft sent an email calling for the reinstatement of Alan Bull, who had been due to stand in local elections in Peterborough in May. In a statement she said she had not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" Facebook post that led to his suspension. Mr Bull said he reposted an article on Facebook for the purpose of debate. He told the BBC that he shared the article, which claimed the Holocaust was a ""hoax"", with friends without comment - but said he did not agree with its content. Ms Shawcroft - a director of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group - only became the head of the disputes committee, which investigates allegations of sexual harassment, anti-Semitism and disciplinary breaches, in January. She said she was ""deeply sorry"" for her ""wrong and misguided questions on this case"". How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue Momentum chief Shawcroft to lead disputes panel In her original email, Ms Shawcroft said she was ""concerned"" to hear about the suspension of Mr Bull for ""a Facebook post taken completely out of context and alleged to show anti-Semitism"". Some people in Peterborough's Labour Party had ""political reasons"" for not wanting him to stand, she wrote, adding: ""I am concerned that party disciplinary procedures are being used in the pursuit of partisan disputes in local parties, wasting a great deal of staff time in the process."" She ended her email by saying the party had ""sat on"" the complaint for months, adding: ""I think we should reinstate his membership and allow him to contest the ward for which he has been selected."" But in a statement announcing her resignation on Wednesday night, she said: ""I sent this email before being aware of the full information about this case and I had not been shown the image of his abhorrent Facebook post. Had I seen this image, I would not have requested that the decision to suspend him be re-considered. I am deeply sorry for having done so."" In a reference to Monday's demonstration by Jewish groups against the Labour leadership, she added: ""This week we have seen a clear expression of the pain and hurt that has been caused to Jewish members of our party and the wider Jewish community by anti-Semitic abuse and language, and by the reality of anti-Semitism being denied and downplayed by others. This video can not be played The shadow chancellor told the Today programme Labour will 'root out' anti-Semitism ""In light of this, I have decided to stand down as chair of the disputes panel to ensure my wrong and misguided questions on this case do not cause doubt or anxiety about our processes."" The shadow chancellor said measures should have been put in place ""ages ago"" to deal with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and that any incidences would be dealt with ""firmly and severely"". John McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""You've got to have an independent system which looks at all the evidence. ""You do not leap to judgement in advance and when that judgment is made we implement it and we implement it ruthlessly because we do not tolerate any form of racism in our party."" Some Labour MPs have called for Ms Shawcroft to step down from the party's ruling National Executive Committee. Labour MP Ian Austin told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""This is the committee that is supposed to review internal disciplinary cases and the chair thinks someone who was accused of sharing material that says the Holocaust was a hoax is fit to be a Labour candidate. Of course she shouldn't be on our NEC."" John Mann, Labour MP and chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on anti-Semitism, said party leader Jeremy Corbyn should ""show some real leadership"" and suspend Ms Shawcroft from the party. Jewish groups protested outside Parliament earlier this week Ms Shawcroft's resignation broke as Mr Corbyn used aninterview with Jewish News,externalto describe anti-Semitism as a ""cancer in our society"". Mr Corbyn, who has faced criticism for questioning the removal of a mural that was branded anti-Semitic in 2012, said: ""I'm not an anti-Semite in any way, never have been, never will be."" Asked about criticism by some of his supporters of MPs who joined the demonstration, he said: ""Any abuse makes me profoundly concerned and any abuse that is done is certainly not done in my name. ""People have a right to speak out and a right to demonstrate and that surely is something that is intrinsic in any democratic society. I will not tolerate abuse of people for their beliefs."" He said none of the ""terrible"" abuse aimed at Labour MP Luciana Berger - who raised the issue of the mural on Twitter - ""can be done in our name or in my name"". He also said deselection threats against another MP who attended the demo, David Lammy, were ""up to the local party"" but added: ""David Lammy is a colleague, a friend of mine, I admire what he stands for and what he does and he should not be condemned for that."" Also on Wednesday evening, the Board of Deputies wrote to Mr Corbyn calling on him to disown supporters who had ""vilified"" the anti-Semitism protesters. ""Nobody should be vilified for opposing anti-Semitism. Those Labour Party members and Labour-supporting blogs pushing the abuse are largely  doing so in your name,"" the letter said. On Thursday Mr Corbyn wrote to Labour MPs saying: ""Support for justice for the Palestinian people should provide no one with the excuse to insult, harass or encourage hatred of Jewish people.""

Musician wins ruling over hearing loss,"He joined the viola section of the ROH orchestra in 2002 A viola player who suffered a life-changing hearing injury at a rehearsal of Wagner's Die Walkure in 2012 has won a landmark High Court judgment against the Royal Opera House (ROH). The case won by Chris Goldscheider has huge implications for the industry and the health and safety of musicians. It is the first time a judge has scrutinised the music industry's legal obligations towards musicians' hearing. The ROH said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the judgment. It is also the first time 'acoustic shock' has been recognised as a condition which can be compensated by a court. On 1 September 2012, Mr Goldscheider was seated directly in front of the brass section of the orchestra for a rehearsal of Wagner's thunderous opera Die Walkure in the famous orchestra pit at the Royal Opera House. During that rehearsal, the noise levels exceeded 130 decibels, roughly equivalent to that of a jet engine. His hearing was irreversibly damaged. Chris Goldscheider said he was ""overjoyed"" by the judge's decision Mr Goldscheider claimed damages for acoustic shock, a condition with symptoms including tinnitus, hyperacusis and dizziness. He told the BBC: ""With this condition if you are exposed to normal sounds, unfortunately they become incredibly painful. ""I suppose the nearest analogy is if you imagine for a normal person to walk on normal ground and then you imagine walking barefoot on glass."" Mr Goldscheider, from Bedfordshire, has to wear ear defenders to carry out everyday household tasks such as preparing food. Especially upsetting is that he had been unable to listen to his 18-year-old son Ben - one of the country's outstanding young French horn players. The Royal Opera House argued that acoustic shock does not exist, and that if it did, Mr Goldscheider did not have it. Their case was that he had developed an entirely natural hearing condition, known as Meniere's disease, at exactly the same time as the super-loud, high intensity noise burst behind his right ear. However, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies took a different view, stating: ""I regard the defendant's contention that Meniere's disease developed at the rehearsal as stretching the concept of coincidence too far."" The ROH also argued a balance had to be struck between preserving the artistic integrity of the music while doing everything possible to reduce the risk of damage to musicians' hearing, that was an inevitable feature of playing long-term in an orchestra. The Royal Opera House had argued that some hearing loss was justifiable Mrs Justice Davies disagreed, ruling that ""the reliance upon artistic value implies that statutory health and safety requirements must cede to the needs and wishes of the artistic output of the Opera company, its managers and conductors. ""Such a stance is unacceptable. Musicians are entitled to the protection of the law, as is any other worker."" Reacting to the ruling, Mr Goldscheider said: ""As you can imagine a law suit of this magnitude takes its strain on everyone. Not just on me but my family, my children. ""Here we are today and I'm just so overjoyed at the judge's decision and I hope it will prevent any more musicians being injured from today onwards."" Speaking of the impact of the decision, Mr Goldscheider's solicitor, Chris Fry of Fry Law, said: ""This case has huge significance and will send shockwaves across the music business. ""It has considered itself exempt from the same regulatory requirements as all other sectors because of the artistic nature of its output. ""This, in our view, has always been a dismissive view from an industry which creates and sells 'noise' as a product."" The Royal Opera House and other orchestras will now need to re-assess policies and procedures and the design of orchestra spaces and could face claims against them by other musicians. In a statement, the ROH said the expert medical advice it had consistently received was that long-term hearing damage could not be caused by an isolated incident of exposure to live music. ""We have been at the forefront of industry-wide attempts to protect musicians from the dangers of exposure to significant levels of performance sound, in collaboration with our staff, the Musicians' Union, acoustic engineers and the Health and Safety Executive,"" it continued. ""Although this judgment is restricted to our obligations as an employer under the Noise Regulations, it has potentially far-reaching implications for the Royal Opera House and the wider music industry. ""We do not believe that the Noise Regulations can be applied in an artistic institution in the same manner as in a factory, not least because in the case of the Royal Opera House, sound is not a by-product of an industrial process but is an essential part of the product itself. ""This has been a complex case and we will consider carefully whether to appeal the judgment."" Goldscheider once played on stage with Kylie Minogue According to Help Musicians UK, the leading UK charity for professional musicians: ""The unfortunate circumstances surrounding Chris's tragic hearing loss reflect a growing number of hearing related issues, as highlighted in our 2015 hearing survey, where 59.5% of musicians said they had suffered hearing loss and 78% said working as a musician was a contributor to their hearing loss."" Mr Goldscheider began playing the violin at the age of five and the viola from about 21. He studied in Prague and the UK and played with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and BBC Symphony orchestras. In 2002 he joined the viola section of the ROH orchestra as number eleven viola and was promoted to number six. Career highlights included playing on stage with Kylie Minogue and with the Three Tenors to 100,000 people in Barcelona. ""Following my injury I spent 18 months trying to recover, recuperate and get back to playing, and unfortunately I couldn't do it,"" he said. Mr Goldscheider left the ROH in July 2014 as a result of his injuries. Damages will be assessed at a later date.

Trump picks his doctor for veterans post,"Ronny Jackson gave Mr Trump a medical in January US President Donald Trump has announced the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin and picked the presidential doctor to replace him. Thanking Mr Shulkin in a tweet, he said he intended to nominate Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, who gave him his first medical as president in January. Unnamed officials told Reuters Mr Shulkin had become a distraction due to speculation about his future. A Pentagon official, Robert Wilkie, will be the acting secretary. It is the latest in a series of departures from Mr Trump's cabinet. This month alone, he has replaced his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, and National Security Advisor, HR McMaster, while his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, also left following discord over Mr Trump's plans to impose trade tariffs on steel and aluminium. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Previously held in high regard in public by the president, Mr Shulkin's position had been under mounting pressure. Mr Shulkin was the only Obama-era administration official within Mr Trump's cabinet A report released in February from an internal watchdog found ""serious derelictions by VA personnel"" on a trip to Europe last year. The report accused the secretary of improperly accepting tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament whilst on the visit and using the trip to sightsee. He denied the accusations but agreed to comply with the report's recommendations, including reimbursing the government for his wife's airfare for the trip, which was more than $4,300 (Â£3,000).

Verna Jones, executive director of the American Legion, told CBS Radio the organisation was sad to see Mr Shulkin go. ""We think that Secretary Shulkin had done a tremendous job for veterans,"" she said. ""Under Secretary Shulkin's leadership, the veterans agenda had been moved - and more than we could have expected."" This video can not be played President Trump has good 'genes', according to a White House doctor Rear Admiral Jackson, 50, has worked as presidential physician to three presidents, serving  George W Bush and Barack Obama before Mr Trump moved into the White House. He comes to the veterans post, which entails running a vast department, with little administrative or political experience. However, he has a wealth of military experience, having served with a Marine unit during the war in Iraq. He caught public attention after Mr Trump's medical, telling reporters the president was in ""excellent health"". Denny Geisman, a US army veteran, welcomed President Trump's choice of replacement. ""Maybe there can be some true good reform now, based on the fact that he's a rear admiral, he's a veteran and, you know, he's a doctor,"" he said.

Trump keen to meet Kim after China talks,"This video can not be played Chinese TV showed footage of the two leaders with their wives US President Donald Trump has said he is keen to meet Kim Jong-un after being told the North Korean leader's trip to China ""went very well"". But Mr Trump said maximum sanctions and pressure on North Korea would continue ahead of proposed talks in May. He added that denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula was now a possibility. The comments follow Mr Kim's meeting with China's President Xi Jinping, in his first known foreign trip since taking office in 2011. Mr Kim and his wife were greeted with a banquet and a guard of honour, with the North Korean leader reportedly saying he was committed to denuclearisation. China is North Korea's main economic ally.

Mr Trump's agreement to hold an unprecedented summit with Mr Kim astonished many observers. The announcement, which would make Mr Trump the first sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader, came after months of hostility and a string of North Korean missile tests. An initial statement from the South Korean delegation said a meeting had been agreed and would take place by May - but no place or date has officially been set. News of the major breakthrough in tensions was met with concern in the US, with reports that Mr Trump had made the decision without consulting key figures in his administration. However Mr Trump later tweeted that a deal with North Korea was ""very much in the making"". This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies But despite the progress in recent months, a number of factors could affect the chances of success. While Mr Kim has reportedly told China and South Korea he is willing to abandon nuclear weapons, he has stated that this comes with conditions, China's Xinhua news agency reported. There are also troubling reports from North Korea. Satellite images from last month, published by the New York Times, showwhat looks like a new nuclear reactor ready to go online,external. The newspaper claims it could produce 20kg of weapons-grade plutonium each year. Meanwhile, US and South Korean troops are gearing up for annual military drills which the North has historically seen as provocation. They start on Monday. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter, BBC News Mr Trump is planning for a win: successful negotiations with Mr Kim over his nuclear programme. Behind the scenes, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and others are trying to exude confidence about what they will be able to achieve at the summit. In a candid conversation with me and other visitors to his office recently, Mr Kelly described their high expectations for the meeting and their hopes for the future. Meanwhile, the CIA director is visiting the Pentagon to discuss the matter, and US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis is coming up with contingency plans. Details for the summit are still being worked out: the president likes to keep people guessing about how he'll negotiate and where his red lines are, and his meeting with Mr Kim is no exception. Mr Kelly and the other aides have several weeks - or perhaps a bit longer if it's delayed - to finalise things. As they're keenly aware, the countdown has begun. Mr Kim arrived with his wife, Ri Sol-ju, by train on Sunday and left Beijing on Tuesday afternoon, according to reports. The North Korean leader said the ""issue of denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved"" if the US and South Korea respond ""with goodwill"", Xinhua reported. Why Xi's the one Kim still needs to see Reading the moves - what our correspondents make of the visit The North's conditions include the removal of a US nuclear guarantee for South Korea, observers say. North Korea's KCNA news agency called the visit ""a milestone"" in improving bilateral ties. Rumours of the visit surfaced in the media earlier this week Mr Kim's arrival and departure were shrouded in secrecy. China said the visit was ""unofficial"" - so there was no announcement of it in advance, promptingspeculation about who was on the trainwhen it was spotted arriving. It is the latest in a flurry of diplomatic activity since the start of the year sparked by the Winter Olympics in South Korea. North Korea crisis in 300 words US-N Korea talks: What could happen now? Profile: Kim Jong-un Relations between North Korea and China, historically strong, had been deteriorating, with China backing US moves to tighten international sanctions in response to the North's growing nuclear threat.

Who is the former Russian colonel?,"Col Skripal was convicted of ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by Moscow's military court in August 2006 Sergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was sentenced in 2006 to 13 years in prison, accused of spying for Britain. He was convicted, and later pardoned, for passing the identities of Russian secret agents in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Russia claimed MI6 had paid him $100,000 for the information, which he had been supplying since the 1990s. But he was one of four prisoners Moscow swapped for spies in the US in 2010. Col Skripal was later flown to the UK. He is now 66. He was found on 4 March slumped on a shopping centre bench in Salisbury, alongside his unconscious 33-year-old daughter Yulia Skripal. British experts say a military-grade nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union was used to poison them. It is in a class of extremely dangerous secret toxins known as Novichok, they say. This video can not be played Viktoria Skripal, the niece of the poisoned Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, told the BBC she hopes a miracle will happen. Col Skripal was well regarded during his career in Russia's military intelligence (GRU). A colleague called him ""the life and soul of the party"" and added: ""All his colleagues respected him. So when he was arrested for spying, it was a real shock."" He was arrested near his home in 2004 and convicted two years later of ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by Moscow's military court. He was stripped of all his titles and awards. Sergei Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 He was alleged by the Russian security service (FSB) to have been recruited by the British secret services in 1995 while serving in the army. He exchanged information classified as Russian state secrets with MI6 for money that was transferred to a Spanish bank account, the FSB claimed. The data on ""several dozen"" Russian undercover operatives, according to pro-Kremlin daily Izvestiya, was eventually used to put FSB agents under surveillance and then expel them from multiple European countries. Even after his retirement in 1999, the FSB claimed Col Skripal continued to pass on state secrets. Col Skripal pleaded guilty at his trial and allegedly confessed while co-operating with investigators, reports said at the time. Russian media gave a lot of air time to Col Skripal's trial and sentencing. They said 13 years was a light sentence considering the ""substantial damage"" he had caused to Russian intelligence services. The daily newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said that in Soviet times he would have been shot. Read more on Col Skripal's intelligence career Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club In July 2010, Col Skripal was pardoned by Russia's then-President Dmitry Medvedev. He was later released together with three other individualsserving time in Russian prisons in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. Among those released by the US was Anna Chapman, who had previously lived in the UK and gained citizenship. Anna Chapman became a presenter on Russian TV Dubbed by the media as ""Russia's most glamorous secret agent"", she went on to present a weekly show on Russian TV. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal was given refuge in the UK, where he kept a low profile for eight years. His wife Liudmila died of cancer in 2012, a year after they had bought a semi-detached home in Salisbury. The Skripals had chosen the Wiltshire city because they believed it to be a good area with a low crime rate, family friends told the BBC. Two years ago, Col Skripal's older brother died in Russia, and last year, his 43-year-old son Alexander died while on holiday with his girlfriend in the Russian city of St Petersburg. He had been rushed to hospital with liver failure. Family members were suspicious at the time. But Alexander's aunt Viktoria says he had a longstanding alcohol problem. She says he took his father's spying conviction very badly and began drinking - a habit that wrecked his first marriage. Col Skripal's family strongly deny that he was an agent of MI6, insisting he was a patriot and that the case against him was fabricated. Col Skripal's mother lives in Yaroslavl, north-east of Moscow, with Viktoria and her family.

Yulia was visiting from Moscow. She had increased her visits to her father after her brother's death last July. Father and daughter had visited the two graves before they collapsed. Yulia lived with her parents and brother in Salisbury after 2010 for several years before returning to the Russian capital because she reportedly missed it. A talented linguist, Yulia studied English and geography at a Moscow university. She and her brother were able to travel freely between the UK and Russia, despite their exiled father's situation. Since settling in Salisbury after the spy swap in 2010, Col Skripal appeared to be leading a relaxed and quiet life although he reportedly went on frequent business trips, the BBC's World Affairs Correspondent Richard Galpin said. Col Skripal reportedly kept the company of British intelligence agents and was a member of Salisbury's Railway Social Club. Valery Morozov, another Russian exile living in the UK, said Col Skripal told him he had been doing business, ""working mainly in cyber-security"". Mr Morozov said: ""I understand he was working for some Russian groups."" Col Skripal last called his mother, who is very ill, in mid-February. He reportedly sounded optimistic, though his family say that after the 2010 spy swap, he was always very vigilant because he believed the Russian special services could come after him at any time.

Analysis: The legal implications,"The High Court described it as unique: A ""difficult, troubling case with many exceptional features"". But the conclusions from this successful judicial review of the Parole Board's decision to release John Worboys will echo across Parliament and the courts for months and years to come, as well as forcing their way into countless legal textbooks. The most immediate implication is that Worboys - a convicted rapist and serial sex attacker - will remain behind bars pending a new Parole Board hearing. It is not possible to challenge the decision of the independent parole panel, but the judges have the power to demand they look again at the matter because the process was not conducted properly on ""public law grounds"". The High Court ruled that the Parole Board didn't do its job properly. A dossier on Worboys was missing some key documents but, even so, the panel ""should have undertaken further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending"". In other words, they were too trusting of a man known to be manipulative and dangerous. Their job was to assess risk, to decide if it was safe for the public to release him. But by failing to ask him about the numerous allegations which were never taken to court, they missed an opportunity to test whether Worboys was the ""open and honest"" character he claimed to be. Worboys review: What we have learned?d Worboys victim: 'Police assumed I was some drunk' Parole Board chairman's resignation letter Cabbie who preyed on young women Despite references in the dossier to ""80-plus potential victims"", the panel did not take this into account. Worboys was convicted on 19 offences, including rape and sexual assault, against 12 victims. But the panel was entitled - indeed, duty bound in this case - to assess the risk Worboys posed by asking him about the catalogue of unproven allegations made against him. This is a change in approach that will have consequences in some other cases. The judges made clear that ""it is not the role of the Parole Board to determine the prisoner's guilt in relation to matters where no such finding has been made by a criminal court"", but the fact an allegation has not resulted in a conviction should not bar the panel from considering it in deciding whether it is safe to release a prisoner. This video can not be played Victim: 'The police assumed I was some drunk' New guidance will be issued making it clear that relevant past offending should be included in the dossiers submitted to the Parole Board, and that it can and should be considered as part of the hearing. In prominent and complex cases, the High Court judges said, it might be sensible to have a judge or retired judge chair the panel - a clear criticism of the Parole Board's performance in the Worboys case, but also a suggestion that the system isn't good enough. The case also sees the end of Rule 25 that forbids the Parole Board from making public the details of their decisions. The Ministry of Justice has announced it will now review all the rules governing the board and that summaries of decisions will be made available to victims in those cases. This will need to be treated with some care because the reason for the rule in the first place was to prevent decisions on parole becoming the subject of political or press campaigns. The extent to which the wider public will be able to see and challenge the decision making of the board remains an open question. In the House of Commons, the former Lord Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said ""criminal sentencing should never be a question of campaigning and responding to popular pressure"", adding that ""it would be a very bad day if ministers started intervening in criminal justice cases and did not judge them objectively"". The High Court, however, said Rule 25 was unlawful because its blanket ban contravened the principle of open justice. They thought it would be quite possible to ""reformulate"" the rule so that it still preserves the fundamental rights of the prisoner but gives victims an understanding of the reasons behind a parole decision. The resignation of Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick was welcomed by some MPs this afternoon, but others suggested he had been made a scapegoat for the failings of the government. The Justice Secretary David Gauke was ultimately responsible for the faulty dossier that was used by the Parole Board.  The High Court noted that that did not include vital information including details of the ""rape kit"" Worboys kept in the boot of his cab, the remarks of the sentencing judge at his trial and new information that emerged when victims took legal action against the Metropolitan Police. Police found a 'rape kit' with contraceptives and drugs in the cab where Worboys drugged and sexually assaulted female passengers Pressed on this point in the Commons, Mr Gauke accepted that his department had failed to include all the information but noted that it was ""for the Parole Board to satisfy themselves that an offender is no longer a risk to the public"". The Justice Secretary was also criticised for his decision not to pursue a Judicial Review himself, on the basis of legal advice that there was ""no reasonable prospect of success"". Mr Gauke said he had concluded the ""victims were in a better position"" than he was to seek a review. Kenneth Clarke supported his party colleague in deciding not to pursue a challenge, arguing that ""it would have been absolutely scandalous to ignore the legal advice"" he had received.  Others suggest that, having briefed newspapers that he was considering a challenge, to then not pursue one and potentially allow Worboy's release showed poor judgment. This case has shone a light on the workings of the Parole Board and found it wanting. The hard part will be in devising a new system that is more transparent and more robust but does not threaten the independence of the vital work it does.

Resignation letter in full,"This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke says there were serious failings in the case Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick's resignation letter, dated 27 March, to Justice Secretary David Gauke, in full. Dear Secretary of State, We met this afternoon to consider the implications of the judgment in the Worboys' case. I want to repeat my admiration for the courage and tenacity of the women who brought the judicial review.  Their success will have consequences that go far beyond this individual case and will benefit victims and the administration of justice for years to come. I am very pleased that the court declared the Rule that prohibits the Parole Board from explaining its decisions should go and that the judgment recognised that this was something I had been calling for. I am pleased too that as a result of Dame Glenys Stacy's investigation into victim communication in the case, these processes will be improved in future and that she made no criticism of the Parole Board's actions in this matter. I am also confident that as a result of this case a much simpler system for reviewing Parole Board decisions will be established and, as I have already made clear in my submission to you, this is something I would very much welcome. Consistent with these principles, I have been clear throughout the legal processes that followed the decision in the Worboys' case that I welcomed the scrutiny to which it was subject. I instructed that there should be no procedural moves to prevent such scrutiny, as the judgment indicated could have been made, and that our disclosure of material relating to the case should be as full as possible. I am as anxious as everyone else that the correct decision should be made. The court was critical of some aspects of the panel's decision-making processes although it did not overturn the panel's decisions on these grounds. It could not, no more than you or I, put itself in the place of the expert and experienced panel members who heard the evidence and made the decision. The court did however find that the panel's understanding that it could not go beyond the offences for which Worboys was convicted was mistaken in this ""difficult, troubling case with many exceptional features"". I shared the panel's misapprehension in this matter and this was supported by the advice I received. We were wrong. You told me that you thought my position was untenable. I had no role in the decision of the panel in the case and believe I am capable of leading the Parole Board through the changes, many of which I have advocated, that will now be necessary. I am sorry for the mistakes that were made in this case but I have always made it clear that I will support the members and staff of the Board in the very difficult individual decisions they make and I will accept accountability for the work of the Board. I will not pass the buck to those who work under me.  In these circumstances I inform you of my decision to resign with immediate effect. In conclusion, I want to state my concern about the independence of the Board. I believe this matter raises very troubling questions about how the Board's independence can be safeguarded. I hope Parliament will consider what structural changes are necessary to ensure this independence is protected in future.

Smith and Warner banned for a year,"This video can not be played Cricket Australia CEO admits players cheated Australia captain Steve Smith and vice-skipper David Warner have been banned for a year forball-tampering. Cameron Bancroft, who carried out the cheating in South Africa, was given a nine-month ban by Cricket Australia. The three had already been sent home from Australia's tour - before a fourth Test begins on Friday - amid widespread condemnation stretching beyond sport. Australia's prime minister Malcolm Turnbull had said the affair ""bitterly disappointed the whole nation"". Smith, 28, and Bancroft, 25, have also been suspended from captaining Australia for at least the next two years. Warner, 31, will not be considered for ""any team leadership positions in the future"", Cricket Australia said. Vaughan suspects Australia were ball-tampering during Ashes Ball-tampering & why it is so serious for Australia How do you tamper with a cricket ball? Cricket Australia's investigation also confirmed Bancroft used sandpaper to damage the ball during the third Test against South Africa. It found Smith and Bancroft had made ""misleading public comments"" when on Saturday they instead claimed it had actually been yellow tape. Cricket Australia had already concluded that coach Darren Lehmann was not involved in the controversy and he will remain in his post. The body's chief executive James Sutherland said the three players were ""sad, disappointed and remorseful"". He added: ""This has caused damage to the game as a whole and certainly to Cricket Australia. It has compromised the fans' faith in cricket and it's our responsibility to reinstate that confidence. ""It appears to be an isolated incident but if there are other allegations we will take them further. There was some courage in owning up but there was an element of untruth and that's something we took into consideration."" Smith, Warner and Bancroft are banned from international and Australian domestic cricket. They will also serve 100 hours of ""voluntary service in community cricket"" and can appeal against the suspension. Cricket Australia said the players would be ""permitted to play [Australian] club cricket and will be encouraged to do so"". They also remain eligible for competition outside of Australia, but earlier on Wednesday Smith and Warner were also banned from this season's Indian Premier League. In January the pair were signed to the most lucrative Twenty20 contracts ever offered to an Australian player - reportedly worth over Â£1m each. Before Wednesday's IPL ban, Warner stepped down as captain of Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad. Smith stood down as captain of Rajasthan Royals on Monday. IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla said: ""The players that they [Cricket Australia] have banned, we are also barring those two players from this season. ""The franchises will get replacements for the players."" Bancroft is due to play for Somerset this season. On Monday Somerset said they would wait and ""collate all the relevant information before considering our next steps"". This video can not be played Watch: Bancroft and Smith admit ball-tampering plan After Bancroft's actions were exposed on Saturday, Smith admitted that the Aussie ""leadership group"" had devised a plan to tamper with the ball. Images showed Bancroft take an item out of his trouser pocket before rubbing the ball with it. After the game, Smith described the events as a ""big mistake"" but added he would not stand down as captain. Following the conclusion of the third Test - South Africa won by 322 runs after an Australian batting collapse - the International Cricket Council (ICC) banned Smith for one match and fined him his entire match fee. Bancroft was fined 75% of his match fee and given three demerit points, while Warner was not punished. Having begun its own investigation after the match, Cricket Australia told reporters on Tuesday that it would look to sanction the players - in addition to the punishments by the ICC. Australian cricket commentator Jim Maxwell told BBC Radio 5 live his understanding was that after lunch, Smith saw Bancroft and Warner in ""collusion"". Maxwell said Smith had said to the pair: ""What are you blokes doing? I don't want to know what you're doing"", before then going out onto the field. Cricket Australia saidSmith: knew of a potential plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball failed to take steps to seek to prevent the development and implementation of that plan directed that evidence of attempted tampering be concealed on the field of play sought to mislead match officials and others regarding Bancroft's attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball made misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent and participants of the plan The body saidWarner: developed a plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball instructed a junior player to carry out a plan to take steps to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper provided advice to a junior player regarding how a ball could be artificially altered including demonstrating how it could be done failed to take steps to seek to prevent the development and/or implementation of the plan failed to report his knowledge of the plan at any time prior to or during the match misled match officials through the concealment of his knowledge of and involvement in the plan failed to voluntarily report his knowledge of the plan after the match It foundBancroft: knew of the existence of, and was being party to, the plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper carried out instructions to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball sought to conceal evidence of his attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball sought to mislead match officials and others regarding his attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball made misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent, implementation and participants of the plan Several former players have raised concerns over the position of coach Lehmann. He was spotted in communication via walkie-talkie with the 12th man during the match against South Africa, leading to some to speculate he had been involved in a plan to cheat. Former coach John Buchanan said it would have been ""highly unusual"" for Lehmann not to be aware of his players' plans. However, Sutherland said Lehmann had been using the walkie-talkie to ask ""what was going on?"" and Cricket Australia was ""satisfied he wasn't involved"". ""I want to make that point very clear. Darren is the coach. He continues as coach under his current contract,"" Sutherland added. ""It appears to be an isolated incident but if there are other allegations we will take them further."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan had said he was ""pretty sure"" Australia were tampering with the ball during England's 4-0 Ashes series defeat. The ICC has said it willnot be investigatingthose claims, as the deadline for reporting any such offence has passed. However, it is expected to discuss Australia's ball-tampering against South Africa at its next board meeting at the end of April. Sutherland said while the South Africa incident ""does appear to be isolated"", Cricket Australia had the powers to investigate should further credible allegations arise. The players involved could also suffer financial losses as sponsors seek to distance themselves from the matter - South Korean electronics company LG has already decided not to renew a sponsorship deal with Warner. Sutherland had on Tuesday been reluctant to use the word 'cheating' when Cricket Australia announced that Warner, Smith and Bancroft would be sent home. Despite being asked twice directly whether they had cheated or not, he instead said: ""In the laws of the game, this is not in the spirit of the game. It is not a good day for Australian cricket."" On Wednesday he was asked the same question and replied: ""I think people want to use their own words but certainly cheating is one of those that would be appropriate. ""It's compromised the fans' faith in cricket."" This video can not be played Michael Vaughan - 'Australian team will be remembered for cheating' Smith has been Australia's dominant player in recent years. In his 64 Test matches, he has scored 6,199 runs and made 23 centuries. Named Test captain in 2015, he scored 687 runs as he steered his side to the recent 4-0 Ashes victory over England on home soil, leading to him being compared to legendary batsmanSir Donald Bradman. Warner has been a more controversial figure. He was suspended for the majority of the 2013 Champions Trophy after punching England batsman Joe Root in a bar in Birmingham. The left-hander was nicknamed 'The Bull' when he began his career but his team-mates begancalling him 'The Reverend',externalafter he gave up alcohol. He was named vice-captain when Smith took over from Michael Clarke, and led Australia in Smith's absence in the recent Twenty20 tri-series against England and New Zealand. Warner has a Test average of 48.20 after compiling 6,363 runs in 74 Tests. He wasfined after the first Testagainst South Africa for an altercation with Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. Australia's schedule from the end of June has not been confirmed. But all three players will miss the fourth Test against South Africa, which begins on Friday, and five ODIs and one Twenty20 on a mini tour of England this summer when the limited-overs series begins on 13 June. Under the ICC'sFuture Tours Programme,external, which sets out when countries play one another, Australia could play India, South Africa and Sri Lanka in the period between October 2018 and January 2019. They will all be eligible to play in the 2019 Cricket World Cup, which takes place in England and Wales from 30 May to 14 July.

Ecuador cuts Assange's embassy internetEcuador says the move is to prevent the WikiLeaks founder from interfering in other countries' affairs.24m24 minutes agoEurope,"Mr Assange has been holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy since 2012 Ecuador has cut Julian Assange's internet connection at its embassy in London, preventing him from communicating with the outside world. The move is to prevent the WikiLeaks founder from interfering in other countries' affairs, Ecuador said. It comes after Mr Assange questioned accusations that Moscow was responsible for the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in the UK on 4 March. Mr Assange was granted political asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in 2012. He was initially staying in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sex crimes, which the 46-year-old has always denied. The Swedish authorities have since dropped their investigation, but Mr Assange believes he will be extradited to the US for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks if he leaves the building. Campaigner or attention-seeker?

Ecuador cuts Assange's embassy internetEcuador says the move is to prevent the WikiLeaks founder from interfering in other countries' affairs.18m18 minutes agoEurope,"Mr Assange has been holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy since 2012 Ecuador has cut Julian Assange's internet connection at its embassy in London, preventing him from communicating with the outside world. The move is to prevent the WikiLeaks founder from interfering in other countries' affairs, Ecuador said. It comes after Mr Assange questioned accusations that Moscow was responsible for the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in the UK on 4 March. Mr Assange was granted political asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in 2012. He was initially staying in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sex crimes, which the 46-year-old has always denied. The Swedish authorities have since dropped their investigation, but Mr Assange believes he will be extradited to the US for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks if he leaves the building.

Ulster rugby pair cleared of rape,"Both Stuart Olding and Paddy Jackson were found not guilty in unanimous verdicts Ireland and Ulster rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have been cleared of rape. They both denied raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Blane McIlroy, who was accused of exposure, and Rory Harrison, who was charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information, were also found not guilty. The verdicts came in the ninth week of the trial. Rugby rape trial: Live reporting on the verdicts Timeline of events in rugby rape trial The main figures in the rugby rape trial Trial that played out beyond court Mr Jackson was also cleared of a charge of sexual assault. The jury of eight men and three women deliberated for three hours and 45 minutes before delivering their unanimous verdicts. Before discharging the 11-person jury, Judge Patricia Smyth told them: ""This has probably been the most difficult trial that any jury in Northern Ireland has ever been asked to adjudicate on."" This video can not be played Jackson's status 'influenced prosecution' The incident at the centre of the case was alleged to have happened after the four accused and four women went to Mr Jackson's home in south Belfast from a club in the city centre. The woman told the court she was attacked after going upstairs to retrieve a clutch bag as she was preparing to leave the house. The woman claimed Mr Jackson had followed her into the bedroom and pushed her onto the bed. She then claimed she was raped. However, the accused said that all sexual activity was consensual. Outside the courthouse, Mr Jackson thanked the judge and jury for ""giving him a fair trial"" as well as his family and legal team. His solicitor, Joe McVeigh, hit out at the investigation into Mr Jackson. ""It's our belief that the investigation has been characterised by the turning of a blind eye to inadequacies in the evidence of the complainant combined with the very apparent investigative bias,"" he said. This video can not be played Timeline of events leading up to the trial He added: ""The prosecution made much of a perceived privileged position provided by virtue of Paddy being an international rugby player. ""We say that it was this very status as a famous sportsman that drove the decision to prosecute in the first place."" Mr McVeigh also said ""real concerns about the integrity of the trial process"" had been raised by ""vile commentary expressed on social media, going well beyond fair comment"". ""Several days of this trial were lost due to problems thrown up by the intrusive infection of the process by social media,"" he said. ""All the lawyers have been distracted by having to man the barriers against a flood of misinformed, misconceived and malicious content on the internet, particularly during the last phase of this trial and, worryingly, even at the hands of public servants who should have known better."" by Mark Simpson, BBC News NI There was no reaction from the four defendants in the dock as the verdicts were announced. This video can not be played Paddy Jackson thanks jury, family and friends outside the court They simply stood and stared in front of them as, one by one, the not guilty verdicts were read out by the chairperson of the jury. A number of their friends and family were in tears in the public gallery. A crowd of reporters gathered outside Laganside courthouse following the verdicts Outside Court 12, Paddy Jackson hugged members of his legal team, as well as friends and family. Relatives of all the four accused attended every day of the 42-day trial. The case was only scheduled to last five weeks. In the end, it went on for eight-and-a-half weeks. In a statement read out by his solicitor, Mr Olding said:  ""I want to acknowledge publicly that though I committed no criminal offence on the evening of the 28th of June 2016, I regret deeply the events of that evening."" He said he was sorry for the hurt that was caused to the complainant. ""It was never my intention to cause any upset to anyone on that night,"" he said. ""I don't agree with her perception of events and I maintain that everything that happened that evening was consensual. ""I have consistently told the truth to the police and the court when asked to account for my conduct."" Blane McIlroy made no comment as he left with his parents and legal team. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) defended the decision to take the case to court. This video can not be played Who is Paddy Jackson? In a statement, Marianne O'Kane, assistant director of the PPS's serious crime unit, said: ""The evidence received in this case was subjected to a very thorough and careful examination by a team of experienced lawyers including senior counsel, before we concluded that the test for prosecution was met, in line with our code for prosecutors. ""This meant that there was both sufficient evidence to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and it was in the public interest to prosecute. ""This case was properly brought before the courts and overcame a number of legal challenges.  It was ultimately right that the matter was placed before a jury to make their determination."" The senior investigating officer in the case, Det Ch Insp Zoe McKee, said she had spoken to the complainant following the verdicts: ""Understandably, she is upset and disappointed with the outcome."" She said the case was ""thoroughly and robustly investigated. We pursued all lines of investigative inquiry, we brought all of the evidence together, we worked in close collaboration with the Public Prosecution Service from the start"". Her colleague, Det Ch Supt Paula Hillman added: ""I am satisfied that this was a very thorough investigation carried out with professionalism and integrity."" In a joint statement, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby said it had ""undoubtedly been a difficult and extremely traumatic time for all involved"". This video can not be played Who is Stuart Olding? They added that an internal review had been postponed pending the end of judicial proceedings and that a review committee has been appointed and ""will conclude its review as soon as practicable"". ""The players will continue to be relieved of all duties while the review committee is in process and determining its findings."" The verdicts came at the end of a 42-day trial. The 12-person jury which started hearing the case was later reduced to 11 after a juror took ill. In total, 30 witnesses gave evidence, including 10 police officers, the four defendants, the alleged victim and the taxi driver who drove her home on the night in question. The court sat on weekdays, but, to try to make up lost time, there was one Saturday sitting. Blane McIlroy denied one count of exposure Some hearings in the eight-and-a-half week trial were taken up with legal arguments, in the absence of the jury. On the second week of the trial, the jury was taken to see the layout of Paddy Jackson's house. All the other proceedings have taken place in Court 12 at Laganside courts complex. On most days, the 100-seat public gallery has been full. Paddy Jackson, 26, from Oakleigh Park, Belfast, and his Ireland and Ulster teammate Stuart Olding, 25, of Ardenlee Street in the city, denied raping the same woman at a house in south Belfast in June 2016. Rory Harrison denied charges of perverting the course of justice and withholding information Mr Jackson denied a further charge of sexual assault. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, denied exposure while Rory Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, denied perverting the course of justice and withholding information.

Facebook revamps its privacy controls,"Facebook says the redesigned privacy tools will be easier to use Facebook says an overhaul of its privacy tools will make it easier for people to find and edit the personal information the company holds. Details of the changes wereannounced in a blog,external. They follow intense criticism of the firm after it emerged that data about 50 million users had been harvested and passed on to a political consultancy. However, Facebook says the revamp was already planned ahead of the scandal in order to comply with new EU rules. The announcement coincides with a fresh dispute with New Zealand's privacy watchdog, which has accused Facebook of being in breach of local laws. If I've got your number, so has Facebook Zuckerberg's snub to MPs 'astonishing' Facebook faces US privacy inquiry Is leaving Facebook the only way to protect your data? Facebook's chief privacy officer acknowledged the damage which the Cambridge Analytica revelations had caused her company, at the start of her blog. ""The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,"" wrote Erin Egan. ""We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed."" The existing mobile settings menu, seen on the left, has been redesigned to look like the image on the right The changes fall into three broad categories: a ""simplified"" settings menu. At present mobile users face a list of about 17 different options, each of which is marked by short title. The new version regroups the controls and adds descriptions in an effort to make it clearer what each involves a new privacy shortcuts menu. The dashboard brings together what the firm believes are the most critical controls into a single place. It suggests this will make it faster for people to do things such as review the posts they have shared or reacted to, and to limit the information used to target ads at them revised data download and edit tools. A new page called Access Your Information allows users to review past interactions with the site - including the things they have ""liked"" and the comments they have posted - with the option to make deletions. In addition, members will be able to download specific categories of data - including their photos - from a selected time range, rather than only being able to export a single large file that might take hours to obtain Although it is not mentioned in the blog, the BBC understands the firm also intends to make the link to fully delete an account more prominent. A new Access Your Information page lets users search through their past activity by topic The action precedes the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),which comes into force on 25 May,external. The new law toughens the requirements on how organisations handle the public's data, as well as imposing harsher penalties for breaches. Facebook insists this move - to give people greater visibility of their privacy settings and an easier way to delete data - has been in the works for months, but the company knows how urgent this has become. ""Facebook recognises it's clearly lost people's trust and it needs to get to work on regaining that,"" Stephen Deadman, its global deputy chief privacy officer told me. Now this sounds like a useful update to what any user will tell you is a very confusing system. Try to find how to stop your phone from uploading its contacts to Facebook, for instance, and you will go on a long and complex journey. But you will still need to do a lot of clicking before you can find out whether that quiz you filled in last week has told Facebook and your supermarket that you are pregnant. The question is whether the social network should be more proactive in warning people about the data they are sharing - perhaps sending an alert to all those people who are almost certainly unaware that they are still uploading their phone contacts to the company. ""You're in control of privacy and security on Facebook"" is the message on the new one-stop shop - but maybe busy users just do not have the time to take back control without a lot more nudging. Close to $80bn (Â£56bn) has been wiped offFacebook's market value since 16 March, when it revealed it had received reports that Cambridge Analytica had not destroyed data about millions of its US members, as demanded several years previously. The UK-based consultancy has denied using the data to aid President Trump's election campaign and claims it had deleted the information. However, the British company suspended its chief executivefollowing other allegations. Cambridge Analytica's Alexander Nix has been suspended from his firm Since then, Facebook's privacy practices have come under fresh scrutiny. New Zealand's privacy commissioner is the latest to have voiced criticism, accusing the firm of breaking the law by refusing to provide data about a dispute involving one of its citizens. The man involved had wanted access to information about what others had written about him. ""The social media company said the Privacy Act did not apply to it and it did not have to comply with the commissioner's request to review the information requested by the complainant,""the watchdog said in a statement,external. Facebook has responded saying: ""We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year's worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy."" Other recent developments include: Media group Playboy Enterpriseshas deleted its Facebook accounts,externalciting privacy concerns. The comedian Will Ferrellhas said he will,externaldo likewise three US-based users have sued Facebook over claims its collection of their call logs and text messages had violated their privacy the firm has delayed the launch of its own voice-controlled smart speaker, according to the Bloomberg news agency.

Man has 'world's worst' super-gonorrhoeaIt is the first ever case that is resistant to the main antibiotic treatment.11m11 minutes agoHealth,"A man in the UK has caught the world's ""worst-ever"" case of super-gonorrhoea. He had a regular partner in the UK, but picked up the superbug after a sexual encounter with a woman in South East Asia. Public Health England says it is the first time the infection cannot be cured with first choice antibiotics. Health officials are now tracing any other sexual partners of the man, who has not been identified, in an attempt to contain the infection's spread. He picked up the infection earlier in the year. The main antibiotic treatment - a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone - has failed to treat the disease. Dr Gwenda Hughes, from Public Health England, said: ""This is the first time a case has displayed such high-level resistance to both of these drugs and to most other commonly used antibiotics."" Discussions with the World Health Organization and the European Centres for Disease Control agree this is a world first. The disease is caused by the bacterium calledNeisseria gonorrhoeae. The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Of those infected, about one in 10 heterosexual men and more than three-quarters of women, and gay men, have no easily recognisable symptoms. But symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods. Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy. Analysis of the man's infection suggests one last antibiotic could work. He is currently being treated and doctors will see if it has been successful next month. So far no other cases - including in the British partner - have been discovered, but the investigation is still under way. Dr Hughes added: ""We are following up this case to ensure that the infection was effectively treated with other options and the risk of any onward transmission is minimised."" Doctors have long been warning this could happen. In 2015,there was an outbreak of azithromycin-resistant gonorrhoea centred on Leeds. The fear is the bug could eventually become untreatable by any antibiotic. Teen hits lottery jackpot on 18th birthday Mum's tough love lesson divides parents Ask the French: Are they really rude? Dr Olwen Williams, the president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said: ""The emergence of this new strain of highly resistant gonorrhoea is of huge concern and is a significant development. ""We are concerned that the problem will worsen due to the dramatic cuts that have been delivered to the public health budget. ""Worryingly this has left sexual health services at 'tipping point', with clinic closures coming at the worst possible time."" Follow James on Twitter,external.

Shoppers to pay plastic bottle deposit,"This video can not be played How Norway is tackling the problem of plastic waste People in England will soon have to pay a deposit when they buy drinks bottles and cans in a bid to boost recycling and cut waste. The deposit will increase prices - but consumers will get the money back if they return the container. The scheme is expected to cover single-use glass and plastic bottles, and steel and aluminium cans. Full details are subject to consultation and yet to be decided, including how big the deposit will be. But costs in similar schemes elsewhere range from 22p in Germany and 8p in Sweden. The government announcement comes after the Blue Planet II series highlightedthe threat of ocean pollutionand showed footage of wildlife eating plastic. Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Five ways to break up with plastic UK faces build-up of plastic waste Deposit return scheme: Who would pay? Environment Secretary Michael Gove said there was no doubt that plastic was ""wreaking havoc"" on the marine environment and discarded plastic bottles and cans ""end up dumped on pavements and lobbed into rivers, lakes and the sea"". ""We have already banned harmful microbeads and cut plastic bag use, and now we want to take action on plastic bottles to help clean up our oceans,"" he said. ""We need to see a change in attitudes and behaviour. And the evidence shows that reward and return schemes are a powerful agent of change."" This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic UK consumers use around 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year but more than three billion are not recycled. Scotlandhas already announced plans for a deposit return scheme,externaland in Wales, ministers said they want to helpimplement a UK-wide system. Northern Ireland will consider the approach as part of a review later this year. Similar schemes in northern Europe have led to a big increase in the amount of plastic recycled. About 40 countries worldwide  - including Germany, Sweden and Israel - and 21 US states have some kind of deposit return scheme for plastic bottles. The schemes take different forms in different countries. Most involve returning bottles to an automated collection point or to the shop from which they were purchased. What happens to the money from unredeemed deposits, when people don't return a bottle to a collection point, also varies. In some countries it is kept by the producer or retailer while in others the money is donated to charity or returned to a centralised operator of the system, which normally ploughs that money back into running the scheme. The German system is estimated to have cost about Â£600m (726m euros) as an initial set up, and about Â£700m (793m euros) annually for maintenance. There the cost is borne by the retailer but in other countries unclaimed deposits pay for it. The British Plastics Federation estimates it could cost Â£1bn to set up a scheme in the UK, and another Â£1bn a year in running costs. The announcement has been welcomed by environmental campaigners, but industry may be worried about the price tag. It may be asked to pick up the bill for the deposit return scheme. Currently plastics producers pay just 10% of the cost of recycling packaging. Councils will also be anxious to ensure that kerbside collecting is not undercut when details are confirmed. Ministers have visited deposit return schemes in several north European nations. Theywere impressed by a Norwegian scheme, which claims a 94% recycling rate for bottles made from PET, the clear plastic used for water and fizzy drinks. The entire scheme in Norway was set up by the beverage industry after the government slapped a tax on every un-recycled bottle. The drinks industry has installed machines in shops that take in used bottles and cans and give back a coupon to return the deposit. Mr Gove saidthe 5p levy put on plastic bagsproved how effectively the UK could respond as consumption of single-use carrier bags was down 83%. He said it was vital to act, pointing to two reports last week. One saidplastic pollution in the sea would treble in a decade unless marine litter is curbed. The other warned thatthe Great Pacific Garbage Patch- an artificial island of plastic material twice the size of France - is thought to contain 79,000 tonnes of floating waste - that is up to 16 times more plastic and microplastic particles than previously estimated. Samantha Harding, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ""This is a brilliant and significant decision by Michael Gove. ""I am thrilled that we will finally see the many benefits a deposit system will bring to England, not least the absence of ugly drinks containers in our beautiful countryside. ""What's significant is that producers will now pay the full costs of their packaging, reducing the burden on the taxpayer and setting a strong precedent for other schemes where the polluter pays."" The British Retail Consortium welcomed the idea but added it wanted costs to be proportionate to the size of the retailer. Its director of food and sustainability, Andrew Opie, said a ""more coordinated, comprehensive approach"" focusing on manufacturer responsibility was needed to tackle plastic packaging in general. However, the British Plastics Federation says convenience is key to the scheme's success and retailers could face costs of tens of thousands of pounds. Director Barry Turner told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money: ""Part of the problem with the fact that people do not dispose of containers in the right way is that there's not a convenient infrastructure to do that so there are going to have to be a lot of them and they're going to have to be conveniently located. ""I think that's one of the big challenges."" Supermarket Tesco says this is ""only one aspect"" of helping to reduce waste in the UK.

Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said he was confident Gen Carter would be an ""outstanding Chief of Defence Staff at a crucial time for defence... in the face of intensifying threats"". Gen Carter joined the Royal Green Jackets (now The Rifles) in 1978. He has served as a soldier in Northern Ireland, Germany, Kosovo, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2002, he was the director of plans for a US-led taskforce in Afghanistan. The following year, he was involved in planning the invasion of Iraq. He would be the first to admit that those wars did not go according to plan. Gen Carter was also instrumental in rethinking military strategy. He was one of the brains behind Provincial Reconstruction Teams, which were used in Iraq and then Afghanistan. The PRT teams were designed to win hearts and minds of locals by building hospitals and schools - a shift from just relying on brute military force to defeat an insurgency. UK military credibility 'at risk' over cuts UK 'must prepare for Russia fight' Throughout his career, Gen Carter returned to Afghanistan - first as the commander of US and UK forces in the south and then as the deputy commander of the Nato mission. He has been a strong believer in long-term military commitment, and has been an advocate of getting involved in fragile states before they descend into violence - known as defence engagement with small teams of British troops. But his time in Afghanistan also brought criticism. One US general accused him of being ""risk-averse"". The reality is he was often exposed to danger visiting troops on the frontline. Other US officers were quick to speak out in Gen Carter's defence. US General Ben Hodges said he was ""appalled"" by the criticism. Even his enemies could never question his commitment or capacity for hard work. Those qualities, and what some friends call ""a touch of genius"", helped him to rise up the ranks. Gen Carter became head of the Army in 2014. In that role, he pushed through radical reform. After becoming the head of the Army in 2014, Gen Carter (second to left) pushed to fight against what he called ""intensifying threats"" He restructured the Army and fought hard for resources in the face of what he himself has highlighted as ""intensifying threats"". At the start of this year, Gen Carter made a public speech in which he warned of the dangers of a more aggressive Russia. He was one of the first senior officers sent ""over the top"" by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to make the case for more money for defence. In the Commons on Wednesday the prime minister announced more money for the MoD, hailed by defence sources as a ""stunning win"" for the defence secretary. There will be an extra Â£600m over the next financial year to pay for four new Dreadnought nuclear submarines, which will come out of a contingency fund. And there will also be a further Â£200m made available coming from an ""underspend"" in other government departments. Sources close to the defence secretary say the extra cash will help avoid defence cuts in the next financial year. One official said it was an indication the prime minister and chancellor were ""paving the way"" to increase overall defence spending. That decision will be made after the MoD has carried out a review of the Armed Forces. Gen Carter has his critics at home though, as well as his fans. I've heard several Army officers complain that he behaves like a dictator, pushing through constant change. Some refer to him unkindly as Kim Jong Carter. As head of the Army, he has also failed to stop the worrying slide in recruitment - with the regular Army now 4,000 troops below its full strength of 82,000. While PM Theresa May says the Army has ""become more reflective of the society it serves"" under Gen Carter, he is himself another product of a privileged public school education. But he is in many ways the obvious choice. He has had plenty of operational experience, is a strategic thinker and is a lot more comfortable in the limelight than his predecessor. Supporters of the Royal Navy bemoan the fact that it is now 15 years since they had an officer who led the three services. They had hoped General Gordon Messenger would be the first Royal Marine to get the job. But once again the position of Chief of the Defence Staff is in the hands of the Army.

Trump keen to meet Kim after China talksThe US president gives a positive reaction to the North Korean leader meeting China's president.24m25 minutes agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Chinese TV showed footage of the two leaders with their wives US President Donald Trump has said he is keen to meet Kim Jong-un after being told the North Korean leader's trip to China ""went very well"". But Mr Trump said maximum sanctions and pressure on North Korea would continue ahead of proposed talks in May. He added that denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula was now a possibility. The comments follow Mr Kim's meeting with China's President Xi Jinping, in his first known foreign trip since taking office in 2011. Mr Kim and his wife were greeted with a banquet and a guard of honour, with the North Korean leader reportedly saying he was committed to denuclearisation. China is North Korea's main economic ally. The Kim-Trump talks in 400 words Are North and South Korea friends again? On Wednesday, Mr Trump welcomed news of progress following the talks between the two leaders in Beijing after days of speculation. ""Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong-un will do what is right for his people and for humanity,"" Mr Trump posted, adding in the next tweet that Mr Kim also ""looks forward to his meeting with me"".

Mr Trump's agreement to hold an unprecedented summit with Mr Kim astonished many observers. The announcement, which would make Mr Trump the first sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader, came after months of hostility and a string of North Korean missile tests. An initial statement from the South Korean delegation said a meeting had been agreed and would take place by May - but no place or date has officially been set. News of the major breakthrough in tensions was met with concern in the US, with reports that Mr Trump had made the decision without consulting key figures in his administration. However Mr Trump later tweeted that a deal with North Korea was ""very much in the making"". This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies But despite the progress in recent months, a number of factors could affect the chances of success. While Mr Kim has reportedly told China and South Korea he is willing to abandon nuclear weapons, he has stated that this comes with conditions, China's Xinhua news agency reported. There are also troubling reports from North Korea. Satellite images from last month, published by the New York Times, showwhat looks like a new nuclear reactor ready to go online,external. The newspaper claims it could produce 20kg of weapons-grade plutonium each year. Meanwhile, US and South Korean troops are gearing up for annual military drills which the North has historically seen as provocation. They start on Monday. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter, BBC News Mr Trump is planning for a win: successful negotiations with Mr Kim over his nuclear programme. Behind the scenes, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and others are trying to exude confidence about what they will be able to achieve at the summit. In a candid conversation with me and other visitors to his office recently, Mr Kelly described their high expectations for the meeting and their hopes for the future. Meanwhile, the CIA director is visiting the Pentagon to discuss the matter, and US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis is coming up with contingency plans. Details for the summit are still being worked out: the president likes to keep people guessing about how he'll negotiate and where his red lines are, and his meeting with Mr Kim is no exception. Mr Kelly and the other aides have several weeks - or perhaps a bit longer if it's delayed - to finalise things. As they're keenly aware, the countdown has begun. Mr Kim arrived with his wife, Ri Sol-ju, by train on Sunday and left Beijing on Tuesday afternoon, according to reports. The North Korean leader said the ""issue of denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved"" if the US and South Korea respond ""with goodwill"", Xinhua reported. Why Xi's the one Kim still needs to see Reading the moves - what our correspondents make of the visit The North's conditions include the removal of a US nuclear guarantee for South Korea, observers say. North Korea's KCNA news agency called the visit ""a milestone"" in improving bilateral ties. Rumours of the visit surfaced in the media earlier this week Mr Kim's arrival and departure were shrouded in secrecy. China said the visit was ""unofficial"" - so there was no announcement of it in advance, promptingspeculation about who was on the trainwhen it was spotted arriving. It is the latest in a flurry of diplomatic activity since the start of the year sparked by the Winter Olympics in South Korea. North Korea crisis in 300 words US-N Korea talks: What could happen now? Profile: Kim Jong-un Relations between North Korea and China, historically strong, had been deteriorating, with China backing US moves to tighten international sanctions in response to the North's growing nuclear threat. But China, a military giant over the border, is still responsible for virtually all of North Korea's food and fuel aid. It has largely been an observer of the recent diplomatic moves by Pyongyang towards the US and South Korea.

"Porn star seeks Trump testimony on claimsStormy Daniels wants the president to testify about whether he was aware of a ""hush agreement"".","This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: 'I was threatened' Adult-film star Stormy Daniels has filed a court motion for US President Donald Trump to testify about her claim that they had a relationship. Her lawyer wants sworn testimony from Mr Trump about a ""hush"" agreement the actress says she signed. The attorney, Michael Avenatti, is also seeking a legal interview with the president's lawyer. Ms Daniels alleges she had unprotected sex with Mr Trump in 2006 a year after he married Melania Trump. He denies it. Mr Avenatti's motion, filed in a court in the Central District of California early on Wednesday, ramps up the legal duel between the porn star and the president. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? The president and the porn star: Why this matters Ex-model apologises for 'Trump affair' Ms Daniels says she signed an agreement to keep quiet about her claims in exchange for $130,000 (Â£91,000) of ""hush"" money in October 2016, days before the White House election. Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, admits to making the payment, but insists it had nothing to do with the presidential campaign. If his statement was found to be untrue, the payment could theoretically constitute an unreported - and therefore illegal - campaign contribution. This video can not be played White House: The president ""has consistently denied these allegations"" In the court documents, Mr Avenatti said he wanted to take a deposition from Mr Trump and Mr Cohen for no more than two hours each. The lawyer said his aim was to establish if the president had consented to the agreement. A deposition is out-of-court testimony by a witness - who commits to tell the truth on possible penalty of perjury - that may be used in a legal case. Ms Daniels legal team says she ""intends to prove that the Hush Agreement did not have a lawful object or purpose"". ""Rather, the Agreement and the $130,000 payment made pursuant to the Agreement, was for the 'purpose of influencing' the 2016 presidential election by silencing Plaintiff from speaking openly and publicly about Mr Trump just weeks before the 2016 election."" Mr Trump's lawyer's lawyer, David Schwartz, dismissed the motion as ""a reckless use of the legal system in order to continue to inflate Michael Avenatti's deflated ego and keep himself relevant"". Mr Schwartz called the effort ""politically motivated"" and added that ""people see through this charade"". Wednesday's court filing refers to the 1997 US Supreme Court case of Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who sued former President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment. Ms Daniels' legal team notes America's highest court found in that case that the ""constitution does not offer a sitting President significant protections from potentially distracting civil litigation"". More than 22 million Americans tuned in on Sunday night to hear Ms Daniels allege she was threatened by a stranger in a car park in 2011 to ""leave Trump alone"". The exclusive pulled in the highest ratings for CBS' 60 Minutes programme in a decade. On Monday, Ms Daniels filed a lawsuit against the president, alleging the non-disclosure agreement was invalid because Mr Trump did not sign it. She also sued Mr Trump's lawyer, arguing he had defamed her by suggesting she was a liar. While Mr Trump has denied her claims, his lawyers are seeking $20m in damages from Ms Daniels, arguing she broke the non-disclosure deal. She has meanwhile reportedly extended her nationwide tour of strip clubs, Making America Horny Again, until November. Ms Daniels is due to appear for two nights at a strip club in Washington DC in June. She has also been touting a $14.99-per-month subscription to her naked web cam service.

Ulster rugby pair cleared of rapePaddy Jackson and Stuart Olding are found not guilty of raping a woman in June 2016.,"Both Stuart Olding and Paddy Jackson were found not guilty in unanimous verdicts Ireland and Ulster rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding have been cleared of rape. They both denied raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Blane McIlroy, who was accused of exposure, and Rory Harrison, who was charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information, were also found not guilty. The verdicts came in the ninth week of the trial. Rugby rape trial: Live reporting on the verdicts Timeline of events in rugby rape trial The main figures in the rugby rape trial Trial that played out beyond court Mr Jackson was also cleared of a charge of sexual assault. The jury of eight men and three women deliberated for three hours and 45 minutes before delivering their unanimous verdicts. Before discharging the 11-person jury, Judge Patricia Smyth told them: ""This has probably been the most difficult trial that any jury in Northern Ireland has ever been asked to adjudicate on."" This video can not be played Jackson's status 'influenced prosecution' The incident at the centre of the case was alleged to have happened after the four accused and four women went to Mr Jackson's home in south Belfast from a club in the city centre. The woman told the court she was attacked after going upstairs to retrieve a clutch bag as she was preparing to leave the house. The woman claimed Mr Jackson had followed her into the bedroom and pushed her onto the bed. She then claimed she was raped. However, the accused said that all sexual activity was consensual. Outside the courthouse, Mr Jackson thanked the judge and jury for ""giving him a fair trial"" as well as his family and legal team. His solicitor, Joe McVeigh, hit out at the investigation into Mr Jackson. ""It's our belief that the investigation has been characterised by the turning of a blind eye to inadequacies in the evidence of the complainant combined with the very apparent investigative bias,"" he said. This video can not be played Timeline of events leading up to the trial He added: ""The prosecution made much of a perceived privileged position provided by virtue of Paddy being an international rugby player. ""We say that it was this very status as a famous sportsman that drove the decision to prosecute in the first place."" Mr McVeigh also said ""real concerns about the integrity of the trial process"" had been raised by ""vile commentary expressed on social media, going well beyond fair comment"". ""Several days of this trial were lost due to problems thrown up by the intrusive infection of the process by social media,"" he said. ""All the lawyers have been distracted by having to man the barriers against a flood of misinformed, misconceived and malicious content on the internet, particularly during the last phase of this trial and, worryingly, even at the hands of public servants who should have known better."" by Mark Simpson, BBC News NI There was no reaction from the four defendants in the dock as the verdicts were announced. This video can not be played Paddy Jackson thanks jury, family and friends outside the court They simply stood and stared in front of them as, one by one, the not guilty verdicts were read out by the chairperson of the jury. A number of their friends and family were in tears in the public gallery. A crowd of reporters gathered outside Laganside courthouse following the verdicts Outside Court 12, Paddy Jackson hugged members of his legal team, as well as friends and family. Relatives of all the four accused attended every day of the 42-day trial. The case was only scheduled to last five weeks. In the end, it went on for eight-and-a-half weeks. In a statement read out by his solicitor, Mr Olding said:  ""I want to acknowledge publicly that though I committed no criminal offence on the evening of the 28th of June 2016, I regret deeply the events of that evening."" He said he was sorry for the hurt that was caused to the complainant. ""It was never my intention to cause any upset to anyone on that night,"" he said. ""I don't agree with her perception of events and I maintain that everything that happened that evening was consensual. ""I have consistently told the truth to the police and the court when asked to account for my conduct."" Blane McIlroy made no comment as he left with his parents and legal team. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) defended the decision to take the case to court. This video can not be played Who is Paddy Jackson? In a statement, Marianne O'Kane, assistant director of the PPS's serious crime unit, said: ""The evidence received in this case was subjected to a very thorough and careful examination by a team of experienced lawyers including senior counsel, before we concluded that the test for prosecution was met, in line with our code for prosecutors. ""This meant that there was both sufficient evidence to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and it was in the public interest to prosecute. ""This case was properly brought before the courts and overcame a number of legal challenges.  It was ultimately right that the matter was placed before a jury to make their determination."" The senior investigating officer in the case, Det Ch Insp Zoe McKee, said she had spoken to the complainant following the verdicts: ""Understandably, she is upset and disappointed with the outcome."" She said the case was ""thoroughly and robustly investigated. We pursued all lines of investigative inquiry, we brought all of the evidence together, we worked in close collaboration with the Public Prosecution Service from the start"". Her colleague, Det Ch Supt Paula Hillman added: ""I am satisfied that this was a very thorough investigation carried out with professionalism and integrity."" In a joint statement, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby said it had ""undoubtedly been a difficult and extremely traumatic time for all involved"". This video can not be played Who is Stuart Olding? They added that an internal review had been postponed pending the end of judicial proceedings and that a review committee has been appointed and ""will conclude its review as soon as practicable"". ""The players will continue to be relieved of all duties while the review committee is in process and determining its findings."" The verdicts came at the end of a 42-day trial. The 12-person jury which started hearing the case was later reduced to 11 after a juror took ill. In total, 30 witnesses gave evidence, including 10 police officers, the four defendants, the alleged victim and the taxi driver who drove her home on the night in question. The court sat on weekdays, but, to try to make up lost time, there was one Saturday sitting. Blane McIlroy denied one count of exposure Some hearings in the eight-and-a-half week trial were taken up with legal arguments, in the absence of the jury. On the second week of the trial, the jury was taken to see the layout of Paddy Jackson's house. All the other proceedings have taken place in Court 12 at Laganside courts complex. On most days, the 100-seat public gallery has been full. Paddy Jackson, 26, from Oakleigh Park, Belfast, and his Ireland and Ulster teammate Stuart Olding, 25, of Ardenlee Street in the city, denied raping the same woman at a house in south Belfast in June 2016. Rory Harrison denied charges of perverting the course of justice and withholding information Mr Jackson denied a further charge of sexual assault. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, denied exposure while Rory Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, denied perverting the course of justice and withholding information.

In the Commons on Wednesday the prime minister announced more money for the MoD, hailed by defence sources as a ""stunning win"" for the defence secretary. There will be an extra Â£600m over the next financial year to pay for four new Dreadnought nuclear submarines, which will come out of a contingency fund. And there will also be a further Â£200m made available coming from an ""underspend"" in other government departments. Sources close to the defence secretary say the extra cash will help avoid defence cuts in the next financial year. One official said it was an indication the prime minister and chancellor were ""paving the way"" to increase overall defence spending. That decision will be made after the MoD has carried out a review of the Armed Forces. Gen Carter has his critics at home though, as well as his fans. I've heard several Army officers complain that he behaves like a dictator, pushing through constant change. Some refer to him unkindly as Kim Jong Carter. As head of the Army, he has also failed to stop the worrying slide in recruitment - with the regular Army now 4,000 troops below its full strength of 82,000. While PM Theresa May says the Army has ""become more reflective of the society it serves"" under Gen Carter, he is himself another product of a privileged public school education. But he is in many ways the obvious choice. He has had plenty of operational experience, is a strategic thinker and is a lot more comfortable in the limelight than his predecessor. Supporters of the Royal Navy bemoan the fact that it is now 15 years since they had an officer who led the three services. They had hoped General Gordon Messenger would be the first Royal Marine to get the job. But once again the position of Chief of the Defence Staff is in the hands of the Army.

The dangers that lurk in your bathroom,"A study has suggested that rubber ducks harbour potentially disease-carrying bacteria which could make children, and adults, ill. But what other unexpected dangers lurk in your bathroom? Prof John Oxford, emeritus professor of virology at Queen Mary University in London, told the BBC: ""The bathroom is quite a tricky spot from a hygiene point of view. ""People spend a lot of time on cleaning the toilet but it would be good if everyone spent more attention on the bathroom and using disinfectant sprays to clean it."" The study which started the discussion about the dangers of entering your own bathroom - the dangers posed by rubber ducks and other bath toys. The Times reported on research conducted by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, together with the department of civil engineering at the University of Illinois. They studied 19 bath toys and discovered that fungi had been identified in 58% of them. The man who supervised the study advised against squirting water from the duck into a child's face as he said it could potentially lead to ""eye, ear or even gastrointestinal infections"". How do you bathe a newborn baby? Parents know that their precious child is too small to sit in a normal tub of water and so they use baby seats to keep them on the surface. However, the seats do not provide 100% protection. A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA) told the BBC: ""Bath seats provide a false sense of security because babies can drown in only a few centimetres of water. ""Things can happen in seconds and it only takes a phone call or for somebody to come to the door to distract a parent. ""It is important to keep the baby within arm's reach at all times as if they slide down into the water, they haven't got the motor skills to right themselves. Obviously this would happen silently and you won't hear them if they slip into the water."" Imagine the scene. The alarm goes off at some unearthly hour and you stumble into the bathroom half asleep. You turn on the shower but don't check the temperature before you step underneath the jets of water. Being burned or scalded by water which is too hot is a risk for both adults and children. The Rospa spokesman told the BBC: ""We ask people to put cold water into a bath first for kids. That way you are not risking a tub full of hot water with children around. ""There is the potential that if you put hot water in first, that they could come into contact with it, whereas if you put cold in first and then mix the hot in, you are not going to get to a temperature where they are going to burn themselves."" Python found lurking in bathroom toilet in Southend Should you have two bins in your bathroom? Wasps in the bathroom: What's going on? The idea of a bar of soap is to clean your hands and body - so it would be the last place you would imagine germs to be. However, you would be wrong. Prof Oxford said: ""Bacteria can sit on soap and move from person to person - common or garden things like E.coli. ""If someone from outside the family grouping has a new bug or one of the family members picks up a bug, then the bathroom is an ideal place for it to reside and spread to the rest of the family."" Prof Oxford advises that using a soap dispenser may be a better option than a bar of soap for the home. And The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises local authority public health teams to use liquid soap, and tepid water, to wash hands. A nice plump towel, perhaps being warmed by a radiator or heated towel rail, is a lovely thing to dry your hands or face on during the day. But whatever you do, don't consider letting someone else use it, says Prof Oxford. ""Towels are quite dodgy things,"" he said. ""You should never ever share a towel - I would advise against that."" It is common to have one hand towel in a downstairs bathroom/toilet that is used by visiting friends and family, as well as the people who live there. However, Prof Oxford said: ""That is best avoided. Germs can sit on a towel for hours. In fact a towel is rather a good spot for them to be sitting as it's in a slightly damp atmosphere. ""I'd advise using a few paper towels to throw in the bin, or individual towels."" Teen hits lottery jackpot on 18th birthday 'BBC helped me find family who never knew me' Six charts on how the British drink Falls in the bathroom are an obvious hazard, with the combination of soap, gel and water making the floor very slippery. People can often suffer broken bones, bruises, cuts and even dislocations getting in and out of the bath or shower, or fall on a wet bathroom floor. To try to avoid this, people are advised to use bath mats on the floor, anti-slip mats in baths and showers and to wash out the tub after use, if they have been using any gels or body oils.

Weinstein gagging order was 'immoral',"Zelda Perkins worked for Weinstein's Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s An ex-assistant of Harvey Weinstein has said she was pressured into signing a non-disclosure agreement [NDA] that was ""morally lacking on every level"". ""There cannot be a legal document that protects criminal behaviour,"" Zelda Perkins told MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee. Ms Perkins said she left Weinstein's company Miramax after a colleague accused him of trying to rape her. Weinstein has denied all allegations of ""non-consensual sexual contact"". He, Miramax and the company's owner Disney were invited to give evidence to the committee, but declined. Weinstein has faced allegations from numerous women Ms Perkins said she felt ""pressure"" to sign the NDA and had been ""unhappy with the entire process"". She said she had tried to make sure the agreement contained restrictions on Weinstein's future conduct, but that they were not subsequently enforced. ""Essentially we were defrauded,"" she told the committee, which is conducting an inquiry into sexual harassment in the workplace. ""We signed that agreement with the belief that Miramax and Harvey Weinstein would uphold their obligations."" Ms Perkins, who worked for Weinstein's Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s, said her former colleague did not talk about the alleged assault to counsellors because she was ""so afraid"" of breaking the agreement. The women were told they could only talk to medical practitioners and legal representatives if those people signed their own NDAs - and even then they were encouraged not to go into detail. ""She sought counselling but she never, ever discussed the events because she was so afraid of this agreement,"" Ms Perkins said. ""She felt she was not allowed to."" Ms Perkins said she was afraid of going to jail herself if she spoke about the events. ""I knew I'd be sued for the damages, for the money, but that wasn't so much my concern,"" she said. ""I thought I was breaking the law."" She is calling for scrutiny on how NDAs were used. ""The problem is they are used abusively and within the law,"" she said. ""There isn't enough regulation and there isn't a framework to protect the victims of the situation."" Ms Perkins said she was never given a copy of the non-disclosure agreement she signed and that she was told by her lawyers they had never seen one like it. ""I was told clearly it was a very broad agreement and, basically, I just couldn't ever say anything about anything to anybody, and just the safest thing was to erase the entire last four years of my life pretty much from my memory. ""At no point was it made clear to me that it was unenforceable or could potentially be unenforceable."" Ms Perkins said her career had ""basically [come] to a halt"" afterwards and that both she and her former colleague had eventually left the country. Her oral evidence followed previous interviews withBBC Newsnight,the Financial Timesand other news outlets.

Musician wins ruling over hearing lossA viola player who sued the Royal Opera House for ruining his hearing wins a landmark High Court judgment.8m8 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts,"He joined the viola section of the ROH orchestra in 2002 A viola player who suffered a life-changing hearing injury at a rehearsal of Wagner's Die Walkure in 2012 has won a landmark High Court judgment against the Royal Opera House (ROH). The case won by Chris Goldscheider has huge implications for the industry and the health and safety of musicians. It is the first time a judge has scrutinised the music industry's legal obligations towards musicians' hearing. The ROH said it was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the judgment. It is also the first time 'acoustic shock' has been recognised as a condition which can be compensated by a court. On 1 September 2012, Mr Goldscheider was seated directly in front of the brass section of the orchestra for a rehearsal of Wagner's thunderous opera Die Walkure in the famous orchestra pit at the Royal Opera House. During that rehearsal, the noise levels exceeded 130 decibels, roughly equivalent to that of a jet engine. His hearing was irreversibly damaged. Chris Goldscheider said he was ""overjoyed"" by the judge's decision Mr Goldscheider claimed damages for acoustic shock, a condition with symptoms including tinnitus, hyperacusis and dizziness. He told the BBC: ""With this condition if you are exposed to normal sounds, unfortunately they become incredibly painful. ""I suppose the nearest analogy is if you imagine for a normal person to walk on normal ground and then you imagine walking barefoot on glass."" Mr Goldscheider, from Bedfordshire, has to wear ear defenders to carry out everyday household tasks such as preparing food. Especially upsetting is that he had been unable to listen to his 18-year-old son Ben - one of the country's outstanding young French horn players. The Royal Opera House argued that acoustic shock does not exist, and that if it did, Mr Goldscheider did not have it. Their case was that he had developed an entirely natural hearing condition, known as Meniere's disease, at exactly the same time as the super-loud, high intensity noise burst behind his right ear. However, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies took a different view, stating: ""I regard the defendant's contention that Meniere's disease developed at the rehearsal as stretching the concept of coincidence too far."" The ROH also argued a balance had to be struck between preserving the artistic integrity of the music while doing everything possible to reduce the risk of damage to musicians' hearing, that was an inevitable feature of playing long-term in an orchestra. The Royal Opera House had argued that some hearing loss was justifiable Mrs Justice Davies disagreed, ruling that ""the reliance upon artistic value implies that statutory health and safety requirements must cede to the needs and wishes of the artistic output of the Opera company, its managers and conductors. ""Such a stance is unacceptable. Musicians are entitled to the protection of the law, as is any other worker."" Reacting to the ruling, Mr Goldscheider said: ""As you can imagine a law suit of this magnitude takes its strain on everyone. Not just on me but my family, my children. ""Here we are today and I'm just so overjoyed at the judge's decision and I hope it will prevent any more musicians being injured from today onwards."" Speaking of the impact of the decision, Mr Goldscheider's solicitor, Chris Fry of Fry Law, said: ""This case has huge significance and will send shockwaves across the music business. ""It has considered itself exempt from the same regulatory requirements as all other sectors because of the artistic nature of its output. ""This, in our view, has always been a dismissive view from an industry which creates and sells 'noise' as a product."" The Royal Opera House and other orchestras will now need to re-assess policies and procedures and the design of orchestra spaces and could face claims against them by other musicians. In a statement, the ROH said the expert medical advice it had consistently received was that long-term hearing damage could not be caused by an isolated incident of exposure to live music. ""We have been at the forefront of industry-wide attempts to protect musicians from the dangers of exposure to significant levels of performance sound, in collaboration with our staff, the Musicians' Union, acoustic engineers and the Health and Safety Executive,"" it continued. ""Although this judgment is restricted to our obligations as an employer under the Noise Regulations, it has potentially far-reaching implications for the Royal Opera House and the wider music industry. ""We do not believe that the Noise Regulations can be applied in an artistic institution in the same manner as in a factory, not least because in the case of the Royal Opera House, sound is not a by-product of an industrial process but is an essential part of the product itself. ""This has been a complex case and we will consider carefully whether to appeal the judgment."" Goldscheider once played on stage with Kylie Minogue According to Help Musicians UK, the leading UK charity for professional musicians: ""The unfortunate circumstances surrounding Chris's tragic hearing loss reflect a growing number of hearing related issues, as highlighted in our 2015 hearing survey, where 59.5% of musicians said they had suffered hearing loss and 78% said working as a musician was a contributor to their hearing loss."" Mr Goldscheider began playing the violin at the age of five and the viola from about 21. He studied in Prague and the UK and played with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and BBC Symphony orchestras. In 2002 he joined the viola section of the ROH orchestra as number eleven viola and was promoted to number six. Career highlights included playing on stage with Kylie Minogue and with the Three Tenors to 100,000 people in Barcelona. ""Following my injury I spent 18 months trying to recover, recuperate and get back to playing, and unfortunately I couldn't do it,"" he said. Mr Goldscheider left the ROH in July 2014 as a result of his injuries. Damages will be assessed at a later date.

Googleâs tax bill rises to Â£50m,"Google's office in London employs 3,280 people Google will pay nearly Â£50m in tax to the Treasury this year. The technology giant's annual accounts show that the company will pay corporation taxes of Â£49.3m on UK profits of Â£202.4m. Although the tax figure is the highest the company has paid - and up on the Â£36.4m it paid last year - it will be likely to reignite the debate about taxation and digital firms. The total value of Google's sales in the UK is about Â£5.7bn a year. It only makes a profit on a small proportion of that activity because most of the intellectual value of its business - the software engineering - is created in America, where Google pays the vast bulk of its taxes. Google UK also operates as a marketing and sales arm of its European operation which is headquartered in Dublin, where corporation taxes are lower. It pays a substantial ""administration fee"" to its European parent to operate across Britain. ""As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK,"" a spokesman said. ""We are investing significantly in the UK, including starting work on new offices in King's Cross [London] for 7,000 staff."" Google's European headquarters is in Dublin The accounts say that at present, Google employs 3,280 people in the UK, an increase of 340. The government and the European Union are both looking at increasing the amount of tax that companies such as Facebook and Google pay. Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for tax affairs,told me last week that digital giants did not pay enough tax. A Commission proposal published at the same time said that a new tax on revenues should be levied, raising up to Â£4bn across the EU. A substantial proportion of that could come to Britain, which has one of the highest usage rates of digital companies. A tax on revenues is also supported by the Treasury. Mel Stride, the Treasury minister,told the BBC that it was the government's ""preferred option"". Google's 2017 accounts show that it had revenues of Â£1.27bn a year in the UK between June 2016 and 2017, up from Â£1.03bn between 2015 and 2016. A tax on those revenues would raise substantially more in the UK than the present Â£50m tax bill on its UK profits. Technology companies make clear that they abide by all the tax laws and that extra taxes on their activities could lead to ""double taxation"" problems - taxes being charged in different countries for the same activity. The US government has also made it clear that it takes a dim view of efforts in Europe to make a special case of large technology firms, many of which are based in Silicon Valley. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the international body charged with proposing new global tax rules for companies, has also warned about the dangers of ""tax wars"" as different countries apply different tax rates to companies. Mr Moscovici said that he wanted EU agreement on the new revenue tax ""by the end of the year"", which many people believe is over-ambitious, given that countries such as Ireland have opposed the move. The UK's policy could be announced in the Budget in the autumn.

US shooting protesters storm city meeting,"This video can not be played ""Stop, please, my brother just got shot"" The brother of US shooting victim Stephon Clark has stormed a public meeting of the Sacramento city council, amid continuing anger over his killing by police earlier this month. Leading protesters into the chamber on Tuesday, Stevonte Clarke sat on a table and said the mayor and the city had ""failed all of you"". The incident happened as the council was debating the death. Stephon Clark, 22, was unarmed when he was shot dead by Sacramento police. Hundreds of people attended Tuesday's meeting, which was called after California's attorney general joined the investigation into the killing. Sacramento police chief Daniel Hahn asked for the attorney general's involvement, citing the ""extremely high emotions, anger and hurt in our city"". Police video shows unarmed man shot dead Before the interruption, Mayor Darrell Steinberg said the meetings would discuss police protocol and training. ""This is not just about the death of Stephon Clark,"" he said. ""We recognise that there have been other lives lost, who also drive your grief and passion for change."" One of those attending the meeting held a phone like a gun - only a phone was found on Mr Clark after the shooting Two police officers shot 20 times at Mr Clark in his grandmother's backyard on 18 March, while investigating nearby break-ins. Mr Clark was believed to be armed but only a mobile phone was found on his body. The officers have not been named by authorities, who say they are concerned for their safety. They have been put on leave. How often are US police killed on duty? Are US police too quick to shoot knife-wielding suspects? Benjamin Crump, lawyer for the Clark family, said in a statement: ""We fully expect that the California Attorney General's Office will do a complete and thorough investigation."" Mr Crump has previously represented the families of shooting victims such as Trayvon Martin, a Florida teenager killed in 2012. After protesters stormed the council chamber, they gathered around the Golden 1 Centre,the scene of an earlier protest. There were angry exchanges between basketball fans and protesters They prevented people from entering the venue to watch the basketball game between the Sacramento Kings and the Dallas Mavericks. In contrast to another game disrupted by protests Tuesday's match started roughly on time. The Sacramento Kings said ticket holders who did not manage to watch the game could get a refund.

They both denied raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Blane McIlroy, who was accused of exposure, and Rory Harrison, who was charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information, were also found not guilty. The verdicts came in the ninth week of the trial. Rugby rape trial: Live reporting on the verdicts Timeline of events in rugby rape trial The main figures in the rugby rape trial Trial that played out beyond court Mr Jackson was also cleared of a charge of sexual assault. The jury of eight men and three women deliberated for three hours and 45 minutes before delivering their unanimous verdicts. Before discharging the 11-person jury, Judge Patricia Smyth told them: ""This has probably been the most difficult trial that any jury in Northern Ireland has ever been asked to adjudicate on."" This video can not be played Jackson's status 'influenced prosecution' The incident at the centre of the case was alleged to have happened after the four accused and four women went to Mr Jackson's home in south Belfast from a club in the city centre. The woman told the court she was attacked after going upstairs to retrieve a clutch bag as she was preparing to leave the house. The woman claimed Mr Jackson had followed her into the bedroom and pushed her onto the bed. She then claimed she was raped. However, the accused said that all sexual activity was consensual. Outside the courthouse, Mr Jackson thanked the judge and jury for ""giving him a fair trial"" as well as his family and legal team. His solicitor, Joe McVeigh, hit out at the investigation into Mr Jackson. ""It's our belief that the investigation has been characterised by the turning of a blind eye to inadequacies in the evidence of the complainant combined with the very apparent investigative bias,"" he said. This video can not be played Timeline of events leading up to the trial He added: ""The prosecution made much of a perceived privileged position provided by virtue of Paddy being an international rugby player. ""We say that it was this very status as a famous sportsman that drove the decision to prosecute in the first place."" Mr McVeigh also said ""real concerns about the integrity of the trial process"" had been raised by ""vile commentary expressed on social media, going well beyond fair comment"". ""Several days of this trial were lost due to problems thrown up by the intrusive infection of the process by social media,"" he said. ""All the lawyers have been distracted by having to man the barriers against a flood of misinformed, misconceived and malicious content on the internet, particularly during the last phase of this trial and, worryingly, even at the hands of public servants who should have known better."" by Mark Simpson, BBC News NI There was no reaction from the four defendants in the dock as the verdicts were announced. This video can not be played Paddy Jackson thanks jury, family and friends outside the court They simply stood and stared in front of them as, one by one, the not guilty verdicts were read out by the chairperson of the jury. A number of their friends and family were in tears in the public gallery. A crowd of reporters gathered outside Laganside courthouse following the verdicts Outside Court 12, Paddy Jackson hugged members of his legal team, as well as friends and family. Relatives of all the four accused attended every day of the 42-day trial. The case was only scheduled to last five weeks. In the end, it went on for eight-and-a-half weeks. In a statement read out by his solicitor, Mr Olding said:  ""I want to acknowledge publicly that though I committed no criminal offence on the evening of the 28th of June 2016, I regret deeply the events of that evening."" He said he was sorry for the hurt that was caused to the complainant. ""It was never my intention to cause any upset to anyone on that night,"" he said. ""I don't agree with her perception of events and I maintain that everything that happened that evening was consensual. ""I have consistently told the truth to the police and the court when asked to account for my conduct."" Blane McIlroy made no comment as he left with his parents and legal team. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) defended the decision to take the case to court. This video can not be played Who is Paddy Jackson? In a statement, Marianne O'Kane, assistant director of the PPS's serious crime unit, said: ""The evidence received in this case was subjected to a very thorough and careful examination by a team of experienced lawyers including senior counsel, before we concluded that the test for prosecution was met, in line with our code for prosecutors. ""This meant that there was both sufficient evidence to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and it was in the public interest to prosecute. ""This case was properly brought before the courts and overcame a number of legal challenges.  It was ultimately right that the matter was placed before a jury to make their determination."" The senior investigating officer in the case, Det Ch Insp Zoe McKee, said she had spoken to the complainant following the verdicts: ""Understandably, she is upset and disappointed with the outcome."" She said the case was ""thoroughly and robustly investigated. We pursued all lines of investigative inquiry, we brought all of the evidence together, we worked in close collaboration with the Public Prosecution Service from the start"". Her colleague, Det Ch Supt Paula Hillman added: ""I am satisfied that this was a very thorough investigation carried out with professionalism and integrity."" In a joint statement, the Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby said it had ""undoubtedly been a difficult and extremely traumatic time for all involved"". This video can not be played Who is Stuart Olding? They added that an internal review had been postponed pending the end of judicial proceedings and that a review committee has been appointed and ""will conclude its review as soon as practicable"". ""The players will continue to be relieved of all duties while the review committee is in process and determining its findings."" The verdicts came at the end of a 42-day trial. The 12-person jury which started hearing the case was later reduced to 11 after a juror took ill. In total, 30 witnesses gave evidence, including 10 police officers, the four defendants, the alleged victim and the taxi driver who drove her home on the night in question. The court sat on weekdays, but, to try to make up lost time, there was one Saturday sitting. Blane McIlroy denied one count of exposure Some hearings in the eight-and-a-half week trial were taken up with legal arguments, in the absence of the jury. On the second week of the trial, the jury was taken to see the layout of Paddy Jackson's house. All the other proceedings have taken place in Court 12 at Laganside courts complex. On most days, the 100-seat public gallery has been full. Paddy Jackson, 26, from Oakleigh Park, Belfast, and his Ireland and Ulster teammate Stuart Olding, 25, of Ardenlee Street in the city, denied raping the same woman at a house in south Belfast in June 2016. Rory Harrison denied charges of perverting the course of justice and withholding information Mr Jackson denied a further charge of sexual assault.

Scottish police arrest Catalan politicianClara Ponsati is being sought by Spanish authorities over her role in the Catalan independence referendum.21m22 minutes agoScotland politics,"Prof Pansati was greeted by supporters when she emerged from the court on Wednesday afternoon A pro-independence Catalan politician who is being sought by the Spanish government has been released on bail by a Scottish court. Prof Clara Ponsati was formally arrested after arriving voluntarily at an Edinburgh police station. She later appeared from custody at an initial extradition hearing at the city's sheriff court. Bail was not opposed, and she will now embark on a legal fight against being returned to face trial in Spain. Prof Ponsati, who says the charges against her are politically-motivated, was asked to surrender her passport. The authorities in Madrid issued a European Arrest Warrant after accusing her of rebellion - defined under Spanish law as being involved in a violent uprising - and misappropriation of public funds. The allegations relate to her involvement in organising last year's Catalan independence referendum, which was ruled illegal by the Spanish courts. Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who faces similar charges, wastaken into custody in Germany at the weekend. This video can not be played Prof Ponsati's lawyer read out a statement when she arrived to hand herself in to police earlier in the day The hearing before Sheriff Nigel Ross lasted less than 10 minutes, with a number of Prof Ponsati's supporters present in the packed court room and many more gathered outside. Among them were several prominent SNP politicians, including former Holyrood presiding officer Tricia Marwick. Ms Marwick told BBC Scotland that it would be ""impossible for Clara, and indeed for any of the other political prisoners"" to have a fair trial in Spain as there was ""absolutely no separation between the justiciary and the government"". Speaking outside court, Prof Ponsati's lawyer Aamer Anwar said his client was opposing the extradition warrant from the Spanish Supreme Court and would ""robustly deny the charges"" against her. He added: ""The 52-page warrant included the crimes of rebellion - punishable by up to 25 years in prison - as well as the crime of misappropriation of public funds, punishable with up to eight years' imprisonment. ""Clara wishes for me to state that these charges are politically motivated and a grotesque distortion of the truth. She cannot believe that she is being held responsible for the violence that took place on the day of the referendum."" The former Catalan education minister was formally arrested when she entered St Leonard's police station in Edinburgh Mr Anwar said Prof Ponsati believes that the Catalan people ""tried to express a democratic right to decide their own destiny"" during the referendum. And he said the only people that should be held responsible for the ""brutal violence"" was the Spanish police and state security forces who ""attacked the Catalan people on behalf of the Spanish government"". He added: ""She submits that Spain has not followed due process, cannot guarantee the independence of the judiciary and has repeatedly abused the human rights of the Catalan people."" Prof Ponsati turned herself in to officers at St Leonard's police station on Wednesday morning, before being taken to court. She has thanked First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish government and other Scottish politicians for their ""solidarity"", with Mr Anwar saying Prof Ponsati believes ""Scotland has been a true friend to Catalonia in her darkest hours"". An online crowdfunding appeal to pay Prof Ponsati's legal costs had raised about Â£170,000 by 16:00 on Wednesday. Her initial target was Â£40,000, but this was later increased to Â£200,000. She fled to Brussels with Carles Puigdemont following the Catalan referendum Prof Ponsati had been working as the director of the School of Economics and Finance at the University of St Andrews since January 2016, before being appointed as the Catalan government's education minister in July of last year. She returned to work at St Andrews earlier this month, having been in Belgium since fleeing Spain with Catalonia's ex-leader Carles Puigdemont and three other former cabinet members following an unsuccessful bid to declare independence from Spain in October. A Spanish judge issued arrest warrants on Friday for Prof Ponsati and the other fugitive politicians, including Mr Puigdemont, who was detained by police in Germany. In almost all cases, there is a requirement that the allegations would amount to a criminal offence were it to have occurred in the UK. Prof Ponsati's legal team could argue that rebellion is not a specific criminal offence in Scotland - although there is a crime of treason, which covers disloyalty to the Crown. The extradition request could also be defeated if Prof Ponsati successfully argues that it is politically-motivated. But extradition lawyer Karen Todner told BBC Scotland it is rare for European requests to be refused for this reason, because ""as part of the European Union we are supposed to believe that all requests are fair and proper"". Regardless, the legal process is likely to take several months and could be challenged all the way to the High Court. Supporters gathered outside the court ahead of Prof Ponsati's hearing Scotland's independence movement has close links to its Catalan counterpart, and the SNP is overwhelmingly supportive of Prof Ponsati's cause. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is also the SNP leader, has not explicitly backed Catalan independence and has stressed that her Scottish government cannot intervene in the legal process. Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly said she supports the right of the Catalan people to determine their own future, and has criticised the Spanish government's decision to arrest and imprison pro-independence Catalan politicians. She added: ""The fact that our justice system is legally obliged to follow due process in the determination of extradition requests does not change those views."" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has requested a meeting with the Spanish ambassador in London to express the party's concern over the treatment of Prof Ponsati and other Catalan politicians.

French hero policeman honoured in Paris,"This video can not be played President Emmanuel Macron said Col Beltrame ""fell as a hero"" Tributes have been paid across France to the police officer who died after he offered himself in exchange for a hostage in an Islamist attack. The coffin carrying Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame was driven in heavy rain through Paris, where hundreds of people joined a national memorial service. President Emmanuel Macron said the officer, who was 44, symbolised the ""French spirit of resistance"". Three other people were also killed in Friday's attacks in southern France. Col Beltrame's widow and his friends, family and colleagues attended a ceremony at Les Invalides in the French capital. France lauds hero policeman TrÃ¨bes memorial Mass for victims ""To be willing to die so that innocent people continue to live, this is the heart of a soldier's promise,"" Mr Macron said in his eulogy as the coffin draped in the French flag laid in the cobbled courtyard. ""To be ready to give your own life because nothing is more important than the life of a citizen, this is the ultimate effect of the transcendence he bore."" In the service, also attended by several former French presidents, Mr Macron awarded the officer France's highest accolade, the Legion d'Honneur. Earlier, a minute's silence was observed at all police stations across France, and flags were lowered to half-mast on public buildings. Col Beltrame was awarded France's highest accolade, the Legion d'Honneur The officer was a highly regarded member of the Gendarmerie Nationale, and friends and relatives have remembered his sense of duty and generosity. His brother Cedric told a French radio station on Saturday: ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would."" Col Beltrame's coffin will now travel back to the southern city of Carcassone for his funeral. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris With full honour guard, Arnaud Beltrame's coffin was brought from the Pantheon - the mausoleum for French heroes - through the Latin Quarter and along the quays of the Seine to the Invalides military museum. Small crowds gathered along the way, but the weather was foul and most people were watching the ceremony on live television. It was a nation coming together to salute the ultimatebeau geste, the noble gesture of a gendarme who, by offering himself as a terrorist hostage last Friday, gave his own life to save another's. Delivering the eulogy, President Macron said while the name of the attacker would sink into oblivion, Arnaud Beltrame's name would be remembered for ever. He had joined the ranks of the country's heroes. Mr Macron also urged France to be vigilant in the face of an ""insidious"" threat by Islamist militants - in the last three years, more than 240 people have been killed in attacks across France. ""What we're fighting is clandestine Islamic fundamentalism, which spreads through social media, which does its work out of sight, which preys on weak and unstable minds, and which on our soil corrupts and indoctrinates on a daily basis,"" he said. Col Beltrame's actions helped bring an end to the siege in a supermarket in TrÃ¨bes by 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, who had earlier killed a person in Carcassonne. The gunman - who had claimed to be a supporter of the Islamic State group - had been on an extremist watch list and was known to authorities as a petty criminal, but intelligence services had determined he did not pose a threat. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what was the worst jihadist attack under Mr Macron's presidency. The gunman was shot dead by police. French officials held a minute's silence at the interior ministry Lakdim was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. The attacker's girlfriend, who has not been named, is reportedly a convert to Islam who has been known to security services for at least a year. On Tuesday, she was placed under formal investigation accused of ""associating with terrorists preparing attacks"" and remains in police custody. One other person, a 17-year-old friend of the gunman, was released on Monday after being questioned.

Worboys review: What we know,"Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them Until the two-day judicial review hearing, very little was known about John Worboys' 10 years' in custody - and the reasons why the Parole Board granted his release. From legal submissions at the High Court hearing, and documents presented to the court, a picture has built up of a man who was in denial about his offending for most of his sentence. Worboys pleaded not guilty at his trial in 2009, brought a legal challenge against his convictions a year later, and, after being refused permission to bring the appeal, applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to consider his case. Even four years later when he settled civil claims brought by 11 of his victims, paying Â£241,000 compensation, he did not accept liability. According to legal papers from the Mayor of London, a forensic psychologist reported in June 2013 that Worboys had not engaged in any programmes focused on his offending. A separate psychologist, in January 2015, wrote that Worboys maintained that sexual contact with the 12 victims in the cases he was convicted of was consensual. But just four months later there was a dramatic change: Worboys admitted the offences. Worboys appeared via videolink at the High Court hearing Worboys' offender supervisor, a member of prison staff, wrote that the former black cab driver had said he felt ""ashamed"" of his behaviour after reflecting on media coverage about Jimmy Savile, and ""needed to show victim empathy"". A forensic psychologist who interviewed him in June 2015 said he was ""nervous"" and ""tearful"" and wanted to give victims ""their due"" and ""say thank you"" by taking responsibility. ""He also said he had maintained hope that his convictions would be overturned, and that this expectation now felt unrealistic, which was a further motivation to take responsibility for his sexual offending,"" the psychologist wrote. Indeed, Worboys had withdrawn his CCRC application in May that year, at the same time as his admission of responsibility. His apparent sudden about-turn came nine months before his eight-year minimum term was due to expire and four months before his first parole hearing, in September 2015. Phillippa Kaufmann QC, who represented two of Worboys' victims at the judicial review hearing, suggested this was no coincidence. The Parole Board decided the 60-year-old should remain in a 'closed' prison because of the level of risk he posed. In fact, he's been held in Category A, high-security, prison accommodation for his entire sentence. In 2015, on the psychologist's advice, Worboys - who has changed his name to John Radford - began a sex offender treatment programme. In 2017, however, the effectiveness of it was called into question by research showing they do not reduce the likelihood of reoffending and may in fact increase it slightly. The Ministry of Justice scrapped the schemes, yet according to Ms Kaufmann that point was missed by the parole panel at his second, successful, parole hearing. Ahead of that hearing, in November last year, there appeared to be a consensus Worboys had not made enough progress in custody to warrant release, let alone a move to an 'open' prison, where inmates spend time in the community to help them adjust to life on the outside and test whether they're ready for such a move. Worboys' probation officer, known as an offender manager, said he was at the ""start of his treatment pathway"" which needed to be ""full and thorough given the seriousness and proliferation of his offending"". The former black cab driver has admitted attacking the 12 women he was convicted of, but he continues to protest his innocence of more than 80 other allegations, which police date back to 2002 The High Court was told that in an interview in March that year, Worboys had described his victims as ""happy drunks...not nasty"" saying that by consuming alcohol they had ""no respect for themselves"".  The offender supervisor agreed that he was not ready to be let out, as did a psychologist, commissioned by the prison authorities, who suggested only a review of Worboys' security category. But by the time of the parole hearing, last November, there was a sharp divergence of views. The psychologist, who'd been instructed by Worboys on a previous occasion, said they felt Worboys could now be ""safely managed"" in the community as he presented a ""low risk"" of sexual reoffending. Crucially, two other psychologists, who both gave evidence on Worboys' behalf, came to the same conclusion. Ranged against them were four prison and probation staff, consisting of two offender managers and a senior prison psychologist, who all said Worboys had to move gradually to lower security jails before release. The case had also been discussed at meetings of MAPPA (Multi-agency Public Protection Arrangements), a group of police, probation and prison staff responsible for managing violent and dangerous offenders. MAPPA believed Worboys still posed a high risk of harm and should not be released. The parole panel, which the Parole Board said was chaired by an ""experienced"" female member and included a psychologist and a lawyer, also heard evidence from prison officers and Worboys himself - the Board said he was ""questioned in detail"". The Justice Secretary, who opposed release, was represented and one victim submitted a statement. The Panel, which had a 363-pages long dossier of information about Worboys, reached its decision, puzzlingly, on Boxing Day last year, though it wasn't made public until January. It concluded it was no longer necessary for Worboys to be held in prison because he'd taken ""full responsibility"" for his offending, learnt to be ""open and honest"", had a ""good insight"" into his risk factors and posed a ""low risk of future sexual offending"". The Panel said the risks he posed were not ""imminent"" and were ""manageable"" in the community, adding that an increase in risk was not ""inevitable"" and would be detected.

"Weinstein gagging order was 'immoral'""You can't have an agreement covering up criminality,"" his former aide tells a Commons committee.","Zelda Perkins worked for Weinstein's Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s An ex-assistant of Harvey Weinstein has said she was pressured into signing a non-disclosure agreement [NDA] that was ""morally lacking on every level"". ""There cannot be a legal document that protects criminal behaviour,"" Zelda Perkins told MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee. Ms Perkins said she left Weinstein's company Miramax after a colleague accused him of trying to rape her. Weinstein has denied all allegations of ""non-consensual sexual contact"". He, Miramax and the company's owner Disney were invited to give evidence to the committee, but declined. Weinstein has faced allegations from numerous women Ms Perkins said she felt ""pressure"" to sign the NDA and had been ""unhappy with the entire process"". She said she had tried to make sure the agreement contained restrictions on Weinstein's future conduct, but that they were not subsequently enforced. ""Essentially we were defrauded,"" she told the committee, which is conducting an inquiry into sexual harassment in the workplace. ""We signed that agreement with the belief that Miramax and Harvey Weinstein would uphold their obligations."" Ms Perkins, who worked for Weinstein's Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s, said her former colleague did not talk about the alleged assault to counsellors because she was ""so afraid"" of breaking the agreement. The women were told they could only talk to medical practitioners and legal representatives if those people signed their own NDAs - and even then they were encouraged not to go into detail. ""She sought counselling but she never, ever discussed the events because she was so afraid of this agreement,"" Ms Perkins said. ""She felt she was not allowed to."" Ms Perkins said she was afraid of going to jail herself if she spoke about the events. ""I knew I'd be sued for the damages, for the money, but that wasn't so much my concern,"" she said. ""I thought I was breaking the law."" She is calling for scrutiny on how NDAs were used. ""The problem is they are used abusively and within the law,"" she said. ""There isn't enough regulation and there isn't a framework to protect the victims of the situation."" Ms Perkins said she was never given a copy of the non-disclosure agreement she signed and that she was told by her lawyers they had never seen one like it. ""I was told clearly it was a very broad agreement and, basically, I just couldn't ever say anything about anything to anybody, and just the safest thing was to erase the entire last four years of my life pretty much from my memory. ""At no point was it made clear to me that it was unenforceable or could potentially be unenforceable."" Ms Perkins said her career had ""basically [come] to a halt"" afterwards and that both she and her former colleague had eventually left the country.

Why is Brexit taking sooo long?,"It's been more than two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and the negotiations, pronouncements and progress reports seem never-ending. So while there's just over six months until Brexit day, with a 21-month transition period after that, we ask why does it seem to be taking sooo long?  We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...

Scottish police arrest Catalan politician,"Prof Pansati was greeted by supporters when she emerged from the court on Wednesday afternoon A pro-independence Catalan politician who is being sought by the Spanish government has been released on bail by a Scottish court. Prof Clara Ponsati was formally arrested after arriving voluntarily at an Edinburgh police station. She later appeared from custody at an initial extradition hearing at the city's sheriff court. Bail was not opposed, and she will now embark on a legal fight against being returned to face trial in Spain. Prof Ponsati, who says the charges against her are politically-motivated, was asked to surrender her passport. The authorities in Madrid issued a European Arrest Warrant after accusing her of rebellion - defined under Spanish law as being involved in a violent uprising - and misappropriation of public funds. The allegations relate to her involvement in organising last year's Catalan independence referendum, which was ruled illegal by the Spanish courts. Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who faces similar charges, wastaken into custody in Germany at the weekend. This video can not be played Prof Ponsati's lawyer read out a statement when she arrived to hand herself in to police earlier in the day The hearing before Sheriff Nigel Ross lasted less than 10 minutes, with a number of Prof Ponsati's supporters present in the packed court room and many more gathered outside. Among them were several prominent SNP politicians, including former Holyrood presiding officer Tricia Marwick. Ms Marwick told BBC Scotland that it would be ""impossible for Clara, and indeed for any of the other political prisoners"" to have a fair trial in Spain as there was ""absolutely no separation between the justiciary and the government"". Speaking outside court, Prof Ponsati's lawyer Aamer Anwar said his client was opposing the extradition warrant from the Spanish Supreme Court and would ""robustly deny the charges"" against her. He added: ""The 52-page warrant included the crimes of rebellion - punishable by up to 25 years in prison - as well as the crime of misappropriation of public funds, punishable with up to eight years' imprisonment. ""Clara wishes for me to state that these charges are politically motivated and a grotesque distortion of the truth. She cannot believe that she is being held responsible for the violence that took place on the day of the referendum."" The former Catalan education minister was formally arrested when she entered St Leonard's police station in Edinburgh Mr Anwar said Prof Ponsati believes that the Catalan people ""tried to express a democratic right to decide their own destiny"" during the referendum. And he said the only people that should be held responsible for the ""brutal violence"" was the Spanish police and state security forces who ""attacked the Catalan people on behalf of the Spanish government"". He added: ""She submits that Spain has not followed due process, cannot guarantee the independence of the judiciary and has repeatedly abused the human rights of the Catalan people."" Prof Ponsati turned herself in to officers at St Leonard's police station on Wednesday morning, before being taken to court. She has thanked First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish government and other Scottish politicians for their ""solidarity"", with Mr Anwar saying Prof Ponsati believes ""Scotland has been a true friend to Catalonia in her darkest hours"". An online crowdfunding appeal to pay Prof Ponsati's legal costs had raised about Â£170,000 by 16:00 on Wednesday. Her initial target was Â£40,000, but this was later increased to Â£200,000. She fled to Brussels with Carles Puigdemont following the Catalan referendum Prof Ponsati had been working as the director of the School of Economics and Finance at the University of St Andrews since January 2016, before being appointed as the Catalan government's education minister in July of last year. She returned to work at St Andrews earlier this month, having been in Belgium since fleeing Spain with Catalonia's ex-leader Carles Puigdemont and three other former cabinet members following an unsuccessful bid to declare independence from Spain in October. A Spanish judge issued arrest warrants on Friday for Prof Ponsati and the other fugitive politicians, including Mr Puigdemont, who was detained by police in Germany. In almost all cases, there is a requirement that the allegations would amount to a criminal offence were it to have occurred in the UK. Prof Ponsati's legal team could argue that rebellion is not a specific criminal offence in Scotland - although there is a crime of treason, which covers disloyalty to the Crown. The extradition request could also be defeated if Prof Ponsati successfully argues that it is politically-motivated. But extradition lawyer Karen Todner told BBC Scotland it is rare for European requests to be refused for this reason, because ""as part of the European Union we are supposed to believe that all requests are fair and proper"". Regardless, the legal process is likely to take several months and could be challenged all the way to the High Court. Supporters gathered outside the court ahead of Prof Ponsati's hearing Scotland's independence movement has close links to its Catalan counterpart, and the SNP is overwhelmingly supportive of Prof Ponsati's cause. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is also the SNP leader, has not explicitly backed Catalan independence and has stressed that her Scottish government cannot intervene in the legal process. Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly said she supports the right of the Catalan people to determine their own future, and has criticised the Spanish government's decision to arrest and imprison pro-independence Catalan politicians. She added: ""The fact that our justice system is legally obliged to follow due process in the determination of extradition requests does not change those views."" The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has requested a meeting with the Spanish ambassador in London to express the party's concern over the treatment of Prof Ponsati and other Catalan politicians.

"Kim was in Beijing, China and NK confirm","This video can not be played Chinese TV showed footage of the two leaders with their wives After days of speculation, it has been confirmed that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un did pay a visit to Beijing. The visit, confirmed by China and North Korea, was Mr Kim's first known foreign trip since taking office in 2011. He held ""successful talks"" with President Xi Jinping, China's Xinhua news agency reported. China is North Korea's main economic ally and it was thought highly likely it would consult Beijing before planned summits with South Korea and the US. Mr Kim is due to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in in late April, and US President Donald Trump in May. The Beijing visit is considered a significant step in North Korea's preparation for the proposed talks. Mr Kim arrived with his wife, Ri Sol-ju, by train on Sunday and left Beijing on Tuesday afternoon, according to reports. During the visit, Mr Kim assured his Chinese counterpart he was committed to giving up his nuclear weapons, Xinhua reported, but with conditions. ""The issue of denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if South Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realisation of peace,"" Mr Kim was reported saying. Why Xi's the one Kim still needs to see Reading the moves - what our correspondents make of the visit Six things to note about Kim's China visit,external The North's conditions include the removal of a US nuclear guarantee for South Korea, observers say. North Korea's KCNA news agency called the visit ""a milestone"" in improving bilateral ties. Mr Kim's arrival and departure were shrouded in secrecy. China said the visit was ""unofficial"" - so there was no announcement of it in advance, promptingspeculation about who was on the trainwhen it was spotted arriving. Because of the visit's ""unofficial"" status, some of the normal protocols were not observed. For example no North Korean country flags were hung around the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square. But it had most of the other trappings of a state visit, including an honour guard and banquet in the Great Hall. Despite the progress in recent months, a number of factors could affect the chances of success. Kim Jong-un may have told the Chinese and the South Koreans that he is willing to abandon nuclear weapons, but of course that comes with conditions, and there are also reports from North Korea that could undermine that stance. Some South Koreans think the drills with US forces should not go ahead Satellite images from last month, published by the New York Times, showwhat looks like a new nuclear reactor ready to go online,externaland the newspaper claims it could produce 20kg of weapons-grade plutonium each year. What Mr Kim might want in return remains unclear. But both North Korea and China have long wanted US troops and weapons out of South Korea, and this is likely to be a key bargaining chip. While Mr Kim has been in Beijing, US and South Korean troops are gearing up for annual military drills which the North has historically seen as provocation. They start on Monday. It's the latest in a flurry of diplomatic activity since the start of the year sparked by the Winter Olympics in South Korea. North Korea crisis in 300 words US-N Korea talks: What could happen now? Profile: Kim Jong-un Relations between North Korea and China, historically strong, had been deteriorating, with China backing US moves to tighten international sanctions in response to the North's growing nuclear threat. But China, a military giant over the border, is still responsible for virtually all of North Korea's food and fuel aid. It has largely been an observer of the recent diplomatic moves by Pyongyang towards the US and South Korea. ""It makes sense for North Korea to explain their positions and co-ordinate with China, their most important partner,"" Andray Abrahamian, research fellow at Pacific Forum CSIS, told the BBC. ""Relations have been extremely strained the last five years and China has been sidelined in the diplomacy of the last several months,"" he said. ""From Beijing's perspective, this is a visit that should have happened some time ago."" Rumours of the visit surfaced in the media earlier this week To some extent, this is a ""symbolic visit of courtesy"" to China, Fyodor Tertitskiy of North Korea monitoring site NK News, said. ""They have two upcoming summits - one with Seoul and one with Washington - and they are probably interested in hearing the Chinese position as well."" KCNA also said Mr Xi had accepted an invitation to return the visit. Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing The comments China's media attributed to both leaders are pretty illuminating if true. Mr Kim reportedly told Mr Xi that because ""the situation is developing rapidly"" he felt he should come to Beijing in person ""out of comradeship and moral responsibility"". Given how tense relations have been recently, following China's imposition of tough economic sanctions, it's significant that Kim made Beijing his first foreign trip, before his planned meetings with Moon and Trump. Crucially, Xi reportedly said China ""sticks to the goal of denuclearisation of the peninsula"" and Kim responded: ""It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearisation."" This may sound bizarre, but there is logic there. They would argue that if they felt sufficiently secure there would be no need for such weapons. The fact that Kim is on the record saying this in Beijing in front of Xi may show that the North Koreans are paving the way for a face-saving nuclear disarmament. China briefed the Trump administration on Tuesday on the visit, Washington confirmed. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies ""We see this development as further evidence that our campaign of maximum pressure is creating the appropriate atmosphere for dialogue with North Korea,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. Trump: N Korea talks could bring world's 'greatest deal' The political gamble of the 21st Century Last month, Mr Trump accepted an unprecedented invitation to meet Mr Kim, after months of hostility and North Korean missile tests. If the summit goes ahead, Mr Trump would become the first sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader. He said on Wednesday that he is ""looking forward"" to the meeting.

Smith & Warner banned for a year,"This video can not be played Cricket Australia CEO admits players cheated Australia captain Steve Smith and vice-skipper David Warner have been banned for a year forball-tampering. Cameron Bancroft, who carried out the cheating in South Africa, was given a nine-month ban by Cricket Australia. The three had already been sent home from Australia's tour - before a fourth Test begins on Friday - amid widespread condemnation stretching beyond sport. Australia's prime minister Malcolm Turnbull had said the affair ""bitterly disappointed the whole nation"". Smith, 28, and Bancroft, 25, have also been suspended from captaining Australia for at least the next two years. Warner, 31, will not be considered for ""any team leadership positions in the future"", Cricket Australia said. Vaughan suspects Australia were ball-tampering during Ashes Ball-tampering & why it is so serious for Australia How do you tamper with a cricket ball? Cricket Australia's investigation also confirmed Bancroft used sandpaper to damage the ball during the third Test against South Africa. It found Smith and Bancroft had made ""misleading public comments"" when on Saturday they instead claimed it had actually been yellow tape. Cricket Australia had already concluded that coach Darren Lehmann was not involved in the controversy and he will remain in his post. The body's chief executive James Sutherland said the three players were ""sad, disappointed and remorseful"". He added: ""This has caused damage to the game as a whole and certainly to Cricket Australia. It has compromised the fans' faith in cricket and it's our responsibility to reinstate that confidence. ""It appears to be an isolated incident but if there are other allegations we will take them further. There was some courage in owning up but there was an element of untruth and that's something we took into consideration."" Smith, Warner and Bancroft are banned from international and Australian domestic cricket. They will also serve 100 hours of ""voluntary service in community cricket"" and can appeal against the suspension. Cricket Australia said the players would be ""permitted to play [Australian] club cricket and will be encouraged to do so"". They also remain eligible for competition outside of Australia, but earlier on Wednesday Smith and Warner were also banned from this season's Indian Premier League. In January the pair were signed to the most lucrative Twenty20 contracts ever offered to an Australian player - reportedly worth over Â£1m each. Before Wednesday's IPL ban, Warner stepped down as captain of Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad. Smith stood down as captain of Rajasthan Royals on Monday. IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla said: ""The players that they [Cricket Australia] have banned, we are also barring those two players from this season. ""The franchises will get replacements for the players."" Bancroft is due to play for Somerset this season. On Monday Somerset said they would wait and ""collate all the relevant information before considering our next steps"". This video can not be played Watch: Bancroft and Smith admit ball-tampering plan After Bancroft's actions were exposed on Saturday, Smith admitted that the Aussie ""leadership group"" had devised a plan to tamper with the ball. Images showed Bancroft take an item out of his trouser pocket before rubbing the ball with it. After the game, Smith described the events as a ""big mistake"" but added he would not stand down as captain. Following the conclusion of the third Test - South Africa won by 322 runs after an Australian batting collapse - the International Cricket Council (ICC) banned Smith for one match and fined him his entire match fee. Bancroft was fined 75% of his match fee and given three demerit points, while Warner was not punished. Having begun its own investigation after the match, Cricket Australia told reporters on Tuesday that it would look to sanction the players - in addition to the punishments by the ICC. Australian cricket commentator Jim Maxwell told BBC Radio 5 live his understanding was that after lunch, Smith saw Bancroft and Warner in ""collusion"". Maxwell said Smith had said to the pair: ""What are you blokes doing? I don't want to know what you're doing"", before then going out onto the field. Cricket Australia saidSmith: knew of a potential plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball failed to take steps to seek to prevent the development and implementation of that plan directed that evidence of attempted tampering be concealed on the field of play sought to mislead match officials and others regarding Bancroft's attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball made misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent and participants of the plan The body saidWarner: developed a plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball instructed a junior player to carry out a plan to take steps to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper provided advice to a junior player regarding how a ball could be artificially altered including demonstrating how it could be done failed to take steps to seek to prevent the development and/or implementation of the plan failed to report his knowledge of the plan at any time prior to or during the match misled match officials through the concealment of his knowledge of and involvement in the plan failed to voluntarily report his knowledge of the plan after the match It foundBancroft: knew of the existence of, and was being party to, the plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper carried out instructions to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball sought to conceal evidence of his attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball sought to mislead match officials and others regarding his attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball made misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent, implementation and participants of the plan Several former players have raised concerns over the position of coach Lehmann. He was spotted in communication via walkie-talkie with the 12th man during the match against South Africa, leading to some to speculate he had been involved in a plan to cheat. Former coach John Buchanan said it would have been ""highly unusual"" for Lehmann not to be aware of his players' plans. However, Sutherland said Lehmann had been using the walkie-talkie to ask ""what was going on?"" and Cricket Australia was ""satisfied he wasn't involved"". ""I want to make that point very clear. Darren is the coach. He continues as coach under his current contract,"" Sutherland added. ""It appears to be an isolated incident but if there are other allegations we will take them further."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan had said he was ""pretty sure"" Australia were tampering with the ball during England's 4-0 Ashes series defeat. The ICC has said it willnot be investigatingthose claims, as the deadline for reporting any such offence has passed. However, it is expected to discuss Australia's ball-tampering against South Africa at its next board meeting at the end of April. Sutherland said while the South Africa incident ""does appear to be isolated"", Cricket Australia had the powers to investigate should further credible allegations arise. The players involved could also suffer financial losses as sponsors seek to distance themselves from the matter - South Korean electronics company LG has already decided not to renew a sponsorship deal with Warner. Sutherland had on Tuesday been reluctant to use the word 'cheating' when Cricket Australia announced that Warner, Smith and Bancroft would be sent home. Despite being asked twice directly whether they had cheated or not, he instead said: ""In the laws of the game, this is not in the spirit of the game. It is not a good day for Australian cricket."" On Wednesday he was asked the same question and replied: ""I think people want to use their own words but certainly cheating is one of those that would be appropriate. ""It's compromised the fans' faith in cricket."" This video can not be played Michael Vaughan - 'Australian team will be remembered for cheating' Smith has been Australia's dominant player in recent years. In his 64 Test matches, he has scored 6,199 runs and made 23 centuries. Named Test captain in 2015, he scored 687 runs as he steered his side to the recent 4-0 Ashes victory over England on home soil, leading to him being compared to legendary batsmanSir Donald Bradman. Warner has been a more controversial figure. He was suspended for the majority of the 2013 Champions Trophy after punching England batsman Joe Root in a bar in Birmingham. The left-hander was nicknamed 'The Bull' when he began his career but his team-mates begancalling him 'The Reverend',externalafter he gave up alcohol. He was named vice-captain when Smith took over from Michael Clarke, and led Australia in Smith's absence in the recent Twenty20 tri-series against England and New Zealand. Warner has a Test average of 48.20 after compiling 6,363 runs in 74 Tests. He wasfined after the first Testagainst South Africa for an altercation with Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. Australia's schedule from the end of June has not been confirmed. But all three players will miss the fourth Test against South Africa, which begins on Friday, and five ODIs and one Twenty20 on a mini tour of England this summer when the limited-overs series begins on 13 June. Under the ICC'sFuture Tours Programme,external, which sets out when countries play one another, Australia could play India, South Africa and Sri Lanka in the period between October 2018 and January 2019. They will all be eligible to play in the 2019 Cricket World Cup, which takes place in England and Wales from 30 May to 14 July.

Weinstein gagging order 'immoral',"Zelda Perkins worked for Weinstein's Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s An ex-assistant of Harvey Weinstein has said she was pressured into signing a non-disclosure agreement [NDA] that was ""morally lacking on every level"". ""There cannot be a legal document that protects criminal behaviour,"" Zelda Perkins told MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee. Ms Perkins said she left Weinstein's company Miramax after a colleague accused him of trying to rape her. Weinstein has denied all allegations of ""non-consensual sexual contact"". He, Miramax and the company's owner Disney were invited to give evidence to the committee, but declined. Weinstein has faced allegations from numerous women Ms Perkins said she felt ""pressure"" to sign the NDA and had been ""unhappy with the entire process"". She said she had tried to make sure the agreement contained restrictions on Weinstein's future conduct, but that they were not subsequently enforced. ""Essentially we were defrauded,"" she told the committee, which is conducting an inquiry into sexual harassment in the workplace. ""We signed that agreement with the belief that Miramax and Harvey Weinstein would uphold their obligations."" Ms Perkins, who worked for Weinstein's Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s, said her former colleague did not talk about the alleged assault to counsellors because she was ""so afraid"" of breaking the agreement. The women were told they could only talk to medical practitioners and legal representatives if those people signed their own NDAs - and even then they were encouraged not to go into detail. ""She sought counselling but she never, ever discussed the events because she was so afraid of this agreement,"" Ms Perkins said. ""She felt she was not allowed to."" Ms Perkins said she was afraid of going to jail herself if she spoke about the events. ""I knew I'd be sued for the damages, for the money, but that wasn't so much my concern,"" she said. ""I thought I was breaking the law."" She is calling for scrutiny on how NDAs were used. ""The problem is they are used abusively and within the law,"" she said. ""There isn't enough regulation and there isn't a framework to protect the victims of the situation."" Ms Perkins said she was never given a copy of the non-disclosure agreement she signed and that she was told by her lawyers they had never seen one like it. ""I was told clearly it was a very broad agreement and, basically, I just couldn't ever say anything about anything to anybody, and just the safest thing was to erase the entire last four years of my life pretty much from my memory. ""At no point was it made clear to me that it was unenforceable or could potentially be unenforceable."" Ms Perkins said her career had ""basically [come] to a halt"" afterwards and that both she and her former colleague had eventually left the country.

Smith & Warner banned for a yearCaptain Steve Smith and vice-skipper David Warner are banned for a year by Cricket Australia over their recent ball-tampering.7m8 minutes agoBBC Sport,"This video can not be played Cricket Australia CEO admits players cheated Australia captain Steve Smith and vice-skipper David Warner have been banned for a year forball-tampering. Cameron Bancroft, who carried out the cheating in South Africa, was given a nine-month ban by Cricket Australia. The three had already been sent home from Australia's tour - before a fourth Test begins on Friday - amid widespread condemnation stretching beyond sport. Australia's prime minister Malcolm Turnbull had said the affair ""bitterly disappointed the whole nation"". Smith, 28, and Bancroft, 25, have also been suspended from captaining Australia for at least the next two years. Warner, 31, will not be considered for ""any team leadership positions in the future"", Cricket Australia said. Vaughan suspects Australia were ball-tampering during Ashes Ball-tampering & why it is so serious for Australia How do you tamper with a cricket ball? Cricket Australia's investigation also confirmed Bancroft used sandpaper to damage the ball during the third Test against South Africa. It found Smith and Bancroft had made ""misleading public comments"" when on Saturday they instead claimed it had actually been yellow tape. Cricket Australia had already concluded that coach Darren Lehmann was not involved in the controversy and he will remain in his post. The body's chief executive James Sutherland said the three players were ""sad, disappointed and remorseful"". He added: ""This has caused damage to the game as a whole and certainly to Cricket Australia. It has compromised the fans' faith in cricket and it's our responsibility to reinstate that confidence. ""It appears to be an isolated incident but if there are other allegations we will take them further. There was some courage in owning up but there was an element of untruth and that's something we took into consideration."" Smith, Warner and Bancroft are banned from international and Australian domestic cricket. They will also serve 100 hours of ""voluntary service in community cricket"" and can appeal against the suspension. Cricket Australia said the players would be ""permitted to play [Australian] club cricket and will be encouraged to do so"". They also remain eligible for competition outside of Australia, but earlier on Wednesday Smith and Warner were also banned from this season's Indian Premier League. In January the pair were signed to the most lucrative Twenty20 contracts ever offered to an Australian player - reportedly worth over Â£1m each. Before Wednesday's IPL ban, Warner stepped down as captain of Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad. Smith stood down as captain of Rajasthan Royals on Monday. IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla said: ""The players that they [Cricket Australia] have banned, we are also barring those two players from this season. ""The franchises will get replacements for the players."" Bancroft is due to play for Somerset this season. On Monday Somerset said they would wait and ""collate all the relevant information before considering our next steps"". This video can not be played Watch: Bancroft and Smith admit ball-tampering plan After Bancroft's actions were exposed on Saturday, Smith admitted that the Aussie ""leadership group"" had devised a plan to tamper with the ball. Images showed Bancroft take an item out of his trouser pocket before rubbing the ball with it. After the game, Smith described the events as a ""big mistake"" but added he would not stand down as captain. Following the conclusion of the third Test - South Africa won by 322 runs after an Australian batting collapse - the International Cricket Council (ICC) banned Smith for one match and fined him his entire match fee. Bancroft was fined 75% of his match fee and given three demerit points, while Warner was not punished. Having begun its own investigation after the match, Cricket Australia told reporters on Tuesday that it would look to sanction the players - in addition to the punishments by the ICC. Australian cricket commentator Jim Maxwell told BBC Radio 5 live his understanding was that after lunch, Smith saw Bancroft and Warner in ""collusion"". Maxwell said Smith had said to the pair: ""What are you blokes doing? I don't want to know what you're doing"", before then going out onto the field. Cricket Australia saidSmith: knew of a potential plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball failed to take steps to seek to prevent the development and implementation of that plan directed that evidence of attempted tampering be concealed on the field of play sought to mislead match officials and others regarding Bancroft's attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball made misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent and participants of the plan The body saidWarner: developed a plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball instructed a junior player to carry out a plan to take steps to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper provided advice to a junior player regarding how a ball could be artificially altered including demonstrating how it could be done failed to take steps to seek to prevent the development and/or implementation of the plan failed to report his knowledge of the plan at any time prior to or during the match misled match officials through the concealment of his knowledge of and involvement in the plan failed to voluntarily report his knowledge of the plan after the match It foundBancroft: knew of the existence of, and was being party to, the plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper carried out instructions to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball sought to conceal evidence of his attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball sought to mislead match officials and others regarding his attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball made misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent, implementation and participants of the plan Several former players have raised concerns over the position of coach Lehmann. He was spotted in communication via walkie-talkie with the 12th man during the match against South Africa, leading to some to speculate he had been involved in a plan to cheat. Former coach John Buchanan said it would have been ""highly unusual"" for Lehmann not to be aware of his players' plans. However, Sutherland said Lehmann had been using the walkie-talkie to ask ""what was going on?"" and Cricket Australia was ""satisfied he wasn't involved"". ""I want to make that point very clear. Darren is the coach. He continues as coach under his current contract,"" Sutherland added. ""It appears to be an isolated incident but if there are other allegations we will take them further."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan had said he was ""pretty sure"" Australia were tampering with the ball during England's 4-0 Ashes series defeat. The ICC has said it willnot be investigatingthose claims, as the deadline for reporting any such offence has passed. However, it is expected to discuss Australia's ball-tampering against South Africa at its next board meeting at the end of April. Sutherland said while the South Africa incident ""does appear to be isolated"", Cricket Australia had the powers to investigate should further credible allegations arise. The players involved could also suffer financial losses as sponsors seek to distance themselves from the matter - South Korean electronics company LG has already decided not to renew a sponsorship deal with Warner. Sutherland had on Tuesday been reluctant to use the word 'cheating' when Cricket Australia announced that Warner, Smith and Bancroft would be sent home. Despite being asked twice directly whether they had cheated or not, he instead said: ""In the laws of the game, this is not in the spirit of the game. It is not a good day for Australian cricket."" On Wednesday he was asked the same question and replied: ""I think people want to use their own words but certainly cheating is one of those that would be appropriate. ""It's compromised the fans' faith in cricket."" This video can not be played Michael Vaughan - 'Australian team will be remembered for cheating' Smith has been Australia's dominant player in recent years. In his 64 Test matches, he has scored 6,199 runs and made 23 centuries. Named Test captain in 2015, he scored 687 runs as he steered his side to the recent 4-0 Ashes victory over England on home soil, leading to him being compared to legendary batsmanSir Donald Bradman. Warner has been a more controversial figure. He was suspended for the majority of the 2013 Champions Trophy after punching England batsman Joe Root in a bar in Birmingham. The left-hander was nicknamed 'The Bull' when he began his career but his team-mates begancalling him 'The Reverend',externalafter he gave up alcohol. He was named vice-captain when Smith took over from Michael Clarke, and led Australia in Smith's absence in the recent Twenty20 tri-series against England and New Zealand. Warner has a Test average of 48.20 after compiling 6,363 runs in 74 Tests. He wasfined after the first Testagainst South Africa for an altercation with Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. Australia's schedule from the end of June has not been confirmed. But all three players will miss the fourth Test against South Africa, which begins on Friday, and five ODIs and one Twenty20 on a mini tour of England this summer when the limited-overs series begins on 13 June. Under the ICC'sFuture Tours Programme,external, which sets out when countries play one another, Australia could play India, South Africa and Sri Lanka in the period between October 2018 and January 2019. They will all be eligible to play in the 2019 Cricket World Cup, which takes place in England and Wales from 30 May to 14 July.

Worboys review: What we have learned,"Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them Until the two-day judicial review hearing, very little was known about John Worboys' 10 years' in custody - and the reasons why the Parole Board granted his release. From legal submissions at the High Court hearing, and documents presented to the court, a picture has built up of a man who was in denial about his offending for most of his sentence. Worboys pleaded not guilty at his trial in 2009, brought a legal challenge against his convictions a year later, and, after being refused permission to bring the appeal, applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to consider his case. Even four years later when he settled civil claims brought by 11 of his victims, paying Â£241,000 compensation, he did not accept liability. According to legal papers from the Mayor of London, a forensic psychologist reported in June 2013 that Worboys had not engaged in any programmes focused on his offending. A separate psychologist, in January 2015, wrote that Worboys maintained that sexual contact with the 12 victims in the cases he was convicted of was consensual. But just four months later there was a dramatic change: Worboys admitted the offences. Worboys appeared via videolink at the High Court hearing Worboys' offender supervisor, a member of prison staff, wrote that the former black cab driver had said he felt ""ashamed"" of his behaviour after reflecting on media coverage about Jimmy Savile, and ""needed to show victim empathy"". A forensic psychologist who interviewed him in June 2015 said he was ""nervous"" and ""tearful"" and wanted to give victims ""their due"" and ""say thank you"" by taking responsibility. ""He also said he had maintained hope that his convictions would be overturned, and that this expectation now felt unrealistic, which was a further motivation to take responsibility for his sexual offending,"" the psychologist wrote. Indeed, Worboys had withdrawn his CCRC application in May that year, at the same time as his admission of responsibility. His apparent sudden about-turn came nine months before his eight-year minimum term was due to expire and four months before his first parole hearing, in September 2015. Phillippa Kaufmann QC, who represented two of Worboys' victims at the judicial review hearing, suggested this was no coincidence. The Parole Board decided the 60-year-old should remain in a 'closed' prison because of the level of risk he posed. In fact, he's been held in Category A, high-security, prison accommodation for his entire sentence. In 2015, on the psychologist's advice, Worboys - who has changed his name to John Radford - began a sex offender treatment programme. In 2017, however, the effectiveness of it was called into question by research showing they do not reduce the likelihood of reoffending and may in fact increase it slightly. The Ministry of Justice scrapped the schemes, yet according to Ms Kaufmann that point was missed by the parole panel at his second, successful, parole hearing. Ahead of that hearing, in November last year, there appeared to be a consensus Worboys had not made enough progress in custody to warrant release, let alone a move to an 'open' prison, where inmates spend time in the community to help them adjust to life on the outside and test whether they're ready for such a move. Worboys' probation officer, known as an offender manager, said he was at the ""start of his treatment pathway"" which needed to be ""full and thorough given the seriousness and proliferation of his offending"". The former black cab driver has admitted attacking the 12 women he was convicted of, but he continues to protest his innocence of more than 80 other allegations, which police date back to 2002 The High Court was told that in an interview in March that year, Worboys had described his victims as ""happy drunks...not nasty"" saying that by consuming alcohol they had ""no respect for themselves"".  The offender supervisor agreed that he was not ready to be let out, as did a psychologist, commissioned by the prison authorities, who suggested only a review of Worboys' security category. But by the time of the parole hearing, last November, there was a sharp divergence of views. The psychologist, who'd been instructed by Worboys on a previous occasion, said they felt Worboys could now be ""safely managed"" in the community as he presented a ""low risk"" of sexual reoffending. Crucially, two other psychologists, who both gave evidence on Worboys' behalf, came to the same conclusion. Ranged against them were four prison and probation staff, consisting of two offender managers and a senior prison psychologist, who all said Worboys had to move gradually to lower security jails before release. The case had also been discussed at meetings of MAPPA (Multi-agency Public Protection Arrangements), a group of police, probation and prison staff responsible for managing violent and dangerous offenders. MAPPA believed Worboys still posed a high risk of harm and should not be released. The parole panel, which the Parole Board said was chaired by an ""experienced"" female member and included a psychologist and a lawyer, also heard evidence from prison officers and Worboys himself - the Board said he was ""questioned in detail"". The Justice Secretary, who opposed release, was represented and one victim submitted a statement. The Panel, which had a 363-pages long dossier of information about Worboys, reached its decision, puzzlingly, on Boxing Day last year, though it wasn't made public until January. It concluded it was no longer necessary for Worboys to be held in prison because he'd taken ""full responsibility"" for his offending, learnt to be ""open and honest"", had a ""good insight"" into his risk factors and posed a ""low risk of future sexual offending"". The Panel said the risks he posed were not ""imminent"" and were ""manageable"" in the community, adding that an increase in risk was not ""inevitable"" and would be detected.

French hero policeman honoured in ParisLt Col Arnaud Beltrame's coffin is being taken through the city ahead of a national memorial service.1han hour agoEurope,"This video can not be played President Emmanuel Macron said Col Beltrame ""fell as a hero"" Tributes have been paid across France to the police officer who died after he offered himself in exchange for a hostage in an Islamist attack. The coffin carrying Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame was driven in heavy rain through Paris, where hundreds of people joined a national memorial service. President Emmanuel Macron said the officer, who was 44, symbolised the ""French spirit of resistance"". Three other people were also killed in Friday's attacks in southern France. Col Beltrame's widow and his friends, family and colleagues attended a ceremony at Les Invalides in the French capital. France lauds hero policeman TrÃ¨bes memorial Mass for victims ""To be willing to die so that innocent people continue to live, this is the heart of a soldier's promise,"" Mr Macron said in his eulogy as the coffin draped in the French flag laid in the cobbled courtyard. ""To be ready to give your own life because nothing is more important than the life of a citizen, this is the ultimate effect of the transcendence he bore."" In the service, also attended by several former French presidents, Mr Macron awarded the officer France's highest accolade, the Legion d'Honneur. Earlier, a minute's silence was observed at all police stations across France, and flags were lowered to half-mast on public buildings. Col Beltrame was awarded France's highest accolade, the Legion d'Honneur The officer was a highly regarded member of the Gendarmerie Nationale, and friends and relatives have remembered his sense of duty and generosity. His brother Cedric told a French radio station on Saturday: ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would."" Col Beltrame's coffin will now travel back to the southern city of Carcassone for his funeral. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris With full honour guard, Arnaud Beltrame's coffin was brought from the Pantheon - the mausoleum for French heroes - through the Latin Quarter and along the quays of the Seine to the Invalides military museum. Small crowds gathered along the way, but the weather was foul and most people were watching the ceremony on live television. It was a nation coming together to salute the ultimatebeau geste, the noble gesture of a gendarme who, by offering himself as a terrorist hostage last Friday, gave his own life to save another's. Delivering the eulogy, President Macron said while the name of the attacker would sink into oblivion, Arnaud Beltrame's name would be remembered for ever. He had joined the ranks of the country's heroes. Mr Macron also urged France to be vigilant in the face of an ""insidious"" threat by Islamist militants - in the last three years, more than 240 people have been killed in attacks across France. ""What we're fighting is clandestine Islamic fundamentalism, which spreads through social media, which does its work out of sight, which preys on weak and unstable minds, and which on our soil corrupts and indoctrinates on a daily basis,"" he said. Col Beltrame's actions helped bring an end to the siege in a supermarket in TrÃ¨bes by 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, who had earlier killed a person in Carcassonne. The gunman - who had claimed to be a supporter of the Islamic State group - had been on an extremist watch list and was known to authorities as a petty criminal, but intelligence services had determined he did not pose a threat. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what was the worst jihadist attack under Mr Macron's presidency. The gunman was shot dead by police. French officials held a minute's silence at the interior ministry Lakdim was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. The attacker's girlfriend, who has not been named, is reportedly a convert to Islam who has been known to security services for at least a year. On Tuesday, she was placed under formal investigation accused of ""associating with terrorists preparing attacks"" and remains in police custody. One other person, a 17-year-old friend of the gunman, was released on Monday after being questioned.

Walmart shelves 'hyper-sexualised' Cosmo,"Cosmopolitan, one of the world's largest magazines, is being removed from view at thousands of checkouts by the US supermarket giant Walmart. The move has been celebrated as a victory by a conservative non-profit group that has lobbied against the magazine's ""hyper-sexualised"" content for years. The National Centre on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) said they had been in ""collaborative dialogue"" with Walmart for months. In a statement, Walmart said the change was ""primarily a business decision"" but ""concerns raised were heard"". They said that while it would be removed from checkouts, Cosmopolitan would still be available to purchase in designated magazine sections in store. Cosmopolitan, which has a print and online reach of tens of millions, told the BBC it was proud of what it had achieved for women around the world. Founded originally in the late 19th Century,the magazine underwent a feminist renaissance in the 1960swhen it became known for pushing the envelope for sexual content, fashion and entertainment gossip.

That reputation has continued today, with dozens of international editions, which Cosmopolitan says cater for the ""fun, fearless female"". Walmart's decision - celebrated by NCOSE as a #MeToo development - raises more questions than answers about where lines are drawn. Promo girls have been the axed from some sporting events in the UKfor similar reasons. Haley Halverson, Vice-President of Advocacy and Outreach for NCOSE, told the BBC that they think the magazine sends the same messages about female sexuality as publications such as Playboy. ""It's filled with articles that are extremely sexually graphic, encouraging its young readership to engage in everything from sexting, to watching pornography. It's also promoting things such as group acts and other forms of risky sex,"" she says. Ms Halverson believes the magazine targets a ""young female demographic"" with its bright covers and cover stars, such as former Disney actors. Her organisation, formerly known as Morality in Media, has already successfully lobbied US hotel chains including Hyatt to stop providing adult films to guests. Should manufacturers be using women to sell cars? Is #MeToo changing Hollywood? Pornography 'desensitising young people' Watch: Do 'dead' models live on in fashion magazines? Supporters of the NCOSE applauded Walmart's decision on social media, while others questioned its logic. ""The magazine has a lot of hyper-sexualised images of women, something that has unfortunately become ubiquitous in our society,"" Ms Halverson says. ""We think they're really contributing to a culture that is normalising male sexual entitlement which gives rise to things like the #MeToo problem."" Both Kirsten King, who has written for Cosmopolitan on women's issues, and freelance feminist writer Suzannah Weiss disagree with the characterisation of the move as part of the #MeToo conversation. Ms Weiss told the BBC it seemed as if the language of feminism and #MeToo was being co-opted in this particular argument. Female writers Kirsten King (left) and Suzannah Weiss (right) admitted women's magazines were not yet perfect ""You can't conflate sex with sexism and say everything related to sexuality is morally wrong,"" she said. ""I sort of agree with them that Cosmopolitan can be problematic. ""But I don't know if they're the worst offender. They have some valid points but I don't really buy that it's corrupting people in the way they're saying."" Kirsten King describes folding Walmart's decision in with #MeToo as ""a stretch"". She said that she believed the move was unfair because it created ""another double standard for women"" as magazines such as Men's Fitness weren't getting the same treatment. ""When women talk about sex, people tend to get incredibly uncomfortable. I don't think it's Selena Gomez in a crop top that is making people uncomfortable here,"" she says. NCOSE criticise the use of former child stars such as Selena Gomez (left) and the Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus (right) ""Saying it's inappropriate for children to see women's bodies teaches children that women's bodies are inappropriate. ""Your child could be walking down the street in a crop top or bikini and shouldn't be taught that's wrong or bad, or is pornography."" Ms Halverson from NCOSE argues that women's magazines, and Cosmo in particular, seem to reinforce ideas of male sexual entitlement. ""If it really was about empowering women they would focus on ways women can get ahead in their careers and other positive coverage,"" she says. ""They may have a niche article now and then. But any cover you pick up will talk about how to please a man sexually."" Kirsten King, who has herself written opinion pieces for Cosmopolitan, disagrees. ""As a teen, Cosmo was where I learned a lot about sex, and while that education was not perfect, in the US sexual education can be super flawed,"" Ms King says. ""I'm a queer woman and I've had the chance to write a couple of op-eds for Cosmo - and maybe that's helped some other blossoming queer kid realise who they are too."" ""The more conversations we have about women's health and sexuality the better. Work has to be done to make them more nuanced, but eliminating them completely or deeming them inappropriate doesn't get us anywhere."" All three agreed that women's magazines had more to do in their representations of women and female sexuality. ""The images we see of women are predominantly sexualised, so we get the idea that is the only acceptable way to be and that's the most important thing about you,"" writer Suzannah Weiss says. She points to the work being done by newer female-led platforms such as Bitch Media. ""At the moment, there aren't really magazine covers with women who don't fit the conventional moulds.""

Legal ruling on black cab rapist release,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women Victims of black cab rapist John Worboys will find out if they have successfully challenged a decision to release him from prison later. The High Court in London will give its ruling on a legal challenge against the Parole Board's decision to free him. Worboys, 60, has served 10 years, including remand time, of an indeterminate prison sentence. At an earlier hearing, two of his victims deemed the decision to grant the rapist's release ""irrational"". Worboys, who is now known as John Radford, was jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London, although police believe he committed crimes against more than 100 women between 2002 and 2008. He was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. After a hearing about his case in November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions. Worboys review: What we have learned Victims told Worboys would serve life-sentence Reality Check: Could Worboys be banned from London? London Mayor Sadiq Khan, wholodged an application for a judicial reviewinto the decision in January, deemed the move ""astonishing and deeply concerning"". The two victims, who brought the case along with Mr Khan, say something went ""badly wrong"" with the Parole Board's decision to free him. Worboys, who has been watching the proceedings via video link from prison, became known as the black cab rapist after attacking victims in his hackney carriage. In May 2015, after protesting his innocence for most of his sentence, he accepted responsibility for sexual offences against the 12 women. His lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald QC, earlier told the court: ""He has completed his tariff and he is therefore entitled to be released if it is not necessary for the protection of the public that he be detained."" The Parole Board argues that its decision was ""lawful and and rational"" and was based on appropriate evidence. Three judges will deliver their decision at the High Court later.

Recycling: Your questions answered,"UK consumers use around 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year but more than three billion are not recycled Firms responsible for a significant proportion of supermarket plastic packaging havesigned a deal to reduce plastic pollution by 2025. More than 40 companies, including Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Asda, have signed up with the government, trade associations and campaigners to form the UK Plastics Pact. The Pact says it's a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to rethink the way we use plastic and its impact on the environment. Recently, the government said it was consideringbanning plastic straws and cotton budsand this came hot on the heels of a proposal to make consumerspay a deposit on drinks bottles and cans. The increased motivation to curb plastic waste and boost recycling comes after the Blue Planet II serieshighlighted the threat of ocean pollution and showed footage of wildlife eating plastic. But as plastic continues to dominate our shopping aisles for now, we asked you to send in any questions you had about these latest proposals and plastic recycling. BBC Environment correspondent Matt McGrath answers Kathryn Baker's question The main way that plastic gets into the seas is via the world's major rivers.Research suggests that 95% of plastic is transported in this way,external. Eight of these rivers are found in Asia. The majority of the plastic in the oceans comes from China but other countries including Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam are also major polluters. However, consumer behaviour in developed countries including the UK, Europe and the US is also a major factor in pushing plastic into the world's waters. According to figures,US citizens produce around 120kg (264lbs) of plastic waste per person every year,external. The UK produces around 76kg (167lbs) of waste while in Sweden, it's around 18kg (40lbs). A ban on plastic straws in England will form part of a consultation later in the year BBC Environment correspondent Matt McGrath answers Mark Bolt's question A major step to expand the reduction of plastics beyond bud, straws and stirrers has been announced in theUK Plastics Pact. Apart from packaging, two of the biggest plastic problems are straws and ear buds. These are among the most widely used items that turn up on beaches around the UK. Plastic cotton buds are often flushed down toilets and are small enough to pass through water filter systems and end up being eaten by fish and other marine creatures. The scale of UK plastic straw use is staggering with a figure of eight-and-a-half billion thrown away each year. The government is consulting on these steps with a possible ban to be introduced next year. Campaigners say that these proposals by government are not enough, and many other products need to be phased out too including plastic film - the UK uses more than a million tonnes a year, most of which can't be recycled. Attempts to cut down on the use of plastic coffee cups in the UK by the introduction of a so-called ""latte levy"" fizzled out earlier this year. The government rejected the idea of a 25p charge on disposable cups, despite the considerable success of a 5p plastic bag charge introduced in England in 2015. BBC Environment correspondent Matt McGrath answers @DaveStock18's question Last December, 193 countries committed toa UN plan to stop plastic waste entering the oceans. However, the commitment is not legally binding and doesn't have a timetable. And different countries have adopted different schemes. Around 40 have banned single-use plastic bags, with charges or outright prohibitions in place in China, Rwanda and many others including Bangladesh. Others including the UK are moving to ban plastic straws and cotton buds.Zero plastic waste shops are opening in many towns and citieswhile plastic-free aisles in stores was part of the25-year plan for nature in the UKput forward by Prime Minister Theresa May. BBC Environment correspondent Matt McGrath answers David Carr's question Any substantial action on an environmental problem like plastic pollution requires a number of key steps that take time. It needs a solid scientific base to determine the scale of the problem such as thelandmark study in 2015 that showed the world the true scale of the plastic problem,externalwith around eight million tonnes entering the oceans every year. More importantly it also needs an informed and motivated public willing to change habits to deal with the problem. In that regard, the global impact of Blue Planet II can't be underestimated. Many governments including the UK, have moved relatively swiftly to consult on ways of curbing plastic use. Large global corporations have also indicated their willingness to reduce plastic over the past five years, but that tide has become a flood in the last year. Marianne You will not need another recycling bin as the scheme will not operate through kerbside collections. In order to reclaim a deposit, customers will need to take their empty bottles to a collection point, which are likely to be located in shops and other public spaces. Some countries which already operate a similar deposit system have installed ""reverse vending machines"" to automate the process of reclaiming a deposit. Many of these machines are able to sort, crush and store used bottles. So-called""reverse-vending"" has operated since 1984 in Sweden,where more than 90% of household waste is recycled. Anonymous Yes, if people have discarded deposit bottles or cans without claiming the deposit, they are fair game for anyone to pick up. You will not need to prove you purchased the bottle in order to claim the deposit. In the times when there was a deposit on glass bottles in the UK, children often used to scoop up waste bottles to make a bit of pocket money. In some US states, the sight of hard-up ""can men"" or ""can women""  gathering cans and claiming the deposit is commonplace. Some pensioners in the German city of Berlin have taken tocollecting plastic bottles to supplement their incomes,external. Arguably a high deposit fee would have the effect of maximising recycling, but also maximising the worth of discarded cans. While it is not yet known how high the deposit is expected to be in England, costs elsewhere range from 22p in Germany and 8p in Sweden. Jane The scheme is only being introduced in England because waste policy is a devolved issue. For example,Waleswas the first of the Nations to introduce a charge for plastic bags in shops in 2011. Northern Irelandfollowed suit in 2013, followed byScotlandin October 2014, andEnglandin 2015. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonannounced a similar deposit return scheme for Scotland in September 2017.,external Mark The government is looking to devise a scheme that doesn't undermine local authority collections. But it's a tricky issue and, ultimately, the effects are uncertain at this stage. There has been some disruption to the recycling system since China resolved at the start of the year to ban imports of waste for recycling. Joseph There are more than 50 different types of plastics, making it more difficult to sort and reprocess than other materials. Nearly all types of plastics can be recycled, but the extent to which they are depends on factors such as whether the technology is available in the area you live. Many recycling collections in the UK have focused on key packaging types, for example plastic bottles, which are heavier than most other plastics and therefore relatively easy to sort. Often packaging can consist of more than one polymer type, which makes it more difficult to recycle. Problematic plastics includeblack plastic food trays,which are used by many supermarkets. They are generally not collected as sorting machines are not able to detect them - the carbon black makes them invisible. If they are collected, they are likely to be rejected at the sorting plant although companies are looking at new technology to get around this problem. Some companies now useyoghurt potsmade out of polyethylene terephthalate - the same material that is used for plastic bottles, making them easily recyclable. But other yoghurt pots are made from polystyrene, which is not usually accepted in recycling schemes. Margarine tubsare often made from a wide range of polymers, which require technology not readily available in the UK - meaning it is often shipped abroad for recycling. Some district and borough councils collectplastic bagsandfilmwith their recycling, but they are not easy to sort mechanically meaning they are very costly to process. Paul Mostyn Many local authorities now allow residents to put plastic trays in their kerbside collection but recycling is managed locally, rather than by central government. What each council decides to recycle depends on the resources available. In Greater Manchester, the only plastic recycled is plastic bottles,externalbecause they don't have the technology available to sort between different types. A bottle and a food tray, for example, can't be recycled together as they melt at different temperatures. Recycle for Greater Manchester, part of England's largest Waste Disposal Authority, says it focuses on plastic bottles as they are in demand by manufacturers that make new products, whereas there is low demand for plastics like yoghurt pots, margarine tubs and plastic trays. However, other areas, such as Surrey, are happy to take those items for recycling. According to the UK Household Plastics Collection Survey 2017, by Recoup - a UK organisation which recycles plastics, 76% of (298) local authorities in the UK collect plastic pots, tubs and trays. Only five local authorities out of 391 do not offer a collection service for plastic bottles, while 19% (75) collect plastic film and 9% (34) collect non-packaging plastics. To find out what you can recycle where you live, click here.,external L. Hudson Plastic bottles are the most commonly collected packaging type because they are easy to sort and can easily be recycled in the UK, where a far higher amount is used than in most countries because it is used as a milk container. Until recently, people were advised to remove lids from their plastic bottles because they were a different colour and could contaminate the bottle stream. However, many processors are now able to separate the lids from the bottles themselves. Check your local area.,external Peter Hickman Yes, squeezable toothpaste tubes are difficult to recycle and it is unusual for councils to collect them as part of their collections schemes. This also applies to other squeezable tubes that contain products, like moisturising creams. However, the pump action toothpaste tubes are made from a different type of plastic and are easier to recycle. Ben Even when plastics can be recycled, some people worry that doing so is even worse for the environment. Recycling paper and glass requires much less energy, so this is a concern more relevant to plastics. According to Prof Thomas Kinnaman, of Bucknell University in the US,,externalrecycling plastic uses roughly double the energy, labour and machinery necessary to put it in landfill. And all recycling has some environmental costs, including more trucks on the road. As modern incinerators produce less and less pollution, they could in theory become a more efficient option in the future. Governments are still encouraging recycling to reduce our need to extract ever more raw material from the environment. Moreover, leaving plastics in landfills can lead to greenhouses gases being released as they begin to break down. Karen Lee The environmental pressure groupGreenpeace sets out nine ways for people to reduce the amount of plastic they throw away.,external Their tips include: avoid packaged vegetables, carry a reusable cup and getting your milk delivered in glass bottles rather than buying plastics ones. Other tips include using Tupperware boxes instead of Clingfilm to keep food fresh and avoiding coffee capsules which cannot be recycled.

Sky Bet 'failed to protect customers',"Sky Bet is to pay Â£1m for ""failing to protect vulnerable customers"", the Gambling Commission has said. It did not stop problem gamblers even after they had asked to be banned from its websites, the watchdog said. Sky Bet chief executive Richard Flint said the firm accepted that it ""needed to do more"" to stop self-excluded gamblers from opening duplicate accounts. He added that Sky Bet had tried to return the money in their accounts. People who feel they are having trouble controlling their gambling can ask betting firms to refuse their service. But 736 self-excluded Sky Bet customers were able to open and use duplicate accounts, the Gambling Commission said. In addition, about 50,000 people who had excluded themselves received marketing emails, texts or push notifications through a mobile app. And 36,748 customers did not get the balance on their account returned after self-excluding. Richard Watson, Gambling Commission programme director, said: ""This was a serious failure affecting thousands of potentially vulnerable customers and the Â£1m penalty package should serve as a warning to all gambling businesses. ""Sky Bet reported the issues to us quickly, co-operated with us and has taken this investigation seriously."" Matt, a trainee accountant from London, started gambling as soon as he turned 18. He says he lost as much as Â£30,000. ""It's a 'lad culture' thing,"" the 22-year-old recently told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.

Customers were able to open up duplicate accounts by initially providing false information, then calling up the contact centre with accurate information, and verifying that information with accurate documentation. ""We at that time didn't have appropriate processes in place to check that there wasn't already an existing account that was a duplicate and was self-excluded,"" Mr Flint said. The firm also didn't have ""sufficient segregation"" in its databases which led to inappropriate marketing, he said. The firm will donate the Â£1m to charities for socially responsible purposes, Mr Flint said in a statement ""We want to reassure people that we have not made any profit out of this episode,"" Mr Flint said. He added that Sky Bet had increased resources ""and focus on helping our customers to gamble safely"", including a TV and online advertising campaign.

The Leeds-based operation, which ismajority-owned by CVC Capital Partners, runs sites including Sky Vegas and Sky Bingo. According to figures released in November, more gamblers are opting to ""ban"" themselves from gambling,with more than a million requests in 2016. The industry is planning to let people who want to self-exclude use a single website from spring 2018. The scheme, which all operators will be required to offer,is called Gamstop,external.

Megabus ads promising Â£1 seats bannedThe advertising watchdog finds as few as one seat per coach was available for the bargain price.10h10 hours agoBusiness,"Megabus ads promising fares from Â£1 have been banned after the company admitted as few as one seat per coach was available at that price. The web ad for a new Aberystwyth to Birmingham Megabus route featured the text ""From Â£1"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said consumers would expect to be able to find the ""from"" price if they booked in advance. A Megabus spokeswoman said future marketing would have a different focus. The ASA also took the Stagecoach-owned operator to task for another web ad that listed routes from Leeds to new Yorkshire destinations, claiming: ""As always, our fares are from Â£1*."" And it questioned a Facebook post that promised ""day trips from Â£1*"" from London to Bath. Two complainants, who searched for tickets and believed that fares were not available at the stated price, challenged whether the claim ""fares are from Â£1*"" was misleading and could be substantiated. The ASA found,externalthat only 4% of fares for the Aberystwyth to Birmingham route were available at Â£1, and 3% for the London to Bath route. The watchdog ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form: ""We told Megabus to ensure in future that when using 'from Â£1' price claims a significant proportion of the advertised fares were available at Â£1, so that consumers would have a reasonable chance of obtaining the products at the advertised 'from' price."" Megabus said the number of fares available at Â£1 for any given route varied due to many factors, such as the number of intermediary stops and the number of tickets booked for the partial and full routes. The coach operator said Â£1 fares were generally available if the booking was made more than four weeks in advance, but this depended on the route. A Megabus spokeswoman said it had always provided clear and transparent pricing and its future marketing would focus on the value offered by its fares, as well as extras such as on-board wi-fi and phone charging points.

USA Gymnastics molester's boss charged,"William Strampel supervised Larry Nassar for several years A former Michigan State University dean who oversaw USA Gymnastics abuser Larry Nassar has himself been arrested for alleged criminal sexual misconduct. William Strampel is accused of inappropriate sexual conduct and of storing nude photos of students, investigators say. The 70-year-old also allegedly failed to properly oversee Nassar despite complaints about his treatments. Nassar, who abused some 265 girls, was sentenced to up to 300 years in prison. USA Gymnastics doctor 'abused 265 girls' After Nassar was jailed in January this year, Michigan's attorney general launched an investigation into how the disgraced doctor was able to evade detection by college authorities for so long. This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar Special prosecutor Bill Forsyth said a ""time sensitive"" tip had led them to Mr Strampel. They searched his work computer and found pornographic images, several of which turned out to be of Michigan State University (MSU) students. Also on the machine was a video of Nassar performing a medical ""treatment"" on a young female patient, according to the affidavit. Mr Strampel's bond was set at $25,000 (Â£17,600) in court on Tuesday, a day after his arrest, and a trial was set for 3 May. The former military colonel, who served in the US army for 25 years, is accused of misconduct in office, two counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct charge, and willful neglect of duty. A charge sheet released by investigators alleges that Mr Strampel: Solicited pornographic images of women, some of whom were MSU students, and kept them on his computer Grabbed the buttocks of two female students Asked a student: ""What do I have to do to teach you to be submissive and subordinate to men?"" Suggested a female student quit medical school and become a centrefold model Stored several pornographic videos on his work computer Made suggestive comments to a student, implying he would exchange academic privileges for sex Told a female student who disputed a test score in June 2017 that ""26-year-old women can 'put out' for 20 minutes with an old man and... get the benefit of a free vacation"" Mr Strampel supervised 54-year-old Nassar, who was a faculty member and worked as a physician at a clinic on the college campus, where much of the abuse took place. Having served as dean of MSU's College of Osteopathic Medicine from 2002-17, Mr Strampel stepped down at the end of last year ostensibly for medical reasons. Mr Strampel appeared for his arraignment by video conference He initially remained on the college's payroll. But in February, MSU fired Mr Strampel for failing to enforce strict protocols introduced to monitor Nassar after Amanda Thomashow accused Nassar of abuse,according to the Detroit Free Press,external. After that complaint against Nassar in 2014, Mr Strampel allowed the doctor to continue treating patients pending the results of an investigation. During this time Nassar was able to molest several more women, according to the affidavit. ""William Strampel did not act with the level of professionalism we expect from individuals who hold senior leadership positions, particularly in a position that involves student and patient safety,"" university interim president John Engler said last month in a statement. The former president of Michigan State University, Lou Anna Simon, resigned hours after Nassar was sentenced in January. Every member of the USA Gymnastics board also quit following Nassar's widely publicised trial. Over the weekend, Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman, who was abused by Nassar, took to social media to call out critics who suggested that gymnasts should stop wearing leotards. Nassar victim, Aly Raisman, poses naked with 'survivor' written on her ""I was recently asked if gymnasts should continue wearing leotards. Leotards r not the problem. The problem is the many paedophiles out there & the adults who enable them. By saying clothing is part of the issue, u are victim shaming/implying survivors should feel it's their fault,"" she tweeted on Sunday night. This video can not be played Gymnast Aly Raisman speaks up against former team doctor A lawyer representing more than 150 Nassar survivors praised the Michigan attorney general for Mr Strampel's arrest. ""It demonstrates that he is serious about investigating the systemic misconduct at MSU that led to the largest child sex abuse scandal in history and holding the responsible parties accountable,"" attorney John Manly said in a statement, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Security boost over Russia threat and terror,"Threats from Russia and organised crime are the focus of a new national security strategy for the UK. In what the prime minister has called a ""fusion doctrine"", the plan will combine intelligence and the Army with economics and diplomacy to defeat UK enemies. Theresa May said ""every capability"" would be used against increasing threats on national security. The review was completed before the Salisbury attack on a Russian ex-spy. Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia,were poisoned with a nerve agentin the Wiltshire city three weeks ago. The UK, US and many EU leaders agree it was highly likely Russia was behind the poisoning, but Russia denies any involvement. UK 'must prepare for Russia fight' Cyber-threat 'as serious as terrorism' Announcing the strategy, Mrs May said the ""reckless act of aggression"" and last year's terror attacks in London and Manchester showed the need for tougher and multi-faceted action. ""These people should be in no doubt that we will use every capability at our disposal to defeat them."" Financial, cultural and diplomatic resources from Whitehall departments will be used to help boost security. Iran and North Korea were also identified as key threats to the UK. Security minister Ben Wallace said the strategy was about creating a ""more focussed, co-ordinated"" approach to modern day threats. He told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""We have to be quicker at staying one step ahead. We have to recognise our adversaries and adapt incredibly quickly to our weaknesses."" Mr Wallace added that new powers would be sought to handle this, but he would not be drawn on precise details.

'Enormous wildcat' found in Aberdeenshire,"This video can not be played One of the largest wildcats ever recorded in the world has been discovered One of the largest wildcats ever recorded in the world is said to have been discovered by field workers in Aberdeenshire's Clashindarroch Forest. Nicknamed the Clashindarroch Beast, it was captured on camera and is estimated to be 4ft (1.2m) from nose to tail. The footage was gathered as part of a Scottish wildcat conservation project operating across the Highlands. Remote traps are baited with food or scent, and anytime something passes in front of it the camera shoots video. Kev Bell, field worker at Wildcat Haven, said: ""I've been fortunate to get footage of quite a few of these ghost cats; there's about 10 to 15 of them here in the Clashindarroch. ""I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw this cat, he is enormous, a magnificent animal."" The technology is used around the world to identify populations of rare and elusive species such as wildcats. Kev said: ""The cameras give us amazing insight to this priceless group of wildcats which have somehow survived here and avoided hybridisation. ""Some people say that the wildcat doesn't exist anymore but we know different and wildcats like 'The Beast' prove it."" Steve Sleigh, another fieldworker with Wildcat Haven, added: ""These cats are a vital part of Scotland's wild nature and ecology, and they must be protected wherever they live; they are one of the rarest animals in the world."" The project involves the neutering of feral domestic cats across more than 1,000 square miles of the West Highlands in an attempt to curb hybridisation. The Clashindarroch Beast will continue to be monitored, as well as wildcat populations in Caithness and Lochaber, where the project began a decade ago.

Megabus ads promising Â£1 seats bannedThe advertising watchdog finds as few as one seat per coach was available for the bargain price.7h7 hours agoBusiness,"Megabus ads promising fares from Â£1 have been banned after the company admitted as few as one seat per coach was available at that price. The web ad for a new Aberystwyth to Birmingham Megabus route featured the text ""From Â£1"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said consumers would expect to be able to find the ""from"" price if they booked in advance. A Megabus spokeswoman said future marketing would have a different focus. The ASA also took the Stagecoach-owned operator to task for another web ad that listed routes from Leeds to new Yorkshire destinations, claiming: ""As always, our fares are from Â£1*."" And it questioned a Facebook post that promised ""day trips from Â£1*"" from London to Bath. Two complainants, who searched for tickets and believed that fares were not available at the stated price, challenged whether the claim ""fares are from Â£1*"" was misleading and could be substantiated. The ASA found,externalthat only 4% of fares for the Aberystwyth to Birmingham route were available at Â£1, and 3% for the London to Bath route. The watchdog ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form: ""We told Megabus to ensure in future that when using 'from Â£1' price claims a significant proportion of the advertised fares were available at Â£1, so that consumers would have a reasonable chance of obtaining the products at the advertised 'from' price."" Megabus said the number of fares available at Â£1 for any given route varied due to many factors, such as the number of intermediary stops and the number of tickets booked for the partial and full routes. The coach operator said Â£1 fares were generally available if the booking was made more than four weeks in advance, but this depended on the route. A Megabus spokeswoman said it had always provided clear and transparent pricing and its future marketing would focus on the value offered by its fares, as well as extras such as on-board wi-fi and phone charging points.

Seven charts on plastic problem,"Marine life is facing ""irreparable damage"" from the millions of tonnes of plastic waste which ends up in the oceans each year, the United Nations has warned. ""This is a planetary crisis... we are ruining the ecosystem of the ocean,"" UN oceans chief Lisa Svenssontold the BBC. But how does this happen, where is most at risk and what damage does this plastic actually do? Plastic as we know it has only really existed for the last 60-70 years, but in that time it has transformed everything from clothing, cooking and catering, to product design, engineering and retailing. One of the great advantages of many types of plastic is that they're designed to last - for a very long time. And nearly all the plastic ever created still exists in some form today. In July a paper published in the journal Science Advances by industrial ecologist Dr Roland Geyer, from the University of California in Santa Barbara, and colleagues,calculated the total volume of all plastic ever produced at 8.3bn tonnes. Of this, some 6.3bn tonnes is now waste - and 79% of that is in landfill or the natural environment. This vast amount of waste has been driven by modern life, where plastic is used for many throwaway or ""single use"" items, from drinks bottles and nappies to cutlery and cotton buds. Drinks bottles are one the most common types of plastic waste. Some 480bn plastic bottles were sold globally in 2016 - that's a million bottles per minute. Of these, 110bn were made by drinks giant Coca Cola. Some countries are considering moves to reduce consumption. Proposals in the UK includedeposit-return schemes, and the improvement offree-drinking water supplies in major cities, including London. It's likely that about 10m tonnes of plastic currently ends up in the oceans each year. In 2010 scientists from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the University of Georgia in Athens estimated the figure as 8m tonnes, and forecast that to rise to 9.1m tonnes by 2015. The same study,published in the journal Science in 2015,external, surveyed 192 coastal countries contributing to ocean plastic waste, and found that Asian nations were 13 of the 20 biggest contributors. China was top of the list of countries mismanaging plastic waste, but the US also featured in the top 20 and contributed a higher rate of waste per person. Plastic waste accumulates in areas of the ocean where winds create swirling circular currents, known as gyres, which suck in any floating debris. There are five gyres around the globe, but the best known is probably the North Pacific gyre. More on this topic: Blue Planet II advisers feel 'shame and anger' at extent of plastic Images of a global problem All the BBC's news on plastic pollution It is estimated debris takes about six years to reach the centre of the North Pacific gyre from the coast of the US, and about a year from Japan. All five gyres have higher concentrations of plastic rubbish than other parts of the oceans. They are made up of tiny fragments of plastic, which appear to hang suspended below the surface - a phenomenon that has led it to being described as plastic soup. And the hard-wearing qualities of most plastics means that some items can take hundreds of years to biodegrade. However, there are moves to clean up the North Pacific gyre. An operation led by a non-profit organisationOcean Cleanup,externalis due to begin in 2018. The Marine Conservation Society found 718 pieces of litter for every 100m stretch of beach surveyed during their recent Great British Beach Clean Up. That was a 10% increase on last year. Rubbish from food and drink constituted at least 20% of all litter collected,the MCS reported.,external The origin of a lot of the litter is difficult to trace, but the public contributes about 30%. ""Sewage-related debris"", or items flushed down toilets that should have been put in the bin, amounted to some 8.5%. For sea birds and larger marine creatures like turtles, dolphins and seals, the danger comes from being entangled in plastic bags and other debris, or mistaking plastic for food. Turtles cannot distinguish between plastic bags and jellyfish, which can be part of their diet. Plastic bags, once consumed, cause internal blockages and usually result in death. Larger pieces of plastic can also damage the digestive systems of sea birds and whales, and can be potentially fatal. Over time, plastic waste slowly degrades and breaks down into tiny micro-fragments which are also causing scientists concern. A recent survey by Plymouth University found that plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish, including cod, haddock, mackerel and shellfish. This can result in malnutrition or starvation for the fish, and lead to plastic ingestion in humans too. The effect on humans of eating fish containing plastic is still largely unknown. But in 2016 the European Food Safety Authority warned of an increased risk to human health and food safety ""given the potential for micro-plastic pollution in edible tissues of commercial fish"".

Teenagers in meningitis B vaccine trial,"This video can not be played Pupil overcomes needle fear to take part in meningitis vaccine trial Teenagers in Great Britain are being asked to take part in a study to learn if immunising them against meningitis B could protect them and other people. The NHS wants 24,000 to take part in the Oxford Vaccine Group's Be On The Team trial, which is helped by National Institute for Health Research funding. Bacteria at the back of the throat can cause meningitis and the study will see if vaccination can stop this happening. The trial will take place in four waves of recruitment over the next two years. Each of the teenagers who chooses to participate, in Year 12 in England or the equivalent in Scotland and Wales, will be put into one of three groups of 8,000 participants and will receive two doses of one of two vaccines. Two of these groups will be in the programme for a year, with the third, which will act as a control group, taking part for 18 months. The recruitment started this week and is planned to work around school holidays and exams, taking place in March-April and September-October this year and in 2019. Meningitis B is a bacterial infection that most often affects children below the age of one It is the most common form of the condition in the UK Since 2015, children under 12 months have been offered the vaccination There are about 1,200 meningitis B cases each year in the UK With early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most people will make a full recovery It is fatal in one in 10 cases About one in four of those who survive is left with long-term problems, such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties Dr Matthew Snape, a consultant paediatrician at the Oxford Vaccine Group, told the BBC: ""We've had great enthusiasm from the schools we have approached, with the majority of Year 12 students interested in taking part. ""The peak of carriage for the bacteria is from the teenage years through to young adulthood - there is a lot of carriage with university students. ""We are doing the study to help us understand whether an immunisation campaign in teenagers would help us to protect the whole community."" Faye Burdett was taken to an accident and emergency unit with a rash on her forehead but died days later Dr Snape said the study's findings would be passed on to policymakers ""to inform any future decisions about adolescent meningococcal immunisation"". And there have already been calls for a wider meningitis B immunisation programme. Following the death of two-year-old Faye Burdett in 2016, a petition set up to ask for all children to be routinely vaccinated attracted 820,000 signatures. As a result, the government published a report last monthexplaining how it made decisions about which vaccines to fund. Meningitis survivor beats odds to ski Girl, six, died after doctor 'failed to spot meningitis' Jeremy Hunt 'apologises' for meningitis care failures Family's call to highlight meningitis B symptoms One of the report's recommendations was to lower the cost-effectiveness threshold for immunisation - widescale vaccination against meningitis B had been rejected as being ""not cost effective"". A consultation on the report is running until 21 May. Georgie Hall, whose six-year-old son died from the condition last October, told the BBC:""The government, I know, are saying that it's not cost effective to vaccinate more children against this disease. We really need the government to listen to the families."" And Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised for ""system failures"" that led to the deaths of two teenagers from the disease in Bristol in 2016. Claire Donovan, head of research and information at Meningitis Now, told the BBC: ""We support the trial, and it's something we've been waiting to happen for a number of years - we are very keen that it goes ahead."" Ms Donovan added that if the trial was successful, ""then potentially vaccinating that age group will help protect the rest of the nation"". Dr Tom Nutt, the charity's chief executive, said: ""This important study is a chance for young people to make a real difference to not only their own health but that of their wider community.""

Wave energy project yet to produce power,"Wave Hub said it was ""disappointed"" that Carnegie had decided to test its device in Australia A Â£42m wave energy project off the Cornish coast has yet to produce any electricity despite being up and running for eight years. Wave Hub, an undersea ""socket"" installed to test wave energy machines,has hosted just one device since 2010. But it was not connected to the shore and one of the project's two remaining potential customers has now pulled out. Wave Hub said it was ""disappointed"" that energy firm Carnegie had decided to test its device in Australia. Carnegie - an Australian company - wasgiven Â£9.6m from the European Regional Development Fund,externalto test its device. Seatricity, the firm behind the only device to have been hosted at Wave Hub, said it was funded by the company and received no public subsidy Wave Hub, based at Hayle in west Cornwall, said the wave energy business was ""unfortunately taking longer to develop"" than anticipated so it was ""diversifying"" and exploring options for testing floating wind turbines. More news from Devon and Cornwall The scheme was financed by the South West of England Regional Development Agency (Â£12.5m), the European Regional Development Fund Convergence Programme (Â£20m) and the UK Government (Â£9.5m). The authorities said at the time that it could generate Â£76m over 25 years for the regional economy. MP for the area, George Eustice, said: ""This is obviously disappointing news. Cornwall has a wave resource that is second to none, however the development of technologies to successfully harness wave energy has taken longer than hoped."" A total of four developers can connect a number of devices into the Wave Hub via the seabed socket, which then supply energy to the national grid. Johnny Gowdy, from Regen South West, which promotes renewable energy systems, said floating wind turbines were a ""great way of using the asset"" and there was more money going into that technology than into wave power. A total of four developers can connect their devices into the Wave Hub In 2006, three companies were signed on for initial development but all pulled out. Michael Ottaviano, chief executive of Carnegie, said that grant support and the feed-in tariff support for wave energy had been removed over the last two years ""and that has led to the situation we have today where we have a world-class piece of infrastructure in Cornwall and no wave technologies like Carnegie operating"". He said wave energy resources were ""exceptional"" in the UK and local expertise was ""world leading"" but ""the better support we can get is in our home country"". He did not rule out returning to the UK ""when the policy settings move again"". Seatricity, the firm behind the only device to have been hosted at Wave Hub, said it was funded by the company and received no public subsidy.

Megabus ads promising Â£1 seats bannedThe advertising watchdog finds as few as one seat per coach was available for the bargain price.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"Megabus ads promising fares from Â£1 have been banned after the company admitted as few as one seat per coach was available at that price. The web ad for a new Aberystwyth to Birmingham Megabus route featured the text ""From Â£1"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said consumers would expect to be able to find the ""from"" price if they booked in advance. A Megabus spokeswoman said future marketing would have a different focus. The ASA also took the Stagecoach-owned operator to task for another web ad that listed routes from Leeds to new Yorkshire destinations, claiming: ""As always, our fares are from Â£1*."" And it questioned a Facebook post that promised ""day trips from Â£1*"" from London to Bath. Two complainants, who searched for tickets and believed that fares were not available at the stated price, challenged whether the claim ""fares are from Â£1*"" was misleading and could be substantiated. The ASA found,externalthat only 4% of fares for the Aberystwyth to Birmingham route were available at Â£1, and 3% for the London to Bath route. The watchdog ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form: ""We told Megabus to ensure in future that when using 'from Â£1' price claims a significant proportion of the advertised fares were available at Â£1, so that consumers would have a reasonable chance of obtaining the products at the advertised 'from' price."" Megabus said the number of fares available at Â£1 for any given route varied due to many factors, such as the number of intermediary stops and the number of tickets booked for the partial and full routes. The coach operator said Â£1 fares were generally available if the booking was made more than four weeks in advance, but this depended on the route. A Megabus spokeswoman said it had always provided clear and transparent pricing and its future marketing would focus on the value offered by its fares, as well as extras such as on-board wi-fi and phone charging points.

Fish tank fumes leave 10 in hospital,"""Potentially toxic"" fumes were emitted from coral in a fish tank (stock image) Ten people were taken to hospital after inhaling chemicals released from a fish tank in an Oxfordshire village. The ""potentially toxic"" fumes were emitted from coral being cleared from an aquarium at a house Hanney Road, Steventon, on Monday evening. About 50 emergency services personnel attended, including a hazardous area response team and three ambulances. Scientist Dr Mike Leahy said the people were probably exposed to ""palytoxins"" released by the coral. Six members of a family and four firefighters were taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and three family members were kept in overnight after suffering ""flu-like symptoms"" and eye irritation. TV presenter Dr Leahy said he was caught inside the police cordon while visiting his mother, who lives on the same road. He said after hearing about what happened he realised the coral was likely to have released ""palytoxins"" that can be ""incredibly lethal"". ""In the main they're absolutely harmless but sometimes if you stress certain types of coral, they can produce a toxin,"" he said. He added that ""if ingested it can be lethal"" but that inhaling fumes was far less dangerous. Two dogs were also removed from the house and the remaining coral was dealt with by firefighters in ""full body cover, gas-tight suits"". Allow Twitter content?

Shoppers to pay deposit for drinks,"This video can not be played How Norway is tackling the problem of plastic waste People in England will soon have to pay a deposit when they buy drinks bottles and cans in a bid to boost recycling and cut waste. The deposit will increase prices - but consumers will get the money back if they return the container. The scheme is expected to cover single-use glass and plastic bottles, and steel and aluminium cans. Full details are subject to consultation and yet to be decided, including how big the deposit will be. But costs in similar schemes elsewhere range from 22p in Germany and 8p in Sweden. The government announcement comes after the Blue Planet II series highlightedthe threat of ocean pollutionand showed footage of wildlife eating plastic. Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Five ways to break up with plastic UK faces build-up of plastic waste Deposit return scheme: Who would pay? Environment Secretary Michael Gove said there was no doubt that plastic was ""wreaking havoc"" on the marine environment and discarded plastic bottles and cans ""end up dumped on pavements and lobbed into rivers, lakes and the sea"". ""We have already banned harmful microbeads and cut plastic bag use, and now we want to take action on plastic bottles to help clean up our oceans,"" he said. ""We need to see a change in attitudes and behaviour. And the evidence shows that reward and return schemes are a powerful agent of change."" This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic UK consumers use around 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year but more than three billion are not recycled. Scotlandhas already announced plans for a deposit return scheme,externaland in Wales, ministers said they want to helpimplement a UK-wide system. Northern Ireland will consider the approach as part of a review later this year. Similar schemes in northern Europe have led to a big increase in the amount of plastic recycled. About 40 countries worldwide  - including Germany, Sweden and Israel - and 21 US states have some kind of deposit return scheme for plastic bottles. The schemes take different forms in different countries. Most involve returning bottles to an automated collection point or to the shop from which they were purchased. What happens to the money from unredeemed deposits, when people don't return a bottle to a collection point, also varies. In some countries it is kept by the producer or retailer while in others the money is donated to charity or returned to a centralised operator of the system, which normally ploughs that money back into running the scheme. The German system is estimated to have cost about Â£600m (726m euros) as an initial set up, and about Â£700m (793m euros) annually for maintenance. There the cost is borne by the retailer but in other countries unclaimed deposits pay for it. The British Plastics Federation estimates it could cost Â£1bn to set up a scheme in the UK, and another Â£1bn a year in running costs. The announcement has been welcomed by environmental campaigners, but industry may be worried about the price tag. It may be asked to pick up the bill for the deposit return scheme. Currently plastics producers pay just 10% of the cost of recycling packaging. Councils will also be anxious to ensure that kerbside collecting is not undercut when details are confirmed. Ministers have visited deposit return schemes in several north European nations. Theywere impressed by a Norwegian scheme, which claims a 94% recycling rate for bottles made from PET, the clear plastic used for water and fizzy drinks. The entire scheme in Norway was set up by the beverage industry after the government slapped a tax on every un-recycled bottle. The drinks industry has installed machines in shops that take in used bottles and cans and give back a coupon to return the deposit. Mr Gove saidthe 5p levy put on plastic bagsproved how effectively the UK could respond as consumption of single-use carrier bags was down 83%. He said it was vital to act, pointing to two reports last week. One saidplastic pollution in the sea would treble in a decade unless marine litter is curbed. The other warned thatthe Great Pacific Garbage Patch- an artificial island of plastic material twice the size of France - is thought to contain 79,000 tonnes of floating waste - that is up to 16 times more plastic and microplastic particles than previously estimated. Samantha Harding, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ""This is a brilliant and significant decision by Michael Gove. ""I am thrilled that we will finally see the many benefits a deposit system will bring to England, not least the absence of ugly drinks containers in our beautiful countryside. ""What's significant is that producers will now pay the full costs of their packaging, reducing the burden on the taxpayer and setting a strong precedent for other schemes where the polluter pays."" The British Retail Consortium welcomed the idea but added it wanted costs to be proportionate to the size of the retailer. Its director of food and sustainability, Andrew Opie, said a ""more coordinated, comprehensive approach"" focusing on manufacturer responsibility was needed to tackle plastic packaging in general. However, the British Plastics Federation says convenience is key to the scheme's success and retailers could face costs of tens of thousands of pounds. Director Barry Turner told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money: ""Part of the problem with the fact that people do not dispose of containers in the right way is that there's not a convenient infrastructure to do that so there are going to have to be a lot of them and they're going to have to be conveniently located. ""I think that's one of the big challenges."" Supermarket Tesco says this is ""only one aspect"" of helping to reduce waste in the UK.

Plastic recycling: Your questions answered,"UK consumers use around 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year but more than three billion are not recycled Firms responsible for a significant proportion of supermarket plastic packaging havesigned a deal to reduce plastic pollution by 2025. More than 40 companies, including Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Asda, have signed up with the government, trade associations and campaigners to form the UK Plastics Pact. The Pact says it's a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to rethink the way we use plastic and its impact on the environment. Recently, the government said it was consideringbanning plastic straws and cotton budsand this came hot on the heels of a proposal to make consumerspay a deposit on drinks bottles and cans. The increased motivation to curb plastic waste and boost recycling comes after the Blue Planet II serieshighlighted the threat of ocean pollution and showed footage of wildlife eating plastic. But as plastic continues to dominate our shopping aisles for now, we asked you to send in any questions you had about these latest proposals and plastic recycling. BBC Environment correspondent Matt McGrath answers Kathryn Baker's question The main way that plastic gets into the seas is via the world's major rivers.Research suggests that 95% of plastic is transported in this way,external. Eight of these rivers are found in Asia. The majority of the plastic in the oceans comes from China but other countries including Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam are also major polluters. However, consumer behaviour in developed countries including the UK, Europe and the US is also a major factor in pushing plastic into the world's waters. According to figures,US citizens produce around 120kg (264lbs) of plastic waste per person every year,external. The UK produces around 76kg (167lbs) of waste while in Sweden, it's around 18kg (40lbs). A ban on plastic straws in England will form part of a consultation later in the year BBC Environment correspondent Matt McGrath answers Mark Bolt's question A major step to expand the reduction of plastics beyond bud, straws and stirrers has been announced in theUK Plastics Pact. Apart from packaging, two of the biggest plastic problems are straws and ear buds. These are among the most widely used items that turn up on beaches around the UK. Plastic cotton buds are often flushed down toilets and are small enough to pass through water filter systems and end up being eaten by fish and other marine creatures. The scale of UK plastic straw use is staggering with a figure of eight-and-a-half billion thrown away each year. The government is consulting on these steps with a possible ban to be introduced next year. Campaigners say that these proposals by government are not enough, and many other products need to be phased out too including plastic film - the UK uses more than a million tonnes a year, most of which can't be recycled. Attempts to cut down on the use of plastic coffee cups in the UK by the introduction of a so-called ""latte levy"" fizzled out earlier this year. The government rejected the idea of a 25p charge on disposable cups, despite the considerable success of a 5p plastic bag charge introduced in England in 2015. BBC Environment correspondent Matt McGrath answers @DaveStock18's question Last December, 193 countries committed toa UN plan to stop plastic waste entering the oceans. However, the commitment is not legally binding and doesn't have a timetable. And different countries have adopted different schemes. Around 40 have banned single-use plastic bags, with charges or outright prohibitions in place in China, Rwanda and many others including Bangladesh. Others including the UK are moving to ban plastic straws and cotton buds.Zero plastic waste shops are opening in many towns and citieswhile plastic-free aisles in stores was part of the25-year plan for nature in the UKput forward by Prime Minister Theresa May. BBC Environment correspondent Matt McGrath answers David Carr's question Any substantial action on an environmental problem like plastic pollution requires a number of key steps that take time. It needs a solid scientific base to determine the scale of the problem such as thelandmark study in 2015 that showed the world the true scale of the plastic problem,externalwith around eight million tonnes entering the oceans every year. More importantly it also needs an informed and motivated public willing to change habits to deal with the problem. In that regard, the global impact of Blue Planet II can't be underestimated. Many governments including the UK, have moved relatively swiftly to consult on ways of curbing plastic use. Large global corporations have also indicated their willingness to reduce plastic over the past five years, but that tide has become a flood in the last year. Marianne You will not need another recycling bin as the scheme will not operate through kerbside collections. In order to reclaim a deposit, customers will need to take their empty bottles to a collection point, which are likely to be located in shops and other public spaces. Some countries which already operate a similar deposit system have installed ""reverse vending machines"" to automate the process of reclaiming a deposit. Many of these machines are able to sort, crush and store used bottles. So-called""reverse-vending"" has operated since 1984 in Sweden,where more than 90% of household waste is recycled. Anonymous Yes, if people have discarded deposit bottles or cans without claiming the deposit, they are fair game for anyone to pick up. You will not need to prove you purchased the bottle in order to claim the deposit. In the times when there was a deposit on glass bottles in the UK, children often used to scoop up waste bottles to make a bit of pocket money. In some US states, the sight of hard-up ""can men"" or ""can women""  gathering cans and claiming the deposit is commonplace. Some pensioners in the German city of Berlin have taken tocollecting plastic bottles to supplement their incomes,external. Arguably a high deposit fee would have the effect of maximising recycling, but also maximising the worth of discarded cans. While it is not yet known how high the deposit is expected to be in England, costs elsewhere range from 22p in Germany and 8p in Sweden. Jane The scheme is only being introduced in England because waste policy is a devolved issue. For example,Waleswas the first of the Nations to introduce a charge for plastic bags in shops in 2011. Northern Irelandfollowed suit in 2013, followed byScotlandin October 2014, andEnglandin 2015. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonannounced a similar deposit return scheme for Scotland in September 2017.,external Mark The government is looking to devise a scheme that doesn't undermine local authority collections. But it's a tricky issue and, ultimately, the effects are uncertain at this stage. There has been some disruption to the recycling system since China resolved at the start of the year to ban imports of waste for recycling. Joseph There are more than 50 different types of plastics, making it more difficult to sort and reprocess than other materials. Nearly all types of plastics can be recycled, but the extent to which they are depends on factors such as whether the technology is available in the area you live. Many recycling collections in the UK have focused on key packaging types, for example plastic bottles, which are heavier than most other plastics and therefore relatively easy to sort. Often packaging can consist of more than one polymer type, which makes it more difficult to recycle. Problematic plastics includeblack plastic food trays,which are used by many supermarkets. They are generally not collected as sorting machines are not able to detect them - the carbon black makes them invisible. If they are collected, they are likely to be rejected at the sorting plant although companies are looking at new technology to get around this problem. Some companies now useyoghurt potsmade out of polyethylene terephthalate - the same material that is used for plastic bottles, making them easily recyclable. But other yoghurt pots are made from polystyrene, which is not usually accepted in recycling schemes. Margarine tubsare often made from a wide range of polymers, which require technology not readily available in the UK - meaning it is often shipped abroad for recycling. Some district and borough councils collectplastic bagsandfilmwith their recycling, but they are not easy to sort mechanically meaning they are very costly to process. Paul Mostyn Many local authorities now allow residents to put plastic trays in their kerbside collection but recycling is managed locally, rather than by central government. What each council decides to recycle depends on the resources available. In Greater Manchester, the only plastic recycled is plastic bottles,externalbecause they don't have the technology available to sort between different types. A bottle and a food tray, for example, can't be recycled together as they melt at different temperatures. Recycle for Greater Manchester, part of England's largest Waste Disposal Authority, says it focuses on plastic bottles as they are in demand by manufacturers that make new products, whereas there is low demand for plastics like yoghurt pots, margarine tubs and plastic trays. However, other areas, such as Surrey, are happy to take those items for recycling. According to the UK Household Plastics Collection Survey 2017, by Recoup - a UK organisation which recycles plastics, 76% of (298) local authorities in the UK collect plastic pots, tubs and trays. Only five local authorities out of 391 do not offer a collection service for plastic bottles, while 19% (75) collect plastic film and 9% (34) collect non-packaging plastics. To find out what you can recycle where you live, click here.,external L. Hudson Plastic bottles are the most commonly collected packaging type because they are easy to sort and can easily be recycled in the UK, where a far higher amount is used than in most countries because it is used as a milk container. Until recently, people were advised to remove lids from their plastic bottles because they were a different colour and could contaminate the bottle stream. However, many processors are now able to separate the lids from the bottles themselves. Check your local area.,external Peter Hickman Yes, squeezable toothpaste tubes are difficult to recycle and it is unusual for councils to collect them as part of their collections schemes. This also applies to other squeezable tubes that contain products, like moisturising creams. However, the pump action toothpaste tubes are made from a different type of plastic and are easier to recycle. Ben Even when plastics can be recycled, some people worry that doing so is even worse for the environment. Recycling paper and glass requires much less energy, so this is a concern more relevant to plastics. According to Prof Thomas Kinnaman, of Bucknell University in the US,,externalrecycling plastic uses roughly double the energy, labour and machinery necessary to put it in landfill. And all recycling has some environmental costs, including more trucks on the road. As modern incinerators produce less and less pollution, they could in theory become a more efficient option in the future. Governments are still encouraging recycling to reduce our need to extract ever more raw material from the environment. Moreover, leaving plastics in landfills can lead to greenhouses gases being released as they begin to break down. Karen Lee The environmental pressure groupGreenpeace sets out nine ways for people to reduce the amount of plastic they throw away.,external Their tips include: avoid packaged vegetables, carry a reusable cup and getting your milk delivered in glass bottles rather than buying plastics ones. Other tips include using Tupperware boxes instead of Clingfilm to keep food fresh and avoiding coffee capsules which cannot be recycled.

Seven charts explain plastic problem,"Marine life is facing ""irreparable damage"" from the millions of tonnes of plastic waste which ends up in the oceans each year, the United Nations has warned. ""This is a planetary crisis... we are ruining the ecosystem of the ocean,"" UN oceans chief Lisa Svenssontold the BBC. But how does this happen, where is most at risk and what damage does this plastic actually do? Plastic as we know it has only really existed for the last 60-70 years, but in that time it has transformed everything from clothing, cooking and catering, to product design, engineering and retailing. One of the great advantages of many types of plastic is that they're designed to last - for a very long time. And nearly all the plastic ever created still exists in some form today. In July a paper published in the journal Science Advances by industrial ecologist Dr Roland Geyer, from the University of California in Santa Barbara, and colleagues,calculated the total volume of all plastic ever produced at 8.3bn tonnes. Of this, some 6.3bn tonnes is now waste - and 79% of that is in landfill or the natural environment. This vast amount of waste has been driven by modern life, where plastic is used for many throwaway or ""single use"" items, from drinks bottles and nappies to cutlery and cotton buds. Drinks bottles are one the most common types of plastic waste. Some 480bn plastic bottles were sold globally in 2016 - that's a million bottles per minute. Of these, 110bn were made by drinks giant Coca Cola. Some countries are considering moves to reduce consumption. Proposals in the UK includedeposit-return schemes, and the improvement offree-drinking water supplies in major cities, including London. It's likely that about 10m tonnes of plastic currently ends up in the oceans each year. In 2010 scientists from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the University of Georgia in Athens estimated the figure as 8m tonnes, and forecast that to rise to 9.1m tonnes by 2015. The same study,published in the journal Science in 2015,external, surveyed 192 coastal countries contributing to ocean plastic waste, and found that Asian nations were 13 of the 20 biggest contributors. China was top of the list of countries mismanaging plastic waste, but the US also featured in the top 20 and contributed a higher rate of waste per person. Plastic waste accumulates in areas of the ocean where winds create swirling circular currents, known as gyres, which suck in any floating debris. There are five gyres around the globe, but the best known is probably the North Pacific gyre. More on this topic: Blue Planet II advisers feel 'shame and anger' at extent of plastic Images of a global problem All the BBC's news on plastic pollution It is estimated debris takes about six years to reach the centre of the North Pacific gyre from the coast of the US, and about a year from Japan. All five gyres have higher concentrations of plastic rubbish than other parts of the oceans. They are made up of tiny fragments of plastic, which appear to hang suspended below the surface - a phenomenon that has led it to being described as plastic soup. And the hard-wearing qualities of most plastics means that some items can take hundreds of years to biodegrade. However, there are moves to clean up the North Pacific gyre. An operation led by a non-profit organisationOcean Cleanup,externalis due to begin in 2018. The Marine Conservation Society found 718 pieces of litter for every 100m stretch of beach surveyed during their recent Great British Beach Clean Up. That was a 10% increase on last year. Rubbish from food and drink constituted at least 20% of all litter collected,the MCS reported.,external The origin of a lot of the litter is difficult to trace, but the public contributes about 30%. ""Sewage-related debris"", or items flushed down toilets that should have been put in the bin, amounted to some 8.5%. For sea birds and larger marine creatures like turtles, dolphins and seals, the danger comes from being entangled in plastic bags and other debris, or mistaking plastic for food. Turtles cannot distinguish between plastic bags and jellyfish, which can be part of their diet. Plastic bags, once consumed, cause internal blockages and usually result in death. Larger pieces of plastic can also damage the digestive systems of sea birds and whales, and can be potentially fatal. Over time, plastic waste slowly degrades and breaks down into tiny micro-fragments which are also causing scientists concern. A recent survey by Plymouth University found that plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish, including cod, haddock, mackerel and shellfish. This can result in malnutrition or starvation for the fish, and lead to plastic ingestion in humans too. The effect on humans of eating fish containing plastic is still largely unknown. But in 2016 the European Food Safety Authority warned of an increased risk to human health and food safety ""given the potential for micro-plastic pollution in edible tissues of commercial fish"".
