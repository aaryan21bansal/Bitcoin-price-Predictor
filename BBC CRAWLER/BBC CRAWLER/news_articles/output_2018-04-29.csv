"Labour pledges to cap overdraft feesShadow chancellor John McDonnell says he wants to end the ""national scandal"" of poor families in debt.8m8 minutes agoBusiness","Labour said the policy could help 2.7 million people who are stuck with permanent overdrafts Labour says it would cap the total amount anyone could pay in bank overdraft fees or interest repayments. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he wanted to end the ""national scandal"" of low paid families trapped in debt. Labour said the policy could help 2.7 million people who are stuck with permanent overdrafts, saving them the equivalent of Â£86 each per year. The Treasury said it had already tightened the rules to protect debtors and cracked down on payday loans. Call for stricter rules on doorstep loans Sheen tackles high cost of rent-to-own Mr McDonnell said: ""Too many families are having to rely on borrowing just to get to the end of the month, and are facing huge costs from our High Street banks. ""The national scandal of the low paid debt trap has to end. More needs to be done to level the playing field and bring greater fairness in consumer finance."" Actor and campaigner Michael Sheen is supporting the proposal According to Labour, people stuck with permanent overdrafts use them more than 85% of the time while incurring higher charges. The party also said overdraft charges could be up to four times higher than the equivalent borrowing from payday lending. Under the policy, regulators would impose a limit of Â£24 per month per Â£100 borrowed on any interest, fees and charges related to an overdraft. That would be equivalent to the current cap on payday loan interest charges. The proposal was welcomed by the actor and founder of the campaign group End High Cost Credit Alliance, Michael Sheen. Payday lenders like Wonga have faced tougher rules since 2015 The Frost/Nixon star, who is a Labour supporter, said: ""High cost credit is more than just pay day loans, rent to own businesses or doorstep lending. ""Millions of people across the UK are also trapped in their overdrafts by extortionate rates of interest charged by reputable high street banks."" Banks say they have introduced a number of measures to help customers avoid going into their overdrafts and minimise any charges when they do. These include accounts with ""overdraft buffers"", in which no overdraft fees are charged, and alerts for customers who are about to enter into an unarranged overdraft. The government has also taken steps to help vulnerable people in debt. Last year it committed to introducing a six-week grace period in which debtors would be protected from enforcement proceedings and mounting interest charges. And in 2015, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a cap on payday loan costs following criticism of lenders. The FCA has also raised concerns about overdrafts and plans to consult on possible remedies later this year. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We know that families can struggle with debt. That is why we have tightened the rules to ensure that money can only be lent to people who can afford to repay. ""We have also cracked down on payday loans, saving borrowers over Â£150m a year, and are introducing an energy cap to help people with household bills.""

Ex-Commons Speaker Lord Martin dies aged 72,"Former House of Commons Speaker Lord Martin of Springburn, has died aged 72, his family have said. The ex-Labour MP, who represented Glasgow, ""passed away peacefully"" on Sunday morning after a short illness, his son Paul confirmed. As Michael Martin, he was Speaker from 2000 to 2009 but resigned in the wake of the expenses scandal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""very sorry"" to hear of Lord Martin's death. ""Michael loved his community and family, our thoughts are with them at this sad time,"" he said. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Lord Martin had been ""an authentic working-class voice in Parliament"". ""He never forgot where he came from, the community he served and the trade union movement, which gave him his education,"" Mr Leonard said. In a statement, Lord Martin's son Paul said: ""He passed away peacefully with his family. ""We would be grateful for our privacy to be respected at this difficult time."" By Brian Wheeler, BBC News political reporter Martin made changes to some of the centuries-old traditions surrounding the role of Speaker The son of a merchant seaman and a cleaner, Lord Martin of Springburn symbolised for many in the Labour movement the opportunities their party offered to working class people to rise above their origins. Michael Martin was intensely proud of his Glasgow roots and the way he had overcome a difficult start in life to ascend to one of the highest ceremonial roles in the land. His Glaswegian accent and background as a sheet metal worker and union official led him to be dubbed ""Gorbals Mick"" by some Conservative MPs and newspaper sketch writers. In fact, he had been born in a tenement in the nearby Anderston area, on the north bank of the River Clyde. Read more Tributes to Lord Martin have been paid by friends and fellow politicians. Current Speaker John Bercow said Lord Martin was a ""decent, public-spirited man who had a real care and concern for members [of Parliament], their staff and the staff of the House"". He added: ""He was a good campaigner and both passionate about and proud of his roots. He also had a great sense of humour. ""On a personal level, he was always very kind to me - I still remember the lovely letter of congratulations he sent to me after my election as Speaker. ""My deepest sympathies go out to Mary, his children and grandchildren."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmondcalled Lord Martin a ""thoroughly decent man"",externaland praised his ""absolute fairness"" as Speaker. And Angus Robertson, former SNP Westminster leader,called Lord Martin a ""kind and gentle man"",external. Glasgow Labour leader Frank McAveety said Lord Martinwas ""very proud"" of his Glaswegian background,external. Lord Martin - latterly Lord Martin of Springburn after the Glasgow constituency he represented from 1979 to 2005 - succeeded Baroness Boothroyd as Speaker in 2000. From 2005 to 2009 he also was the Glasgow North East MP. Lord Martin was seen as on the right of his party and a social conservative on matters such as abortion and homosexuality. Following his appointment as Speaker, he held a news conference - provoking critics to say he had broken the convention of keeping a distance from the media. He was the first Roman Catholic to serve in the role since the Reformation and he was not shy of disposing with other centuries-old traditions. He did away with the tights worn by Speakers in favour of dark flannel trousers. He also continued the precedent set by his predecessor as Speaker, Betty Boothroyd, and did not wear the wig that had been traditional for previous incumbents. He also appointed the first PR adviser to the House of Commons Commission. By tradition, Speakers are elevated to the Lords, but the decision to grant Lord Martin's peerage was controversial. As Speaker he came under fire for his own past expenses claims, but it was his reaction to the allegations against others that provoked criticism. He told the Commons there should be a police investigation into the source of the leak to the Daily Telegraph, which broke the story of MPs expenses.

Photographer 'groped' Swedish princessThe French photographer is at the centre of a sexual misconduct scandal at the Swedish Academy.9h9 hours agoEurope,"French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault is accused of groping Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria (pictured) The man at the centre of a sexual abuse scandal at the Swedish Academy - the body that awards the Nobel Prize in Literature - has been accused of groping the heir to the Swedish throne. French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault denies groping Crown Princess Victoria at an Academy event in 2006. It follows areport in the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper,externalthat quoted three people who said they saw the incident. One witness said an aide had forcibly removed Mr Arnault's hand. ""Her female aide, it was really something to see, threw herself forward and pushed him away,"" Ebba Witt-BrattstrÃ¶m toldthe Expressen newspaper,external. The Royal Family has not commented on the incident, but issued a general statement expressing support for the#MeToo campaign. Is #MeToo changing Hollywood? Why women fear a #MeToo backlash Mr Arnault, the husband of a former Academy member, has faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct which he denies. The scandal has sparked a wave of resignations in the Academy, raising major questions about whether it will be able to award the Nobel prize later this year. The organisation has been criticised for its handling of a probe into the alleged sexual misconduct of Mr Arnault, who is married to former Academy member Katarina Frostenson. Last November, inspired by the #MeToo campaign,18 women made allegations of sexual assault and harassment,externalagainst him. Several of the alleged incidents reportedly happened in properties belonging to the Academy. The organisation then voted against removing Ms Frostenson from its 18-person committee. This sparked resignations from three of its members - Klas Ostergren, Kjell Espmark and Peter Englund. Technically they cannot resign from their positions, which are for life, but they can stop participating in the Academy's activities. Sara Danius quit as head of the Academy over the scandal Soon afterwards the head of the Academy, Professor Sara Danius, stepped down. ""It has already affected the Nobel Prize quite severely and that is quite a big problem,"" she said at the time. In total, six members have quit the committee since the first allegations were made. That is not clear, but the wave of resignations has raised questions about whether the Nobel Prize for Literature will be awarded later this year. The remaining 11 members have reportedly discussed cancelling the prize, which is voted on and awarded in October. A member of the Academy,Per WÃ¤stberg, told the Guardian newspaper on Friday that the award may be postponed,external. ""There will most probably be a statement on whether we will award a prize this year or reserve it for next year, in which case two prizes for literature will be announced in October 2019,"" he said. A decision is expected on Thursday. If the prize is cancelled it would be the first time since World War Two that the Academy has failed to award a Nobel Prize for Literature.

Wanted men 'kicked and beaten with iron bars',"Pictures shared on social media appear to show James White and Alexis Guesto tied up and covered in paint Police say they have had to ""redirect resources towards investigating a serious assault"" after two wanted men were ""kicked and beaten with iron bars,"" in County Armagh . They were then ""further assaulted"" and ""covered in paint"". James White and Alexis Guesto were taken back into custody after they were foundtied up on a bench in Mullaghbawn. They were wanted for offences including breach of licence and warrants. Images shared on social media on Saturday appear to show them tied up and covered in paint. Police said that due to the ""violent actions of a small number of people, we have had to redirect resources and efforts towards investigating a serious assault."" The police said both men had sustained injuries and have been taken to hospital for treatment. One of the men has been arrested and the other remains in hospital. Police said both men will appear in court at the ""earliest opportunity in relation to the matters for which they were being sought"". Police had said Alexis Guesto and James White were wanted for a range of offences Det Ch Insp Jill Duffie, from the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, said:  ""Throughout yesterday as our search for the two men was ongoing, I was pleased with the response from the local community and the assistance being provided to police. ""Unfortunately, now, due to the violent actions of a small number of people, we have had to redirect resources and efforts towards investigating a serious assault. ""There is no excuse for individuals taking the law into their own hands nor for the violent scenes that we witnessed last night."" Earlier on Saturday, the police said it was believed the two men had travelled to Northern Ireland from the Republic. There have been a number of reported sightings of them in south Armagh and Newry, County Down. On Thursday afternoon, police seized a car from a car park on the Chancellors Road in Mullaghbawn after a member of the public expressed concern. SDLP Newry and Armagh MLA Justin McNulty said the incident was ""disgraceful"". ""It is important that the two wanted men can now be brought before the courts so that they can be subjected to the judicial process,"" he said. ""It is disgraceful however that the police now also have to deal with an assault case. ""There can be no middle man in the criminal justice system."" Mr McNulty encouraged anyone with information on criminality to go to the police. ""Those who believe they are unable to do so can contact Crimestoppers anonymously. ""No one is above the law,"" he added.

Windrush pledges 'must be written into law',"Labour MP David Lammy has been a vocal critic of the government over the Windrush scandal More than 200 MPs have signed a letter to the prime minister calling for government promises to Windrush migrants to be written into law. The letter, co-ordinated by Labour MP David Lammy, said concerns over compensation, housing and legal rights had not been settled. The Home Office said Amber Rudd would speak in Parliament on Monday. The home secretary is accused in the letter of making up immigration policy ""on the hoof"" to defuse the situation. The letter, addressed to Theresa May, said any promises made by the government in response to the Windrush crisis should be enshrined in law ""without delay"". It continued: ""We are calling on you to do this by bringing a statutory instrument before Parliament to ensure that the measures are implemented as quickly as possible."" Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Who are the Windrush generation? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories The signatories are predominantly Labour MPs but politicians from the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party - as well as one Conservative - also feature. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged some migrants from Commonwealth Caribbean countries who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s, and their relatives, had been declared illegal immigrants. Some of the Windrush generation have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs, or been refused access to medical treatment. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK In a separate letter, Labour MP and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has called for a full inquiry into whether the home secretary had breached the ministerial code over government immigration removal targets. Ms Abbott said Ms Rudd's explanations as to why she had told MPs there were no such targets, when in fact there were, ""stretch credulity to the limit"". Downing Street has said there is no need for an investigation because ministerial code only requires a resignation if a minister knowingly misleads parliament - a charge the home secretary denies. Ms Rudd tweeted on Friday nightadmitting she had been copied in on a memo that mentioned migrant deportation targets but insisted that she had not actually read it. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, meanwhile, has appealed to ethnic minority voters not to abandon the Tories in this week's local elections over the Windrush scandal. Mr Javid, whose parents emigrated from Pakistan in the 1960s, said his first reaction when he heard people were being wrongly threatened with deportation was that it could have been his family. However,in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph,external, he said the government was determined to ""put things right"" and he urged ethnic minority voters to look at the ""bigger picture"" when it came to Thursday's vote.

What went wrong for Amber Rudd?,"This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them Amber Rudd's resignation over the question of whether she knew about targets to remove illegal immigrants has shown once again that being home secretary remains one of the most high-risk jobs in government. Although Theresa May lasted more than six years in the job and used it as a springboard to Downing Street, her successor joins a long list of others, including David Blunkett, Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke, who ended up paying the price for personal or administrative failings with their jobs. Before the full extent of the Windrush controversy became clear, shining an unflattering light on the workings and culture of her department and Ms Rudd's own command of her brief, the 54-year-old had been regarded as one of the Conservatives' rising stars. Her views on Europe - she is one of the cabinet's most pro-European voices and her brother Roland helped run the Remain campaign - were not to everyone's tastes within the party but despite this she was seen as being capable, tough and - until recent weeks - unflappable. In her early years in Parliament after being elected in 2010, she was regarded as being a protege of George Osborne on the liberal-modernising wing of the party, a member of the so-called ""friends of George"". Ms Rudd at a constituency event in 2011 - she scraped home in last year's election despite a significant swing to Labour She was promoted rapidly under David Cameron, working for a while in the Treasury and becoming energy and climate change secretary after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the 2015 general election. Her growing reputation was further enhanced during the 2016 Brexit referendum. She was one of the star performers during the main TV debate - caustically taking Boris Johnson to task and suggesting he was ""not the kind of man that you would want to drive you home at the end of the evening"". She not only survived Theresa May's clearout of Cameron/Osborne supporters after she became PM but was rewarded with the plum job of home secretary, stepping into her boss's shoes. Her first year in the Home Office went smoothly enough although dealing with the succession of terror attacks that took place during 2017 was a harrowing experience. The 54-year old was appointed home secretary in July 2016 She has been MP for Hastings and Rye in East Sussex since 2010 She won the seat in 2017 by just 346 votes She was a Remain supporter in 2016 referendum - her brother helped fund campaign She was married for five years to the late journalist and writer AA Gill An Edinburgh University graduate, she previously worked in banking and recruitment She was credited as a consultant on the 1994 hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral Ms Rudd earned plenty of plaudits after deputising for Mrs May in the 2017 general election leadership debate, despite her father Tony - a stockbroker and businessman - having died a few days before. She used up one of her political lives on election night when it looked, for several hours, as if she had lost her Hastings and Rye seat and ended up only scraping home by 346 votes. This video can not be played Amber Rudd and Jeremy Corbyn in the General election 2017 debate She remained in the Home Office after the election and with questions over Mrs May's future swirling around, she was talked of as a potential successor who could appeal to both wings of the party. But in the face of daily revelations about the plight of Windrush migrants and their families, Ms Rudd appeared slow to respond and, despite numerous apologies, to appreciate the scale and significance of the crisis. Previously regarded as having more liberal views on immigration than her predecessor, she was soon accused of making the government's ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants even tougher, with disastrous repercussions for thousands of people in the country legally. More significantly, she was forced to publicly backtrack on claims that the Home Office did not have targets for removing immigration offenders, admitting to MPs she had been wrong. She was appointed energy and climate change secretary by David Cameron after the Tories' 2015 election win The opposition soon called for her head, describing her as a ""human shield"" for the prime minister. But there was no appetite on the Tory benches - either from Brexiters or Remainers - for her to go, with three cabinet ministers already having had to quit in the past six months. The final nail in her coffin was when her claim to the Commons that she was not aware of the targets was contradicted not only by a memo she had been sent by a top Home Office official, published by the Guardian, but also a letterMs Rudd herself sent to the prime minister,externalsetting out ""ambitious but deliverable"" deportation targets. Ms Rudd published a strategy earlier this month on tackling violent crime, after a rise in deaths in London Before entering politics, Ms Rudd had successful careers working in finance, journalism and executive recruitment - as well as somewhat incongruously being ""aristocracy consultant"" on the hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral. She was married for five years to the late writer and Sunday Times columnist AA Gill, with whom she had two children. At a recent lunch for Westminster journalists, she responded to questions about her future leadership ambitions by saying that she merely ""wanted to stay in the game"". She will now have more time to ponder her own future in that game from the backbenches and also to reflect on the conventional wisdom in Westminster - seemingly dispelled by Mrs May - that the Home Office is the graveyard of many a political career. The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948. It is regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration known as the ""Windrush generation"". Now, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it has emerged that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation and denied access to the NHS, benefits and pensions.

"Breaking|Breaking newsAmber Rudd resigns as home secretaryHome Secretary Amber Rudd has resigned, Downing Street says.2m3 minutes agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them Amber Rudd has resigned as home secretary, saying she ""inadvertently misled"" MPs over targets for removing illegal immigrants. The Windrush scandal had heaped pressure on Ms Rudd, who faced renewed criticism after saying she did not know about Home Office removals targets. Her successor is expected to be announced within hours by Theresa May, who was ""very sorry"" to see Ms Rudd go. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Ms Rudd had ""done the right thing"". Ms Abbott added that the ""architect of this crisis"" - the prime minister - must come before the Commons to explain ""whether she knew that Amber Rudd was misleading Parliament and the public last week"". Amber Rudd resigns: Live reaction What went wrong for Amber Rudd? Rudd's resignation letter in full Rudd's resignation dominates front pages Ms Rudd told MPs last week the Home Office did not have targets for removing illegal immigrants, but on Sunday the Guardian published a letter in whichMs Rudd set out her ""ambitious but deliverable"",externalaim to deport 10% more illegal immigrants over the ""next few years"" to Theresa May. Ms Rudd is the fourth person forced to resign from the cabinet in the last six months - following Sir Michael Fallon, Priti Patel and Damian Green. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling denied the government was in chaos, telling BBC Radio 4's Today the spate of recent resignations were ""unwanted noise"" but there were always ""up and downs"" in politics. Ms Rudd, who had been due to make a Commons statement on Monday afternoon, telephoned the prime minister on Sunday evening to tell her of the decision amid intensifying opposition demands for her to quit. In herresignation letter, Ms Rudd said she took ""full responsibility"" for the fact she was not aware of ""information provided to (her) office which makes mention of targets"". In response, Mrs May said she believed Ms Rudd had given her evidence to the Commons ""in good faith"" but that she understood her decision to resign and take ""responsibility for inadvertently misleading the home affairs select committee"". She should ""take great pride"" in what she achieved at the Home Office, Mrs May added. An inevitable resignation? Certainly there has been a mismatch between what she told MPs last week and the evidence that emerged. In a different time, and with a minister with enemies, she'd likely have been out on Friday. This time the Tory party was fighting hard to keep her. But beyond the mess-ups, perhaps part of the issue was also that she was not necessarily in tune with her predecessor's attitude on immigration - the Home Office's most politically charged brief. Read more from Laura The controversy began when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly declared illegal immigrants. Ms Rudd came under fire for the government's treatment of these people - known as the Windrush generation - and their relatives and the wider impact of its ""hostile environment"" policy designed to deter illegal immigration. She told MPs last Wednesday there were no removals targets for illegal immigrants - comments subsequently contradicted by a 2015 inspection report. She later admitted ""local"" targets for voluntary removals had been set but she told the Commons on Thursday she had not been aware of them. Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush pledges 'must be written into law' Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? But the Guardian reported a June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that referred to targets. The newspaper also published a letter at the weekend, from January 2017, where Ms Rudd told Theresa May about plans to restructure her department and increase removals ""over the next few years"". Sources told the BBC that on Saturday and Sunday Ms Rudd and her officials did a thorough search of all documents and found other references to operational targets which she felt she should have been aware of. This video can not be played Diane Abbott: The prime minister has questions to answer on Windrush Conservative MPs have been paying tribute to their colleague. Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom called Ms Rudd ""honest and principled"" while Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said she was a ""huge talent"" who would ""no doubt be back in Cabinet soon"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said she had done ""a great job during last year's terrorist attacks and cares deeply about the people she serves"". Allow Twitter content?

Labour MP David Lammy said the home secretary had quit because she ""didn't know what was going on"" in her department and she had clearly ""lost the confidence"" of her officials. He added: ""The real issue is the hostile environment policy that caused this crisis in the first place. That policy must now be reviewed."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable told the BBC Ms Rudd had ""clearly jumped before she was pushed"" while Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the PM had ""lost her human shield and now looks very exposed"". And UKIP's former leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""Now that Amber Rudd has resigned we need a Home Secretary that supports Brexit."" Theresa May is expected to name Amber Rudd's successor later on Monday. Names being touted include Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, the son of a Pakistani bus driver whose father came to the UK in the 1960s and who says his family could easily have been affected by the recent crisis. Others potentially in the frame include former Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire, an ally of Mrs May's who left the cabinet in January for an operation but has since returned to front-line politics. Could one of the cabinet's other heavy-hitters get a promotion? Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt have been mentioned. There could also be a swift promotion for Karen Bradley, four months after succeeding Mr Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary. Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw With responsibility for immigration, counter-terrorism and policing, the job of home secretary is one of the toughest in government. During one period under Labour, there were six home secretaries in eight years. But Amber Rudd's job was made doubly difficult because she was following Theresa May, who'd survived in the post for more than six years and had set in train a series of plans and objectives that Ms Rudd was expected to stick to, even if she disagreed with them. The former energy secretary was unable to put her stamp on any significant policy during her 21 months at the Home Office; much of her time was spent fire-fighting - dealing with the implications of Brexit, the rise in violent crime and last year's terror attacks. Presentationally, Amber Rudd was impressive.  But she lacked a command of the detail, which her predecessor had mastered, and it proved to be her undoing.

Leaked Rudd letter on migrant removalsLabour says a letter reportedly from the home secretary to the PM proves she knew about deportation targets.3h3 hours agoUK Politics,"Home Secretary Amber Rudd reportedly set out her ""ambitious but deliverable"" aim to deport more illegal immigrants last year in a letter to Theresa May. Labour said the letter proved there were removals targets and Ms Rudd was aware of them - something she has previously denied. Ms Rudd promised Mrs May a 10% or more increase in enforced removals over the ""next few years,""The Guardian says,external. She is due to make a Commons statement on Monday amid calls for her to quit. In the letter, from January 2017, leaked to the Guardian, Ms Rudd tells Theresa May - her predecessor as home secretary - about plans to restructure the department to focus on the ""aim of increasing the number of enforced removals by more than 10% over the next few years, something I believe is ambitious, but deliverable"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""The Tories' shameful attempts to cover up their mess must end. Clearly there were targets, and Amber Rudd was aware of them. ""Theresa May has sent minister after minister out to protect her cruel legacy, misleading Parliament and the public in the process. With each new revelation, we get more of an insight into the Tories' heartless Home Office policies which have led to the Windrush scandal. ""This chaos has gone on for far too long. It's time for Rudd to go and for the government to rethink its whole approach."" Amber Rudd 'didn't see' migrant memo Windrush pledges 'must be written into law' Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? The Windrush row began when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s, and their relatives, had been declared illegal immigrants. Ms Rudd's aim of increasing ""enforced deportations"" would not have affected Windrush migrants, as they were threatened with ""voluntary departure"". (The term ""voluntary"" describes the method of departure rather than the choice of whether or not to depart - those leaving in this way are able to approach the Home Office for financial assistance with travel costs). Ms Rudd had initially told MPs investigating the scandal there were no removals targets - before admitting ""local"" targets for voluntary removals had been set. She told the Commons on Thursday she had not been aware of them. But the Guardian reported a June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that refers to targets. Brandon Lewis was the immigration minister when the leaked memo was sent Ms Rudd's former deputy at the Home Office, Brandon Lewis, said he often talked to her about the 10% ""ambition"" for enforced removals but not ""detailed numbers or targets"". Mr Lewis, who is now Conservative Party chairman, said he remembered receiving the memo, from the Home Office's immigration enforcement team, in July last year. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""I am confident that she didn't have that memo. When Amber Rudd says she didn't see something, I know she didn't see it."" This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK He said there was a difference between the figures in that memo, which was an update of progress towards a target of ""12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18"", and what Ms Rudd was asked about at the home affairs committee hearing on Wednesday. He said those figures has been ""key performance indicators"" for local internal use. Yvette Cooper, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee said this was ""clearly not true"" and called on Mr Lewis to withdraw his claim, tweeting: ""It doesn't help anyone and is completely inappropriate for you to try to rewrite committee questions."" Mr Lewis said Ms Rudd had put an extra Â£10m into the team that produced the memo leaked to The Guardian to help them meet a target of increasing removals by 10% ""in the years ahead,"" as she sets out in her letter to Mrs May. ""I was working with her on a weekly basis to make sure that we were doing everything we could - working with the police, working with local government - to help vulnerable people, to crackdown on criminals, and to remove more people who are here illegally,"" he told the programme. ""Yes, I did talk to the home secretary about that and the overall work that we were doing and the overall ambition to see an increase in numbers, but not on the detailed numbers and targets."" Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Diane Abbott said the home secretary may have breached the ministerial code by not giving accurate and truthful information to Parliament. Ms Abbott has written to the prime minister to demand an investigation into Ms Rudd's conduct and a full investigation into targets for immigration removals. On Wednesday, Ms Rudd told the home affairs committee: ""We do not have targets for removals."" Asked about evidence giving to the committee by the head of the ISU union, for border and immigration workers, that targets had been set, she asked whether they were a ""number"" or a ""percentage"" before promising to look into the issue. On Thursday, she told MPs: ""I have never agreed that there should be specific removal targets and I would never support a policy that puts targets ahead of people.""

Macron's White House tree disappears,"Only a small patch of yellow grass is seen where the sapling was planted A tree gifted to President Donald Trump by French President Emmanuel Macron has disappeared from the White House lawn. The pair planted the sapling, taken from the site of a World War One battle in north-east France, last week. Mr Macron said the tree would be a reminder of ""these ties that bind us"". But a Reuters photographer on Saturday took a shot of only a yellow patch of grass where the tree once stood. The French ambassador to the US later tweeted the sapling was in quarantine.

Nearly 2,000 US soldiers died in the battle north-east of Paris. Yet only four days after it was planted, the sapling has disappeared. The two men helped shovel earth onto the tree on the White House South Lawn With no official reason given for the sapling mystery, speculation began online about the tree's fate. French radio networkFranceinfo quotes gardening site gerbaud.com,external, which says this type of oak is better planted in autumn, giving it time to grow deep roots ""to face the drought of the following summer"".

"Boy, 13, is youngest Fortnite pro player","This video can not be played Kyle Jackson says playing games professionally is a ""dream for all kids"" A 13-year-old boy from Kent says he is living every child's ""dream"" after becoming Fortnite's youngest professional player. Kyle Jackson is part of Team Secret Fortnite, which has four members, playing under the name ""Mongraal"". Since launching in July 2017, the survival shooting game, which is free, has been downloaded more than 40 million times. The teenager, from Sidcup, says he is doing well in most subjects at school. At the moment, Kyle does not make money from his contract but he will get a share of the prize money from any competitions. Game 'not addictive' says researcher Fortnite adds cheeky warning for students He started gaming at the age of eight, and three years later says he started to realise he was ""probably better than the average player"". He says he noticed he was always coming top of the scoreboard for every game and was even finishing above semi-pro players. But it's not just down to natural ability, Kyle adds. In the school holidays he plays nearly all day and constantly practises to improve. ""If a mistake happens, I will look over it in the replay mode and I'll see what I could have done better, and I'll improve on that next time I play."" Kyle's parents are very supportive and his father has agreed to accompany him when he takes part in competitions around the world. But there are rules. He says he has a curfew of 21:00 BST and there are other times he cannot play. ""Currently, at school I'm doing very well in pretty much every subject so they're not really worried about me playing as much as I do. I still have time to study [and] revise."" Asked if his school friends are jealous of his opportunity, he said: ""I guess they are kind of, playing games and travelling all over the world is kind of a dream for all kids."" And his team mates? The 13-year-old said they were shocked to find out his age but that he is treated the same as anyone else. Fortnite combines cartoon-like graphics with the challenge of being the last player standing After six years in development Epic games released Fortnite in July 2017. It is a co-operative survival shooting game that lets players build structures out of materials they scavenge from the game world. Its most popular format is the Battle Royale mode which pits 100 players against each other, some of whom are in small teams, to see who is the last person standing. The game is free but players can spend real money on in-app purchases. Concerns have been raised about hackers getting access to accounts used for purchases and over the potential dangers of children playing the game online with strangers. Since last year's release, it has been available to play on gaming devices such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, as well as PC and Mac. It has recently become available on some mobile devices. E-sports, the practice of watching people play video games, generated Â£350m ($493m) in revenue with a global audience of about 320m people in 2016, the market research firm Newzoo reported last year. Sponsorship is the biggest revenue stream, bringing in much more than is raised by the media, advertising, merchandise and ticketing. But there is also prize money for competitions - the winning team at the 2016 League of Legends world championship shared $1m (Â£725,933). E-sports will be included in the official sporting programme of the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. Team Secret's Director of Media George Yao said his team did not know Kyle was only 13 when they first watched him play Fortnite online. ""We had no idea. The level of communication they had in the game was at such a professional level, and the sound of his voice is very mature, so we naturally didn't even think he was that young so it took us by surprise. ""It's very rare to find a player that is at that calibre at such a young age."" Mr Yao added no tournaments had been announced yet.

Two seriously hurt in Glasgow bus crash,"Police said the bus left the road on a bend in the sliproad and went up an embankment One person is in a critical condition and two more have been seriously injured in a bus crash in Glasgow. Five more people are thought to have suffered injuries in the crash, on a sliproad to the Clydeside Expressway close to the Clyde Tunnel. It happened on the A814 sliproad, just north of the tunnel. The crash, which took place just after 19:00 on Sunday, involved a single-decker First Bus vehicle, which went up an embankment. Casualties were treated at the scene of the crash on the A814 sliproad It was not clear if any other vehicles were involved in the collision. Ambulance, fire and police crews were sent to the scene, where casualties were treated. The A814 sliproad was closed to traffic but reopened at about 05:30 on Monday. Police said eight people in total were taken to hospital. Five people, including the bus driver, were taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where one person was described as being in a critical condition. One person was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary and two more to Royal Alexandra Hospital. Lisa Stirling's husband was among those on the bus. She told BBC Scotland: ""He was sitting at the front and he went flying forward. ""He has hurt his right leg. His knee is badly swollen. He hurt his arm and has he chest pains. He's got a big gash on his head - it's a big cut, split open."" First Glasgow, the operator of the bus, tweeted saying ""Our thoughts are with those involved in this serious incident. The firm said details about the cause of the crash were ""unclear"". It added: ""We have members of our team at the scene to assist the emergency services, who we cannot praise highly enough for their quick response and professionalism during this incident.""

T-Mobile agrees to buy Sprint for $26bn,"T-Mobile boss John Legere broke the news of deal on Twitter. US telecoms giant T-Mobile has agreed to buy its rival Sprint in a $26bn (Â£18.9bn) deal. The merger of America's third and fourth largest mobile carriers is designed to create a more competitive firm with about 130 million customers. However, the deal is expected to attract regulatory scrutiny over its potential impact on customer prices. T-Mobile boss John Legere said the new firm would spend $40bn on building a 5G mobile network in the next three years. ""Together, we will build the highest-capacity mobile network in US history!! I'm talking 30X more capacity than T-Mobile today!!"" he said in one of a series of Tweets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It comes after months of negotiations between T-Mobile's controlling shareholder, Deutsche Telekom, and Japan's SoftBank, which controls Sprint. Under the deal, Deutsche Telekom will own 42% of the combined company and control its board. Softbank will hold a 27% stake. Mr Legere will lead the new firm which will take the T-Mobile name and have a market value of $146bn. Analysts say the combined company will have more clout to compete with the first and second biggest US telecoms firms, Verizon and AT&T, each of which have more than 100 million subscribers. In particular, they say it will be better positioned in the race to provide America with next generation 5G mobile broadband technology. They also believe that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to upgrade its network. Sprint and T-Mobile had been in talks about a potential tie-up since 2014, when the Obama administration scuppered a previous merger attempt over competition concerns. Under the Trump administration, regulators have continued to challenge deals they believe could push up prices and are likely to scrutinise this latest takeover closely. Sprint is the fourth largest mobile broadband provider in the US The US Justice Department is currently trying to block AT&T's deal to buy US media giant Time Warner for $85bn, warning that ""consumers all across America will be worse off"" if it goes ahead. It has also allegedly opened a probe into claims of co-ordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecoms standards body to hinder consumers from easily switching provider, Reuters reported earlier in April. In a statement, Mr Legere said the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile would lower prices and help the US accelerate its development of 5G, amid fierce competition from China. He also said it would create tens of thousands of jobs in rural America - factors analysts say could help sway officials in the Trump administration. ""This combination will create a fierce competitor with the network scale to deliver more for consumers and businesses in the form of lower prices, more innovation, and a second-to-none network experience - and do it all so much faster than either company could on its own,"" Mr Legere said.

"Cable: Governments think public are bigotsThe Lib Dem leader claims he tried to rein in Theresa May's ""hostile environment"" for illegal migrants.3h3 hours agoUK Politics","UK governments have long assumed the public are ""pretty bigoted"" and need to be given ""red meat"" on immigration, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable has said. He claimed the Lib Dems had fought this tendency when they were in coalition with the Conservatives. The ""hostile environment"" for illegal migrants that critics say led to the Windrush scandal was created by the coalition. But Sir Vince claimed he had tried to block some of the measures in it. Ex-deputy 'didn't discuss targets with Rudd' Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? Cable says nostalgia for âwhiteâ UK helped Leave vote ""There are a whole lot of very powerful measures that Theresa May was pushing at the time - things like making landlords responsible for immigration control. We stopped that. We simply had pilot studies,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""Once the Lib Dems were out of the coalition they just introduced the policy in a very aggressive way."" In a 2014 speech,external, the then Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg highlighted moves to to make life more difficult for those in the UK without permission and said ""more needs to be done"" to ""bear down"" on illegal immigration. Sir Vince told Andrew Marr ""all parties have got some responsibility"" for the Windrush scandal. The former business secretary, who has not joined Labour, SNP and Green calls for Home Secretary Amber Rudd to quit over her handling of the crisis, said: "" I don't believe in lynch mobs"". He urged people to ""wait and see"" what Ms Rudd, who shared a platform with him at a Remain campaign event during the 2016 EU referendum, had to say in a Commons statement on Monday. Sadiq Khan: Most organisations have problem with 'institutional racism' On immigration crackdowns, he said: ""It goes back to New Labour. I think the working assumption successive governments have made is that the public out there are pretty bigoted and they have got be given red meat in the form of these very restrictive measures and it has done a lot of harm,"" said Sir Vince. ""I think the interesting thing about Windrush is that perhaps for the first time the public opinion has been ahead of the politicians in seeing that there is a terrible injustice here and it should not be allowed to pass."" Sir Vince came under fire earlier this year for a speech in which he said many older voters backed Brexit out of nostalgia for a world where ""passports were blue, faces were white and the map was coloured imperial pink"". ""The ugly truth is that race has been a key factor in British politics. I was simply making that quite explicit,"" he told Marr. Many British citizens who arrived in the country from Commonwealth nations decades ago have been targeted as part of a drive to remove illegal immigrants and block access to jobs, benefits and medical treatment. The government has apologised to the so-called Windrush generation - named after the ship that brought the first Caribbean migrants to the UK in 1948 - and set up a task force to help them formalise their right to remain. London's Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan has, meanwhile, claimed most organisations in Britain have problems with ""institutional racism"" and ""unwitting prejudice"" including the main political parties, the police and ""other public authorities"". ""The key thing is the leadership at the top must make sure there is a zero tolerance towards this, we have policies in place and an action plan to address that. ""I think we've been too slow and we're going to accelerate the progress."" Sajid Javid: Windrush could have affected my family In a separate development, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid urged ethnic minority voters to look beyond the government's treatment of Caribbean migrants from the ""Windrush generation,"" in Thursday's local elections. Mr Javid, whose parents emigrated from Pakistan in the 1960s, said his first reaction when he heard people were being wrongly threatened with deportation was that it could have been his family. But inan interview with The Sunday Telegraph,externalhe said the government was would ""put things right"" and he urged ethnic minority voters to look at the ""bigger picture"" when it came to Thursday's vote. The Labour anti-Semitism row explained Labour's Andrew Gwynne was quizzed by Andrew Marr about whether his party would lose votes on Thursday over allegations of anti-Semitism in its ranks.

'Unseasonably cold' weather hits UK,"This video can not be played BBC Weather's Simon King has the UK forecast A man has died after being swept out to sea in Kent as heavy rain, winds and ""unseasonably cold"" weather hit parts of the UK. Two other men were taken to hospital after being washed from East Pier in Ramsgate by a large wave, police said. A yellow warning,externalfor heavy rain and strong winds remains in place for southern and eastern parts of England for the whole of Monday. Forecasters said some areas could see more than a month's rainfall in a day. Some trains in the south-east of England were cancelled and roads have been blocked by fallen trees. The RNLI, whose crews were called to help the three men at Royal Harbour in Ramsgate, called the conditions ""atrocious"". They said they rescued two men from the water but one was pronounced dead at the scene. The third man had been knocked over on the harbour wall by the wave and has been airlifted to hospital. Strong winds have caused large waves across coastal areas in the south east, including in Ramsgate in Kent Also in Kent, firefighters rescued two adults and a baby from a car which was stuck in flood water in Sutton Valence, while another man in Herne Bay was trapped when a tree fell on his car. Meanwhile, two flood warnings - which means flooding is expected - remain in place along the River Nene, east of Peterborough, and on the coast in North Shields in north-east England. Flood warnings and alerts,external, issued by the Environment Agency, are in force across England and staff are maintaining defences at at-risk spots. By 07:00 BST, Kent had seen more than 20mm of rain in 24 hours - nearly half of the monthly average for this time of year - and gusts of 50mph have been recorded. Some services on Southeastern Railway were cancelled and others diverted because of flooding and a tree blocking the line at Charing in Kent. Southern Rail faced disruption because of speed restrictions due to the weather and a fallen tree, while a tree hanging over the line between Woking and Weybridge also affected some South Western Railway services. Several flights leavingLondon City Airport,externalhave been delayed. A spokesman for the airport said air traffic control restricted the number of flights that can take off and land because of the poor weather conditions. Strong winds have brought down trees across the south-east, including in Streatham, south London UK Power Networks, which covers part of the south-east of England, said although there are outages it was a ""normal day"" with no widespread problems due to the weather. The wet and windy weather is the result of an area of low pressure moving northwards overnight on Sunday. It will feel ""unseasonably cold"" for the time of year, the BBC Weather Centre said, with maximum temperatures about 6 to 7C in these areas, but feeling much colder under the rain and wind. Peter Siddle of Essex bowls against Hampshire in the county cricket match on Monday High ground - like the Chilterns and the Cotswolds - could even see sleet and snow, although it will not settle. County cricketers playing at the Ageas Bowl in Hampshire wore woolly hats to keep warm. On social media, people shared photos and videos of flooded roads and large waves in coastal areas.

Five hurt in restaurant ceiling collapse,"A section of the ceiling landed on diners Five people were hurt when part of a restaurant ceiling fell on them as they dined beneath, police have said. They were treated by paramedics at the Sizzling Palate restaurant in Bolton at about 22:30 BST on Saturday. Some customers criticised the venue's management, with one saying: ""Not one came down to ask if anyone was OK."" Assistant manager Mohammad Amiri disputed complaints, saying managers were busy talking to 999 crews while ""staff attended to customers"". He said the incident was in the basement of the three-floor venue, which ""continued to trade as normal"". Mr Amiri said: ""A section of a suspended ceiling in the lower ground restaurant came loose from its fixing and dropped. ""A couple of customers sustained some minor cuts and bruising."" The ceiling section was lifted to let people get out from underneath Huzaifa Chunara, from Manchester, was having a meal with his wife and 12 friends when the ceiling dropped. ""There was no creaking... no indication that it was going to let go,"" he said. He said it landed on his wife and friends but just missed him. ""They were trapped beneath for about 30 seconds."" Another customer, who did not want to be named, said: ""People panicked, were shocked, had no idea what was happening, so the men just got up and tried to lift the ceiling off people. ""There were a good 15-20 people that had to actually try and hold the ceiling up butâ¦ once people got out from underneath, they put it back on the table. This section of ceiling came loose from its fixing, the restaurant said ""Fire and police were there quite quickly, within five minutes. ""What was really shocking was that no management came to talk to us, [check that] people were OK - it was just the people that were injured that had to take charge."" Mr Chunara said a waiter helped after the ceiling section fell but ""not one [manager] came down to ask if anyone was OK"". ""There was no protocol in place,"" he said. He said one woman, who was wearing a neck restraint, had to be taken out on a stretcher. Mr Amiri said: ""Management were involved in communicating with emergency services while staff attended to customers. ""We did not want to create any panic. We just wanted to keep things calm. ""One person was taken to hospital as a matter of precaution.""

"Diesel trial collapses after disclosure failings'Systemic failures' in disclosing evidence led to the collapse of another trial, a judge says.5m5 minutes agoUK","The trial of tanker driver Peter Norton collapsed after the prosecution failed to disclose evidence A judge has warned of ""systemic failures"" in disclosing evidence after a Â£500,000 red diesel VAT fraud trial collapsed. A linked trial also had to be abandoned due to errors on the part of investigating officers from HMRC. HMRC said it accepted the failings and was working with the Crown Prosecution Service to learn from the incident. It followsa series of high-profile rape caseswhich have collapsed due to crucial evidence not being disclosed. Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said the fraud case showed ""lamentable negligence"" and was indicative of a more widespread problem. The former Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas blamed disclosure failings on ""cuts of a very high magnitude"" to the criminal justice system. Hundreds of cases dropped over disclosure failings Evidence not disclosed on a daily basis, lawyers say In December 2013, officers from customs and excise (HMRC) raided tanker driver Peter Norton's home. He was charged with others with conspiracy to evade VAT by selling nearly Â£500,000 of laundered so-called red diesel fuel. Red diesel is only legal for off-road vehicles such as tractors, and has a much lower VAT rate. A VAT fraud involving the fuel works by removing the red dye to make it look like regular diesel before the fuel is then sold on fraudulently at the higher VAT rate. Peter Norton has always denied any wrongdoing. If the red dye is removed, the substance looks like normal diesel After a four-year investigation by HMRC, the case went to trial in January at Liverpool Crown Court. But a month into the trial, a vast amount of information that should have been disclosed to the defence was identified on the laptop of the HMRC investigating officer, Daniel Grundy. The prosecution asked for an adjournment to sift through the material that should have been disclosed. Judge Trevor-Jones refused and the trial collapsed. In his ruling, he said: ""I accept that the failure here can properly be described as negligent, but it was negligence to a lamentable degree. ""It is indicative of a more systemic failure going beyond the omissions of just one officer."" He added: ""The competence, even credibility, of the investigative team has clearly been tainted."" The same disclosure failings meant that a linked trial of petrol station owners, due to begin a few weeks later, was also abandoned. Lawyers in the case estimate the two trials cost in excess of Â£2m of public money. Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said the credibility of the investigations team had been ""tainted"" Mr Norton told the BBC: ""When you are in court, you look at the surroundings you are in. ""There are barristers, there are judges, there is a jury, and these people are in charge of my liberty at that time. ""As a defendant, you think that HMRC have done everything in a professional manner and you feel as though, hopefully, everyone has done their job properly to have a fair trial."" In any criminal investigation, the investigating authority - be it the police or HMRC - are bound to gather evidence that leads to the suspect and any that also leads away from him. Critically, the prosecution is under a duty to disclose to the defence any of the material gathered that either assists the defence case or undermines their own. This latest case shows that disclosure failings are not limited to rape and sexual assault cases. The problems are more systemic and investigating authorities other than the police are also failing in their duty to disclose evidence. The former Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas told the BBC he believed ""disclosure failures are pretty widespread"". ""We have, over the last 20 or so years, seen less police officers and other investigating officers go to court, so they don't understand the importance of disclosure."" He added: ""It seems to me that the cuts have gone too far. ""The obvious thing to do is to make sure proper resources are put into this vital aspect of our criminal justice system."" But Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC has denied the current disclosure failures are a ""resources"" issue. An HMRC spokesperson said they ""fully accept"" the failings, but would be working closely with the CPS to ""see what lessons can be learned."" Hundreds of court cases axed over failings All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed Evidence not being disclosed, lawyers say Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Uni bids to be 'first drug-free campus'Vice-chancellor Sir Anthony Seldon says institutions are ""failing students on drugs"".3h3 hours agoBeds, Herts & Bucks","Buckingham University has not yet set a date for when it will introduce the contracts A university is to ask students to sign contracts promising not to take drugs on its property in a bid to become Britain's first drug-free campus. Buckingham University vice-chancellor Sir Anthony Seldon said institutions were ""failing students on drugs"". As reported in the Sunday Times,external, the number of UK students disciplined for drug use has risen by 42% since 2015. But former chief constable Tom Lloyd said Buckingham's proposal ""infantilised"" adult students. The Sunday Times figures came from freedom of information requests. Most involved smoking cannabis, but increasing numbers involved hard drugs or dealing. Sir Anthony said the aim of the contract was ""to be compassionate and enlightened, helping our students learn how to be fully adult"" Sir Anthony said: ""Student lives are needlessly being lost and imperilled. ""Universities need to shake themselves up and take more responsibility for students in their care."" Students will be asked to leave if they continue to take drugs on campus - which is in Buckingham - after signing the contract. Mr Lloyd, who was Cambridgeshire's chief constable and is now a drug policy adviser, said Sir Anthony was ""extremely naive to think that he can make universities drug- free"". He said that ""university is an opportunity for [students] to develop without being mollycoddled"", and that ""prohibition is a hugely costly, counter-productive and harmful failure"". Mr Lloyd said the best way to reduce harm to students was to allow thedrug testing organisation The Loop,externalto check drugs before use. Harry Shapiro, the director of the online drug information service DrugWise, said: ""People take drugs for all sorts of reasons, so where is the pastoral care in all this? ""I think there needs to be a proper consultation on this with health professionals and also those responsible for student welfare."" A Buckingham University spokesman said it was working on the details of implementing the policy, but no date had been set for its introduction. She said it was a ""small"" university with 3,000 students, and she believed drug use there would be in line with national figures.

Restrained man's family to sue police,"Sheku Bayoh died in Kirkcaldy in May 2015 The family of a man who died after being restrained by police nearly three years ago are suing the chief constable of Police Scotland. A lawyer for relatives of Sheku Bayou said they were seeking Â£2m from Iain Livingstone. Sheku Bayoh, 31, lost consciousness after being restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in May 2015. Solicitor Aamer Anwar said the family believed his death was unlawful and Police Scotland was responsible. The civil action will be raised against Acting Chief Constable Iain Livingstone shortly before three-year ""time bar"" laws come into force on Thursday, exactly three years since the death. The action - to be lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh - is believed to be the first time police in Scotland have been sued over an unlawful killing. Mr Bayoh died on Sunday 3 May 2015. Police had reacted to reports that a man - later identified as Mr Bayoh - was behaving erratically and brandishing a knife. His family maintain he was not carrying a weapon when he was stopped, although the BBC understands a knife was later found nearby. He was restrained by up to six officers using CS spray and batons. A toxicology report later said that ecstasy had been found in Mr Bayoh's system, as well traces of psycho-stimulant A-PVP, sometimes called Flakka. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) filed a report on Mr Bayou's death but two years on, the Crown Office has still to decide what, if any action, will be taken. The family has previously said it would call for a public inquiry if officers were not prosecuted. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm that legal papers have been received and as such it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.""

N Korea nuclear test site 'to shut in May',"A satellite image of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North Korea North Korea's nuclear test site will close in May, the South Korean president's office has said. A spokesman said the closure of the Punggye-ri site would be done in public and foreign experts from South Korea and the US would be invited to watch. Scientists have said the site may have partially collapsed in September. On Friday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in agreed to work to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. Their summit came after months of warlike rhetoric from the North. On Saturday,US President Donald Trump said he would likely hold talks with the North Korean leadership ""over the next three or four weeks""about the denuclearisation of the peninsula. A senior presidential communications official, Yoon Young-chan, said that Mr Kim had stated he ""would carry out the closing of the nuclear test site in May"". Mr Yoon added that the North Korean leader had also said he ""would soon invite experts of South Korea and the US to disclose the process to the international community with transparency"". Will Korea talks lead to lasting peace? Five conflicts that continued after they ended The office also said North Korea would change its time zone - currently half an hour different - to match that of the South. North Korea has so far made no public comments on the issue. Situated in mountainous terrain in the north-east, it is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility. The nuclear tests have taken place in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap, near the Punggye-ri site. North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site Six nuclear tests have been carried out there since 2006. After the last, in September 2017,a series of aftershocks hit the site, which seismologists believe collapsed part of the mountain's interior. Mr Kim made an apparent reference to these reports, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. ""Some say that we are terminating facilities that are not functioning, but you will see that they are in good condition,"" the North Korean leader was quoted as saying by Mr Yoon on Sunday. The information about the nuclear site has been gathered mainly from satellite imagery and tracking the movement of equipment at the location. Analysis by the BBC's Korea correspondent Laura Bicker This is another significant and symbolic step by Kim Jong-un. He had already announced he'd be closing the Punggye-ri test site, but now he has told officials in South Korea that he's prepared to make it public and invite experts and media from Seoul and the US to inspect it. Mr Kim also told President Moon that he hoped trust could be built with the US and reiterated that there would be no need for him to have nuclear weapons if they formally ended the war on the Korean peninsula. Mr Kim said once Washington spoke to him North Korea would know he was not an aggressor. He added that his heart was broken when he saw the two clocks with different Korean time zones hanging on the wall of the peace house at the border between the two countries. He will now match the time zone in the North with that of the South. Mr Kim and Mr Moon said they would pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not total peace. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un issues his pledge for peace with South Korea The commitment to denuclearisation does not explicitly refer to North Korea halting its nuclear activities but rather to the aim of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"". The statement talks about this taking place in a phased manner, but does not include further details. Many analysts remain sceptical about the North's apparent enthusiasm for engagement. Korea talks explained Profile: Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis in 300 words Previous inter-Korean agreements have been abandoned after the North resorted to nuclear and missile tests and the South elected more conservative presidents.

'Real opportunity' for North Korea deal,"A satellite image of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North Korea US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says there is a ""real opportunity"" for a deal when President Trump meets the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Interviewed by ABC News, he said North Korea must take ""irreversible"" steps to get rid of its nuclear arms programme. Mr Pompeo met Mr Kim secretly in Pyongyang earlier this month as CIA director. Details only emerged later. Mr Trump is expected to meet the North Korean leader next month to discuss denuclearising the Korean peninsula. Mr Pompeo said Mr Trump had clearly told him to raise the issue of a verifiable mechanism to make sure North Korea does denuclearise. He also raised the topic of US citizens held by the North Koreans. Separately, new US National Security Advisor John Bolton told Fox News that an agreement with Libya on eliminating its weapons of mass destruction programme could serve as a model for a North Korea deal. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi agreed with Western powers in 2003 to dismantle his programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. ""There are obviously differences. The Libyan programme was much smaller, but that was basically the agreement that we made,"" Mr Bolton said. South Korea has said that North Korea's main nuclear testing site - Punggye-ri - is to close. Presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan said that Mr Kim had stated he ""would carry out the closing of the nuclear test site in May"". Experts from South Korea and the US would be invited to witness it. North Korea has so far made no public comments on the issue. Chinese scientists have said the site may have partially collapsed last September. On Friday, Mr Kim and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in agreed at an historic summit to work on denuclearisation.

New fund to protect Great Barrier Reef,"The Great Barrier Reef is under threat from coral bleaching and damage from crown-of-thorns starfish Australia has pledged A$500 million (Â£275m; $379m) to protect the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef. In recent years, the reef has lost 30% of its coral due to bleaching linked to rising sea temperatures and damage from crown-of-thorns starfish. The funding will be used to reduce the runoff of agricultural pesticides and improve water quality. Some of the money will be used to help farmers near the reef modify their practices. Threats to the reef include ""large amounts of sediment, nitrogen and pesticide run-off"" as well as the crown-of-thorns starfish species, Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg said. The reef can be seen from space and was listed as a world heritage site in 1981 by the United Nations cultural body Unesco. The race to document Australia's unknown species Damage to Australia's reef 'unprecedented' Crown-of-thorns starfish videos, news and facts There are 1,052 sites of environmental and cultural importance such as the reef on Unesco's World Heritage List. In 2017, the organisation decided not to place the Great Barrier Reef on its official list of 55 World Heritage sites ""in danger"". Unprecedented coral bleaching in recent years has caused damage to two-thirds of the reef, aerial surveys in 2017 showed. Crown-of-thorns starfish feed on coral in the Great Barrier Reef Crown-of-thorns starfish are one of the most damaging creatures affecting tropical coral reefs as they are voracious predators that release the contents of their stomach on to the coral. Digestive juices then liquify the coral ready for consumption. A single individual starfish can wipe out large areas of a reef. The reef is actually a vast collection of thousands of smaller coral reefs stretching from the northern tip of Queensland to the state's southern city of Bundaberg. Conservationists have welcomed the extra funding, but said the government needed to focus on climate change. ""You cannot 'preserve' the Great Barrier Reef without cutting carbon emissions. That means no new coal, oil or gas,"" Greenpeace Australia Pacific's CEO, David Ritter, said on Twitter. However, Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop told Australian news outlets her country was a world leader in managing and protecting the reef. Australia is considered to be one of the world's worst polluters of greenhouse gases. In 2015,Australia said it planned to cut greenhouse gas emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels before 2030.

Restrained man's family sue chief constable,"Sheku Bayoh died in Kirkcaldy in May 2015 The family of a man who died after being restrained by police nearly three years ago are suing the chief constable of Police Scotland. A lawyer for relatives of Sheku Bayou said they were seeking Â£2m from Iain Livingstone. Sheku Bayoh, 31, lost consciousness after being restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in May 2015. Solicitor Aamer Anwar said the family believed his death was unlawful and Police Scotland was responsible. The civil action will be raised against Acting Chief Constable Iain Livingstone shortly before three-year ""time bar"" laws come into force on Thursday, exactly three years since the death. The action - to be lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh - is believed to be the first time police in Scotland have been sued over an unlawful killing. Mr Bayoh died on Sunday 3 May 2015. Police had reacted to reports that a man - later identified as Mr Bayoh - was behaving erratically and brandishing a knife. His family maintain he was not carrying a weapon when he was stopped, although the BBC understands a knife was later found nearby. He was restrained by up to six officers using CS spray and batons. A toxicology report later said that ecstasy had been found in Mr Bayoh's system, as well traces of psycho-stimulant A-PVP, sometimes called Flakka. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) filed a report on Mr Bayou's death but two years on, the Crown Office has still to decide what, if any action, will be taken. The family has previously said it would call for a public inquiry if officers were not prosecuted. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm that legal papers have been received and as such it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.""

Fake online reviews 'for sale on internet',"Fake online reviews are being openly traded on the internet, a BBC investigation has found. BBC 5 live Investigates was able to buy a false, five-star recommendation placed on one of the world's leading review websites, Trustpilot. It also uncovered online forums where Amazon shoppers are offered full refunds in exchange for product reviews. Both companies said they do not tolerate false reviews. The popularity of online review sites mean they are increasingly relied on by both businesses and their customers, with the government'sCompetition and Markets Authority,externalestimating such reviews potentially influence Â£23 billion of UK customer spending every year. Maria Menelaou, whose Yorkshire Fisheries chip shop is the top-ranked fish and chip shop in Blackpool on several review sites, said the system has replaced traditional advertising. ""It brings us a lot of customers ... It really does make a difference. We don't do any kind of advertising,"" Mrs Menelaou said. While three quarters of UK adults use online review websites, almost half of those believe they have seen fake reviews, according to a survey of 1500 UK residents conducted by theChartered Institute of Marketing,externaland shared with BBC 5 live Investigates. Some US analysts estimate as many as half of the reviews for certain products posted on international websites such as Amazon are potentially unreliable. ""Sellers are trying to game the system and there's a lot of money on the table,"" said Tommy Noonan, who runs ReviewMeta, a US-based website that analyses online reviews. ""If you can rank number one for, say, bluetooth headsets and you're selling a cheap product, you can make a lot of money,"" he said. In 2016, Amazon introduced a range of measures prohibiting what it called ""incentivised reviews"", where businesses offered customers free goods in exchange for positive reviews. Mr Noonan said this effectively drove the problem underground, leading to the emergence of Facebook groups where potential Amazon customers were encouraged to buy a product and post a review in return for a full refund. BBC 5 live Investigates identified several of these groups and, within minutes of joining, was approached with offers of full refunds on products bought on Amazon in exchange for positive reviews. ""5 star is better for us"" said one person making such an offer, in an exchange of messages with the BBC. ""We value our brand, will refund you as we promised ... All my company do in this way."" It was not possible to identify the people making these offers, nor contact the businesses whose products they were seeking reviews for. ""We do not permit reviews in exchange for compensation of any kind, including payment. Customers and Marketplace sellers must follow our review guidelines and those that don't will be subject to action including potential termination of their account,"" Amazon said in a statement. Responding to adverts posted on eBay, the BBC was also able to purchase a false 5-star review on Trustpilot, an online review website that describes itself as ""committed to being the most trusted online review community on the market"". ""Dan Box is one of the most respected professionals I have dealt with. It was a pleasure doing business with him,"" this review said - word for word as requested by 5 live Investigates.

Supermarket merger 'must be investigated'UK competition watchdog is urged by politicians to probe a potential merger of Sainsbury's and Asda.3h3 hours agoBusiness,"The competition watchdog is being urged by politicians to examine the possible merger of Sainsbury's and Asda. Talks between the two UK supermarket chains are at an ""advanced"" stage, with more details of a potential Â£10bn deal expected on Monday. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, a former business secretary, said the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ""must investigate"". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey echoed Sir Vince's concerns. Simon Jack: Five big questions for Sainsbury's boss Merger talks 'sign of changing retail world' Aldi tops supermarket satisfaction survey Thousands of jobs at risk at Sainsbury's The combined group would comprise 2,800 stores and would represent 31.4% of the UK grocery market - slightly more than that of market leader Tesco. The two brands are expected to be retained, should a merger go ahead. Sir Vince said the CMA should force the companies to sell off stores if the merger meant the new giant was dominant in a particular area.  He said the move risked creating ""even more concentrated local monopolies"". He later told the BBC: ""The competition inquiry has to focus on the customers, that is their job."" And Ms Long-Bailey warned that the merger risked ""squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further"". Any investigation by the CMA could only be announced once an intention to merge has been formally unveiled. Latest figures show that Tesco has a 25% grocery market share, while Sainsbury's has 13.8% and Asda has 12.9%. Together, they would move just ahead of Tesco, with 26.7% of the grocery market. The merger would have to be backed by the CMA, as the two chains are the UK's second and third biggest grocery chains. Catherine Shuttleworth, shopping and retail expert at agency Savvy,  told BBC Radio 5live: ""The two brands are very different. Sainsbury's is also much stronger in the south, and Asda much stronger in the north."" The two chains are focused on different geographic areas But she said there were similarities, including both having ""quite strong clothing businesses"". She added that any merger talks would get off to a good start as Asda chief executive Roger Burnley used to work for Sainsbury's, and Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe is a former employee of Asda. Mrs Shuttleworth said the proposed merger was being driven by a number of factors, including the possible entry of Amazon into the UK groceries market, and also the challenge to traditional chains from discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. ""In the UK Amazon have started to dip their toe in the waters with food,"" she said. ""They have got a trading agreement with Morrisons, who are their agent. ""But the fear is that if they really went into the UK market, then they will take share. Part of the merger is to make sure they are protected from that, and also from the growing rise of the discounters."" News of the potential deal also caused concern among workers' unions. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, said: ""Our first priority is to safeguard the job of every single Asda member, both in stores and in distribution. We are demanding an urgent meeting with Asda to get the answers and assurances our members need and deserve."" And Joanne McGuinness, Usdaw national officer, said: ""Our priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes."" Asda was founded in Yorkshire in 1965. It was bought by US retail giant Walmart in 1999. The first ever Sainsbury's store opened in 1869 in London's Drury Lane. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, is now the supermarket's largest shareholder. Analysis: By BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson All the main supermarket chains have been looking to find new sources of growth because there's not much of it around their own aisles. Asda had been the poorest performer of the big four. The industry has been wondering what its big strategic move might be. Now we know. If this merger goes through, it will be the biggest shake up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004.

Trump criticises 'lousy' London embassy,"This video can not be played Take a look around the new US embassy Donald Trump has again criticised the new home of the US embassy in London, describing the south London location as ""lousy"" and ""horrible"". He spoke at a rally three months after saying the sale of the Grosvenor Square site in Mayfair was a ""bad deal"". The US president, who visits the UK in July, had blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, but the move was agreed during George W Bush's presidency. The new embassy in Vauxhall cost $1bn (Â£730m) and holds 800 members of staff. Mr Trump said he thought - but would have to check - that officials sold the previous site for $250m (Â£181m). Speaking at a rally in Michigan, the president said: ""In the UK, in London, we had the best site in all of London. The best site. ""Well, some genius said: 'We're gonna sell the site and then we're going to take the money and build a new embassy.' ""That sounds good, right, but you've got to have money left over if you do that, right?"" Reality Check: Who sold the US embassy in London? Take a look inside the new US embassy in London Vauxhall residents say what's wrong with our area? He added: ""By the way, they wanted me to cut the ribbon on the embassy [in January] and I said: 'I'm not going. I don't wanna do it.'"" Mr Trump previously described the new site as an ""off location"". The building on the Mayfair site was never owned outright by the United States. It owned a 999-year leasehold, but the freehold is owned by Grosvenor Estates. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said the embassy was moved from its Mayfair site because it was too small to install the modern security it needed.

Lib Dem leader and former business secretary Vince Cable has said there must be an immediate investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority.

Sainsbury'stook over catalogue retailerArgos and Habitat for Â£1.4bn in 2016. In 2017,Tesco merged with Booker- the UK's largest food wholesaler. By BBC business editor Simon Jack The two parties realise that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will have some serious questions to ask. Sainsbury's concedes that some store disposals will be required to satisfy them, so the 30% market share figure may well go down. Having said that, sources close to the deal say the market has changed in the last few years and point to the Tesco Booker merger as evidence that the CMA understands that. Sainsbury's is continuing to integrate Argos into its network and sees an opportunity to roll out Argos in Asda stores. The two brands will be retained as they appeal to a different customer but they see a good geographical fit, with Asda stronger in the north and Sainsbury's in the south. The shop workers trade union Usdaw has said it is seeking urgent talks with Sainsbury's and Asda over the protection of jobs. Asda was founded in Yorkshire in 1965.

Supermarket merger 'must be investigated',"The competition watchdog is being urged by politicians to examine the possible merger of Sainsbury's and Asda. Talks between the two UK supermarket chains are at an ""advanced"" stage, with more details of a potential Â£10bn deal expected on Monday. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, a former business secretary, said the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ""must investigate"". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey echoed Sir Vince's concerns. Simon Jack: Five big questions for Sainsbury's boss Merger talks 'sign of changing retail world' Aldi tops supermarket satisfaction survey Thousands of jobs at risk at Sainsbury's The combined group would comprise 2,800 stores and would represent 31.4% of the UK grocery market - slightly more than that of market leader Tesco. The two brands are expected to be retained, should a merger go ahead. Sir Vince said the CMA should force the companies to sell off stores if the merger meant the new giant was dominant in a particular area.  He said the move risked creating ""even more concentrated local monopolies"". He later told the BBC: ""The competition inquiry has to focus on the customers, that is their job."" And Ms Long-Bailey warned that the merger risked ""squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further"". Any investigation by the CMA could only be announced once an intention to merge has been formally unveiled. Latest figures show that Tesco has a 25% grocery market share, while Sainsbury's has 13.8% and Asda has 12.9%. Together, they would move just ahead of Tesco, with 26.7% of the grocery market. The merger would have to be backed by the CMA, as the two chains are the UK's second and third biggest grocery chains. Catherine Shuttleworth, shopping and retail expert at agency Savvy,  told BBC Radio 5live: ""The two brands are very different. Sainsbury's is also much stronger in the south, and Asda much stronger in the north."" The two chains are focused on different geographic areas But she said there were similarities, including both having ""quite strong clothing businesses"". She added that any merger talks would get off to a good start as Asda chief executive Roger Burnley used to work for Sainsbury's, and Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe is a former employee of Asda. Mrs Shuttleworth said the proposed merger was being driven by a number of factors, including the possible entry of Amazon into the UK groceries market, and also the challenge to traditional chains from discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. ""In the UK Amazon have started to dip their toe in the waters with food,"" she said. ""They have got a trading agreement with Morrisons, who are their agent. ""But the fear is that if they really went into the UK market, then they will take share. Part of the merger is to make sure they are protected from that, and also from the growing rise of the discounters."" News of the potential deal also caused concern among workers' unions. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, said: ""Our first priority is to safeguard the job of every single Asda member, both in stores and in distribution. We are demanding an urgent meeting with Asda to get the answers and assurances our members need and deserve."" And Joanne McGuinness, Usdaw national officer, said: ""Our priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes."" Asda was founded in Yorkshire in 1965. It was bought by US retail giant Walmart in 1999. The first ever Sainsbury's store opened in 1869 in London's Drury Lane. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, is now the supermarket's largest shareholder. Analysis: By BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson All the main supermarket chains have been looking to find new sources of growth because there's not much of it around their own aisles. Asda had been the poorest performer of the big four. The industry has been wondering what its big strategic move might be. Now we know. If this merger goes through, it will be the biggest shake up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004.

Why you're getting so many privacy emails,"You'd be forgiven for thinking the privacy emails you've been getting are all because of therecent Facebook scandal- but you'd be wrong. From Twitter to Airbnb, your favourite musicians to the football club you support - you may have noticed they've all been emailing you. The reason is because there's a new European law on its way. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was going to happen before Cambridge Analytica was in the news. Every mailing list you've signed up to, online shop you've bought from, social media website you're part of, probably all store your information. It doesn't mean they've done anything with your details that they shouldn't have. But these new rules, which replace the Data Protection Act 1998, are designed to give you, the customer, better control over who has that data. These emails are essentially telling you that they've rewritten their terms and conditions. Those long terms and conditions documents that most people click past because they are really long and full of jargon will need to be written in language that's easy to understand. You, as the customer, must also specifically 'opt in' to sharing your data and can ask for it to be removed at any time. There's lots ofinformation hereif you want to know more. That's because, just like all the other companies, Facebook has updated its documents to abide by the new law. It has also made many more changes in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But even if all this hadn't happened you'd probably still have received an email from Facebook about the new rules. Not specifically. It's worth being aware of which businesses hold information about you and all these emails will help to do that. And it does provide you with a great opportunity to remove yourself from any mailing lists that you're no longer interested in. Don't remember signing up for news about artisan cheese seven years ago? Now's a good moment to say goodbye. You may have heard of the 'right to be forgotten' and this is all about your data. Anyone can ask for their personal data to be deleted at any time, if it's no longer relevant. You can also contact companies to find out what information they have about you - including how they got it and what it's used for.

New fund to protect Great Barrier ReefThe World Heritage site has lost 30% of its coral due to environmental degradation.4h4 hours agoAustralia,"The Great Barrier Reef is under threat from coral bleaching and damage from crown-of-thorns starfish Australia has pledged A$500 million (Â£275m; $379m) to protect the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef. In recent years, the reef has lost 30% of its coral due to bleaching linked to rising sea temperatures and damage from crown-of-thorns starfish. The funding will be used to reduce the runoff of agricultural pesticides and improve water quality. Some of the money will be used to help farmers near the reef modify their practices. Threats to the reef include ""large amounts of sediment, nitrogen and pesticide run-off"" as well as the crown-of-thorns starfish species, Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg said. The reef can be seen from space and was listed as a world heritage site in 1981 by the United Nations cultural body Unesco. The race to document Australia's unknown species Damage to Australia's reef 'unprecedented' Crown-of-thorns starfish videos, news and facts There are 1,052 sites of environmental and cultural importance such as the reef on Unesco's World Heritage List. In 2017, the organisation decided not to place the Great Barrier Reef on its official list of 55 World Heritage sites ""in danger"". Unprecedented coral bleaching in recent years has caused damage to two-thirds of the reef, aerial surveys in 2017 showed. Crown-of-thorns starfish feed on coral in the Great Barrier Reef Crown-of-thorns starfish are one of the most damaging creatures affecting tropical coral reefs as they are voracious predators that release the contents of their stomach on to the coral. Digestive juices then liquify the coral ready for consumption. A single individual starfish can wipe out large areas of a reef. The reef is actually a vast collection of thousands of smaller coral reefs stretching from the northern tip of Queensland to the state's southern city of Bundaberg. Conservationists have welcomed the extra funding, but said the government needed to focus on climate change. ""You cannot 'preserve' the Great Barrier Reef without cutting carbon emissions. That means no new coal, oil or gas,"" Greenpeace Australia Pacific's CEO, David Ritter, said on Twitter. However, Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop told Australian news outlets her country was a world leader in managing and protecting the reef. Australia is considered to be one of the world's worst polluters of greenhouse gases. In 2015,Australia said it planned to cut greenhouse gas emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels before 2030.

Ex-deputy insists Rudd did nothing wrong,"Home Secretary Amber Rudd reportedly set out her ""ambitious but deliverable"" aim to deport more illegal immigrants last year in a letter to Theresa May. Labour said the letter proved there were removals targets and Ms Rudd was aware of them - something she has previously denied. Ms Rudd promised Mrs May a 10% or more increase in enforced removals over the ""next few years,""The Guardian says,external. She is due to make a Commons statement on Monday amid calls for her to quit. In the letter, from January 2017, leaked to the Guardian, Ms Rudd tells Theresa May - her predecessor as home secretary - about plans to restructure the department to focus on the ""aim of increasing the number of enforced removals by more than 10% over the next few years, something I believe is ambitious, but deliverable"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""The Tories' shameful attempts to cover up their mess must end. Clearly there were targets, and Amber Rudd was aware of them. ""Theresa May has sent minister after minister out to protect her cruel legacy, misleading Parliament and the public in the process. With each new revelation, we get more of an insight into the Tories' heartless Home Office policies which have led to the Windrush scandal. ""This chaos has gone on for far too long. It's time for Rudd to go and for the government to rethink its whole approach."" Amber Rudd 'didn't see' migrant memo Windrush pledges 'must be written into law' Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? The Windrush row began when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s, and their relatives, had been declared illegal immigrants. Ms Rudd's aim of increasing ""enforced deportations"" would not have affected Windrush migrants, as they were threatened with ""voluntary departure"". (The term ""voluntary"" describes the method of departure rather than the choice of whether or not to depart - those leaving in this way are able to approach the Home Office for financial assistance with travel costs). Ms Rudd had initially told MPs investigating the scandal there were no removals targets - before admitting ""local"" targets for voluntary removals had been set. She told the Commons on Thursday she had not been aware of them. But the Guardian reported a June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that refers to targets. Brandon Lewis was the immigration minister when the leaked memo was sent Ms Rudd's former deputy at the Home Office, Brandon Lewis, said he often talked to her about the 10% ""ambition"" for enforced removals but not ""detailed numbers or targets"". Mr Lewis, who is now Conservative Party chairman, said he remembered receiving the memo, from the Home Office's immigration enforcement team, in July last year. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""I am confident that she didn't have that memo. When Amber Rudd says she didn't see something, I know she didn't see it."" This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK He said there was a difference between the figures in that memo, which was an update of progress towards a target of ""12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18"", and what Ms Rudd was asked about at the home affairs committee hearing on Wednesday. He said those figures has been ""key performance indicators"" for local internal use. Yvette Cooper, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee said this was ""clearly not true"" and called on Mr Lewis to withdraw his claim, tweeting: ""It doesn't help anyone and is completely inappropriate for you to try to rewrite committee questions."" Mr Lewis said Ms Rudd had put an extra Â£10m into the team that produced the memo leaked to The Guardian to help them meet a target of increasing removals by 10% ""in the years ahead,"" as she sets out in her letter to Mrs May. ""I was working with her on a weekly basis to make sure that we were doing everything we could - working with the police, working with local government - to help vulnerable people, to crackdown on criminals, and to remove more people who are here illegally,"" he told the programme. ""Yes, I did talk to the home secretary about that and the overall work that we were doing and the overall ambition to see an increase in numbers, but not on the detailed numbers and targets."" Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Diane Abbott said the home secretary may have breached the ministerial code by not giving accurate and truthful information to Parliament. Ms Abbott has written to the prime minister to demand an investigation into Ms Rudd's conduct and a full investigation into targets for immigration removals. On Wednesday, Ms Rudd told the home affairs committee: ""We do not have targets for removals."" Asked about evidence giving to the committee by the head of the ISU union, for border and immigration workers, that targets had been set, she asked whether they were a ""number"" or a ""percentage"" before promising to look into the issue. On Thursday, she told MPs: ""I have never agreed that there should be specific removal targets and I would never support a policy that puts targets ahead of people.""

"Burning Man festival founder diesLarry Harvey, who founded the huge countercultural event in 1986, dies in San Francisco aged 70.12h12 hours agoUS & Canada","Larry Harvey was ""never one for labels"", the Burning Man CEO said Larry Harvey, founder of the Burning Man arts festival, has died in San Francisco aged 70. He suffered a stroke earlier this month and passed away at home on Saturday morning, a statement on the organisation's website said. The annual counterculture festival sees up to 70,000 people gather in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. It features giant interactive art installations and a huge wooden man that is burnt at the end of the event. ""Larry was never one for labels. He didn't fit a mould; he broke it with the way he lived his life,""Burning Man CEO Marian Goodell wrote,external. ""He was a landscape gardener, a philosopher, a visionary, a wit, a writer, an inspiration, an instigator, a mentor, and at one point a taxi driver and a bike messenger."" ""The loss of his presence in our daily lives will be felt for years, but because of the spirit of who he is, we will never truly be without him,"" she added. What does it take to run Burning Man? Burning Man bicycles on the move Hedonistic festival's unlikely relocation Burning Man was founded in June 1986 when Mr Harvey and his friend Jerry Goodell burned a wooden man on Baker Beach in San Francisco to mark the summer solstice. This then grew into the festival, which in 1990 was held in Nevada's Black Rock Desert for the first time. It quickly became one of America's most well-known cultural events, attracting famous faces such as singer Katy Perry and the actor Will Smith.

"Five hurt in restaurant ceiling collapseFive people were treated by paramedics in the ""shocking"" incident on Saturday night.","A section of the ceiling landed on diners Five people were hurt when part of a restaurant ceiling fell on them as they dined beneath, police have said. They were treated by paramedics at the Sizzling Palate restaurant in Bolton at about 22:30 BST on Saturday. Some customers criticised the venue's management, with one saying: ""Not one came down to ask if anyone was OK."" Assistant manager Mohammad Amiri disputed complaints, saying managers were busy talking to 999 crews while ""staff attended to customers"". He said the incident was in the basement of the three-floor venue, which ""continued to trade as normal"". Mr Amiri said: ""A section of a suspended ceiling in the lower ground restaurant came loose from its fixing and dropped. ""A couple of customers sustained some minor cuts and bruising."" The ceiling section was lifted to let people get out from underneath Huzaifa Chunara, from Manchester, was having a meal with his wife and 12 friends when the ceiling dropped. ""There was no creaking... no indication that it was going to let go,"" he said. He said it landed on his wife and friends but just missed him. ""They were trapped beneath for about 30 seconds."" Another customer, who did not want to be named, said: ""People panicked, were shocked, had no idea what was happening, so the men just got up and tried to lift the ceiling off people. ""There were a good 15-20 people that had to actually try and hold the ceiling up butâ¦ once people got out from underneath, they put it back on the table. This section of ceiling came loose from its fixing, the restaurant said ""Fire and police were there quite quickly, within five minutes. ""What was really shocking was that no management came to talk to us, [check that] people were OK - it was just the people that were injured that had to take charge."" Mr Chunara said a waiter helped after the ceiling section fell but ""not one [manager] came down to ask if anyone was OK"". ""There was no protocol in place,"" he said. He said one woman, who was wearing a neck restraint, had to be taken out on a stretcher. Mr Amiri said: ""Management were involved in communicating with emergency services while staff attended to customers. ""We did not want to create any panic. We just wanted to keep things calm.

New fund to protect Great Barrier ReefThe World Heritage site has lost 30% of its coral due to environmental degradation.2h2 hours agoAustralia,"The Great Barrier Reef is under threat from coral bleaching and damage from crown-of-thorns starfish Australia has pledged A$500 million (Â£275m; $379m) to protect the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef. In recent years, the reef has lost 30% of its coral due to bleaching linked to rising sea temperatures and damage from crown-of-thorns starfish. The funding will be used to reduce the runoff of agricultural pesticides and improve water quality. Some of the money will be used to help farmers near the reef modify their practices. Threats to the reef include ""large amounts of sediment, nitrogen and pesticide run-off"" as well as the crown-of-thorns starfish species, Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg said. The reef can be seen from space and was listed as a world heritage site in 1981 by the United Nations cultural body Unesco. The race to document Australia's unknown species Damage to Australia's reef 'unprecedented' Crown-of-thorns starfish videos, news and facts There are 1,052 sites of environmental and cultural importance such as the reef on Unesco's World Heritage List. In 2017, the organisation decided not to place the Great Barrier Reef on its official list of 55 World Heritage sites ""in danger"". Unprecedented coral bleaching in recent years has caused damage to two-thirds of the reef, aerial surveys in 2017 showed. Crown-of-thorns starfish feed on coral in the Great Barrier Reef Crown-of-thorns starfish are one of the most damaging creatures affecting tropical coral reefs as they are voracious predators that release the contents of their stomach on to the coral. Digestive juices then liquify the coral ready for consumption. A single individual starfish can wipe out large areas of a reef. The reef is actually a vast collection of thousands of smaller coral reefs stretching from the northern tip of Queensland to the state's southern city of Bundaberg. Conservationists have welcomed the extra funding, but said the government needed to focus on climate change. ""You cannot 'preserve' the Great Barrier Reef without cutting carbon emissions. That means no new coal, oil or gas,"" Greenpeace Australia Pacific's CEO, David Ritter, said on Twitter. However, Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop told Australian news outlets her country was a world leader in managing and protecting the reef. Australia is considered to be one of the world's worst polluters of greenhouse gases. In 2015,Australia said it planned to cut greenhouse gas emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels before 2030.

"Crackdown on 'money laundering' schemeThe government says Scottish limited partnerships have been exploited in complex ""dirty money"" schemes.","The review follows claims SLPs are being exploited by money launderers The UK government has unveiled plans to crack down on a business scheme which it says has been used to launder dirty foreign money. It followsa review of Scottish limited partnerships(SLPs) by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). BEIS said SLPs had been used to move $80bn from Russia in just four years. It also said just five individuals were behind thousands of SLPs registered between January 2016 and mid-May 2017. The department is due to launch a consultation on Monday on proposals to close loopholes in the law regarding the scheme. Scam sparks Scots fraud haven fears The billion-dollar ex-council flat Ukraine's stolen billions and the Eurovision connection The proposals would apply to all limited partnerships in the UK. BEIS said thousands of British businesses used SLPs and limited partnerships legitimately. But it said new research would show they had been exploited in complex money laundering schemes, including one which used 100 SLPs to move up to $80bn out of Russia. The department also said the scheme had been linked to international criminal networks in Eastern Europe and had allegedly been used in arms deals. What are Scottish limited partnerships? SLPs are a business entity provided for in UK law Limited partnerships are formed by at least two partners, one of which must be a general partner - who is liable for any debts incurred - and one limited partner - who has limited liability but cannot play a role in how the partnership is run. SLPs differ to limited partnerships elsewhere in the UK as they have ""legal personality"", which allows them to enter into contracts, take on debts or own property. In a limited partnership in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, this is done by the partners.

In 2016, it reported thatshell firms advertised as ""Scottish zero-tax offshore companies"",externalwere being marketed across the European Union. The issue has also been raised by the SNP's former Westminster leader Angus Robertson. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""For some time we have called on the UK government to tighten the regulatory framework around Scottish Limited Partnerships. ""Therefore we welcome that new regulations are now being introduced on beneficial ownership. ""This is a complex landscape and we await with interest the detail of any additional new measures, following the wider review into limited partnership law. ""We remain fully committed to ensuring that SLPs engaged in criminal activity and those individuals and organisations who help facilitate that activity are held accountable for their actions."" Under the new proposals, SLP users will need to have ""a real connection to the UK"" and do business or maintain an address in Scotland to operate an SLP. They will also need to register through an agent who will carry out anti-laundering checks.

""But as we are seeing, especially with Scottish limited partnerships, is that they are being abused to carry out all manner of crimes abroad - from foreign money laundering to arms dealing. ""This simply cannot continue to go unchecked and these reforms will improve their transparency and subject them to more stringent checks to ensure they can continue to be used as a legitimate way for investors and pension funds to invest in the UK."" Figures published in tandem with the launch of the consultation on SLP reforms will show just five individuals were responsible for more than half of 6,800 SLPs registered between January 2016 and mid-May 2017.

Nuclear test site 'collapsed',"Kim Jong-un and senior officials confer over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme in late 2017 Chinese scientists have concluded that North Korea's nuclear test site has partially collapsed, potentially rendering it unusable. The test site at Punggye-ri has been used for six nuclear tests since 2006. After the last, in September, a series of aftershocks hit the site, which seismologists believe collapsed part of the mountain's interior. On Saturday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un announced he was suspending his country's nuclear and missile tests. The surprise declaration came ahead of historic talks with South Korea and the US. The latest research from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) is due to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union, in the coming days. It concluded that eight and a half minutes after September's test, there was ""a near-vertical on-site collapse towards the nuclear test centre"". What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site? Why has Kim Jong-un halted North Korean tests now? The Punggye-ri site is situated in mountainous terrain in North Korea's north-east, and tests have taken place in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap. A one-page summary of the research on the USTC website concluded: ""The occurrence of the collapse should deem the underground infrastructure beneath mountain Mantap not be used for any future nuclear tests."" But those words do not appear in the final peer-reviewed paper. It instead says that the ""collapse in the test site calls for continued close monitoring of any leaks of radioactive materials"". Prof Wen Lianxing, the lead author of the study, told the Wall Street Journal that the conclusion about the test site's viability would not be included in the published paper, but did not say why. A graphic on the university website concludes the test site is likely unusable - but the peer-reviewed paper does not The research echoessimilar findings by a team from the Jilin Earthquake Agency,external, published in the same journal last month. That team concluded that the explosion ""created a cavity and a damaged 'chimney' of rocks above it"", leading to a collapse. The earlier paper did not offer an opinion on the viability of the test site in the wake of the collapse. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies A possible tunnel collapse at Mount Mantap has long been suspected, with Chinese scientists expressing concern soon after September's large-scale nuclear test. The US Geological Survey recorded a second seismic event about eight minutes after the test, which it assessed as a ""collapse"" of the cavity. Two aftershocks were detected as late as December, prompting concerns about the stability of the surrounding mountains. What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site?

What we know about nuclear site,"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006 and every time it has used the Punggye-ri test site. Situated in mountainous terrain in the north-east of the country, it is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility and the only active nuclear testing site in the world. But scientists believe the site has partially collapsed and may be unusable. Much of what we know about it is gleaned from satellite imagery and tracking the movement of equipment at the location. The nuclear tests have taken place in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap, near the Punggye-ri site. North Korea watchers study the details of the excavation of these tunnels to get clues on whether the country is preparing for another nuclear test. Ahead of its most recent nuclear test on 3 September 2017, some had pointed to satellite imagery from August, which showed that the site was in a standby state - indicating readiness for a test. North Korea hails 'perfect' H-bomb test The aftershocks of North Korea's nuclear test 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues Earlier in the year more tunnelling or excavation work had been detected and unidentified equipment had been placed outside one of the tunnels. The test devices are buried deep at the end of the tunnels, which end in a hook. The tunnel gets backfilled to prevent radioactive leakage and then the device is detonated. Scientists say part of the site collapsedeight and a half minutes after the test in September. It was a ""near-vertical on-site collapse towards the nuclear test centre"", Chinese researchers reported. The US Geological Survey recorded a second seismic event about eight minutes after the test, which it assessed as a ""collapse"" of the cavity. Two aftershocks were detected as late as December, prompting concerns about the stability of the surrounding mountains. We know more about Chinese cities and towns along the border with North Korea than we do about populations that might be closer to the test site inside North Korea. People in several Chinese border cities reported feeling the tremors from the seismic activity at the time of the test. School children ran out into the open in the city of Yanji, which is 10km (6.25 miles) from the border, when they felt the shaking, Global Times reported. Very close to the site is Punngye-ri village and about 80km away is the North Korean city of Chongjin, but it is not known if these towns were evacuated or warned in any way. North Korea claimed that no radiation leaked when it conducted its latest test. China's Nuclear Safety Administration and South Korea's Nuclear Safety and Security Commission do conduct emergency monitoring for radiation immediately after the tests. Experts at the analysis group 38North, who closely track the North's nuclear activities, said that radionuclides, products of the nuclear reactions that are released into the atmosphere, were detected and traced back to a previous nuclear test, in February 2013. They also pointed to the second seismic event. Minutes after the initial seismic event was picked up by sensors when the test occurred, there was another smaller one with a magnitude of 4.6. After previous tests authorities have usually reported very small amounts of radioactive particles or gases in neighbouring countries, although there is no way to test for the amounts inside North Korea.

Trump: Talks in three-four weeks,"Donald Trump said it would be ""a very important meeting"" US President Donald Trump has said talks with North Korea could take place ""over the next three or four weeks"". ""It's going [to] be a very important meeting, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,"" he said. Meanwhile, new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had had a ""good conversation"" with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang recently. On Friday, Mr Kim and the South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. The inter-Korean summit at the border came just months after warlike rhetoric from the North. Mr Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953.

Speaking at a rally in Washington, Michigan, he said: ""I think we will have a meeting over the next three or four weeks."" He said he hoped for successful negotiations on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But the president added that he was ready to walk away if the talks did not work out. North Korea has not publicly commented on Mr Trump's latest statements. Earlier on Saturday, Mr Trump tweeted that ""things are going well"" and that preparations were being made for his summit with Mr Kim. Separately, Mr Pompeo told ABC News that Mr Kim was ""prepared to... lay out a map that would help us achieve"" denuclearisation. Mr Pompeo described the North Korean leader as ""very well prepared"" during their talks in Pyongyang. US officials are still deciding where to hold the talks between President Trump and Mr Kim - but Mongolia and Singapore are understood to be two countries on the shortlist.

Will talks lead to peace?,"This video can not be played Welcoming Kim Jong-un with pomp and ritual Friday's dramatic meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his North Korean counterpart, Chairman Kim Jong-un, represents an unambiguous historic breakthrough at least in terms of the image of bilateral reconciliation and the emotional uplift it has given to South Korea public opinion. Whether the agreement announced at the meeting - the new Panmunjeom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula - offers, in substance, the right mix of concrete measures to propel the two Koreas and the wider international community towards a lasting peace remains an open question. The symbolic impact of a North Korean leader setting foot for the first time on South Korean soil cannot be underestimated. Mr Kim's bold decision to stride confidently into nominally hostile territory reflects the young dictator's confidence and acute sense of political theatre and expertly executed timing. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea His clever, seemingly spontaneous gesture to President Moon to reciprocate his step into the South by having him join him for an instance in stepping back into the North was an inspired way of asserting the equality of the two countries and their leaders. It also, by blurring the boundary between the two countries, hinted at the goal of unification that both Seoul and Pyongyang have long sought to realise. The rest of the day was full of visual firsts and a set of cleverly choreographed images of the two leaders chatting informally and intimately in the open air - deliberately advancing a powerful new narrative of the two Koreas as agents of their own destiny. Handshakes, broad smiles and bear hugs have amplified this message of Koreans determining their own future, in the process offsetting past memories of a peninsula all too often dominated by the self-interest of external great powers, whether China, Japan, or more recently, during the Cold War, the United States and the former Soviet Union. Historic summit as it happened Key moments from the meeting Read the Korean declaration in full,external Five conflicts that continued after they ended The two leaders' joint statements before the international media were another pitch perfect moment for Mr Kim to challenge the world's preconceptions. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un issues his pledge for peace with South Korea In an instance, Mr Kim's confident and relaxed announcement to the press dispelled the picture of a remote, rigid, autocratic leader in favour of a normal, humanised statesman, intent on working to advance the cause of peace and national reconciliation. A cynic might see this as both a simple propaganda victory for Mr Kim, and also his attempt to lock in place the nuclear and missile advances the North has already achieved by calling for ""phasedâ¦disarmament"" - by intentionally downplaying the expectation of immediate progress while emphasising the need for step-by-step negotiations. Why has Kim halted nuclear tests now? Profile: Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis in 300 words The joint declaration echoes the themes of past accords, including the previous Korean leaders summits of 2000 and 2007, and an earlier 1991 bilateral Reconciliation and Non-Aggression agreement. Plans to establish joint liaison missions, military dialogue and confidence building measures, economic co-operation, and the expansion of contact between the citizens of the two countries have featured in earlier agreements. However, Friday's declaration is more specific in its proposals, with the two countries pledging, for example, ""to cease all hostile acts against each other in every domain, including land, sea and airâ¦"" and providing a series of key dates for the early implementation by both sides of a raft of new confidence building measures. These include the cessation of ""all hostile acts"" near the demilitarised zone by 1 May, the start of bilateral military talks in May, joint participation by the two Koreas in the 2018 Asian Games, the re-establishment of family reunions by 15 August, and, perhaps most importantly of all, a return visit to the North by President Moon by as soon as the autumn of this year. Committing to early, albeit incremental, steps in the direction of peace, appears to be motivated by the Korean leaders' wish to foster an irresistible sense of momentum and urgency. The declaration also calls for future peace treaty talks involving the two Koreas, together with one or both of China and the US. The logic of binding external actors into a definite - but evolving - timetable for progress on key issues is that it lowers the risk of conflict on the peninsula - something both Koreas are keen to avoid and which they have long had reason to fear given the past bellicose language of a ""fire and fury"" Donald Trump. Playing for time is a viable option, given that President Moon is at the start of his five-year presidency - a marked contrast to the summits of 2000 and 2007, when the respective leaders of the South, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, were already well into their presidential terms. Mr Moon can count, therefore, on repeat meetings with Mr Kim, and the two men appear genuinely interested in sustaining their dialogue and making progress on the wide-ranging set of initiatives included in the declaration. Mr Kim's own statements at the summit have also been a vocal argument in favour of identity politics, given his stress on ""one nation, one language, one blood"", and his repeated rejection of any future conflict between the Koreas - two themes that will have played well with a South Korean public that traditionally is sympathetic to a narrative of self-confident, although not necessarily strident, nationalism. President Trump says he will continue to exert maximum pressure on North Korea For all of the stress on Koreans determining their common future, there is no escaping the decisive importance of the US. The much anticipated Trump-Kim summit in May or early June will be critical in testing the sincerity of the North's commitment to a peaceful settlement. Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to be very different from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. Not only will the Trump-Kim summit be a way of measuring the gap between the US and North Korea on this issue; it will also be an important opportunity to gauge how far the US has developed its own strategy for narrowing the differences with the North. Korea summit sparks cold noodle craze Diplomacy on the menu: How food can shape politics President Moon has cleverly and repeatedly allowed Mr Trump to assume credit for the breakthrough in inter-Korean relations, recognising perhaps that boosting the US president's ego is the best way of minimising the risk of war and keeping Mr Trump engaged in dialogue with the North. Whatever the long-term, substantive outcome from the Panmunjeom summit, the event has memorably showcased the political astuteness, diplomatic agility and strategic vision of both Korean leaders. The dramatic events of Friday are a reminder that personality and leadership are key ingredients in effecting historical change, sometimes allowing relatively small powers to advance their interests in spite of the competing interests of larger, more influential states.

What do we know about the nuclear site?,"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006 and every time it has used the Punggye-ri test site. Situated in mountainous terrain in the north-east of the country, it is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility and the only active nuclear testing site in the world. But scientists believe the site has partially collapsed and may be unusable. Much of what we know about it is gleaned from satellite imagery and tracking the movement of equipment at the location. The nuclear tests have taken place in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap, near the Punggye-ri site. North Korea watchers study the details of the excavation of these tunnels to get clues on whether the country is preparing for another nuclear test. Ahead of its most recent nuclear test on 3 September 2017, some had pointed to satellite imagery from August, which showed that the site was in a standby state - indicating readiness for a test. North Korea hails 'perfect' H-bomb test The aftershocks of North Korea's nuclear test 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues Earlier in the year more tunnelling or excavation work had been detected and unidentified equipment had been placed outside one of the tunnels. The test devices are buried deep at the end of the tunnels, which end in a hook. The tunnel gets backfilled to prevent radioactive leakage and then the device is detonated. Scientists say part of the site collapsedeight and a half minutes after the test in September. It was a ""near-vertical on-site collapse towards the nuclear test centre"", Chinese researchers reported. The US Geological Survey recorded a second seismic event about eight minutes after the test, which it assessed as a ""collapse"" of the cavity. Two aftershocks were detected as late as December, prompting concerns about the stability of the surrounding mountains. We know more about Chinese cities and towns along the border with North Korea than we do about populations that might be closer to the test site inside North Korea. People in several Chinese border cities reported feeling the tremors from the seismic activity at the time of the test. School children ran out into the open in the city of Yanji, which is 10km (6.25 miles) from the border, when they felt the shaking, Global Times reported. Very close to the site is Punngye-ri village and about 80km away is the North Korean city of Chongjin, but it is not known if these towns were evacuated or warned in any way.

"Trump criticises ""lousy"" London embassy","This video can not be played Take a look around the new US embassy Donald Trump has again criticised the new home of the US embassy in London, describing the south London location as ""lousy"" and ""horrible"". He spoke at a rally three months after saying the sale of the Grosvenor Square site in Mayfair was a ""bad deal"". The US president, who visits the UK in July, had blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, but the move was agreed during George W Bush's presidency. The new embassy in Vauxhall cost $1bn (Â£730m) and holds 800 members of staff. Mr Trump said he thought - but would have to check - that officials sold the previous site for $250m (Â£181m). Speaking at a rally in Michigan, the president said: ""In the UK, in London, we had the best site in all of London. The best site. ""Well, some genius said: 'We're gonna sell the site and then we're going to take the money and build a new embassy.' ""That sounds good, right, but you've got to have money left over if you do that, right?"" Reality Check: Who sold the US embassy in London? Take a look inside the new US embassy in London Vauxhall residents say what's wrong with our area? He added: ""By the way, they wanted me to cut the ribbon on the embassy [in January] and I said: 'I'm not going. I don't wanna do it.'"" Mr Trump previously described the new site as an ""off location"". The building on the Mayfair site was never owned outright by the United States. It owned a 999-year leasehold, but the freehold is owned by Grosvenor Estates. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said the embassy was moved from its Mayfair site because it was too small to install the modern security it needed.

N Korea nuclear test site 'to close in May',"A satellite image of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North Korea North Korea's nuclear test site will close in May, the South Korean president's office has said. A spokesman said the closure of the Punggye-ri site would be done in public and foreign experts from South Korea and the US would be invited to watch. Scientists have said the site may have partially collapsed in September. On Friday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in agreed to work to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. Their summit came after months of warlike rhetoric from the North. On Saturday,US President Donald Trump said he would likely hold talks with the North Korean leadership ""over the next three or four weeks""about the denuclearisation of the peninsula. A senior presidential communications official, Yoon Young-chan, said that Mr Kim had stated he ""would carry out the closing of the nuclear test site in May"". Mr Yoon added that the North Korean leader had also said he ""would soon invite experts of South Korea and the US to disclose the process to the international community with transparency"". Will Korea talks lead to lasting peace? Five conflicts that continued after they ended The office also said North Korea would change its time zone - currently half an hour different - to match that of the South. North Korea has so far made no public comments on the issue. Situated in mountainous terrain in the north-east, it is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility. The nuclear tests have taken place in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap, near the Punggye-ri site. North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site Six nuclear tests have been carried out there since 2006. After the last, in September 2017,a series of aftershocks hit the site, which seismologists believe collapsed part of the mountain's interior. Mr Kim made an apparent reference to these reports, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. ""Some say that we are terminating facilities that are not functioning, but you will see that they are in good condition,"" the North Korean leader was quoted as saying by Mr Yoon on Sunday. The information about the nuclear site has been gathered mainly from satellite imagery and tracking the movement of equipment at the location. Analysis by the BBC's Korea correspondent Laura Bicker This is another significant and symbolic step by Kim Jong-un. He had already announced he'd be closing the Punggye-ri test site, but now he has told officials in South Korea that he's prepared to make it public and invite experts and media from Seoul and the US to inspect it. Mr Kim also told President Moon that he hoped trust could be built with the US and reiterated that there would be no need for him to have nuclear weapons if they formally ended the war on the Korean peninsula. Mr Kim said once Washington spoke to him North Korea would know he was not an aggressor. He added that his heart was broken when he saw the two clocks with different Korean time zones hanging on the wall of the peace house at the border between the two countries. He will now match the time zone in the North with that of the South. Mr Kim and Mr Moon said they would pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not total peace.

Rudd 'didn't mislead',"Senior Tories have rallied around Amber Rudd, amid criticism for her failure to know specific migrant removal targets. The home secretary said she had not seen a memo leaked to the Guardian suggesting she knew of the objectives. Justice Secretary David Gauke said Ms Rudd ""made a mistake but didn't knowingly mislead"" while Environment Secretary Michael Gove pointed to the vast sum of emails ministers receive. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott continued to call for Ms Rudd to quit. ""I am just surprised that she doesn't seem to take the issue seriously enough to offer her resignation,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. Ms Abbott said it was the decision to set a numerical target for removing illegal immigrants that contributed to problems faced by the Windrush generation, where Commonwealth citizens, who came to Britain in the decades after World War Two were wrongly targeted. ""The danger is that very broad target put pressure on Home Office officials to bundle Jamaican grandmothers into detention centres,"" she said. Some of the Windrush generation have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs or been refused access to medical treatment. Their plight has sparked a storm of criticism for the government, with Prime Minister Theresa May apologising for their treatment. Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Who are the Windrush generation? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories On Saturday, almost 100 people met at the Black Cultural Archives in Brixton, where lawyers joined people who may have been affected by the Windrush fallout. Among them was Louis Smart who came to Britain as a child in 1963, travelling on his mother's passport. ""I've got a National Insurance number but I have tried to get a passport, and every time I lose the fee because you have to have certain documents,"" he said. ""I think the home secretary should resign. This is deliberate."" But one lawyer, Jacqueline McKenzie, said a new home secretary was not necessarily the answer since the system itself needed addressing. ""That's all people want,"" she said. ""They want evidence that they are British and then they can move on with their lives."" Louis Smart, who came to Britain in 1963, says he was 'left in limbo' Ms Rudd faced calls to resign from her position as home secretary after telling MPs earlier this week there had been no targets for migrant removal then later admitting ""local"" targets existed. In a series of late night tweets on Friday, she apologised, saying that although her office had been copied into the document she did not see it herself. The memo, seen by the Guardian, from June 2017 set out Home Office targets for achieving 12,800 ""enforced returns"" in 2017-18. It also said targets had been exceeded for ""assisted returns"". She is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons on Monday to respond to what she called ""legitimate questions"" about illegal migration. This video can not be played Amber Rudd ""can't be held responsible for a document she didn't see"" By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent One by one cabinet ministers have offered support to their colleague Amber Rudd. After a tense few hours on Friday evening when her position seemed to be uncertain, there is now an effort to rally round the home secretary. She has given an explanation and an apology, and for MPs in her own party and the prime minister, that would appear to be enough. To lose Amber Rudd would leave Theresa May further exposed to criticism of her own record at the home office. It would also upset the delicate balance of opinions on Brexit in cabinet with crunch votes on the government's policy looming at Westminster. But the home secretary's position is far from rock solid. She has promised a statement to parliament on Monday. For Amber Rudd it may feel like a very long weekend. The chair of the home affairs select committee, Yvette Cooper, has said ""serious questions"" need to be answered when Ms Rudd returns to the committee to give further evidence. ""We have obviously been given inaccurate information to Parliament twice now,"" she said. Asked whether ministers could cite the volume of emails received as an excuse, Ms Cooper said a ""huge amount"" of documents are received but systems had to be in place.

Michael Gove told Radio 4's Today: ""There are hundreds of documents which are copied in to a secretary of state's office every day and week. ""She was very clear both in her apology and also in the fact that this specific document wasn't placed in her box, wasn't brought to her attention. It wasn't a matter for decision."" Justice Secretary David Gauke told the programme that Ms Rudd is an ""excellent"" home secretary. ""She has accepted that she made a mistake, she didn't knowingly mislead the House of Commons, but she accepted she was inaccurate in her statements. ""She's coming back to the House of Commons on Monday to correct the record."" Under the Ministerial Code, if any minister ""knowingly"" misleads Parliament they are expected to resign. Downing Street has already pledged its support to Ms Rudd, saying the prime minister has ""full confidence"" in her. The six-page document, from Immigration Enforcement Agency boss Hugh Ind, states: ""IE has set a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18, aided by the redistribution of resources towards this area. ""This will move us along the path towards the 10% increased performance on enforced returns, which we promised the home secretary earlier this year."" It adds: ""We have exceeded our target of assisted returns. We set an internal target of 1,250 of these returns for 2016-17â¦ we delivered 1,581.""

N Korea nuclear test site 'collapsed',"Kim Jong-un and senior officials confer over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme in late 2017 Chinese scientists have concluded that North Korea's nuclear test site has partially collapsed, potentially rendering it unusable. The test site at Punggye-ri has been used for six nuclear tests since 2006. After the last, in September, a series of aftershocks hit the site, which seismologists believe collapsed part of the mountain's interior. On Saturday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un announced he was suspending his country's nuclear and missile tests. The surprise declaration came ahead of historic talks with South Korea and the US. The latest research from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) is due to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union, in the coming days. It concluded that eight and a half minutes after September's test, there was ""a near-vertical on-site collapse towards the nuclear test centre"". What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site? Why has Kim Jong-un halted North Korean tests now? The Punggye-ri site is situated in mountainous terrain in North Korea's north-east, and tests have taken place in a system of tunnels dug below Mount Mantap. A one-page summary of the research on the USTC website concluded: ""The occurrence of the collapse should deem the underground infrastructure beneath mountain Mantap not be used for any future nuclear tests."" But those words do not appear in the final peer-reviewed paper. It instead says that the ""collapse in the test site calls for continued close monitoring of any leaks of radioactive materials"". Prof Wen Lianxing, the lead author of the study, told the Wall Street Journal that the conclusion about the test site's viability would not be included in the published paper, but did not say why. A graphic on the university website concludes the test site is likely unusable - but the peer-reviewed paper does not The research echoessimilar findings by a team from the Jilin Earthquake Agency,external, published in the same journal last month. That team concluded that the explosion ""created a cavity and a damaged 'chimney' of rocks above it"", leading to a collapse. The earlier paper did not offer an opinion on the viability of the test site in the wake of the collapse. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies A possible tunnel collapse at Mount Mantap has long been suspected, with Chinese scientists expressing concern soon after September's large-scale nuclear test. The US Geological Survey recorded a second seismic event about eight minutes after the test, which it assessed as a ""collapse"" of the cavity. Two aftershocks were detected as late as December, prompting concerns about the stability of the surrounding mountains. What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site?

Who was on Windrush ship?,"The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948 carrying hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean hoping for a new life in Britain - alongside hundreds from elsewhere. Who were they? June 2020: To mark this year's Windrush Day, on 22 June, we have retrieved this article from our archives. The former passenger liner's journey up the Thames on that misty June day is now regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration between 1948 and 1971 known as the ""Windrush generation"". Many were enticed to cross the Atlantic by job opportunities amid the UK's post-war labour shortage. But, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it emerged last year that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation, denied access to NHS treatment, benefits and pensions and stripped of their jobs.The UK government was forced to apologise and offered compensationfor anyone who had ""suffered loss"". The ship - which dropped anchor on 21 June and released its travellers a day later - was carrying 1,027 passengers, including two stowaways, according to BBC analysisof the ship's records kept by the National Archives.,external Alongside those travelling from the Caribbean for work, there were also Polish nationals displaced by World War Two, members of the RAF and people from Britain. Passenger Lucile Harris, who settled in Britain from the Caribbean, recalled her arrival in Tilbury in aninterview with the BBC in 1998to mark the 50th anniversary of the Windrush sailing. ""It was a lovely day, beautiful, and they [family] were all at the dock waiting for me... I was very excited."" According to the ship's passenger lists, more than half of the 1,027 listed official passengers on board (539) gave their last country of residence as Jamaica, while 139 said Bermuda and 119 stated England. There were also people from Mexico, Scotland, Gibraltar, Burma and Wales. According to Nicholas Boston of the City University of New York, those who gave Mexico as their last country of residence were agroup of Polish refugees,external- mainly women and children - who had been offered permanent residence in Britain. Who are the Windrush generation? Advice for the Windrush generation on what to do next How do you prove you've been living in the UK? Overall, 802 passengers gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean. Many of them had paid Â£28 (about Â£1,000 today) to travel to Britain in response to job adverts in local newspapers. Among them wereJohn Hazel, 21, a boxer, Harold Wilmot, 32, a case maker and John Richards, 22, a carpenter,seen here in a photograph taken on arrival - alongside their records from the National Archives passenger list. Mr Richards,interviewed by the BBC in 1998, was, like many others, shocked to discover the difference between the ""mother country"" he had seen in books and the reality he was confronted with. ""I know a lot about Britain from school days but it was a different picture from that one, when you came face to face with the facts. It was two different things,"" he said. ""They tell you it is the 'mother country', you're all welcome, you all British. When you come here you realise you're a foreigner and that's all there is to it."" According to the ship's records, most of the Windrush's passengers got on in Jamaica, but others also joined the vessel in Trinidad, Tampico and Bermuda. As many of the eyewitness accounts have stated since, the majority of the people on board were men. There were 684 males over the age of 12, alongside 257 females of the same age. There were also 86 children aged 12 and under. The listed occupations on the passenger lists give some indication of the wide range of skills that were on offer. Among those arriving from the Caribbean were mechanics, carpenters, tailors, engineers, welders and musicians. According to the RAF,dozens of the Caribbean passengers were also RAF airmen,externalreturning from leave or veterans re-joining the service. A future Mayor of Southwark,Sam King, who had served in England with the wartime RAF, was among them. Also among the Caribbean passengers was a hatter, a retired judge, a potter, a barrister, two hairdressers, two actresses, two piano repairers, two missionaries, three boxers, five artists and six painters. The most noted occupation, though, was ""HD"" - or ""housing domestic"" - meaning a housewife, servant or cleaner. There were 172 overall on board - 96 from the Caribbean. Among the boxing hopefuls on board wereCharles Smith, 21, a welder and boxer, Vernon ""Boy"" Solas, 18, mechanic and boxer, and boxing manager Mortimer Martin, 31, who was also a welder,captured in this photograph on arrival. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular destination recorded by passengers from the Caribbean was London - 296 people gave the city as their planned place of residence. Interestingly, 109 passengers didn't give any address, perhaps indicating they had no fixed plan on arrival. A number of other passengers planned to go to Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Plymouth. Those that had nowhere to stay were temporarily housed in a former air raid shelter at Clapham South underground station. Newspaper reports from the time state how those at the shelter went on to find jobs through the nearest Labour Exchanges (Job Centres), one of which was in Coldharbour Lane, Brixton. Many then moved into rented houses and rooms in the Brixton and Clapham areas, working for employers such as the National Health Service or London Transport. From here, large Caribbean communities developed, contributing to the political, social and musical life of Britain ever since. The ship - full name HMT Empire Windrush - was originally a German passenger liner given to the UK as war reparation in 1945. First called Monte Rosa, it was converted to a troopship and renamed HMT Empire Windrush in 1947. This video can not be played What was life like on-board the Windrush? Oswald ""Columbus"" Denniston, who was the first of the Windrush passengers to get a job according to the Daily Express at the time,told the BBC in 1998 that the atmosphere on the ship was ""jolly"".,external ""We had two or three bands - calypso singers. And Jamaican people are happy-go-lucky people. When you have more than six you have a party."" On leaving the ship on 22 June, the then 35-year-old began work the same day handing out rations at the shelter in Clapham where the Windrush passengers were staying. Mr Denniston, who died in 2000 aged 86, went on to settle in Brixton, where he worked as a street trader. ""Many of us thought we would come here to get a better education and to stay for about five years,"" he said. ""But then some of us have ended staying for 50."" As for the ship itself, it made its final voyage in 1954, catching fire and sinking in the Mediterranean Sea with the loss of four members of crew. All of its passengers were saved.

Trump: N Korea talks in three-four weeks,"Donald Trump said it would be ""a very important meeting"" US President Donald Trump has said talks with North Korea could take place ""over the next three or four weeks"". ""It's going [to] be a very important meeting, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,"" he said. Meanwhile, new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had had a ""good conversation"" with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang recently. On Friday, Mr Kim and the South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. The inter-Korean summit at the border came just months after warlike rhetoric from the North. Mr Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. N Korea nuclear test site 'to shut in May' Historic summit as it happened Five key moments from the meeting Read the Korean declaration in full,external For years, Pyongyang has insisted that it would never give up its nuclear arsenal, which it claims it needs to defend itself against aggression from the US. Speaking at a rally in Washington, Michigan, he said: ""I think we will have a meeting over the next three or four weeks."" He said he hoped for successful negotiations on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But the president added that he was ready to walk away if the talks did not work out. North Korea has not publicly commented on Mr Trump's latest statements. Earlier on Saturday, Mr Trump tweeted that ""things are going well"" and that preparations were being made for his summit with Mr Kim. Separately, Mr Pompeo told ABC News that Mr Kim was ""prepared to... lay out a map that would help us achieve"" denuclearisation. Mr Pompeo described the North Korean leader as ""very well prepared"" during their talks in Pyongyang. US officials are still deciding where to hold the talks between President Trump and Mr Kim - but Mongolia and Singapore are understood to be two countries on the shortlist. Mr Kim and Mr Moon said they would pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not total peace. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un issues his pledge for peace with South Korea The commitment to denuclearisation does not explicitly refer to North Korea halting its nuclear activities but rather to the aim of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"".

Crackdown on 'money laundering' scheme,"The review follows claims SLPs are being exploited by money launderers The UK government has unveiled plans to crack down on a business scheme which it says has been used to launder dirty foreign money. It followsa review of Scottish limited partnerships(SLPs) by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). BEIS said SLPs had been used to move $80bn from Russia in just four years. It also said just five individuals were behind thousands of SLPs registered between January 2016 and mid-May 2017. The department is due to launch a consultation on Monday on proposals to close loopholes in the law regarding the scheme. Scam sparks Scots fraud haven fears The billion-dollar ex-council flat Ukraine's stolen billions and the Eurovision connection The proposals would apply to all limited partnerships in the UK. BEIS said thousands of British businesses used SLPs and limited partnerships legitimately. But it said new research would show they had been exploited in complex money laundering schemes, including one which used 100 SLPs to move up to $80bn out of Russia. The department also said the scheme had been linked to international criminal networks in Eastern Europe and had allegedly been used in arms deals. What are Scottish limited partnerships? SLPs are a business entity provided for in UK law Limited partnerships are formed by at least two partners, one of which must be a general partner - who is liable for any debts incurred - and one limited partner - who has limited liability but cannot play a role in how the partnership is run. SLPs differ to limited partnerships elsewhere in the UK as they have ""legal personality"", which allows them to enter into contracts, take on debts or own property. In a limited partnership in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, this is done by the partners. Source: BEIS Concerns about criminal activity surrounding SLPs have been highlighted by the Herald newspaper which has been campaigning on the issue. In 2016, it reported thatshell firms advertised as ""Scottish zero-tax offshore companies"",externalwere being marketed across the European Union. The issue has also been raised by the SNP's former Westminster leader Angus Robertson. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""For some time we have called on the UK government to tighten the regulatory framework around Scottish Limited Partnerships. ""Therefore we welcome that new regulations are now being introduced on beneficial ownership. ""This is a complex landscape and we await with interest the detail of any additional new measures, following the wider review into limited partnership law. ""We remain fully committed to ensuring that SLPs engaged in criminal activity and those individuals and organisations who help facilitate that activity are held accountable for their actions."" Under the new proposals, SLP users will need to have ""a real connection to the UK"" and do business or maintain an address in Scotland to operate an SLP. They will also need to register through an agent who will carry out anti-laundering checks. Business Minister Andrew Griffiths said SLPs were being abused to ""carry out all manner of crimes abroad"" UK Business Minister Andrew Griffiths said: ""The UK has taken a leading role in the fight against money laundering and is known internationally as a great place to work, invest and do business. ""But as we are seeing, especially with Scottish limited partnerships, is that they are being abused to carry out all manner of crimes abroad - from foreign money laundering to arms dealing. ""This simply cannot continue to go unchecked and these reforms will improve their transparency and subject them to more stringent checks to ensure they can continue to be used as a legitimate way for investors and pension funds to invest in the UK."" Figures published in tandem with the launch of the consultation on SLP reforms will show just five individuals were responsible for more than half of 6,800 SLPs registered between January 2016 and mid-May 2017. By June 2017, 17,000 SLPs were registered at just 10 addresses. According to the BEIS, laws introduced last year requiring SLPs to report their beneficial owner and make their ownership structure more transparent led to an 80% reduction in the number registered. The latest reforms will apply to all limited partnerships in the UK and will also include new annual reporting requirements for limited partnerships in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: ""I welcome these proposals to crack down on money laundering. ""These latest reforms will help ensure Scotland and other parts of the UK continue to be known internationally as great places to work, invest and do business.""
