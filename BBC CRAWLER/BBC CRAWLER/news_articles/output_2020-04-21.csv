"US green cards to be halted for 60 days, Trump saysThe US president's immigration ban will not be applied to temporary workers entering the country.","President Trump says the measure was needed to protect American jobs President Donald Trump has said he will halt applications of foreign nationals seeking permanent residence in the US because of the coronavirus crisis. A day after he announced the move in an ambiguous tweet, Mr Trump said the measure would protect American jobs. It is not clear how effective it will be as most visa services have already been suspended because of the outbreak. Critics say he is trying to distract attention away from his response to the virus. The US has nearly 45,000 deaths. Democrats also accuse the administration of using the pandemic to crack down on immigration. The issue has traditionally been a strong campaigning theme for Mr Trump, a Republican, but has taken a back seat during the crisis and in the lead-up to the November election. At a White House coronavirus briefing, Mr Trump said the ban could be extended ""much longer"" depending on how the economy was doing, he said. Follow our live updates from around the world After vowing to suspend ""all immigration"" to the US on Monday night, Mr Trump apparently changed his original plan after a backlash from some business leaders. It would reportedly impact immigrants given temporary working visas, like farm labourers and hi-tech employees. On Wednesday, the president wrote on Twitter that he would be signing an executive order ""prohibiting immigration"" later in the day. Allow Twitter content?

More than 20 million Americans have lost their jobs amid the coronavirus outbreak, and the president said the government had a ""solemn duty"" to ensure they regain their jobs. ""It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad,"" he said, adding that there could be some exemptions to the measure. This video can not be played ""We first must take care of the American worker,"" says President Trump ""We want to protect our US workers and I think as we move forward we will become more and more protective of them"". Mr Trump's order could spark legal challenges. The US has the highest number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the world - more than 820,000 - according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. They give immigrants legal permanent residence and the opportunity to apply for American citizenship In a typical year, nearly one million green cards are issued in the US The majority - roughly 70% - go to those with relatives living in the US, according to a 2018 report from the US Senate For employment-based green cards, a common form of the residency status, roughly 80% are issued to those already in the country, shifting from a temporary visa to permanent residence Details of Donald Trump's ""immigration ban"" have emerged, and it turns out the proposal is not as sweeping as his tweet originally suggested. The 60-day hold applies only to permanent residents, not temporary workers. That means the public health rationale for the move is even more tenuous, however. Screening immigrants for the virus would appear to be just as effective as a total halt. As many suspected, the primary justification is economic. In the president's view, permanent workers compete with US citizens for jobs - and in a financial crisis, their presence is neither needed nor desired. Many economists will be quick to disagree, arguing that the benefits of immigration outweigh the costs. That is a public policy debate President Trump will be happy to have, however. There is also the very real possibility that the order will become bogged down in the courts - a fate that befell the president's immigration orders made in the early days of his presidency. Although the administration ultimately prevailed, those battles took time. And the end of Mr Trump's first term at this point is measured in months, not years. The president could be betting, however, that his base will appreciate the effort - and deliver another four years for him in November. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

If youâve been following our updates, thanks for joining us. Weâll be back on Wednesday to bring you the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Until then, here is a recap of what happened on Tuesday:  Our live coverage was brought to you today by BBC teams in London, Singapore, Delhi, Sydney and Washington DC: Saira Asher, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Tessa Wong, Frances Mao, Krutika Pathi, Michael Emons, Joshua Nevett, Joshua Cheetham, Jim Todd, Thomas Poole, Matt Cannon, Stephen Sutcliffe, Martha Buckley, Claudia Allen, Max Matza, and Ben Collins. Opposition to Trump's green card ban has been swift from two pro-immigration groups, as one might expect. Ali Noorani, of the National Immigration Forum, wrote on Twitter that ""immigrants account for 17% of healthcare workers and 24% of direct care workers "" in the US. ""It is unfortunate the president would rather scapegoat the other than building a consensus that helps all of through this crisis,"" he wrote. The American Immigration Council tweeted that ""Trump's actions are designed to distract and divide us from the fact that America now has the highest death and infection from the coronavirus"". The American Civil Liberties Union's immigration expert, Andrea Flores, wrote: ""Xenophobia is not a public health response."" The pandemic has disrupted TV production across the world, as lockdowns and social-distancing rules prevent shows from filming. But this week, actors from Australian soap opera Neighbours will return to the studio, as filming of the show resumes. In keeping with the spirit of soaps, however, there is a twist. Actors will be required to observe social-distancing rules on set. That means no physical contact like kissing will be allowed. Instead, camera trickery will be used to make actors look closer than they are. The filming of Neighbours was suspended last month after Australia brought in restrictions to stem the spread of coronavirus. Now, the Australian government is considering lifting those restrictions as the rate of new infections has slowed. To date, a total of 6,645 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in Australia, including 71 deaths. Read more:Australian soap to resume filming after Covid-19 shutdown Karl and Susan Kennedy are two of the soap's longest-serving characters A second wave of coronavirus cases could be even worse than the first as winter flu puts further strain on hospitals, a senior US disease expert has said. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), issued the warning on Tuesday as several US states prepared to reopen their economies. âThereâs a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,âRedfield told the Washington Post,external. âWeâre going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time,â he added. Redfield describedthe recent anti-lockdown protests that saw hundreds of people across the US flouting social-distancing rulesas ânot helpfulâ. Trump notes the coronavirus emerged in the middle of his trade war with China, arguing no one has been tougher on China than him. ""And all of a sudden out of nowhere comes the invisible enemy,"" he says, referring to the pandemic. He also told reporters: ""We think we know where it [coronavirus] came from. We'll be talking about that, probably a lot."" Some US media have reported that US intelligence believes the virus leaked from a Wuhan virology facility with lax safety protocols, which China has denied. Trump told journalists he won't discuss intelligence briefings. And that's the end of the White House briefing.  Trump says he has doubts about Florida's ban on golfing, which has affected several of the clubs that the president owns. ""That one I'm not sure I agree with,"" says Trump. He adds that ""it's a tough policy but it's a state policy."" Some Trump properties have been forced to furlough workers, reporters note. Trump is asked if his shutdown on immigration is an extension of his 2016 campaign promise to curtail all immigration to the US - both legal and illegal. ""No, no, I want people that are in this country, I want our citizens to get jobs,"" Trump responds, adding: ""I donât want them to have competition."" âI want the American worker to be able to get jobs,"" he says. ""I donât want them to compete right now, thereâs a big difference when you have a full economy.â Trump says his 60-day ban on new permanent US immigrants may be extended depending on how the US economy is doing. He says it could be extended for 30 days, ""or much longer"" than that. He also suggests that he could sign a secondary immigration order ""if we want"", without specifying what it could contain. After being asked about seasonal farm workers, many of whom are migrants, Trump says that ""farmers will not be affected"". Trump says that his executive order stopping new permanent residency to the US is being written now and is expected to completed by White House lawyers tomorrow for him to sign. It will contain ""certain exemptions"" he says, without specifying what they will be. ""It's something we have to have in this country,"" he says. He pledges for it to be a ""strong order"". Trump says the US ""must first take care of the American worker"" while explaining reasons for the temporary green card ban. ""As we all know, millions of Americans sacrificed their jobs in order to battle the virus and save the lives of our fellow citizens,"" he says. The president says the government has a ""solemn duty"" to ensure Americans regain their jobs. ""It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad,"" he says. ""We want to protect our US workers and I think as we move forward we will become more and more protective of them,"" he adds.  Coronavirus taskforce coordinator Dr Deborah Birx says some major metropolitan areas appear to have passed their peaks for infections. But she cautions that some cities have yet to see ""the light at the end of the tunnel due to hospitalisations and deaths"". She says that urban areas in New York, Rhode Island Connecticut, Detroit are doing ""quite well"". She also says New Orleans is nearly back to its baseline for new infections, while there are also improvements in Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Baltimore, Indianapolis and St Louis, but in the Washington DC metro area ""we do not see a decline yet"". However, ""we will continue to see mortality and deaths among our American citizens particularly in our cities as they begin to move past peak because deaths will lag,"" she says. Birx also says that the US mortality rate is the lowest of anywhere in the world. Trump says: ""We continue to gain ground in the war against the invisible enemy. ""And I see light at the end of the tunnel. I actually see a lot of light at the end of the tunnel. ""And we're starting the process. We're starting a very, very powerful important process. ""We see that people are very anxious. They want to get going, they want to get back to their jobs. They want to make money. They want to care of their families. ""So the light is getting brighter and brighter every day."" In a typical year, nearly 1 million green cards are issued in the US, granting immigrants legal permanent residence and the opportunity to apply for American citizenship. The majority of green cards - roughly 70% - go to those with relatives living in the US, according to a 2018 report from the US Senate. For employment-based green cards, a common form of the residency status, roughly 80% are issued to those already in the country, shifting from a temporary visa to permanent residence. The US also grants temporary employment through approximately 20 different visa programmes. These visas cover a wide range of jobs and skills, like those with âhighly specialised knowledgeâ - including tech and engineering jobs - and temporary and seasonal agricultural workers. In 2016, there were 750,000 of such visas issued across all categories. Trump says there will be a 60 day ban on immigration in order to protect jobless Americans. After 60 days, US officials will evaluate ""any extension or modification"" that will be ""based on economic conditions at the time,"" he says. It will ""only apply to individuals seeking permanent residency"" and not ""to those entering on a temporary basis"", Trump says. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says some large companies may be forced to return the small business loans that they received from the federal bailout. ""The intent was not for companies that have liquidities and plenty of resources,"" he says. Companies that do not return the funds will face ""consequences"" that could be ""quite significant,"" he says. President Trump says Harvard University, which has an endowment of around $40bn, will return the $9m in loans it got from a government programme intended to provide money to struggling small businesses. He made the remark after a reporter asked about Shake Shack, a restaurant chain that said it would return the funds it got from the Small Business Administration. Other major companies have been criticised for taking the money, which quickly ran dry after it was tapped last week. Trump praises the $480bn bailout package that was passed earlier today by the Senate, saying it will help struggling workers. The bill goes to the House next, where Trump predicts it will find ""tremendous support"". Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the bill includes $310bn for the small business loan programme, which ran out of funds last week. He adds that it also includes an ""unprecedented amount of money for testing"". The bill will also boost a separate small business emergency grant and loan programme by $60bn, give $75bn to hospitals and $25bn to a new coronavirus testing scheme. Trump starts the briefing sending condolences to virus victims and their families. He notes that around 20 states, representing around 40% of US population, are now making plans to âsafely re-start their economiesâ. ""The country wants to get back to work,"" Trump says. To date, there are over 816,000 Covid-19 cases and 44,000 deaths from the virus in the US. The White House coronavirus taskforce briefing has just begun. Trump is joined in the White House briefing room by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The briefing comes as the US is faced with over 816,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and more than 44,000 deaths caused by the virus. The US Senate has unanimously passed a $480bn relief budget that includes new funds for small business loans and protective gear for hospital workers. The bill now goes to the House of Representatives before going to Trump, who has urged lawmakers to approve it quickly. The US Congress has now approved stimulus funds of nearly $3tr to help the country's 22m newly-unemployed workers. On Twitter, Trump said lawmakers will address funding for state governments - who are also reeling from a steep decline in tax revenue - in their next round of budget talks. Â© 2025 BBC.

In 2016, there were 750,000 of such visas issued across all categories. Trump says there will be a 60 day ban on immigration in order to protect jobless Americans. After 60 days, US officials will evaluate ""any extension or modification"" that will be ""based on economic conditions at the time,"" he says. It will ""only apply to individuals seeking permanent residency"" and not ""to those entering on a temporary basis"", Trump says. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says some large companies may be forced to return the small business loans that they received from the federal bailout. ""The intent was not for companies that have liquidities and plenty of resources,"" he says. Companies that do not return the funds will face ""consequences"" that could be ""quite significant,"" he says. President Trump says Harvard University, which has an endowment of around $40bn, will return the $9m in loans it got from a government programme intended to provide money to struggling small businesses. He made the remark after a reporter asked about Shake Shack, a restaurant chain that said it would return the funds it got from the Small Business Administration. Other major companies have been criticised for taking the money, which quickly ran dry after it was tapped last week. Trump praises the $480bn bailout package that was passed earlier today by the Senate, saying it will help struggling workers. The bill goes to the House next, where Trump predicts it will find ""tremendous support"". Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the bill includes $310bn for the small business loan programme, which ran out of funds last week. He adds that it also includes an ""unprecedented amount of money for testing"". The bill will also boost a separate small business emergency grant and loan programme by $60bn, give $75bn to hospitals and $25bn to a new coronavirus testing scheme. Trump starts the briefing sending condolences to virus victims and their families. He notes that around 20 states, representing around 40% of US population, are now making plans to âsafely re-start their economiesâ. ""The country wants to get back to work,"" Trump says. To date, there are over 816,000 Covid-19 cases and 44,000 deaths from the virus in the US. The White House coronavirus taskforce briefing has just begun. Trump is joined in the White House briefing room by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The briefing comes as the US is faced with over 816,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and more than 44,000 deaths caused by the virus. The US Senate has unanimously passed a $480bn relief budget that includes new funds for small business loans and protective gear for hospital workers. The bill now goes to the House of Representatives before going to Trump, who has urged lawmakers to approve it quickly. The US Congress has now approved stimulus funds of nearly $3tr to help the country's 22m newly-unemployed workers. On Twitter, Trump said lawmakers will address funding for state governments - who are also reeling from a steep decline in tax revenue - in their next round of budget talks. Â© 2025 BBC.

The tiny premature baby who fought off coronavirus,"This video can not be played 'She's our rainbow in the coronavirus storm' Tracy Maguire remembers the moment she saw doctors insert a swab into her three-week-old baby's nose to test for coronavirus. The new mother says it is one of the ""worst things"" she has seen. ""It was the first time I'd seen my baby cry tears,"" she said. ""I held her, I was crying and we were just trying to get each other through the situation"". Born prematurely at just 3lbs 5oz (1.5kg), baby Peyton was diagnosed with Covid-19 at just three weeks old. Her arrival on 26 March - eight weeks before her due date - defied all of the family's planning. Despite feeling healthy, Tracy was told she may have pre-eclampsia during a routine appointment and was sent straight to Wishaw General Hospital in Lanarkshire. Tracy had no idea she was unwell - and was taken straight to hospital After those first weeks, during which Peyton enjoyed a bath in the ward, she began to show the slightest of symptoms - a sniffle and a few coughs, almost undetectable. Tracy told BBC Radio Scotland'sMornings with Kaye Adams programmethe news that her baby had become one of the country's youngest virus patients was traumatic. ""They said 'she's fine, don't panic - but she has tested positive for coronavirus',"" said Tracy. ""I think the doctor was trying to keep me calm but I was sobbing. ""As much as she was fine I thought at what point was she with the virus? How is she fighting against it when she's so wee? It was just the unknown."" Tracy and Arjuna give Peyton a bath in the days following the Caesarean section Peyton was given steroids to help strengthen her lungs and received ""amazing"" care from neonatal nurses in the days that followed her diagnosis. However, after recovering from her Caesarean section, Tracy was told she would have to go home and isolate for 14 days away from her baby. She said: ""I was pleading on the phone with the doctor saying I don't want to be away from her. ""As much as everyone was looking after her, I'm her mum. Even if it was the cold, I'd want to be there with her."" Doctors relented and allowed Tracy to stay - but Arjuna would have to go home and complete the isolation period in order to see his baby girl. As days passed, the number of deaths in Scotland caused by the virus continued to increase - but Peyton recovered. This video can not be played Peyton and her mum featured in BBC filming at the University Hospital Wishaw in Lanarkshire She and Tracy were discharged on Monday and Arjuna has now held her for the first time since leaving hospital. Tracy said: ""From Arjuna's point of view, I think he felt a bit useless - first his baby is coming early and secondly his wife isn't well and he couldn't be there."" Now home and settling into a routine, Tracy and family have praised the doctors and nurses at Wishaw General who guided them through a remarkable and daunting birth. A smiling Peyton who fought off coronavirus just weeks after being born Tracy said: ""They are doing a job that is unreal - they put their life at risk to make sure my baby was getting fed and cuddled in their full PPE. ""It's spectacular, you'll never understand how grateful you can be to people. Peyton is my most precious thing in the whole world and I trusted them to look after her. ""To any mums that are worried, put your trust in these nurses."" Man who caused woman 'fear or alarm' given legal slap on the wrist Do you know this pooch?

World risks 'biblical' famines due to pandemic - UN,"Millions across the world already rely heavily on food aid to survive The world is at risk of widespread famines ""of biblical proportions"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the UN has warned. David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said urgent action was needed to avoid a catastrophe. A report estimates that the number suffering from hunger could go from 135 million to more than 250 million. Those most at risk are in 10 countries affected by conflict, economic crisis and climate change, the WFP says. The fourth annualGlobal Report on Food Crises,externalhighlights Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Nigeria and Haiti. In South Sudan, 61% of the population was affected by food crisis last year, the report says. Even before the pandemic hit, parts of East Africa and South Asia were already facing severe food shortages caused by drought andthe worst locust infestations for decades. Yemen: World's biggest humanitarian emergency How a single locust becomes a plague Venezuela: The crisis forcing mothers to give away their babies Addressing the UN Security Council during a video conference, Mr Beasley said the world had to ""act wisely and act fast"". ""We could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months,"" he said. ""The truth is we do not have time on our side."" In a call to action, he added: ""I do believe that with our expertise and our partnerships, we can bring together the teams and the programmes necessary to make certain the Covid-19 pandemic does not become a human and food crisis catastrophe."" The WFP chief - who has just recovered from Covid-19 - began his Security Council briefing by saying ""excuse me for speaking bluntly."" There is no blunting what could happen in a world facing - even before this global health crisis - what David Beasley called the worst humanitarian catastrophe since the Second World War. In an interview, he also expressed fear that 30 million people, and possibly more, could die in a matter of months if the UN does not secure more funding and food. But this is also a world where donors are reeling from the steep financial cost of their own Covid-19 crises. Mr Beasley says no-one told him they would turn their back on the most vulnerable. But he admitted they would need to take stock at home first. He warned that chaos elsewhere could circle back around the world. His blunt warning: ""One way or another, the world will pay for this."" Better to work together, he says, on the basis of facts, not fear. The WFP's senior economist, Arif Husain, said the economic impact of the pandemic was potentially catastrophic for millions ""who are already hanging by a thread"". ""It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage,"" he said in a statement. ""Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock - like Covid-19 - to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe."" Earlier this month, this WFP said it was set to halve aid to parts of war-torn Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels due to a funding crisis. It said some donors had stopped their aid over concerns that deliveries were being obstructed by Houthi forces. The WFP feeds more than 12 million Yemenis a month, 80% of whom are in areas controlled by Houthi forces. Yemen confirmed its first case of Covid-19 earlier this month, with aid agencies warning that the disease could quickly overwhelm the country's weakened health systems.

Netflix sign-ups jump during coronavirus lockdowns,"Netflix has seen subscriber numbers surge this year, as lockdowns around the world keep people at home where they want to be entertained. Almost 16 million people created accounts in the first three months of the year, the firm said. That is almost double the new sign-ups it saw in the final months of 2019. However, the streaming service, which is behind some multi-million dollar productions, said shutdowns have halted ""almost all"" filming around the world. And sharp declines in the value of many currencies has meant new subscribers outside of the US, where Netflix is based, are not worth as much to the company as they would have been before the crisis. And that has hurt its international revenue growth. Nevertheless, the home-entertainment giant's share price has climbed more than 30% this year as investors bet on its ability to benefit from people spending more time indoors. ""Netflix is and will continue to be the media company least impacted by Covid-19,"" said eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom. ""Their business is a near perfect fit to a population that is suddenly housebound."" Demand for streaming has been so high that Netflix last month said it would reduce the quality of its videos in Europe to ease strain on internet service providers. The firm also hired an additional 2,000 customer support staff to handle the increased interest. Netflix said some 85 million people had watched its original movie, Spenser Confidential, for at least two minutes - the cut-off it uses for viewing figures. Meanwhile, the documentary series Tiger King reached 64 million households. Tiger King focuses on Joe Exotic and his big cat zoo The firm expected to add another 7.5 million members in the three months to the end of June - above analyst expectations. But it warned investors that viewers and growth would decline as governments lift lockdowns around the world. ""Given the uncertainty on home confinement timing this is mostly guesswork,"" it said. Netflix said it expects to stick to its release schedule through June and has been acquiring other movies to keep its offering fresh. But it said future membership growth could be hurt by delays to upcoming seasons and shows. Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said production delays would hurt subscriber growth at all streaming companies in coming months. ""Arguably, Netflix should fare much better with its broad catalogue,"" he said. by Zoe Thomas, BBC News Technology Reporter Netflix's early subscriber growth certainly caught the attention of Wall Street investors. But spectacular growth in a period where most of the world's internet users are under orders to stay at home is a bit less impressive. The bigger question for Netflix is can it retain those paying customers after Covid-19 lockdown measures are eased. The company is facing increasing competition from the likes of Disney Plus and Amazon Prime, which both boast of large archives of content to attract new subscribers. Meanwhile, newly-launched short-form streaming service Quibi spent billions to release content with top Hollywood talent. And later this year HBO Max and NBCUniversal will launch Peacock in the US. In the streaming world, content is king and more rivals mean Netflix will need to shore up its lineup. That's where coronavirus - a positive when it comes to driving subscriber growth - becomes a possible negative. Netflix had to pause the production of new shows during the lockdown. Its rivals face the same challenge. But big brands like NBCUniversal and Disney are also pulling popular shows they had leased to Netflix and showing on their own services instead. Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for the largest number of new members with almost 7 million new subscribers.  Growth in the US and Canada, which has lagged in recent quarters, also jumped, with 2.3 million new members joining the service, compared to just 550,000 in the final months of 2019. The firm now has more than 182 million subscribers worldwide. Netflix said revenue increased to $5.76bn, up more than 27% compared to the same period in 2019. Profits almost doubled, from $344m in the first quarter of 2019 to $709m.

Here's a round-up of today's main developments: This video can not be played Coronavirus: Doctor 'really glad' to be back in Wales A senior intensive care consultant who was stranded in India has said he is ""really glad"" to get home to Wales to treat patients struck by coronavirus. Dr Venkat Sundaram, the clinical lead for intensive care at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, flew to India several weeks ago to visit his sick father who has since died. The coronavirus pandemic left him unable to find a flight home. After a campaign by his colleagues, Dr Sundaram has been reunited with his wife and children. Gruff, 7, needs fresh air to help with his cystic fibrosis The family of a boy with cystic fibrosis has said a ""weight has been lifted"" after a footpath near their home was closed. Eilir Jones, whose seven-year-old stepson Gruff has the condition, put up signs urging people to stop using the route outside their home in Ruthin. But Denbighshire council officers removed them and re-opened the path. However, on Tuesday,the council admitted the path should be closed and was the ""right thing to do"". Elliw Angharad, Gruff's mother, said her son must be outside for long periods and the path near their house can attract up to 200 walkers each day, leaving him vulnerable to coronavirus. The public footpath runs close to the house of Gruff, seven, who is at risk if he catches Covid-19. Newport West Assembly Member Jayne Bryant has shared a photo of a pro-NHS painting she spotted in her constituency. More than 3,500 businesses in Cardiff have received almost Â£50m in grants, according to the council. The cash, which is part of theWelsh Government's support package for the economy and public services, has been distributed by Cardiff council. The council said its officers had contacted 7,000 businesses to give information and assistance, and that 3,668 businesses in the city had received support. People who are concerned and need advice have been asked to email the council on: brates@cardiff.gov.uk A man has admitted breaching coronavirus lockdown regulations on six occasions. Owain Rhys Worgan, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, pleaded guilty to breaching Covid-19 restrictions at Swansea Magistrates' Court on Monday. The 18-year-old had been served six penalty notices by Dyfed-Powys Police for breaching the regulations designed to limit the spread of the virus. He will be sentenced in early June, the force said. Sgt Philip Jones added: ""I want to assure those who continue to breach Covid-19 restrictions that we will have no hesitation in enforcing our powers as we have done in this case."" The 99-year-old war veteran who raised more than Â£27m for the NHS has opened a new Nightingale Hospital in Harrogate. Captain Tom Moore, who raised money by completing 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday, appeared via video link at the opening on Tuesday. A virtual ceremony was held to open the 500-bed facility at Harrogate Convention Centre, the first of seven field hospitals built outside a city. Captain Tom was invited to appear in honour of his fundraising effort. Asked about opening the new hospital, he said: ""It's one of those things you never think would ever happen."" There have now been more than 2.5 million coronavirus infections worldwide. The latest figure stands at 2,501,156 with a death toll of 171,810, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US. Frankie McCamleyBBC News Separated couples exploiting the lockdown to stop an ex-partner from seeing their child could face court action,says a senior judge. Head of the family courts Sir Andrew McFarlane says children should continue to visit parents they don't live with, as long as both households are healthy. Family lawyers told the BBC they have been inundated with separated parents arguing over contact during lockdown. Some say parents have exploited Covid-19 guidance to stop visits altogether. More than a quarter of deaths caused by Covid-19 in Wales in the two
weeks to 10 April occurred outside hospitals, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. The new statistics show 356 (73%) of the 490 people who died with Covid-19 during that period died in hospital. Official figures released by Public Health Wales each day includes deaths in hospitals and may or may not include some deaths in community settings such as care homes. The ONS figures,externaltake longer to report but are more complete because they include all registered deaths - a process that can take up to 14 days. BBC Walesâ health correspondent, Owain Clarke, said the trend of lower deaths
in hospitals and increasing deaths in the community was expected to continue. The figures also show: If you mistake the symptoms of hayfever for Covid-19 you could be helping to spread the deadly virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Welsh Government should help local authorities give cyclists and pedestrians more
space for social distancing, according to campaign group Cycling UK. In a letter to Walesâ Transport Minister Lee Waters, engagement officer
Gwenda Owen praised Cardiff council for measures it had taken to increase the
space available for cyclists and pedestrians. These include temporary 20mph (32.1 km/h) zones and the âreallocation of
road spaceâ. âItâs encouraging to see the steps Cardiff council has taken to enable
people to walk and cycle whilst maintaining social distancing,â Ms Owen says. âItâs a good start, but we need to do more throughout Wales, and
quickly, to ensure that our key workers can get to work safely and enable
people to walk and cycle as part their daily exercise.â A Welsh Government spokesman said it welcomes the measures introduced by Cardiff council and encouraged other authorities to adopt similar measures. People suffering heart attacks during the coronavirus outbreak may be
putting their lives at risk by delaying seeking medical help, a charity has
warned. British Heart Foundation Cymru says there has been a drop of at least 20%
in the number of people seen in hospitals across Wales with a suspected heart
attack since the UK-wide lockdown. The Welsh cardiologists surveyed believe the decrease is down to people
worried about catching Covid-19 and putting a further burden on the NHS. âOur message is don't delay because you think hospitals are too busy - the
NHS still has systems in place to treat people for heart attacks and they are
still a top priority,â said Joanne Oliver, from BHF Cymru. âThe coronavirus pandemic is extremely serious, but itâs concerning if it
also means peopleâs fears about the virus are putting them off calling 999 when
they suffer heart attack symptoms."" Three teenagers have been arrested after a 20-hectare (50 acre) blaze on a mountain above a village in the Rhondda Valley. The man, 19, a 17-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl were stopped in a car on the A4059 at 04:45 GMT on Tuesday. They were arrested on suspicion of arson with intent and are in custody. It comes after the fire on the mountain above Ton Pentre - one of a number of deliberately started grass fires on Monday. ""The fires are putting lives and people's health at risk,"" South Wales Police said on Facebook. In all, South Wales fire service attended 15 blazes, including on the the mountain above Ystrad in the Rhondda, where there were dramatic scenes as flames and smoke filled the sky behind homes. In north Wales, the emergency services were called to a large mountain fire in Denbighshire on Monday evening.

Sioned Martha Davies, 22, was taken to hospital four years ago and said the ""bubble"" of lockdown could lead to some patients into picking up previous eating disorder habits. Jo Whitfield, from eating disorder charity Beat, said it had received an 80% increase in contact on social media and a 35% rise in phonecalls. But Sioned said taking up new hobbies, like baking, has helped her during the pandemic. Cardiff University has distanced itself from the comments of its former chancellor, Sir Martin Evans, whosaid the Welsh and UK governments were guilty of a ""dereliction of duty""for failing to make better use of domestic resources to address testing and kit shortages. The Nobel Prize-winning scientist made the remarks in an interview with BBC Wales' political editor, Felicity Evans. In a statement, a spokesman said these were Sir Martin's ""personal views"" and ""in no way reflect the views of Cardiff University"". He added: ""We have written to the Welsh Government offering our unreserved support, recognising that this is an extremely challenging time. ""We remain in contact with Welsh Government and Public Health Wales officials and will help in any way we can."" A few days ago we shared the video of 60-year-old Jeff Cope beingapplauded as he leftPrince Charles Hospital's intensive care unit.

During the UK government's daily briefing, the Mirror's Pippa Crerar asked Health Secretary Matt Hancock whether the UK opted out of the EU's ventilator procurement scheme for political reasons, as the Foreign Office's top official Simon McDonald has suggested. She says Mr McDonald and Mr Hancock, who earlier distanced himself from this claim, ""cannot both be right' and asks which one we should be believing. The health secretary says there has been speculation about e-mails not being answered. But he says the decision came to his desk and he recommended the UK did take part in the scheme as an associate member - that is the ""long and the short of it"". And he insists missing out on the scheme has had ""absolutely zero"" impact on the UK's access to the equipment, because the scheme has not yet delivered any items to its participants. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is delivering the UK government's daily briefing. On a vaccine for Covid-19, he says: ""I am certain we will throw everything we've got at developing a vaccine."" The UK has ""put more money than any other country on a vaccine search"", he adds. He mentions trials at Oxford and Imperial College London universities, saying they are ""both promising projects"" making ""rapid progress"". He says the government will be giving Â£20m to the Oxford team to fund their clinical trials - and they will be trialling a vaccine on people starting on Thursday.

"Scottish employment up to 75% before lockdownUnemployment also dropped by 500 to 105,000 in the same period between December and February.Scotland business","The number of Scots in work in the three months before the coronavirus lockdown rose by 34,000 to 2,714,000 - more than 75% of the workforce. In the same period between December and February, unemployment dropped by 500 to 105,000. At 3.7%, Scotland's unemployment rate was lower than that in the UK as a whole, which remained at 4%. UK employment for people aged 16 to 64 was estimated at a record highof 76.6% in the three months to February. The UK unemployment rate was higher than that in Scotland, with a slightly higher proportion of Scots classed as ""economically inactive"". This was mainly due to roles looking after family, full-time education or long-term sick leave. UK employment rate at record high before lockdown More than 140,000 firms claim wage bill help Salary subsidy scheme extended into June However,the latest figures issued by the Office for National Statistics,externaldo not co ver the current state of the jobs market. They do not cover the period since the health crisis took hold, and millions of people were either put out of work or furloughed by their employees. During the winter months covered by the Labour Market Survey, there were wider signs of the economy picking up. That followed the December election and an end to the political paralysis around Brexit. David Freeman, ONS head of labour market statistics, said: ""Our final data wholly from before the coronavirus restrictions were in place, showed the labour market was very robust in the three months to February. ""For the first time, we have brought forward information on the number of employees in work using PAYE data to cover a more recent period.

Insurer to give Â£25 refunds as cars sit idle,"Roads have been extremely quiet owing to the virus restrictions One of the UK's biggest motor insurance companies, Admiral, is giving a Â£25 refund to customers as cars and vans sit idle in the coronavirus pandemic. The payment will be paid automatically to anyone with a car or van insurance policy with Admiral on 20 April. The company said it was a ""thank you"" to customers for staying at home, but also reflected the lower level of claims, benefiting its profits. Other insurers are under pressure to follow suit. Some are offering to defer premiums for those struggling to pay, but Admiral is thought to be the first one actually providing refunds directly to customers. The owners of 4.4 million vehicles will receive the payment by the end of May. Admiral suggested that the refund and the amount it was spending on other support measures were the equivalent for many customers of one month's worth of their annual premium, but for most young drivers it will be far less than that. One said the refund accounted for just 1.68% of his annual bill. 'My business could go bust if insurers don't pay' Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain Insurers have been heavily criticised during the coronavirus crisis for failing to cover small and medium-sized businesses for interruption to their trade. The industry has responded by saying that many did not have the relevant cover. Drivers have also been asking why they should be paying for a service that they cannot use as expected, namely insurance cover for the regular journeys which have stopped as they follow government guidance to stay at home. Cristina Nestares, chief executive of UK insurance at Admiral, said: ""This is an unprecedented time when people across the country are driving significantly less than before the lockdown, and we expect this to lead to a fall in the number of claims we are seeing. ""We want to give the money we would have used to pay these claims back to our loyal customers in this difficult time."" The company would not reveal to BBC News how much of a reduction it has seen in claims. More insurance companies should do the same, according to Gareth Shaw, head of money at the consumer organisation Which?. ""Firms that act fairly now may see that they are rewarded in the future, and we encourage all other car insurers to follow Admiral's lead,"" he said. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said that pricing and refunds were a matter for individual firms, but insurers were being flexible. This included giving free cover to key workers unable to use public transport. He added that by law, vehicles on the road still needed to be covered by insurance, while many people were still using them for essential journeys, such as to the supermarket. ""Even if you do not drive during lockdown, you will still need to be protected against theft, vandalism and damage,"" an ABI spokesman said. Mike Powell, car insurance expert at analysts Defaqto, said insurance providers were allowing customers to defer payments, in a similar way to banks with mortgages and utility companies with other bills. He pointed out that information on how to access support was available on insurance companies' websites, but this needed to be agreed with the provider, rather than simply cancelling payments.

World risks âbiblicalâ famines due to pandemic â UN,"Millions across the world already rely heavily on food aid to survive The world is at risk of widespread famines ""of biblical proportions"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the UN has warned. David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said urgent action was needed to avoid a catastrophe. A report estimates that the number suffering from hunger could go from 135 million to more than 250 million. Those most at risk are in 10 countries affected by conflict, economic crisis and climate change, the WFP says. The fourth annualGlobal Report on Food Crises,externalhighlights Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Nigeria and Haiti. In South Sudan, 61% of the population was affected by food crisis last year, the report says. Even before the pandemic hit, parts of East Africa and South Asia were already facing severe food shortages caused by drought andthe worst locust infestations for decades. Yemen: World's biggest humanitarian emergency How a single locust becomes a plague Venezuela: The crisis forcing mothers to give away their babies Addressing the UN Security Council during a video conference, Mr Beasley said the world had to ""act wisely and act fast"". ""We could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months,"" he said. ""The truth is we do not have time on our side."" In a call to action, he added: ""I do believe that with our expertise and our partnerships, we can bring together the teams and the programmes necessary to make certain the Covid-19 pandemic does not become a human and food crisis catastrophe."" The WFP chief - who has just recovered from Covid-19 - began his Security Council briefing by saying ""excuse me for speaking bluntly."" There is no blunting what could happen in a world facing - even before this global health crisis - what David Beasley called the worst humanitarian catastrophe since the Second World War. In an interview, he also expressed fear that 30 million people, and possibly more, could die in a matter of months if the UN does not secure more funding and food. But this is also a world where donors are reeling from the steep financial cost of their own Covid-19 crises. Mr Beasley says no-one told him they would turn their back on the most vulnerable. But he admitted they would need to take stock at home first. He warned that chaos elsewhere could circle back around the world. His blunt warning: ""One way or another, the world will pay for this."" Better to work together, he says, on the basis of facts, not fear. The WFP's senior economist, Arif Husain, said the economic impact of the pandemic was potentially catastrophic for millions ""who are already hanging by a thread"". ""It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage,"" he said in a statement. ""Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock - like Covid-19 - to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe."" Earlier this month, this WFP said it was set to halve aid to parts of war-torn Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels due to a funding crisis. It said some donors had stopped their aid over concerns that deliveries were being obstructed by Houthi forces. The WFP feeds more than 12 million Yemenis a month, 80% of whom are in areas controlled by Houthi forces. Yemen confirmed its first case of Covid-19 earlier this month, with aid agencies warning that the disease could quickly overwhelm the country's weakened health systems.

Laura McKinlay and Ruaridh Macmillan, who live near Falkirk, were due to wed on Saturday in Inverness. But most marriages and civil partnerships are not taking place because of the lockdown. Laura and Ruaridh held what they called a ""not our wedding day"" and linked up with family and friends via video calls. They had fun on their special day, with Laura using a fitted bed sheet for the veil while Ruaridh wore his pyjamas instead of a kilt. Social distancing regulations introduced to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) have been extended to protect workers by the Scottish government. Temporary regulations restricting public gatherings and non-essential business activity have been in force since 26 March. The regulations must be reviewed every 3 weeks and are kept under continual review by the government. Today a number of amendments have been made to protect workers and provide further guidance for people in Scotland. The adjustments to the regulations include formalising the two metre distancing rules to all businesses that remain open. Businesses that do not take all reasonable measures to enforce those rules could be fined or ultimately prosecuted.

Read more here. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Blood test taken in a GP surgery car park in Penicuik I spent the morning at a GP practice in Penicuik in Midlothian. The waiting room was deserted, only a tiny fraction of patients are now coming to the surgery, most will have a consultation by phone or video call. Behind the scenes receptionists are busy managing calls, the team here can take 400 to 500 a day. Any patients who need to come to the practice are met by a doctor or nurse in protective clothing.  Those with suspected Covid-19 are directed to coronavirus assesment centres. Just like in hospitals it's important to make every effort to minimise the risk of infection for both patients and staff. Routine blood tests are carried out in the car park, a make shift gazebo covers a drive-in space where the patient rolls down their window and stretches out their arm. House calls do still happen, the staff tell me, they need to check in on their most vulnerable patients. But after a chap at the door to say the doctor has arrived, the visor, gloves, mask and apron are all donned. Doctors say they are worried that some people are ignoring symptoms for too long.  They want people to know that behind the closed front door, they are very much open for business. The role of the GP has always been to manage a patient's care in the community, to keep them out of hospital unless they need to be there.   More than ever that is a vital service to ensure our hospitals don't become overwhelmed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK's Health Secretary Matt Hancock The UK's Health Secretary Matt Hancock has begun today's daily coronavirus briefing by saying: ""At the heart of our plan is ensuring NHS capacity is always ahead of need. ""If you or someone you love needs hospital care with covid-19, then you will always get that care."" He says the plan to slow the spread of the virus is working - but there is still some way to go. You can follow updates here. Holyrood LiveBBC Parliaments Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie welcomes the testing of all new residents of care homes and calls for an extra Â£29 a day reward for NHS and care frontline staff during the pandemic. The first minister pledges to consider any suggestion like that and says the government will reflect properly on this experience. What we are learning about what really matters in life should be reflected in what we spend as a government, she adds. Mr Rennie says Inclusion Scotland has identified ""worrying evidence, at times horrific"", of the experience of children with additional support needs during the lockdown. Ms Sturgeon says her government is considering on an ongoing basis of how better to support the vulnerable and that will be to the fore of the government's thinking as the country moves to the next phase. She points out that the guidance around children with autism being able to exercise more than once a day has been clarified. Holyrood LiveBBC Parliaments Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie insists economic recovery must mean we stop undervaluing those people whose work we all rely on, such as cleaners and carers. He seeks a commitment that public support will be directed to ""clean, green industries"" rather than high-carbon industry, those who pay ""poverty wages"" and those registered in tax havens. The first minister agrees that economic recovery must be in line with the society and country we are trying to build. These are big debates I hope we get to engage with properly in the not too distant future, Ms Sturgeon says, though she says the focus now remains on dealing with responding to the virus. Mr Harvie says the ""test, trace and isolate"" strategy is not in place yet, expressing concern that testing capacity is not being fully utilised. The first minister says that when the most stringent restrictions are lifted, we will still need to be taking measures to suppress the virus. Building capacity is not just about testing but also contact tracing, she explains. On testing specifically, Ms Sturgeon says the government is looking at where to deploy extra capacity - for example care-home workers are now to be tested in the same way NHS workers are.

Holyrood LiveBBC Parliaments Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard says  he is hearing from council leaders and NHS and social care workers that PPE is ""still a big issue"". He asks what the advice is to care workers in care homes without the PPE they need tonight. Ms Sturgeon says care home providers will not be fulfilling their responsibilities to staff if that is the case and she reiterates the e-mail address for those with concerns, which isCovid-19-health-PPE@gov.scot. Mr Leonard also raises concerns about someone being asked to give consent to a ""do not attempt CPR notice"" for a loved one and asks why care home residents are being treated differently to other Covid-19 patients. The first minister says any person with Covid-19 should be treated as an individual and treatment should be clinically driven. Any discussion about DNR (do not resuscitate) must be sensitive and no-one should be forced to sign one, she adds. Mr Leonard asks why there is reluctance to move people from care homes to hospitals. The first minister replies that anyone who needs to be in hospital should be in one. ""Everybody deserves person-centred care that is right for them,"" says Ms Sturgeon. Allow Twitter content?

Holyrood LiveBBC Parliaments Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw congratulates everyone involved in making NHS Louisa Jordan ready for operation. He pivots to people avoiding attending hospitals despite having serious conditions unrelated to Covid-19. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon echoes Mr Carlaw's comments on the coronavirus hospital, before urging the public to seek medical help if they need it. Mr Carlaw next asks about issues with PPE access, highlighting an intensive care doctor in Glasgow has not had a response nine days after emailing the government's support line. The first minister says efforts to get PPE to all who need it are continuous. On the Glasgow case, she confirms the issue has been dealt with but the clinician has not been responded to. We have sufficient stocks of PPE and we are always looking at replenishing as they are used, with gowns and goggles being the areas of most concern at the moment, the first minister says. The Scottish Tory leader asks for specific figures on PPE but Ms Sturgeon explains any figure she gives will almost immediately be out of date as the situation moves on. We've got 1-2 weeks of aprons on stock and 12 weeks' worth of gloves, but items are continually used and replenished, she adds. Ms Sturgeon also reiterates the guidance that single-use PPE should not be reused. Â© 2025 BBC.

Scottish employment up to 75% before lockdown,"The number of Scots in work in the three months before the coronavirus lockdown rose by 34,000 to 2,714,000 - more than 75% of the workforce. In the same period between December and February, unemployment dropped by 500 to 105,000. At 3.7%, Scotland's unemployment rate was lower than that in the UK as a whole, which remained at 4%. UK employment for people aged 16 to 64 was estimated at a record highof 76.6% in the three months to February. The UK unemployment rate was higher than that in Scotland, with a slightly higher proportion of Scots classed as ""economically inactive"". This was mainly due to roles looking after family, full-time education or long-term sick leave. UK employment rate at record high before lockdown More than 140,000 firms claim wage bill help Salary subsidy scheme extended into June However,the latest figures issued by the Office for National Statistics,externaldo not co ver the current state of the jobs market. They do not cover the period since the health crisis took hold, and millions of people were either put out of work or furloughed by their employees. During the winter months covered by the Labour Market Survey, there were wider signs of the economy picking up. That followed the December election and an end to the political paralysis around Brexit. David Freeman, ONS head of labour market statistics, said: ""Our final data wholly from before the coronavirus restrictions were in place, showed the labour market was very robust in the three months to February. ""For the first time, we have brought forward information on the number of employees in work using PAYE data to cover a more recent period. ""These experimental statistics show a softening picture in March, but cover the month as a whole, including the period before the coronavirus restrictions were in place."" Next month's figures are expected to reflect the rapid downturn in the economy since the lockdown began. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Oil price falls to 18-year low as turmoil persists,"The deal represents the largest cut in oil production ever agreed The UK benchmark for oil has slumped 10% to around $16 (Â£13) a barrel in another day of declines. It comes after the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell below zero for the first time ever earlier this week. The falls are a striking illustration of just how much economic activity has slowed around the world. Prices have weakened sharply because of a combination of events triggered by a collapse in global demand. The knock-on effect has been a supply glut and a worldwide shortage of storage space for oil. Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? On Tuesday energy ministers from the Opec and other major oil-producing countries held an unscheduled conference call to discuss the collapse but did not agree any new measures to cut supplies. ""This is an unprecedented demand drop. Nobody in their lifetime has seen anything like this,"" said Peter McNally of Third Bridge Group. The collapse in physical demand for crude products like petrol and jet fuel has left storage hubs at capacity or, as one trader put it: ""They're close to the brim."" Storage at US oil hub Cushing has already grown to more than 15 million barrels in the past month - and is expected to soon be at capacity for the first time ever. ""Coronavirus is rewriting the rules of the global economy in front of our very eyes,"" said Adam Vettese, analyst at eToro. ""With oil demand virtually non-existent, this quite amazing sell-off is almost entirely down to fears over storage."" While the price of petrol is linked to the wholesale price of oil, it is driven by competition. That means that what motorists pay is not directly linked to crude. Instead, suppliers control the prices they sell petrol at. Crucially, a key factor affecting the price of fuel is that the biggest proportion of the money you hand over for a litre of petrol in the UK goes to the government in the form of tax. Fuel duty is charged at 57.95p per litre. On top of that, you have to pay VAT at 20% on the cost of petrol. Could this week's oil price turmoil see prices drift below Â£1 for the first time since the late 2000s? ""In theory, petrol prices could fall below Â£1 per litre if the lower wholesale costs were reflected at the pumps - but at the same time, people are driving very few miles, so they're selling vastly lower quantities of petrol and diesel at the moment,"" pointed out RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. This means many forecourts will be reluctant to trim their prices any further, he said. At the same time, he said, more price pressure on petrol could hit the viability of independent garages, which provided ""a vital service in areas where the supermarkets don't have a foothold"". ""It would be bad news all round if these forecourts shut up shop for good."" Since the end of March, the wholesale price of petrol has been around the 16p a litre mark, according to the AA. ""Add fuel duty at 57.95p a litre, a generous 9p a litre supplier/retailer margin, plus VAT and the average pump price of petrol would normally be around Â£1 a litre,"" said the AA's fuel spokesperson Luke Bosdet. Instead, the average pump price is higher because the retailers say they need to charge 10p a litre more to offset the lower volumes of fuel they are selling, he pointed out. Journey levels are at about 40% of normal during the working week, falling to 20% by Sunday. This meant those who were still driving were being ""overcharged on average by more than a fiver a tank"". ""I suspect that when the lockdown comes to an end, coronavirus is beaten and driving starts to return to normal, questions will be asked about the fairness of pump prices during the great oil crash of 2020.""

"Deaths hit 20-year high - but peak may be overNumbers dying nearly double above what would be expected, but peak may now be over, say experts.","Deaths in England and Wales have nearly doubled above what would be expected, hitting a 20-year high. The Office for National Statistics said there were 18,500 deaths in the week up to 10 April - about 8,000 more than is normal at this time of year. A third were linked to coronavirus, but deaths from other causes also increased, suggesting the lockdown may be having an indirect impact on health. But experts believe this period could well be when virus deaths peaked. They point to a separate analysis by NHS England which showed since 8 April the number of deaths in hospitals have been falling when you look at the date of death. The daily figures presented by government just show when hospital deaths are announced - there is often a delay in recording and reporting which masks when a drop in deaths starts happening. On Tuesday 823 new deaths were announced, but most of these happened in the previous days and weeks. Some even date back to March. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, of the University of Cambridge, said the NHS England figures suggested we were past the peak and in a ""steadily"" albeit slowly improving position. But he added: ""Judging from the experience in Italy, this could be a lengthy process."" Prof Carl Heneghan, from the University of Oxford, said he agreed, saying London, which saw rapid increases earlier than the rest of country, peaked even earlier, suggesting the steps taken before full lockdown had an impact. But England's deputy medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van Tam, said: ""We are not out of danger yet. We must keep pushing on this."" The figures presented by the ONS are different from those used by the government on a daily basis and the NHS England analysis. Those rely on hospital cases confirmed by tests, whereas the ONS has used death certificates which show both fatalities in hospital and in the community on a weekly basis. The figures show that the overall number of deaths topped 18,500. That is the highest since January 2000 when there was a bad flu outbreak. It is also much higher than the recent bad flu season of 2015. More than 6,200 of these deaths were linked to coronavirus and Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. One in six of these deaths happened outside hospital. But the ONS also said deaths from other causes rose too. Nick Stripe, head of health analysis at ONS, said they were trying to understand and find out why this was. He said it could be that people with other illnesses were avoiding going to hospital for treatment - visits to A&E have halved since the pandemic started - or an under-reporting of coronavirus. But he added it could ""take years to work out"". He also said it was important to remember the human toll in these figures. ""Each one is a person. Each one has a family. We must always remember this."" A similar trend is being reported in Scotland where there were nearly 2,000 deaths in the week up to 12 April. Deaths in Northern Ireland are also up. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area There has been growing concern about the impact of coronavirus outside of hospital. Care homes have begun reporting outbreaks among residents that have been difficult to control, they say, because of a lack of testing and protective equipment. The ONS - because it relies on death certificates rather than testing - can capture the scale of deaths. The majority of deaths happened in hospital, but since the start of the pandemic more than 1,000 have died in care homes. Another way to judge the impact of coronavirus is to look at the overall impact on the numbers dying over the course of the year so far. The figures show overall number of deaths are up. Nearly 185,000 people have died in 2020 compared with around 175,000 on average over the past five years at this point of the year. But the figures for 2020 also show the impact of flu and pneumonia compared to coronavirus. The number of deaths from flu and pneumonia - at more than 32,000 - is three times higher than the total number of coronavirus deaths this year. This difference will obviously narrow in the coming weeks as the flu season is coming to an end and there has been a rapid rise in coronavirus deaths. Some also believe the number of coronavirus deaths have been under-reported - a lack of testing outside hospital means it is down to doctors to use their clinical judgement to decide cause of death.

The tiny premature baby who fought off coronavirusPeyton Maguire from Lanarkshire is one of the youngest Covid-19 patients in the UK.Glasgow & West Scotland,"This video can not be played 'She's our rainbow in the coronavirus storm' Tracy Maguire remembers the moment she saw doctors insert a swab into her three-week-old baby's nose to test for coronavirus. The new mother says it is one of the ""worst things"" she has seen. ""It was the first time I'd seen my baby cry tears,"" she said. ""I held her, I was crying and we were just trying to get each other through the situation"". Born prematurely at just 3lbs 5oz (1.5kg), baby Peyton was diagnosed with Covid-19 at just three weeks old. Her arrival on 26 March - eight weeks before her due date - defied all of the family's planning. Despite feeling healthy, Tracy was told she may have pre-eclampsia during a routine appointment and was sent straight to Wishaw General Hospital in Lanarkshire. Tracy had no idea she was unwell - and was taken straight to hospital After those first weeks, during which Peyton enjoyed a bath in the ward, she began to show the slightest of symptoms - a sniffle and a few coughs, almost undetectable. Tracy told BBC Radio Scotland'sMornings with Kaye Adams programmethe news that her baby had become one of the country's youngest virus patients was traumatic. ""They said 'she's fine, don't panic - but she has tested positive for coronavirus',"" said Tracy. ""I think the doctor was trying to keep me calm but I was sobbing. ""As much as she was fine I thought at what point was she with the virus? How is she fighting against it when she's so wee? It was just the unknown."" Tracy and Arjuna give Peyton a bath in the days following the Caesarean section Peyton was given steroids to help strengthen her lungs and received ""amazing"" care from neonatal nurses in the days that followed her diagnosis. However, after recovering from her Caesarean section, Tracy was told she would have to go home and isolate for 14 days away from her baby. She said: ""I was pleading on the phone with the doctor saying I don't want to be away from her. ""As much as everyone was looking after her, I'm her mum. Even if it was the cold, I'd want to be there with her."" Doctors relented and allowed Tracy to stay - but Arjuna would have to go home and complete the isolation period in order to see his baby girl. As days passed, the number of deaths in Scotland caused by the virus continued to increase - but Peyton recovered. This video can not be played Peyton and her mum featured in BBC filming at the University Hospital Wishaw in Lanarkshire She and Tracy were discharged on Monday and Arjuna has now held her for the first time since leaving hospital. Tracy said: ""From Arjuna's point of view, I think he felt a bit useless - first his baby is coming early and secondly his wife isn't well and he couldn't be there."" Now home and settling into a routine, Tracy and family have praised the doctors and nurses at Wishaw General who guided them through a remarkable and daunting birth.

Branson offers island for bailout,"Sir Richard moved to Necker Island 14 years ago Sir Richard Branson has pledged his luxury island resort as collateral to help get a UK government bailout of his stricken airline Virgin Atlantic. The billionaire Virgin Group boss saidin an open letter to staff,externalhe was not asking for a handout, but a commercial loan, believed to be Â£500m. The airline's survival was in doubt, and his Necker Island home in the Caribbean could be mortgaged, he said. It comes as Virgin Group's airline in Australia enters administration. Virgin Australia collapses into administration Both airlines have been hit hard by the global coronavirus lockdown, and Sir Richard has appealed to governments in both countries for help. However, he has been criticised for appealing for taxpayer aid rather than drawing on his huge wealth. Sir Richard's fortune is thought to be well over Â£4bn. The large US airline Delta owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic. Sir Richard said in his letter to staff: ""Many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it."" The crisis facing airlines, and the staff they employ, was ""unprecedented,"" he said. Despite his wealth, this did not mean he had ""cash in a bank account ready to withdraw"". And he hit back at criticism that he was a tax exile who did not deserve help, saying he and his wife ""did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island"". He said Necker would be offered as security for any loans. ""As with other Virgin assets, our team will raise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible around the group,"" Sir Richard said. Allow Twitter content?

In his letter to staff, Sir Richard said: ""We will do everything we can to keep the airline [Virgin Atlantic] going - but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for. ""This would be in the form of a commercial loan - it wouldn't be free money and the airline would pay it back (as EasyJet will do for the Â£600m loan the government recently gave them)."" He pointed out that Virgin Atlantic started with one plane 36 years ago, before adding: ""Over those years it has created real competition for British Airways, which must remain fierce for the benefit of our wonderful customers and the public at large."" Sir Richard offered to inject Â£250m into the Virgin Group last month, with most of that going to the airline. Earlier this month, Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Heathrow airport and Manchester Airports Group sent letters to the government highlighting the importance of Virgin Atlantic to the UK's manufacturing supply chain. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia - in which Sir Richard holds a stake of around 10% - is going into administration. The carrier has been forced to cancel nearly all of its flights during the coronavirus crisis and been unable to restructure its debts. The Australian government offered some support, but refused a request from the company for a A$1.4bn (Â£720m) loan. The airline is part-owned by Sir Richard along with Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA. ""The brilliant Virgin Australia team is fighting to survive and need support to get through this catastrophic global crisis,"" Sir Richard said. ""We are hopeful that Virgin Australia can emerge stronger than ever, as a more sustainable, financially viable airline."" He warned: ""If Virgin Australia disappears, Qantas would effectively have a monopoly of the Australian skies. We all know what that would lead to."" Sir Richard also addressed the fierce criticism he has faced in recent weeks over his tax situation. Critics have pointed out he has paid no UK income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago. Sir Richard is the 312th richest person in the world with an estimated $5.2bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. ""I've seen lots of comments about my net worth - but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw,"" he said. ""Over the years significant profits have never been taken out of the Virgin Group, instead they have been reinvested in building businesses that create value and opportunities."" Turning to the question of living abroad he said: ""Joan and I did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands (BVI) and in particular Necker Island, which I bought when I was 29 years old, as an uninhabited island on the edges of the BVI. ""Over time, we built our family home here. The rest of the island is run as a business, which employs 175 people."" Coronavirus: Who is still flying?

'My PPE offer to NHS has been ignored',"Paul Dodd says he has had to stop production of visors due to mounting costs A businessman has been left angry after his offer of 450 visors a day to the NHS has apparently been ignored. Paul Dodd says he has spent Â£8,000 on materials and wages for the work but after four weeks has been forced to stop. Mr Dodd, owner of Weaver Dane and Trade in Cheshire, said: ""I knew there was a risk buying materials but I thought I was doing the right thing by helping."" The government said it was ""rapidly working through 8,000 offers"". NHS workersare concerned about supplies, and have been asked to consider reusing some equipment. Mr Dodd, who said he had already donated 2,300 visors to local hospitals as part of a separate crowdfunding project, said he made the offer to manufacture visors on thegovernment's website,external. He employs nine people and said he had sourced the necessary materials for the work before they sold out and started work on a further 1,300 visors which are stockpiled and ready to go.

After setting up a Facebook page publicising his efforts, Mr Dodd said he was contacted individually by a surgeon, who asked for 75 visors. The surgeon said he was not prepared to go to work without them, and later emailed to thank him, saying he had carried out a ""cardiac procedure"" and saved a woman's life, Mr Dodd explained. Mr Dodd, who said he had sent samples of the visors to the government testing house, said was ""too much red tape"" and people were ""passing the buck"". The Cabinet Office said in a statement: ""We are incredibly grateful for over 8,000 offers of support from suppliers as part of the national effort to ensure appropriate PPE is reaching the front line. ""We are working rapidly to get through these offers, ensuring they meet the safety and quality standards that our NHS and social care workers need, and prioritising offers of larger volumes.""

US oil prices turn negative,"The price of US oil has turned negative for the first time in history. That means oil producers are paying buyers to take the commodity off their hands over fears that storage capacity could run out in May. Demand for oil has all but dried up as lockdowns across the world have kept people inside. As a result, oil firms have resorted to renting tankers to store the surplus supply and that has forced the price of US oil into negative territory. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell as low as minus $37.63 a barrel. Record deal to cut oil output ends price war Coronavirus: Who is still flying? Seafarers in limbo as coronavirus hits shipping ""This is off-the-charts wacky,"" said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""The demand shock was so massive that it's overwhelmed anything that people could have expected."" The severe drop on Monday was driven in part by a technicality of the global oil market. Oil is traded on its future price and May futures contracts are due to expire on Tuesday. Traders were keen to offload those holdings to avoid having to take delivery of the oil and incur storage costs. June prices for WTI were also down, but trading at above $20 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent Crude - the benchmark used by Europe and the rest of the world, which is already trading based on June contracts - was also weaker, down 8.9% at less than $26 a barrel. Mr Glickman said the historic reversal in pricing was a reminder of the strains facing the oil market and warned that June prices could also fall, if lockdowns remain in place. ""I'm really not optimistic about the prospects for oil companies or oil prices,"" he said. OGUK, the business lobby for the UK's offshore oil and gas sector, said the negative price of US oil would affect firms operating in the North Sea. ""The dynamics of this US market are different from those directly driving UK produced Brent but we will not escape the impact,"" said OGUK boss Deirdre Michie. ""Ours is not just a trading market; every penny lost spells more uncertainty over jobs,"" she said. The oil industry has been struggling with both tumbling demand and in-fighting among producers about reducing output. Earlier this month, Opec members and its allies finally agreed a record deal to slash global output by about 10%. The deal was the largest cut in oil production ever to have been agreed. But many analysts say the cuts were not big enough to make a difference. ""It hasn't taken long for the market to recognise that the Opec+ deal will not, in its present form, be enough to balance oil markets,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at Axicorp. The leading exporters - Opec and allies such as Russia - have already agreed to cut production by a record amount. In the United States and elsewhere, oil-producing businesses have made commercial decisions to cut output. But still the world has more crude oil than it can use. And it's not just about whether we can use it. It's also about whether we can store it until the lockdowns are eased enough to generate some additional demand for oil products. Capacity is filling fast on land and at sea. As that process continues it's likely to bear down further on prices. It will take a recovery in demand to really turn the market round and that will depend on how the health crisis unfolds. There will be further supply cuts as private sector producers respond to the low prices, but it's hard to see that being on a sufficient scale to have a fundamental impact on the market. For US drivers, the decline in oil prices - which have fallen by about two-thirds since the start of the year - has had an impact at the pumps, albeit not as dramatic as Monday's decline might suggest. ""The silver lining is, if you for various reason actually need to be on the roads, you're filling up for far less than you would have been even four months ago,"" Mr Glickman said. ""The problem for most of us is even if you could fill up, where are you going to go?"" US President Donald Trump has said the government will buy oil for the country's national reserve. But concern continues to mount that storage facilities in the US will run out of capacity, with stockpiles at Cushing, the main delivery point in the US for oil, rising almost 50% since the start of March, according to ANZ Bank. Mr Innes said: ""It's a dump at all cost as no one, and I mean no one, wants delivery of oil with Cushing storage facilities filling by the minute.""

Insurer to give Â£25 refunds as cars sit idlePressure mounts on other motor insurers to offer refunds as people stay at home during the pandemic.BusinessComments,"Roads have been extremely quiet owing to the virus restrictions One of the UK's biggest motor insurance companies, Admiral, is giving a Â£25 refund to customers as cars and vans sit idle in the coronavirus pandemic. The payment will be paid automatically to anyone with a car or van insurance policy with Admiral on 20 April. The company said it was a ""thank you"" to customers for staying at home, but also reflected the lower level of claims, benefiting its profits. Other insurers are under pressure to follow suit. Some are offering to defer premiums for those struggling to pay, but Admiral is thought to be the first one actually providing refunds directly to customers. The owners of 4.4 million vehicles will receive the payment by the end of May. Admiral suggested that the refund and the amount it was spending on other support measures were the equivalent for many customers of one month's worth of their annual premium, but for most young drivers it will be far less than that. One said the refund accounted for just 1.68% of his annual bill. 'My business could go bust if insurers don't pay' Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain Insurers have been heavily criticised during the coronavirus crisis for failing to cover small and medium-sized businesses for interruption to their trade. The industry has responded by saying that many did not have the relevant cover. Drivers have also been asking why they should be paying for a service that they cannot use as expected, namely insurance cover for the regular journeys which have stopped as they follow government guidance to stay at home. Cristina Nestares, chief executive of UK insurance at Admiral, said: ""This is an unprecedented time when people across the country are driving significantly less than before the lockdown, and we expect this to lead to a fall in the number of claims we are seeing. ""We want to give the money we would have used to pay these claims back to our loyal customers in this difficult time."" The company would not reveal to BBC News how much of a reduction it has seen in claims. More insurance companies should do the same, according to Gareth Shaw, head of money at the consumer organisation Which?. ""Firms that act fairly now may see that they are rewarded in the future, and we encourage all other car insurers to follow Admiral's lead,"" he said. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said that pricing and refunds were a matter for individual firms, but insurers were being flexible. This included giving free cover to key workers unable to use public transport. He added that by law, vehicles on the road still needed to be covered by insurance, while many people were still using them for essential journeys, such as to the supermarket. ""Even if you do not drive during lockdown, you will still need to be protected against theft, vandalism and damage,"" an ABI spokesman said. Mike Powell, car insurance expert at analysts Defaqto, said insurance providers were allowing customers to defer payments, in a similar way to banks with mortgages and utility companies with other bills. He pointed out that information on how to access support was available on insurance companies' websites, but this needed to be agreed with the provider, rather than simply cancelling payments.

Primark boss: We have sold nothing,"Clothing giant Primark has gone from making Â£650m in sales a month to nothing as the coronavirus has forced it to close in Europe and the US, it revealed on Tuesday. It was not the only company to admit struggling in the face of the pandemic. John Lewis has furloughed thousands of staff and fashion retailer Cath Kidston said it had closed its stores for good. Primark owner Associated British Foods ""has been squarely in the path of this pandemic,"" said boss George Weston. Without furlough support from European states, many of Primark's 68,000 staff would have been made redundant, he said. The company has also written down the value of its clothing stock by Â£284m. ""From making sales of Â£650m each month, since the last of our stores closed on 22 March, we have sold nothing,"" Mr Weston said. He added that while he would ""love"" to be able to reopen Primark stores, ""I know that we must not do so until we have suppressed this disease"". The chain, which was founded in 1969, does not have an online store or offer click-and-collect services for its products. The firmhas previously said,externalthis is because it would not be able to keep prices for its clothing as low if it offered home delivery. Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, ""we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal"". ""In time we can rebuild the profits. We can't replace the people we lose."" Mr Weston paid tribute to two workers at AB Foods who within the last three weeks have died from coronavirus. Mario Marioli worked for 40 years at a yeast plant the firm owns in Italy, and Claudio Maini worked at Italian balsamic vinegar maker Acetum for 20 years. AB Foods said it had paid Primark's suppliers for stock it has received and will set up a fund to ensure workers who make those clothes are paid. This move comes at a time when competing retailers have asked suppliers for payment holidays and cuts. Earlier this month, New Looksaid it would suspend paymentsto suppliers for existing stock ""indefinitely"", telling them in a letter that the stock can be collected by its owners. AB Foods is cash-rich by comparison with many companies with a High Street presence. It has Â£801m in cash and a Â£1.09bn loan agreed, which it has recently drawn down in case banks have trouble lending in the future. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak As well as Primark, Associated British Foods owns food brands including Twinings tea, Blue Dragon sauces and Ovaltine. For these and other businesses outside Primark, the company has kept its financial forecasts for the year the same. However, while many clothing rivals have been able to make sales online, Primarksells only gift cards,externalthrough its website. This is a big problem for AB Foods as Primark usually contributes about two-thirds of the company's profits. ""Although AB Foods derives some benefit from product and geographical diversification in other parts of the group, the impact of the loss of Primark income, even if temporary, is a major blow,"" said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor. The shares fell 2.3% in London trading to 1,944 pence apiece, valuing the firm at about Â£15.4bn. The shares changed hands at 2,708 pence each in February. Overall, it said net profit for the first half of the year fell to Â£217m from Â£389m. ""Our food businesses have continued production at all facilities, maintaining their essential output to support the food, animal feed and pharmaceutical supply chains. This has been and remains a key priority for us,"" said Mr Weston. John Lewis also reported trading figures on Tuesday. Unlike Primark it has a strong online presence, but it said a surge in online orders had not made up for its loss of trade from department store closures amid the coronavirus outbreak. After shutting its shops on 1 April, John Lewis furloughed 14,000 of its staff,according to its annual report.,external Products like clothing and other items that can offer high margins for a retailer are not selling well right now, said Maureen Hinton, global retail research director at GlobalData. Meanwhile, low-margin areas with lots of competition like technology are selling well, which is good for sales but not profit. The lockdown will test its ability to deliver, which may put it in good stead for September, when it parts ways with delivery firm Ocado. ""It will certainly have tested their ability and it is bringing on more capability as well,"" she said. Its Waitrose supermarket chain has seen a boost, albeit one the company thinks could be temporary. It warned that in a worst-case scenario, its department stores could see sales fall 35% this year, with Waitrose seeing a fall of less than 5%. ""Items in highest demand have been cupboard essentials like rice, pasta, long life milk; home baking; frozen foods and cleaning products,"" the company said. Since 26 January, Waitrose sales have risen 8% compared with a year ago, while John Lewis sales are down 7%. Primark and John Lewis were not the only brands to reveal on Tuesday that they are struggling in the face of the crisis. Floral fashion firm Cath Kidston said that its 60 stores in the UK would not be reopening their doors after the lockdown is over. The firm fell into administration and now its brand and online shop has been bought by a company owned by Baring Private Equity Asia. That has left its physical stores in the hands of administrators and more than 900 shop staff unemployed.

'Emergency food' for families with nothing to eat,"Some deprived families are running out of food because of delays in receiving free school meal vouchers under the government's scheme in England, say school leaders. Some schools are supplying emergency food parcels or buying their own vouchers for desperate families. Parents say they are waiting up to 10 days for the government vouchers. The Department for Education said it was providing extra cash for schools facing ""unavoidable costs"". Under the government scheme, families eligible for free school meals in England should receive vouchers worth Â£15 a week per child. But Edenred, the company appointed to manage the scheme, has struggled to meet demand, even after its website was rebuilt over the Easter weekend. Further delays to children's food vouchers Food vouchers for free school meals children The government scheme allows Â£15 a week for every child eligible for free school meals Schools say they still encounter lengthy waits and error messages while logging on to order the vouchers. Parents are then usually expected to download the vouchers themselves but with thousands in the queue, this can take hours. The National Association of Head Teachers has been pushing for improvements after ""a significant number of schools"" reported problems. Many are concerned about using cash from their own tight budgets to pay for emergency food. At St Richard's Catholic Primary School in Chichester parishioners raised more than Â£3,000 to support families whose livelihoods have collapsed under the lockdown. Head teacher James Field says the school used the money to buy its own vouchers from local supermarkets and he personally delivered them to families. Self-employed parents, particularly those in private rented accommodation, are ""really struggling"" to feed their families, he adds. Chiswick School, in west London, is using money raised from donations to fund food parcels for families described by head Laura Ellener as some of the most vulnerable in the country. ""There are families with nothing, who rely on this money to feed their children,"" she says. ""We are now delivering food parcels to those who have told us they have nothing to eat."" At Gorringe Park Primary in south London, chair of governors James Whiting says some parents became so desperate they went to the school over the Easter holidays, asking for food. The school is in quite a deprived area, he adds, with about 80 pupils out of 450 already eligible for free school meals -and this number is growing under the lockdown. School lunch assistant Vorona, lives in a room in a shared south London house with her six-year-old daughter. She eventually managed to download and spend the first Â£15 voucher at the end of last week but her attempts to download the second have so far been unsuccessful - the screen freezes and she has to start again. Another problem is the limited selection of supermarkets included in the scheme. The nearest is Morrisons - a bus ride away. Vorona has asthma and being at high risk from coronavirus means she is scared to go out, let alone get on a bus. ""It does stress me,"" she says. ""My chest gets tight it's not a good situation, especially for my child."" Her friend Eunice, meanwhile, says despite having gone through all the required steps, her vouchers never appeared and she has found it impossible to get through to Edenred to check why. ""You just have to cope,"" she says, ""but I know there's other people who have got them."" Not having enough food is particularly hard with her children at home all the time, she says. ""They're constantly wanting something to eat,"" she says. ""It hasn't got that bad - but it would help a lot if the vouchers came."" A letter highlighting the scheme's failings from their MP, Siobhain McDonagh to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has been signed by more than 70 MPs. ""Everybody says that this virus does not discriminate,"" Ms McDonagh says. ""But we know that the poorest families are hit hardest. ""They are more likely to be in precarious employment, unsuitable housing and worse health. ""Free schools meals are an essential lifeline of support for these families and it is vital that they receive the support that they are entitled to."" The Department for Education said itwas providing additional funding to schools,externalon top of existing budgets, to cover  unavoidable costs incurred due to the coronavirus outbreak, ""including free school meal costs which are not covered by the national voucher scheme"". A spokeswoman said schools could print out vouchers for families with no internet access. And on Tuesday, the government announcedthe scheme,externalwould from 27 April include Aldi, alongside Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer, which were involved from the start. Edenred, meanwhile, said it had sent Â£15m worth of supermarket e-gift vouchers to families so far. The company said changes to the site meant waiting times were ""falling significantly"", promised more improvements  and thanked families and schools for their patience.

Insurer to give Â£25 refunds as cars sit idlePressure mounts on other motor insurers to offer refunds as people stay at home during the pandemic.Business,"Roads have been extremely quiet owing to the virus restrictions One of the UK's biggest motor insurance companies, Admiral, is giving a Â£25 refund to customers as cars and vans sit idle in the coronavirus pandemic. The payment will be paid automatically to anyone with a car or van insurance policy with Admiral on 20 April. The company said it was a ""thank you"" to customers for staying at home, but also reflected the lower level of claims, benefiting its profits. Other insurers are under pressure to follow suit. Some are offering to defer premiums for those struggling to pay, but Admiral is thought to be the first one actually providing refunds directly to customers. The owners of 4.4 million vehicles will receive the payment by the end of May. Admiral suggested that the refund and the amount it was spending on other support measures were the equivalent for many customers of one month's worth of their annual premium, but for most young drivers it will be far less than that. One said the refund accounted for just 1.68% of his annual bill. 'My business could go bust if insurers don't pay' Insurance firms ordered to pay out or explain Insurers have been heavily criticised during the coronavirus crisis for failing to cover small and medium-sized businesses for interruption to their trade. The industry has responded by saying that many did not have the relevant cover. Drivers have also been asking why they should be paying for a service that they cannot use as expected, namely insurance cover for the regular journeys which have stopped as they follow government guidance to stay at home. Cristina Nestares, chief executive of UK insurance at Admiral, said: ""This is an unprecedented time when people across the country are driving significantly less than before the lockdown, and we expect this to lead to a fall in the number of claims we are seeing. ""We want to give the money we would have used to pay these claims back to our loyal customers in this difficult time."" The company would not reveal to BBC News how much of a reduction it has seen in claims. More insurance companies should do the same, according to Gareth Shaw, head of money at the consumer organisation Which?. ""Firms that act fairly now may see that they are rewarded in the future, and we encourage all other car insurers to follow Admiral's lead,"" he said. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said that pricing and refunds were a matter for individual firms, but insurers were being flexible. This included giving free cover to key workers unable to use public transport. He added that by law, vehicles on the road still needed to be covered by insurance, while many people were still using them for essential journeys, such as to the supermarket. ""Even if you do not drive during lockdown, you will still need to be protected against theft, vandalism and damage,"" an ABI spokesman said. Mike Powell, car insurance expert at analysts Defaqto, said insurance providers were allowing customers to defer payments, in a similar way to banks with mortgages and utility companies with other bills. He pointed out that information on how to access support was available on insurance companies' websites, but this needed to be agreed with the provider, rather than simply cancelling payments.

"Primark boss: We have sold nothingPrimark's owner ""has been squarely in the path of this pandemic,"" its chief executive says.BusinessComments","Clothing giant Primark has gone from making Â£650m in sales a month to nothing as the coronavirus has forced it to close in Europe and the US, it revealed on Tuesday. It was not the only company to admit struggling in the face of the pandemic. John Lewis has furloughed thousands of staff and fashion retailer Cath Kidston said it had closed its stores for good. Primark owner Associated British Foods ""has been squarely in the path of this pandemic,"" said boss George Weston. Without furlough support from European states, many of Primark's 68,000 staff would have been made redundant, he said. The company has also written down the value of its clothing stock by Â£284m. ""From making sales of Â£650m each month, since the last of our stores closed on 22 March, we have sold nothing,"" Mr Weston said. He added that while he would ""love"" to be able to reopen Primark stores, ""I know that we must not do so until we have suppressed this disease"". The chain, which was founded in 1969, does not have an online store or offer click-and-collect services for its products. The firmhas previously said,externalthis is because it would not be able to keep prices for its clothing as low if it offered home delivery. Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, ""we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal"". ""In time we can rebuild the profits. We can't replace the people we lose."" Mr Weston paid tribute to two workers at AB Foods who within the last three weeks have died from coronavirus. Mario Marioli worked for 40 years at a yeast plant the firm owns in Italy, and Claudio Maini worked at Italian balsamic vinegar maker Acetum for 20 years. AB Foods said it had paid Primark's suppliers for stock it has received and will set up a fund to ensure workers who make those clothes are paid. This move comes at a time when competing retailers have asked suppliers for payment holidays and cuts. Earlier this month, New Looksaid it would suspend paymentsto suppliers for existing stock ""indefinitely"", telling them in a letter that the stock can be collected by its owners. AB Foods is cash-rich by comparison with many companies with a High Street presence. It has Â£801m in cash and a Â£1.09bn loan agreed, which it has recently drawn down in case banks have trouble lending in the future. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak As well as Primark, Associated British Foods owns food brands including Twinings tea, Blue Dragon sauces and Ovaltine. For these and other businesses outside Primark, the company has kept its financial forecasts for the year the same. However, while many clothing rivals have been able to make sales online, Primarksells only gift cards,externalthrough its website. This is a big problem for AB Foods as Primark usually contributes about two-thirds of the company's profits. ""Although AB Foods derives some benefit from product and geographical diversification in other parts of the group, the impact of the loss of Primark income, even if temporary, is a major blow,"" said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor. The shares fell 2.3% in London trading to 1,944 pence apiece, valuing the firm at about Â£15.4bn. The shares changed hands at 2,708 pence each in February. Overall, it said net profit for the first half of the year fell to Â£217m from Â£389m. ""Our food businesses have continued production at all facilities, maintaining their essential output to support the food, animal feed and pharmaceutical supply chains. This has been and remains a key priority for us,"" said Mr Weston. John Lewis also reported trading figures on Tuesday. Unlike Primark it has a strong online presence, but it said a surge in online orders had not made up for its loss of trade from department store closures amid the coronavirus outbreak. After shutting its shops on 1 April, John Lewis furloughed 14,000 of its staff,according to its annual report.,external Products like clothing and other items that can offer high margins for a retailer are not selling well right now, said Maureen Hinton, global retail research director at GlobalData. Meanwhile, low-margin areas with lots of competition like technology are selling well, which is good for sales but not profit. The lockdown will test its ability to deliver, which may put it in good stead for September, when it parts ways with delivery firm Ocado. ""It will certainly have tested their ability and it is bringing on more capability as well,"" she said. Its Waitrose supermarket chain has seen a boost, albeit one the company thinks could be temporary. It warned that in a worst-case scenario, its department stores could see sales fall 35% this year, with Waitrose seeing a fall of less than 5%. ""Items in highest demand have been cupboard essentials like rice, pasta, long life milk; home baking; frozen foods and cleaning products,"" the company said. Since 26 January, Waitrose sales have risen 8% compared with a year ago, while John Lewis sales are down 7%. Primark and John Lewis were not the only brands to reveal on Tuesday that they are struggling in the face of the crisis. Floral fashion firm Cath Kidston said that its 60 stores in the UK would not be reopening their doors after the lockdown is over.

Advice issued for spending Ramadan in lockdown,"The Muslim Council of Britain, the largest umbrella organisation for Muslims in Britain, has published online guidance to help millions cope with the restrictions of lockdown during the coming fasting month of Ramadan. It says this year's Ramadan, which begins at the end of this week, will be ""a very different experience for Muslims as we adapt to changing circumstances during the Covid-19 pandemic"". With lockdown continuing, there will be no congregational acts of worship outside the home, no Taraweeh prayers at the mosque and no iftars (usually a huge ritual meal marking the breaking of the fast after sundown) with friends and family to attend. Instead, the MCB is offering guidance on how to arrange virtual iftars online with loved ones and community members by using video chat. Plan your iftar menus in advance, it says, so as to avoid multiple shopping trips. It also suggests eating high-energy, slow-burning foods during the second meal of the night, the suhoor, which takes place just before dawn, to help maintain energy levels throughout the daylight fasting hours. Is coronavirus coming between people and their faith? How coronavirus is changing religious festivals The MCB advises Muslims to ""honour your workplace duties with patience and good grace to those around you"". But it also warns that a refusal by employers to allow flexibility in work timings for fasting employees without a legitimate business reason could amount to unlawful indirect discrimination. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The Muslim holy month of Ramadan is a special time for nearly two billion Muslims all over the world. In any normal year, it is a time of communal prayer, of daytime fasting, night-time feasting, extensive socialising and acts of profound generosity and charity as Muslims reaffirm their faith in God. For those living in the West, forsaking food and drink during daylight hours while the rest of the population is able to indulge publicly in cafes and restaurants has always been a testing time. But this year it will be very different. With lockdown continuing, most of those visible temptations on the streets will be absent as people stay at home. Yet individual isolation is completely counter-intuitive to most Muslims during the month of Ramadan. Usually, whole communities tend to pour onto the streets after dark to share and enjoy the communal experience with their relatives and neighbours. But Dr Emman El-Badawy, an expert on Islamic jurisprudence, believes the spirit of Ramadan will survive. ""So much of the essence of Ramadan can be maintained during isolation. ""The spiritual aspects may even be heightened for some of us, with less distractions than usual. ""The communal practices will be missed under the restrictions, for sure, but there are already great initiatives being built to help with this."" How will you be observing Ramadan where you are?

Oil price falls to 18-year low as turmoil persistsCoronavirus downturn has put major pressure on oil prices with demand slumping and storage running out.BusinessComments,"The deal represents the largest cut in oil production ever agreed The UK benchmark for oil has slumped 10% to around $16 (Â£13) a barrel in another day of declines. It comes after the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell below zero for the first time ever earlier this week. The falls are a striking illustration of just how much economic activity has slowed around the world. Prices have weakened sharply because of a combination of events triggered by a collapse in global demand. The knock-on effect has been a supply glut and a worldwide shortage of storage space for oil. Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? On Tuesday energy ministers from the Opec and other major oil-producing countries held an unscheduled conference call to discuss the collapse but did not agree any new measures to cut supplies. ""This is an unprecedented demand drop. Nobody in their lifetime has seen anything like this,"" said Peter McNally of Third Bridge Group. The collapse in physical demand for crude products like petrol and jet fuel has left storage hubs at capacity or, as one trader put it: ""They're close to the brim."" Storage at US oil hub Cushing has already grown to more than 15 million barrels in the past month - and is expected to soon be at capacity for the first time ever. ""Coronavirus is rewriting the rules of the global economy in front of our very eyes,"" said Adam Vettese, analyst at eToro. ""With oil demand virtually non-existent, this quite amazing sell-off is almost entirely down to fears over storage."" While the price of petrol is linked to the wholesale price of oil, it is driven by competition. That means that what motorists pay is not directly linked to crude. Instead, suppliers control the prices they sell petrol at. Crucially, a key factor affecting the price of fuel is that the biggest proportion of the money you hand over for a litre of petrol in the UK goes to the government in the form of tax. Fuel duty is charged at 57.95p per litre. On top of that, you have to pay VAT at 20% on the cost of petrol. Could this week's oil price turmoil see prices drift below Â£1 for the first time since the late 2000s? ""In theory, petrol prices could fall below Â£1 per litre if the lower wholesale costs were reflected at the pumps - but at the same time, people are driving very few miles, so they're selling vastly lower quantities of petrol and diesel at the moment,"" pointed out RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. This means many forecourts will be reluctant to trim their prices any further, he said. At the same time, he said, more price pressure on petrol could hit the viability of independent garages, which provided ""a vital service in areas where the supermarkets don't have a foothold"". ""It would be bad news all round if these forecourts shut up shop for good."" Since the end of March, the wholesale price of petrol has been around the 16p a litre mark, according to the AA. ""Add fuel duty at 57.95p a litre, a generous 9p a litre supplier/retailer margin, plus VAT and the average pump price of petrol would normally be around Â£1 a litre,"" said the AA's fuel spokesperson Luke Bosdet. Instead, the average pump price is higher because the retailers say they need to charge 10p a litre more to offset the lower volumes of fuel they are selling, he pointed out. Journey levels are at about 40% of normal during the working week, falling to 20% by Sunday. This meant those who were still driving were being ""overcharged on average by more than a fiver a tank"". ""I suspect that when the lockdown comes to an end, coronavirus is beaten and driving starts to return to normal, questions will be asked about the fairness of pump prices during the great oil crash of 2020.""

Airports 'at risk' of closure as flights grounded,"Check-in desks at Stansted Airport are deserted and there are only a few flights a day, mainly for freight Some airports are ""at risk"" of closure because of the loss of business during the coronavirus pandemic, experts have warned. Nine out of 10 flights have been grounded since the UK went into lockdown. Airports said cargo flights were running and shareholders were being supportive as they worked to cut costs. Flight tracking websiteFlightradar24,externalrecorded just 711 departures from the UK's 10 biggest airports last week. This compares with 7,865 in the week up to the UK's lockdown. Independent aviation analyst Martin Evans said there was a ""risk"" some airports would fold. ""Regional airports, just before the lockdown,were hit by the administration of Flybe,"" he said. ""So they had already lost a substantial amount of income. ""Now is the start of the period when they should be getting maximum revenue. If things return to normal by winter, that's the point they are at their quietest. ""There is a risk that we could see airports close. That could mean an airport company folds but that the buildings and facilities are still there and someone else would take over, but there is a risk at the moment."" He said airports would still have to cover fixed costs - ranging from management to air traffic control - whether there were flights or not. Virgin Australia slumps into administration Who is still flying? Julian Bray, an aviation expert and broadcaster, said some grounded aircraft may ""never return to the skies"". He said systems would need to be thoroughly serviced before they could fly again. Mr Bray added: ""We will see some smaller airports go to the wall unless a rescue deal can be arranged."" He said he expected passenger numbers to be low even when restrictions were lifted as people choose not to travel. ""Some are getting one or two departures a day, but it is pretty bleak at the moment."" EasyJet has grounded planes at airports like Luton EasyJet said it expected a pre-tax loss of between Â£185m and Â£205m for the six months to 31 March, although this would mark an improvement after a Â£275m loss in the same period a year earlier.

The departure lounge at Heathrow's Terminal 5 is almost empty For some airports, almost all passenger flights have stopped. A spokeswoman for Birmingham Airport said traffic was down 90%. ""Birmingham Airport remains open to support any airlines that need to carry out aircraft maintenance checks, emergency flights and cargo, and we will continue to remain open for any airlines which need to use Birmingham as an arrival or departure point,"" she said.

MAG faces into this crisis in a strong and prudent financial position, with supportive shareholders."" He said East Midlands Airport was currently one of the top 10 busiest airports in Europe by flight numbers because of its cargo operation, with volumes ""as high as they would be in a normal month"" but passenger numbers down ""very significantly on normal levels"". Newcastle Airport has limited its hours of operation and currently has one commercial flight per day, four days a week, operating between Newcastle and Amsterdam as well as one-off military, freight and medical flights. ""We welcome the measurestaken so far by the government to support businesses,externalthrough this difficult time but hope there will be further help provided,"" a spokeswoman said. At Belfast International, there have been no passenger flightssince EasyJet grounded services in March. A spokeswoman said the airport remained open and ""appropriately staffed"". ""Passenger flights are effectively limited to round-the-clock medical emergency flights,"" she said. ""Our extensive lifeline nightly cargo operations continue to provide the vital supplies required by the core health and food chain sectors throughout this most challenging of times."" Medical flights include passengers who need to go to Great Britain for treatment, not related to coronavirus, while cargo flights go mainly to the East Midlands and Stansted airports and include Royal Mail services. Bristol Airport is ""assisting with repatriation, medical, military and other essential movements,"" a spokeswoman said.

Former UK Athletics head Black dies,"Neil Black was appointed performance director at UK Athletics in 2012 Neil Black, the former performance director of UK Athletics, has died aged 60, the organisation has confirmed. Black, who worked closely with Mo Farah throughout his career, became performance director in September 2012. He left his position in 2019 after coach Alberto Salazar was banned for four years for doping violations. British four-time Olympic champion Farah paid tribute on Twitter, saying: ""I have lost a good friend. Known him since I was 14 years old."" Farah added: ""Neil supported me all the way in my career since I was kid. My heart is broken. I wouldn't be where I am today without Neil Black. No-one knew me like he did. We lost a great man."" A UK Athletics statement released on Tuesday said Black died at the weekend; the organisation said it was ""shocked and saddened"" at the news. ""Neil loved the sport of athletics and dedicated his life to supporting athletes - as a world-class physiotherapist, as head of sport science, and then in recent years as performance director for British Athletics,"" the statement continued. Ed Warner, former UK Athletics chairman, described Black's death as ""an immense loss to British high performance sport and to athletics in particular"". Warner added: ""It was a great privilege to work with him, and to share the highs and lows of British teams through the cycles of major competitions. I'll particularly treasure our celebratory clinch in the mixed zone at the Olympic Stadium after the last session of the London 2017 World Championships. ""Neil bore the barbs of the critics that are an inevitable part of the job of any leader in elite performance sport with a grace and sense of humour that were truly a mark of the man. ""He wanted to lead the British teams into Tokyo. He won't now be able to cheer their successes there. ""But I am certain there are British athletes who will win medals in Olympics and championships to come who will look back with enormous gratitude at the role Neil played in preparing them for their success. He will be greatly missed."" Black was a physiotherapist with UK Athletics before moving up through the organisation's ranks. He worked with Farah as the athlete won 5,000m and 10,000m gold at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics. Black made the decision to step down as performance director in October 2019 after the banning of Salazar, who coached Farah from 2011 to 2017, and who was appointed as a consultant by UK Athletics in 2013. UK Athletics had conducted a review in 2015 and said there was ""no concern"" about Salazar's link with Farah. In 2015, following a BBC Panorama programme, the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) began an investigation into how Salazar ran the Nike Oregon Project. Salazar has always denied that the Nike Oregon Project permitted doping, saying he was ""shocked"" by Usada's findings, and he is appealing against the ban. UK Athletics said that Black continued to work as an adviser to several athletes following his resignation. World championDina Asher-Smithsaid on social media: ""Incredibly sad and shocking news. I really can't believe it. He was a genuinely lovely, caring and kind-hearted man whose sense of humour and positivity would light up a room. Rest in peace Neil; you'll be dearly missed by all and my thoughts are with your family at this time."" Former heptathlon bronze medallistKelly Sothertontweeted: ""He came everywhere with me and made sure I was held together physically and mentally. So many things I want to say... I'll miss you forever Neil Black."" Chris Tomlinson, the former long jumper, also paid tribute on social media: ""Such sad news to hear of the passing of Neil Black. He was both my physio and team manager for many years. RIP."" Five-time Paralympic championHannah Cockroftwrote: ""Such a great guy, always made time to come chat to me and see how I was getting on when he passed me, and always took a true interest in my training and in my sport. RIP Neil, you'll be missed."" Pole vaulterHolly Bradshawsaid: ""This news is so sad. Neil was such a special and incredible person who did so much for myself and athletics in the UK. Tremendous leader, sensational personality and just a genuinely nice guy. Neil you will be missed - rest in peace."" Paralympic championJo Butterfieldsaid: ""What a shock to wake up to this news this morning. Thoughts are with his loved ones right now. One of the most genuine caring menâ¦ always made time for everyone."" High jumperMorgan Lakeadded her tribute: ""Such terribly sad news. Neil was always so supportive and knew how to bring a team of athletes together and make us feel at ease, especially at major championships. Rest in Peace, my thoughts are with his loved ones."" Paralympic championAled Sion Daviessaid: ""Horrendous news, great man, full of passionâ¦life really is too short.""

"'Emergency food' for families with nothing to eatWith some families still waiting for government food vouchers, schools are having to step in.","Some deprived families are running out of food because of delays in receiving free school meal vouchers under the government's scheme in England, say school leaders. Some schools are supplying emergency food parcels or buying their own vouchers for desperate families. Parents say they are waiting up to 10 days for the government vouchers. The Department for Education said it was providing extra cash for schools facing ""unavoidable costs"". Under the government scheme, families eligible for free school meals in England should receive vouchers worth Â£15 a week per child. But Edenred, the company appointed to manage the scheme, has struggled to meet demand, even after its website was rebuilt over the Easter weekend. Further delays to children's food vouchers Food vouchers for free school meals children The government scheme allows Â£15 a week for every child eligible for free school meals Schools say they still encounter lengthy waits and error messages while logging on to order the vouchers. Parents are then usually expected to download the vouchers themselves but with thousands in the queue, this can take hours. The National Association of Head Teachers has been pushing for improvements after ""a significant number of schools"" reported problems. Many are concerned about using cash from their own tight budgets to pay for emergency food. At St Richard's Catholic Primary School in Chichester parishioners raised more than Â£3,000 to support families whose livelihoods have collapsed under the lockdown. Head teacher James Field says the school used the money to buy its own vouchers from local supermarkets and he personally delivered them to families. Self-employed parents, particularly those in private rented accommodation, are ""really struggling"" to feed their families, he adds. Chiswick School, in west London, is using money raised from donations to fund food parcels for families described by head Laura Ellener as some of the most vulnerable in the country. ""There are families with nothing, who rely on this money to feed their children,"" she says. ""We are now delivering food parcels to those who have told us they have nothing to eat."" At Gorringe Park Primary in south London, chair of governors James Whiting says some parents became so desperate they went to the school over the Easter holidays, asking for food. The school is in quite a deprived area, he adds, with about 80 pupils out of 450 already eligible for free school meals -and this number is growing under the lockdown. School lunch assistant Vorona, lives in a room in a shared south London house with her six-year-old daughter. She eventually managed to download and spend the first Â£15 voucher at the end of last week but her attempts to download the second have so far been unsuccessful - the screen freezes and she has to start again. Another problem is the limited selection of supermarkets included in the scheme. The nearest is Morrisons - a bus ride away. Vorona has asthma and being at high risk from coronavirus means she is scared to go out, let alone get on a bus. ""It does stress me,"" she says. ""My chest gets tight it's not a good situation, especially for my child."" Her friend Eunice, meanwhile, says despite having gone through all the required steps, her vouchers never appeared and she has found it impossible to get through to Edenred to check why. ""You just have to cope,"" she says, ""but I know there's other people who have got them."" Not having enough food is particularly hard with her children at home all the time, she says. ""They're constantly wanting something to eat,"" she says. ""It hasn't got that bad - but it would help a lot if the vouchers came."" A letter highlighting the scheme's failings from their MP, Siobhain McDonagh to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has been signed by more than 70 MPs. ""Everybody says that this virus does not discriminate,"" Ms McDonagh says. ""But we know that the poorest families are hit hardest. ""They are more likely to be in precarious employment, unsuitable housing and worse health. ""Free schools meals are an essential lifeline of support for these families and it is vital that they receive the support that they are entitled to."" The Department for Education said itwas providing additional funding to schools,externalon top of existing budgets, to cover  unavoidable costs incurred due to the coronavirus outbreak, ""including free school meal costs which are not covered by the national voucher scheme"". A spokeswoman said schools could print out vouchers for families with no internet access. And on Tuesday, the government announcedthe scheme,externalwould from 27 April include Aldi, alongside Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer, which were involved from the start. Edenred, meanwhile, said it had sent Â£15m worth of supermarket e-gift vouchers to families so far. The company said changes to the site meant waiting times were ""falling significantly"", promised more improvements  and thanked families and schools for their patience.

UK employment rate at record high before lockdown,"Many people have started working from home because of the coronavirus outbreak UK employment was estimated at a record high in the three months to February, before the effects of the coronavirus lockdown started to hit the economy. Official figures showed 76.6% of people aged 16 to 64 were in paid work, up from 76.4% in the previous quarter. Unemployment was estimated at 4%, up slightly on the last quarter,the Office for National Statistics said.,external However, early estimates for March showed a slight drop in the number of paid employees compared with February. The figures fell by 0.06%, although they were still 0.8% higher than the same period last year. Pay in February continued to grow faster than inflation, but its rate of growth has slowed since the middle of last year. The estimated growth for pay excluding bonuses in the three-month period was 2.9%. There were an estimated 33.07 million people in employment, 352,000 more than a year earlier. David Freeman, ONS head of labour market statistics, said: ""Our final data wholly from before the coronavirus restrictions were in place, showed the labour market was very robust in the three months to February. ""For the first time, we have brought forward information on the number of employees in work using PAYE data to cover a more recent period. ""These experimental statistics show a softening picture in March, but cover the month as a whole, including the period before the coronavirus restrictions were in place."" More than 140,000 firms claim wage bill help Salary subsidy scheme extended into June Next month's figures are expected to reflect the rapid downturn in the economy since the lockdown began. Andrew Sentance, senior adviser to Cambridge Econometric, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It won't be until next month that we get the proper picture when even just the first phase of lockdown had an impact ""The figure showing nearly a million new claims of universal credit, shows there's clearly something in the pipeline of a significant increase in unemployment."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, said: ""The latest figures mask the extent of the rise in unemployment expected this year. ""We estimate that as many as 13 million jobs are in sectors highly affected by the lockdown, representing 36% of all jobs in the UK, which could see unemployment rising to just under 9% during the lockdown period. ""An additional spike in unemployment after the lockdown also seems likely, once government support via the Job Retention Scheme ends."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures were not ""very useful"" as they predated the lockdown, but the added that the slight drop in paid employees estimated for March suggested a ""small crack in the labour market"" may soon ""turn into a chasm"". Reflecting on the early March estimates, Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The labour market deteriorated markedly less than had been expected in March."" ""The number of workers claiming benefits rose a modest 12.100. Importantly, though, the claims data was based on the situation at 12 March, and there looks to have been a substantial pick-up since then especially when the lockdown was imposed on 23 March.""

Oil price still below zero as turmoil persists,"The deal represents the largest cut in oil production ever agreed The UK benchmark for oil has slumped 10% to around $16 (Â£13) a barrel in another day of declines. It comes after the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell below zero for the first time ever earlier this week. The falls are a striking illustration of just how much economic activity has slowed around the world. Prices have weakened sharply because of a combination of events triggered by a collapse in global demand. The knock-on effect has been a supply glut and a worldwide shortage of storage space for oil. Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? On Tuesday energy ministers from the Opec and other major oil-producing countries held an unscheduled conference call to discuss the collapse but did not agree any new measures to cut supplies. ""This is an unprecedented demand drop. Nobody in their lifetime has seen anything like this,"" said Peter McNally of Third Bridge Group. The collapse in physical demand for crude products like petrol and jet fuel has left storage hubs at capacity or, as one trader put it: ""They're close to the brim."" Storage at US oil hub Cushing has already grown to more than 15 million barrels in the past month - and is expected to soon be at capacity for the first time ever. ""Coronavirus is rewriting the rules of the global economy in front of our very eyes,"" said Adam Vettese, analyst at eToro. ""With oil demand virtually non-existent, this quite amazing sell-off is almost entirely down to fears over storage."" While the price of petrol is linked to the wholesale price of oil, it is driven by competition. That means that what motorists pay is not directly linked to crude. Instead, suppliers control the prices they sell petrol at. Crucially, a key factor affecting the price of fuel is that the biggest proportion of the money you hand over for a litre of petrol in the UK goes to the government in the form of tax. Fuel duty is charged at 57.95p per litre. On top of that, you have to pay VAT at 20% on the cost of petrol. Could this week's oil price turmoil see prices drift below Â£1 for the first time since the late 2000s? ""In theory, petrol prices could fall below Â£1 per litre if the lower wholesale costs were reflected at the pumps - but at the same time, people are driving very few miles, so they're selling vastly lower quantities of petrol and diesel at the moment,"" pointed out RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. This means many forecourts will be reluctant to trim their prices any further, he said. At the same time, he said, more price pressure on petrol could hit the viability of independent garages, which provided ""a vital service in areas where the supermarkets don't have a foothold"". ""It would be bad news all round if these forecourts shut up shop for good."" Since the end of March, the wholesale price of petrol has been around the 16p a litre mark, according to the AA. ""Add fuel duty at 57.95p a litre, a generous 9p a litre supplier/retailer margin, plus VAT and the average pump price of petrol would normally be around Â£1 a litre,"" said the AA's fuel spokesperson Luke Bosdet. Instead, the average pump price is higher because the retailers say they need to charge 10p a litre more to offset the lower volumes of fuel they are selling, he pointed out. Journey levels are at about 40% of normal during the working week, falling to 20% by Sunday. This meant those who were still driving were being ""overcharged on average by more than a fiver a tank"". ""I suspect that when the lockdown comes to an end, coronavirus is beaten and driving starts to return to normal, questions will be asked about the fairness of pump prices during the great oil crash of 2020.""

Dentists facing 'critical shortage of kit',"Dentists in England are facing ""critical shortages"" in personal protective equipment (PPE), forcing patients with urgent problems to ""take matters into their own hands"", says an organisation representing UK dentists. Over half (54%) of dentists in England say that PPE shortages are hampering efforts to treat patients at urgent dental care (UDC) hubs, according to a survey carried out by the British Dental Association (BDA). The BDA, which surveyed one thousand dentists, says a lack of PPE has meant some UDC hubs can't currently treat patients. It says a third of the sites in England remain inactive, compared with just 2% across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In response, the chief dental officer for England, Sara Hurley, says there are now 219 open hubs ""to provide care for those who need it"" and that ""every hub has the relevant PPE and work is ongoing to ensure that supply is maintained."" UDC hubs are designed to provide emergency dental treatment for patients with urgent needs, such as cracked teeth, gum infections and facial swelling. Patients requiring emergency treatment are meant to be referred to a UDC hub after a telephone consultation with their local dentist. Local practices were told to suspend routine face-to-face services on 25 March,externalin order to slow the spread of coronavirus and to set up local UDC hubs to treat patients with urgent needs. However, BDA Chair Mick Armstrong says progress has been too slow. ""Many dentists have been redeployed, only to find their hands tied by a critical shortage of kit, and delays in training and fit-testing. The depth of these problems will fatally undermine any progress on getting this network up and running,"" he says. One dentist, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC they had been redeployed to a UDC hub in the Midlands. However, they said their hub is currently unable to treat patients until a testing kit to be used on masks arrives. ""It's frustrating and disappointing when we know there is a significant need for urgent care because of a lack of training and PPE"", they said. ""The testing kits are shared across the region and they're being been taken up and down the motorway, and we're still waiting for it to arrive."" ""But as soon as we get the PPE, the hub will be up and running"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Another dentist, based in the south, said that while their hub was treating patients, they only had about 20 days' worth of FFP3 masks remaining. The FFP3 mask offers one of the highest grades of protection. The dentist said they would have to stop treating patients if they ran out of masks and replacement ones could not be sourced. Has the NHS got enough protective gear? Should we all be wearing masks now? The BDA's survey found that two thirds of dentists at sites in England are reporting shortages of FFP3 masks and gowns and that 58% of dentists say they do not feel fully protected at their sites. Dentists say PPE is necessary because they can be as close as 20cm from patients' mouths and are therefore at a high risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19. Dr Michael Ehrlich is a dentist based at a practice in Brighouse, West Yorkshire. He says he's been giving advice to patients over for the phone for the past three weeks. ""A broken tooth, a sharp bit of tooth, a lost crown, they are not urgent but they still cause discomfort. And then there are certain things that really need seeing and sorting out, but at the moment we have nowhere to send people"", he says. Billy Taylor pulled out his own tooth at home with the help of his 11-year-old son Aircraft fitter Billy Taylor, 33, from Axminster, Devon, told the BBC that he decided to pull out his own tooth after experiencing ""pretty bad"" pain over the Easter bank holiday weekend. ""I phoned my dentist. They said they're closed and will put me on an emergency waiting list, but they're not sure how long it would take to see me"", Mr Taylor said. ""The pain was absolutely excruciating so I thought I'd take it into my own hands"" Mr Taylor said the DIY extraction took an hour and a half. ""I didn't release how hard it would be to take out a molar tooth"". Dentists strongly advise against any patient doing their own dentistry. It is potentially dangerous for an untrained person with no anaesthetic or proper tools and risks significant damage to their mouth, broken teeth and serious infection. Kathryn Hey, 47, a teacher from Biddulph in Staffordshire woke up with a sudden sharp pain on 2 April. She says she has not been seen by a dentist, despite making two phone calls and is managing with painkillers ""My tooth ache is more manageable now so I'm waiting for the lockdown to end before contacting my dentist again"", she says. ""However, I still can't eat or drink on the side my tooth is, so it affects me every day."" In the first instance, patients are advised to call their local practice. If symptoms are serious, local dentists can prescribe medication over the phone (such as painkillers and antibiotics). In such cases, dentists can contact local pharmacies, which can then prepare medication for patients to pick up. If a patient has an urgent dental problem, then they should be referred to a UDC hub. Other emergency treatment may also be available. For example, some hospitals may offer emergency dental walk-ins. However, if a patient cannot reach their local dentist - or is not registered with one - then the advice is to usethe 111 online service.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' wants to plead guilty.

""Coronavirus is rewriting the rules of the global economy in front of our very eyes,"" said Adam Vettese, analyst at eToro. ""With oil demand virtually non-existent, this quite amazing sell-off is almost entirely down to fears over storage."" While the price of petrol is linked to the wholesale price of oil, it is driven by competition. That means that what motorists pay is not directly linked to crude. Instead, suppliers control the prices they sell petrol at. Crucially, a key factor affecting the price of fuel is that the biggest proportion of the money you hand over for a litre of petrol in the UK goes to the government in the form of tax. Fuel duty is charged at 57.95p per litre. On top of that, you have to pay VAT at 20% on the cost of petrol. Could this week's oil price turmoil see prices drift below Â£1 for the first time since the late 2000s? ""In theory, petrol prices could fall below Â£1 per litre if the lower wholesale costs were reflected at the pumps - but at the same time, people are driving very few miles, so they're selling vastly lower quantities of petrol and diesel at the moment,"" pointed out RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. This means many forecourts will be reluctant to trim their prices any further, he said. At the same time, he said, more price pressure on petrol could hit the viability of independent garages, which provided ""a vital service in areas where the supermarkets don't have a foothold"". ""It would be bad news all round if these forecourts shut up shop for good."" Since the end of March, the wholesale price of petrol has been around the 16p a litre mark, according to the AA. ""Add fuel duty at 57.95p a litre, a generous 9p a litre supplier/retailer margin, plus VAT and the average pump price of petrol would normally be around Â£1 a litre,"" said the AA's fuel spokesperson Luke Bosdet. Instead, the average pump price is higher because the retailers say they need to charge 10p a litre more to offset the lower volumes of fuel they are selling, he pointed out. Journey levels are at about 40% of normal during the working week, falling to 20% by Sunday. This meant those who were still driving were being ""overcharged on average by more than a fiver a tank"". ""I suspect that when the lockdown comes to an end, coronavirus is beaten and driving starts to return to normal, questions will be asked about the fairness of pump prices during the great oil crash of 2020.""

Coronavirus leads to record number of deaths,"Deaths in England and Wales have nearly doubled above what would be expected, hitting a 20-year high. The Office for National Statistics said there were 18,500 deaths in the week up to 10 April - about 8,000 more than is normal at this time of year. A third were linked to coronavirus, but deaths from other causes also increased, suggesting the lockdown may be having an indirect impact on health. But experts believe this period could well be when virus deaths peaked. They point to a separate analysis by NHS England which showed since 8 April the number of deaths in hospitals have been falling when you look at the date of death. The daily figures presented by government just show when hospital deaths are announced - there is often a delay in recording and reporting which masks when a drop in deaths starts happening. On Tuesday 823 new deaths were announced, but most of these happened in the previous days and weeks. Some even date back to March. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, of the University of Cambridge, said the NHS England figures suggested we were past the peak and in a ""steadily"" albeit slowly improving position. But he added: ""Judging from the experience in Italy, this could be a lengthy process."" Prof Carl Heneghan, from the University of Oxford, said he agreed, saying London, which saw rapid increases earlier than the rest of country, peaked even earlier, suggesting the steps taken before full lockdown had an impact. But England's deputy medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van Tam, said: ""We are not out of danger yet. We must keep pushing on this."" The figures presented by the ONS are different from those used by the government on a daily basis and the NHS England analysis. Those rely on hospital cases confirmed by tests, whereas the ONS has used death certificates which show both fatalities in hospital and in the community on a weekly basis. The figures show that the overall number of deaths topped 18,500. That is the highest since January 2000 when there was a bad flu outbreak. It is also much higher than the recent bad flu season of 2015. More than 6,200 of these deaths were linked to coronavirus and Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. One in six of these deaths happened outside hospital. But the ONS also said deaths from other causes rose too. Nick Stripe, head of health analysis at ONS, said they were trying to understand and find out why this was. He said it could be that people with other illnesses were avoiding going to hospital for treatment - visits to A&E have halved since the pandemic started - or an under-reporting of coronavirus. But he added it could ""take years to work out"". He also said it was important to remember the human toll in these figures. ""Each one is a person. Each one has a family. We must always remember this."" A similar trend is being reported in Scotland where there were nearly 2,000 deaths in the week up to 12 April. Deaths in Northern Ireland are also up. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area There has been growing concern about the impact of coronavirus outside of hospital. Care homes have begun reporting outbreaks among residents that have been difficult to control, they say, because of a lack of testing and protective equipment. The ONS - because it relies on death certificates rather than testing - can capture the scale of deaths. The majority of deaths happened in hospital, but since the start of the pandemic more than 1,000 have died in care homes. Another way to judge the impact of coronavirus is to look at the overall impact on the numbers dying over the course of the year so far. The figures show overall number of deaths are up. Nearly 185,000 people have died in 2020 compared with around 175,000 on average over the past five years at this point of the year. But the figures for 2020 also show the impact of flu and pneumonia compared to coronavirus. The number of deaths from flu and pneumonia - at more than 32,000 - is three times higher than the total number of coronavirus deaths this year. This difference will obviously narrow in the coming weeks as the flu season is coming to an end and there has been a rapid rise in coronavirus deaths. Some also believe the number of coronavirus deaths have been under-reported - a lack of testing outside hospital means it is down to doctors to use their clinical judgement to decide cause of death.

Is the NHS getting enough PPE?,"Personal protective equipment (PPE), like masks and gloves, helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives. With a new, more contagious variant of Covid circulating in the UK, doctors and nurses are calling formore kit that provides the highest protection. Anyone in close contact with patients should wear some form of protection. That includes staff in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. People giving vaccines will also use PPE. The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. Millions of high-grade NHS masks withdrawn over safety concerns Guidelines say all hospital staff,externalshould wear a face mask, while people visiting hospital or attending outpatient departments should wear a face covering. Face coverings, unlike surgical face masks,are not classed as PPE,externalas they are not usually made to a recognised standard and do not provide a proven level of protection for work. In hospitals, anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection. This includes disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. That would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. Ambulance staff driving the ambulance (if the cab is closed off from the patient compartment) do not need to wear any PPE. The rest of the crew should wear PPE appropriate to their likely risk of exposure. Pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask. Some staff in other higher-risk occupations likecleaners,,externalmortuary workers,externalandmembers of the prison service,externalmay need to use PPE and should follow guidelines. The NHS needs billions of items each month. There are about 1.6 million NHS staff in UK hospitals and the community, who need varying amounts of PPE. Ordering is done on a UK-wide level, but different parts of the NHS have different levels of stock. The government says 32 billion items, including masks, visors and gowns, have been bought. Almost three quarters of expected demand for PPE will be met by UK manufacturers, it says. Before coronavirus, in 2019, the NHS and social care sector in England received around 2.4 billion items of PPE. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 8.4 billion items have been delivered to the health and social care system inEngland. That includes body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent as well as masks, gowns and gloves. Abreakdown of PPE,externaldelivered in the week to 6 November 2020 included: 35.5 million masks 40 million aprons 1.1 million gowns 156 million gloves (supplied and counted individually rather than as pairs) Since March,more than 908 million items of PPE have been delivered,externalin the NHS inScotland. In the week to 30 December, this included: 1.9 million masks 2.3 million aprons 35,000 gowns 5.7 million gloves Since March, nearly630 million items of PPE,externalhave been delivered to the health and social care sectors inWales. In the week to 20 December, this included: 77,000 masks 2.6 million aprons 101,000 gowns 10 million gloves InNorthern Ireland,more than376.5 million items of PPE,externalwere sent between March and the end of January 2021. In the week to 27 November, this included: 1.3 million masks 1.2 million aprons 53,500 gowns 4.6 million gloves Some bits of kit can only be used once per patient. Others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. All PPE worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated. Aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. When there are shortages,guidelines say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so,external, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises ""some compromise"" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. TheRoyal College of Nursing,externaland theBritish Medical Association,externalsay PPE guidance should take a more precautions to stop airborne spreading. Both say members can refuse to treat patients as a ""last resort"" if there is not adequate PPE. UK anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before deciding whether to provide care. The government said it was monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and would update advice ""where necessary"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

'Enormous strain' on protective kit,"An ""enormous strain"" has been put on the system for obtaining protective kit for NHS staff and care workers, the education secretary has said. Some 400,000 gowns had been expected to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, but the government said it had been delayed. Gavin Williamson was asked by the BBC why British suppliers offering to make protective kit had not been contacted. He responded that government hoped to speak to them within the next 24 hours, and the gowns should arrive on Monday. ""I think we all recognise the enormous strain that has been placed on the whole system and we also recognise that right across the globe people are trying to get the same items of PPE from quite a limited number of suppliers,"" Mr Williamson said at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing. BBC Health editor Hugh Pym also asked why stocks had been allowed to run down over the last couple of years, and why more was not done to boost them in March and February. The education secretary said ""every resource of government"" had been deployed to expand supplies of PPE and ventilators. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries, meanwhile, said the UK remained an ""international exemplar"" of pandemic preparedness, adding there had been challenges but the government was ""always looking ahead"". 'Critical' to get protective kit to front line No date for when schools will reopen - Williamson Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement' The pledge to take delivery of more protective kit came after warnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gowns this weekend. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, described the delay as ""very concerning"". ""Healthcare workers desperately need proper and effective protection now - by whatever means possible,"" he said, adding: ""This really is a matter of life and death."" Public Health England changed its advice on Friday to allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"". It asked staff to reuse ""(washable) surgical gowns or coveralls or similar suitable clothing (for example, long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown or industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for AGPs (aerosol-generating procedures) and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown or coverall is removed"". The guidance also said hospitals could reserve the gowns for surgical operations and procedures which were likely to transmit respiratory pathogens. NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said for the guidance on the use of protective equipment to be properly followed, it was ""absolutely critical above everything else that we have the supplies of PPE going out to the front line"". But the Royal College of Nursing said the guidance was developed without a full consultation and the British Medical Association (BMA) - which represents doctors - said any change must be driven by science, not availability. The delay to the consignment is a real worry, both in the short and long-term. It is clear the pandemic stocks we have been largely relying on to date are running out, at least in terms of gowns and visors. It has left us depending on international supply - certainly for gowns - as we do not seem to be able to manufacture them ourselves. Given the international demand for them, this threatens to be an on-going issue that could cause problems for months to come. Staff are understandably worried - they are putting their lives at risk. Ministers and their officials are clearly working hard to do what they can. But in the future, serious questions will need to be asked about why this situation has arisen in the first place. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the UK had built up stocks of PPE in expectation of a flu pandemic - as well as to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit - but he said there was a ""worldwide pressure"" on supplies. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said ""serious mistakes have been made"" by the government in tackling the outbreak. He told Sky News: ""We know that our front-line NHS staff don't have the PPE, that they've been told this weekend that they won't necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe."" The government has appointed Lord Deighton, who headed the organising committee of the London Olympics, to resolve problems with supplies and distribution of PPE.

Virgin Australia collapses into administration,"Ticket revenue had dried up amid coronavirus travel bans Virgin Australia has confirmed it has entered voluntary administration - making it Australia's first big corporate casualty of the coronavirus pandemic. The country's second-largest carrier cut almost all flights last month following wide-spread travel bans. It was already struggling with a long-term A$5bn (Â£2.55bn; $3.17bn) debt. The airline is now seeking new buyers and investors, after failing to get a loan from Australia's government. Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah said: ""Our decision today is about securing the future of the Virgin Australia Group and emerging on the other side of the Covid-19 crisis. ""Australia needs a second airline and we are determined to keep flying."" Meanwhile, Sir Richard Branson - whose Virgin group is a part-owner of Virgin Australia - has offered a Caribbean island as collateral to help get a UK government bailout of Virgin Atlantic. Branson offers Caribbean island to secure bailout Shares had been suspended in the firm for the past fortnight as it struggled to find a survival plan. Canberra refused a request from the company for a A$1.4bn loan, but in the past month had announced around A$900m in support for all local airlines. Virgin Australia has turned just two statutory profits in the past decade. It is part-owned by a number of entities including the UAE government, Singapore Airlines, China's HNA, and Sir Richard Branson's Group. It employs about 10,000 people directly and another 6,000 through ancillary businesses.

Consumer groups and local politicians have voiced concerns that unless the airline is resurrected, national flag carrier Qantas will hold a near-monopoly in Australia. Air travel is crucial in the vast continent where distances between coastal capital cities make flights the only practical way to travel quickly domestically. Virgin Australia had previously held around 31% of domestic flights, while Qantas controlled around 58% of the market. The long-term loss of the airline will also be seen as a major blow to Australia's tourism industry - a big GDP driver. Before the shutdown, Virgin Australia had flown about 130 aircraft to 41 destinations - mainly domestic routes, but also international services including to New Zealand, Bali, Fiji, Tokyo and Los Angeles.

Restaurant bosses call for rent holiday,"Burger King has more than 500 UK restaurants The chief executive of Burger King UK has said the fast-food chain has not made its rent payments for April. Alasdair Murdochtold the BBC's Today programmethat he could not see the firm paying for some time to come. Burger King is one of several High Street restaurant chains to have asked the chancellor for a nine-month rent holiday during the coronavirus crisis. Without it, some two million hospitality jobs are at risk, warned bar owner Jonathan Downey. As well as Burger King, Mr Downey has persuaded bosses at other chains such as Wahaca and Nando's to back his plea. ""The idea is fairly simple and won't cost the taxpayer a thing,"" Mr Downey said. No-one in the industry ""expects to get back to anything like normal until mid-2021 at the earliest,"" he said. ""Without some extraordinary next measures we estimate that more than half of hospitality businesses and as many as two million jobs will not survive,"" he warned. Burger King has more than 500 UK restaurants and Mr Murdochwarned last month the chain would be withholding rent payments. He said: ""It looks very difficult for us to be saying that we're actually going to be paying next month's or even next quarter's rent, because we have no sales. ""And I think that's the same for a lot of people in the industry."" He added: ""I think the landlords are perfectly sympathetic, but there are also evidently ones who are reasonably threatening when they come back to us as well."" Under Mr Downey's idea - called the #NationalTimeOut - the next nine months' rent would be pushed back so that restaurants pay nothing until the first quarter of 2021. ""Leases are extended by nine months so that those payments aren't lost, just postponed to the back-end,"" said Mr Downey, who owns bars Milk & Honey and London Union in the capital. Landlords would be helped too, under the plan, ""with the same push back for them on the next nine months of their loan repayments"". The proposal includes other protections and support for landlords but the measure should only apply to businesses that have been forced to close by government order, said Mr Downey. ""It is now clear that hospitality businesses, having been the first and hardest hit by the virus, will now be the last allowed to reopen."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The letter to the chancellor has been signed by 14 other restaurant bosses and supported by trade associations such as UK Hospitality, the Music Venue Trust, the Night Time Industries Association and UK Active. ""Rents are a major issue for hospitality businesses - arguably the biggest threat at a time when most have no revenue,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality. ""We need to come up with a solution to this collectively, to ensure that hospitality businesses, who have already been battered, don't have to suffer more than their fair share."" The business bosses that have co-signed the plea come from Burger King, D&D, Dishoom, Gordon Ramsay Group, Gymbox, Harts Group, Hawksmoor, JKS Restaurants, Leon, Living Ventures, Nando's, The Breakfast Club, Tortilla, and Wahaca. ""While the existing measures being taken by the government go some way to offer a lifeline to our industry, it's crucial that support and protection is extended to landlords as well as tenants of commercial premises, in order to help ensure a return to normality in the hopefully not-too-distant future,"" said Mark Selby, chief executive of Wahaca. Some major landlords, like Canary Wharf Group, have also confirmed they support the plan. However, Melanie Leech, who runs landlords group the British Property Federation, said missing out on nine months' rent would be a significant loss for an industry that has a rent bill of Â£2.5bn each quarter. But Mr Downey said: ""It's a solution that allows businesses to work through the next nine months towards a bounce back and without the need for another government handout."" ""We have to find a way to make this work for everyone and, although this is early stages, it feels like an answer."" A government spokesperson said:  ""We've taken action at unprecedented speed to support businesses, jobs and our economy through these challenging times. This includes targeted support for the hospitality sector with business rates holidays and cash grants of up to Â£25,000 for eligible firms. ""Pubs and restaurants can also benefit from our other business support measures, including the coronavirus job retention scheme, VAT deferrals and protection from eviction for commercial tenants affected by coronavirus. ""We would encourage any business that is struggling to find out more about the support available to them on gov.uk/business-support.""

UK restricts olive tree imports to halt infection,"Oliver trees have become popular with gardeners in recent years Severe restrictions will be placed on imports of some very popular trees and plants in an effort to halt a deadly infection. Xylella fastidiosahas wreaked havoc on olive plantations in parts of Italy and has also been found in France and Spain. To prevent the disease spreading to the UK, imports of olive trees and lavender bushes will now be curtailed. There will also be restrictions on almond, rosemary and oleander shrubs. Olive tree killer still threatens EU Volunteers needed to spot bug's 'spittle' Saving the nation's seeds from extinction Xyllelais a bacterium that has caused significant damage to olive trees in Italy over the past seven years. Infected olive trees being torn out of the ground in Italy Spread by spittlebugs and other sap-sucking insects, the resulting disease has no treatment and it is said to have cut Italy's olive harvest to its lowest level in 25 years. Arecently published studysuggested that the infection could cause billions of euros in damages if it spreads further into olive-producing regions of Spain and Greece. ButXylellais not just a disease of olive trees. According to experts, some 560 species in 72 plant families can be affected by the infection. For the UK,Xylellaposes a threat to iconic species including oak, elm and plane trees. Lavender will be hit with tough new restrictions on imports To prevent the spread of the disease, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is now placing heavy restrictions on some species. Imports ofCoffea(coffee plants) andPolygala myrtifoliawill be banned completely, while much tougher requirements will be placed on other high-risk hosts including Olive, Almond, Oleander, Lavender and Rosemary. In a statement, Defra said that the introduction of the tougher measures in the middle of a health pandemic had been supported by their expert advisers. ""The changes have been identified as priorities for improving the UK's plant biosecurity, in response to known threats, thereby protecting UK business, society and the environment in the short term, as well as in the future. ""As such, we have concluded that it remains important to introduce these enhanced protections now, to deliver the benefits identified (for instance, maintaining the UK's pest status for the trees and plants concerned) despite the challenging circumstances we are all faced with at present, as a result of Covid-19."" Experts say the new limitations will have a substantial effect. Imports of Oleander will also be restricted ""They're quite stringent requirements and they will very much impact the trade flows of things like olive and lavender where huge quantities are moved around in the horticultural trade,"" said Dr Gerard Clover, from the John Innes Centre in Norwich, who is involved in the UK research initiative called BRIGIT, designed to monitor theXylellapathogen. Tens of thousands of olive trees are imported into the UK every year, while the numbers of lavender and rosemary plants are higher still. Some of those involved in the plant breeding industry say the restrictions will mean a ban in practice - with implications for gardeners. ""There is a new requirement for exporters supplying plants to the UK to show that the area 200 metres around their place of production has been free fromXylellafor at least one year, with official test results to prove it. This is impossible to comply with,"" said Graham Spencer from Plants for Europe, an independent plant breeders agent. ""Furthermore, it is not possible to switch to domestic British production. There is very little propagation of lavender and rosemary in the UK - nearly all growers rely on the international supply of unrooted cuttings, young plants or finished plants,"" he added. The horticultural industry is generally in favour of the move to restrict imports, recognising the threat posed byXylella. Rosemary is one of the plants facing new restrictions However, business owners are far more concerned with the immediate threat to their livelihoods from the coronavirus. If they aren't supported in that, they argue, then the government plans to controlXylellamight backfire. ""We have proposed to government a stock compensation scheme - highlighting the benefits of the Dutch grower compensation model - and the re-opening of garden centres to help British growers' businesses to survive,"" said James Clark, from the Horticultural Trades Association. ""Without this immediate financial assistance, we will be facing a significantly reduced British grower sector, resulting in the UK being more dependent on the import of plants and, with it, all the potential additional pests and disease risks this carries.""

"Dentists facing 'critical shortage of kit'Patients with urgent problems are having to ""take matters into their own hands"", a dental body says.","Dentists in England are facing ""critical shortages"" in personal protective equipment (PPE), forcing patients with urgent problems to ""take matters into their own hands"", says an organisation representing UK dentists. Over half (54%) of dentists in England say that PPE shortages are hampering efforts to treat patients at urgent dental care (UDC) hubs, according to a survey carried out by the British Dental Association (BDA). The BDA, which surveyed one thousand dentists, says a lack of PPE has meant some UDC hubs can't currently treat patients. It says a third of the sites in England remain inactive, compared with just 2% across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In response, the chief dental officer for England, Sara Hurley, says there are now 219 open hubs ""to provide care for those who need it"" and that ""every hub has the relevant PPE and work is ongoing to ensure that supply is maintained."" UDC hubs are designed to provide emergency dental treatment for patients with urgent needs, such as cracked teeth, gum infections and facial swelling. Patients requiring emergency treatment are meant to be referred to a UDC hub after a telephone consultation with their local dentist. Local practices were told to suspend routine face-to-face services on 25 March,externalin order to slow the spread of coronavirus and to set up local UDC hubs to treat patients with urgent needs. However, BDA Chair Mick Armstrong says progress has been too slow. ""Many dentists have been redeployed, only to find their hands tied by a critical shortage of kit, and delays in training and fit-testing. The depth of these problems will fatally undermine any progress on getting this network up and running,"" he says. One dentist, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC they had been redeployed to a UDC hub in the Midlands. However, they said their hub is currently unable to treat patients until a testing kit to be used on masks arrives. ""It's frustrating and disappointing when we know there is a significant need for urgent care because of a lack of training and PPE"", they said. ""The testing kits are shared across the region and they're being been taken up and down the motorway, and we're still waiting for it to arrive."" ""But as soon as we get the PPE, the hub will be up and running"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Another dentist, based in the south, said that while their hub was treating patients, they only had about 20 days' worth of FFP3 masks remaining. The FFP3 mask offers one of the highest grades of protection. The dentist said they would have to stop treating patients if they ran out of masks and replacement ones could not be sourced. Has the NHS got enough protective gear? Should we all be wearing masks now? The BDA's survey found that two thirds of dentists at sites in England are reporting shortages of FFP3 masks and gowns and that 58% of dentists say they do not feel fully protected at their sites. Dentists say PPE is necessary because they can be as close as 20cm from patients' mouths and are therefore at a high risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19. Dr Michael Ehrlich is a dentist based at a practice in Brighouse, West Yorkshire. He says he's been giving advice to patients over for the phone for the past three weeks. ""A broken tooth, a sharp bit of tooth, a lost crown, they are not urgent but they still cause discomfort. And then there are certain things that really need seeing and sorting out, but at the moment we have nowhere to send people"", he says. Billy Taylor pulled out his own tooth at home with the help of his 11-year-old son Aircraft fitter Billy Taylor, 33, from Axminster, Devon, told the BBC that he decided to pull out his own tooth after experiencing ""pretty bad"" pain over the Easter bank holiday weekend. ""I phoned my dentist. They said they're closed and will put me on an emergency waiting list, but they're not sure how long it would take to see me"", Mr Taylor said. ""The pain was absolutely excruciating so I thought I'd take it into my own hands"" Mr Taylor said the DIY extraction took an hour and a half. ""I didn't release how hard it would be to take out a molar tooth"". Dentists strongly advise against any patient doing their own dentistry. It is potentially dangerous for an untrained person with no anaesthetic or proper tools and risks significant damage to their mouth, broken teeth and serious infection. Kathryn Hey, 47, a teacher from Biddulph in Staffordshire woke up with a sudden sharp pain on 2 April. She says she has not been seen by a dentist, despite making two phone calls and is managing with painkillers ""My tooth ache is more manageable now so I'm waiting for the lockdown to end before contacting my dentist again"", she says. ""However, I still can't eat or drink on the side my tooth is, so it affects me every day."" In the first instance, patients are advised to call their local practice. If symptoms are serious, local dentists can prescribe medication over the phone (such as painkillers and antibiotics). In such cases, dentists can contact local pharmacies, which can then prepare medication for patients to pick up. If a patient has an urgent dental problem, then they should be referred to a UDC hub. Other emergency treatment may also be available. For example, some hospitals may offer emergency dental walk-ins. However, if a patient cannot reach their local dentist - or is not registered with one - then the advice is to usethe 111 online service.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' wants to plead guilty.

Branson offers Caribbean island to secure bailoutSir Richard Branson pledges Necker Island as collateral to help get a UK government bailout for Virgin Atlantic.Business,"Sir Richard moved to Necker Island 14 years ago Sir Richard Branson has pledged his luxury island resort as collateral to help get a UK government bailout of his stricken airline Virgin Atlantic. The billionaire Virgin Group boss saidin an open letter to staff,externalhe was not asking for a handout, but a commercial loan, believed to be Â£500m. The airline's survival was in doubt, and his Necker Island home in the Caribbean could be mortgaged, he said. It comes as Virgin Group's airline in Australia enters administration. Virgin Australia collapses into administration Both airlines have been hit hard by the global coronavirus lockdown, and Sir Richard has appealed to governments in both countries for help. However, he has been criticised for appealing for taxpayer aid rather than drawing on his huge wealth. Sir Richard's fortune is thought to be well over Â£4bn. The large US airline Delta owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic. Sir Richard said in his letter to staff: ""Many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it."" The crisis facing airlines, and the staff they employ, was ""unprecedented,"" he said. Despite his wealth, this did not mean he had ""cash in a bank account ready to withdraw"". And he hit back at criticism that he was a tax exile who did not deserve help, saying he and his wife ""did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island"". He said Necker would be offered as security for any loans. ""As with other Virgin assets, our team will raise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible around the group,"" Sir Richard said. Allow Twitter content?

In his letter to staff, Sir Richard said: ""We will do everything we can to keep the airline [Virgin Atlantic] going - but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for. ""This would be in the form of a commercial loan - it wouldn't be free money and the airline would pay it back (as EasyJet will do for the Â£600m loan the government recently gave them)."" He pointed out that Virgin Atlantic started with one plane 36 years ago, before adding: ""Over those years it has created real competition for British Airways, which must remain fierce for the benefit of our wonderful customers and the public at large."" Sir Richard offered to inject Â£250m into the Virgin Group last month, with most of that going to the airline. Earlier this month, Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Heathrow airport and Manchester Airports Group sent letters to the government highlighting the importance of Virgin Atlantic to the UK's manufacturing supply chain. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia - in which Sir Richard holds a stake of around 10% - is going into administration. The carrier has been forced to cancel nearly all of its flights during the coronavirus crisis and been unable to restructure its debts. The Australian government offered some support, but refused a request from the company for a A$1.4bn (Â£720m) loan. The airline is part-owned by Sir Richard along with Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA. ""The brilliant Virgin Australia team is fighting to survive and need support to get through this catastrophic global crisis,"" Sir Richard said. ""We are hopeful that Virgin Australia can emerge stronger than ever, as a more sustainable, financially viable airline."" He warned: ""If Virgin Australia disappears, Qantas would effectively have a monopoly of the Australian skies. We all know what that would lead to."" Sir Richard also addressed the fierce criticism he has faced in recent weeks over his tax situation. Critics have pointed out he has paid no UK income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago. Sir Richard is the 312th richest person in the world with an estimated $5.2bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. ""I've seen lots of comments about my net worth - but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw,"" he said. ""Over the years significant profits have never been taken out of the Virgin Group, instead they have been reinvested in building businesses that create value and opportunities."" Turning to the question of living abroad he said: ""Joan and I did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands (BVI) and in particular Necker Island, which I bought when I was 29 years old, as an uninhabited island on the edges of the BVI. ""Over time, we built our family home here. The rest of the island is run as a business, which employs 175 people."" Coronavirus: Who is still flying?

Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear?,"Personal protective equipment (PPE), like masks and gloves, helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives. With a new, more contagious variant of Covid circulating in the UK, doctors and nurses are calling formore kit that provides the highest protection. Anyone in close contact with patients should wear some form of protection. That includes staff in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. People giving vaccines will also use PPE. The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. Millions of high-grade NHS masks withdrawn over safety concerns Guidelines say all hospital staff,externalshould wear a face mask, while people visiting hospital or attending outpatient departments should wear a face covering. Face coverings, unlike surgical face masks,are not classed as PPE,externalas they are not usually made to a recognised standard and do not provide a proven level of protection for work. In hospitals, anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection. This includes disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. That would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. Ambulance staff driving the ambulance (if the cab is closed off from the patient compartment) do not need to wear any PPE. The rest of the crew should wear PPE appropriate to their likely risk of exposure. Pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask. Some staff in other higher-risk occupations likecleaners,,externalmortuary workers,externalandmembers of the prison service,externalmay need to use PPE and should follow guidelines. The NHS needs billions of items each month. There are about 1.6 million NHS staff in UK hospitals and the community, who need varying amounts of PPE. Ordering is done on a UK-wide level, but different parts of the NHS have different levels of stock. The government says 32 billion items, including masks, visors and gowns, have been bought. Almost three quarters of expected demand for PPE will be met by UK manufacturers, it says. Before coronavirus, in 2019, the NHS and social care sector in England received around 2.4 billion items of PPE. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 8.4 billion items have been delivered to the health and social care system inEngland. That includes body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent as well as masks, gowns and gloves. Abreakdown of PPE,externaldelivered in the week to 6 November 2020 included: 35.5 million masks 40 million aprons 1.1 million gowns 156 million gloves (supplied and counted individually rather than as pairs) Since March,more than 908 million items of PPE have been delivered,externalin the NHS inScotland. In the week to 30 December, this included: 1.9 million masks 2.3 million aprons 35,000 gowns 5.7 million gloves Since March, nearly630 million items of PPE,externalhave been delivered to the health and social care sectors inWales. In the week to 20 December, this included: 77,000 masks 2.6 million aprons 101,000 gowns 10 million gloves InNorthern Ireland,more than376.5 million items of PPE,externalwere sent between March and the end of January 2021. In the week to 27 November, this included: 1.3 million masks 1.2 million aprons 53,500 gowns 4.6 million gloves Some bits of kit can only be used once per patient. Others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. All PPE worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated. Aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. When there are shortages,guidelines say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so,external, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises ""some compromise"" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. TheRoyal College of Nursing,externaland theBritish Medical Association,externalsay PPE guidance should take a more precautions to stop airborne spreading. Both say members can refuse to treat patients as a ""last resort"" if there is not adequate PPE. UK anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before deciding whether to provide care.

Olive tree killer still threatens EU Volunteers needed to spot bug's 'spittle' Saving the nation's seeds from extinction Xyllelais a bacterium that has caused significant damage to olive trees in Italy over the past seven years. Infected olive trees being torn out of the ground in Italy Spread by spittlebugs and other sap-sucking insects, the resulting disease has no treatment and it is said to have cut Italy's olive harvest to its lowest level in 25 years. Arecently published studysuggested that the infection could cause billions of euros in damages if it spreads further into olive-producing regions of Spain and Greece. ButXylellais not just a disease of olive trees. According to experts, some 560 species in 72 plant families can be affected by the infection. For the UK,Xylellaposes a threat to iconic species including oak, elm and plane trees. Lavender will be hit with tough new restrictions on imports To prevent the spread of the disease, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is now placing heavy restrictions on some species. Imports ofCoffea(coffee plants) andPolygala myrtifoliawill be banned completely, while much tougher requirements will be placed on other high-risk hosts including Olive, Almond, Oleander, Lavender and Rosemary. In a statement, Defra said that the introduction of the tougher measures in the middle of a health pandemic had been supported by their expert advisers. ""The changes have been identified as priorities for improving the UK's plant biosecurity, in response to known threats, thereby protecting UK business, society and the environment in the short term, as well as in the future. ""As such, we have concluded that it remains important to introduce these enhanced protections now, to deliver the benefits identified (for instance, maintaining the UK's pest status for the trees and plants concerned) despite the challenging circumstances we are all faced with at present, as a result of Covid-19."" Experts say the new limitations will have a substantial effect. Imports of Oleander will also be restricted ""They're quite stringent requirements and they will very much impact the trade flows of things like olive and lavender where huge quantities are moved around in the horticultural trade,"" said Dr Gerard Clover, from the John Innes Centre in Norwich, who is involved in the UK research initiative called BRIGIT, designed to monitor theXylellapathogen. Tens of thousands of olive trees are imported into the UK every year, while the numbers of lavender and rosemary plants are higher still. Some of those involved in the plant breeding industry say the restrictions will mean a ban in practice - with implications for gardeners. ""There is a new requirement for exporters supplying plants to the UK to show that the area 200 metres around their place of production has been free fromXylellafor at least one year, with official test results to prove it. This is impossible to comply with,"" said Graham Spencer from Plants for Europe, an independent plant breeders agent. ""Furthermore, it is not possible to switch to domestic British production. There is very little propagation of lavender and rosemary in the UK - nearly all growers rely on the international supply of unrooted cuttings, young plants or finished plants,"" he added. The horticultural industry is generally in favour of the move to restrict imports, recognising the threat posed byXylella. Rosemary is one of the plants facing new restrictions However, business owners are far more concerned with the immediate threat to their livelihoods from the coronavirus. If they aren't supported in that, they argue, then the government plans to controlXylellamight backfire. ""We have proposed to government a stock compensation scheme - highlighting the benefits of the Dutch grower compensation model - and the re-opening of garden centres to help British growers' businesses to survive,"" said James Clark, from the Horticultural Trades Association. ""Without this immediate financial assistance, we will be facing a significantly reduced British grower sector, resulting in the UK being more dependent on the import of plants and, with it, all the potential additional pests and disease risks this carries.""

Virgin Australia collapses into administrationAustralia's second-largest carrier cut almost all flights last month amid virus travel bans.Australia,"Ticket revenue had dried up amid coronavirus travel bans Virgin Australia has confirmed it has entered voluntary administration - making it Australia's first big corporate casualty of the coronavirus pandemic. The country's second-largest carrier cut almost all flights last month following wide-spread travel bans. It was already struggling with a long-term A$5bn (Â£2.55bn; $3.17bn) debt. The airline is now seeking new buyers and investors, after failing to get a loan from Australia's government. Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah said: ""Our decision today is about securing the future of the Virgin Australia Group and emerging on the other side of the Covid-19 crisis. ""Australia needs a second airline and we are determined to keep flying."" Meanwhile, Sir Richard Branson - whose Virgin group is a part-owner of Virgin Australia - has offered a Caribbean island as collateral to help get a UK government bailout of Virgin Atlantic. Branson offers Caribbean island to secure bailout Shares had been suspended in the firm for the past fortnight as it struggled to find a survival plan. Canberra refused a request from the company for a A$1.4bn loan, but in the past month had announced around A$900m in support for all local airlines. Virgin Australia has turned just two statutory profits in the past decade. It is part-owned by a number of entities including the UAE government, Singapore Airlines, China's HNA, and Sir Richard Branson's Group. It employs about 10,000 people directly and another 6,000 through ancillary businesses. This video can not be played A Virgin Australia flight attendant says goodbye on a final international flight Consulting firm Deloitte announced it had appointed as administrator on Monday. It will try and restructure the firm's debt, pay off creditors and find a buyer - with private equity groups expected to be interested. Consumer groups and local politicians have voiced concerns that unless the airline is resurrected, national flag carrier Qantas will hold a near-monopoly in Australia. Air travel is crucial in the vast continent where distances between coastal capital cities make flights the only practical way to travel quickly domestically. Virgin Australia had previously held around 31% of domestic flights, while Qantas controlled around 58% of the market. The long-term loss of the airline will also be seen as a major blow to Australia's tourism industry - a big GDP driver. Before the shutdown, Virgin Australia had flown about 130 aircraft to 41 destinations - mainly domestic routes, but also international services including to New Zealand, Bali, Fiji, Tokyo and Los Angeles.

As it happened: Trump singles out governors for criticism,"President Donald Trump criticised the governors of Maryland and Illinois, saying they ""didn't understand"" testing The US state of Georgia became the latest to relax restrictions, announcing it will reopen restaurants on Friday For first time, Italy recorded one-day fall in number of people currently infected US oil prices collapsed to their lowest level in history, with futures turning negative A further 449 deaths in UK hospitals confirmed, bringing total to 16,509 Nine out of 10 UK coronavirus deaths are in hospital, says Public Health England official France passes 20,000 deaths but unlike in many countries the official toll includes nursing homes World Health Organization chief says nothing about the pandemic has been ""hidden"" from the US There are more than 2.4m infections worldwide, with more than 166,000 deaths Edited by Jude Sheerin Thanks for joining our live page today. We're pausing our coverage now until tomorrow - but before we go, here's a recap of some of the day's top stories. Today's coverage was brought to you by our reporters in Singapore, the UK, and Washington DC: Saira Asher, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Tessa Wong, Paulin Kola, Joel Gunter, Thom Poole, Rebecca Seales, Josh Cheetham, Georgina Rannard, Josh Nevett, Ashitha Nagesh, Steve Sutcliffe, Jonathan Jurejko, Ben
Collins, Martha Buckley, Matt Cannon, Lucy Webster, Max Matza, Helier Cheung, Ritu Prasad and Jude Sheerin. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington As with the furore over ventilators, so with the furore over testing. That was President Trumpâs theme today, first on his Twitter account and then at the White House briefing.""It used to be ventilators, ventilators, ventilators,"" he said. ""Now itâs testing, testing, testing.""Trump has accused the ""Do Nothing Democrats"" of playing a ""dangerous political game"" by insisting there is a shortage of tests for coronavirus.But governors from both parties have insistently called for more federal help in order to do the testing necessary before they can ease up on stay-at-home orders.Trump told us their demands for tests was overblown, just as it had been in the case of ventilators.""Nobody that needed a ventilator didnât get one,"" he said, declaring that the governors already had tremendous testing capacity in their states about which they didnât know: ""hundreds and hundreds of laboratories"" and thousands of pieces of equipment available at federal locations. The president brought up experts and officials to fill in the details for us and lay out the maps of where these supplies are located.But for him the bottom line was political. He claimed that ""they"" â presumably the Do Nothing Democrats â didnât ""catch him"" on ventilators and so thought theyâd ""get him"" on testing. Quoting an apocryphal story about US Founding Father George Washington confessing to chopping down a cherry tree as a boy, Trump tells the White House briefing room: ""I cannot tell a lie."" He made the comment as he called on a journalist whom he had earlier promised could ask a question. Moments later, Trump said: ""I haven't left the White House in months.â A PBS reporter said: âYou held a rally in March.â Trump shrugs: âDid I hold a rally? Iâm sorry, I held a rally!â Marianna BradyBBC News On 26 March, Chicago stopped for a moment of gratitude: People took to their balconies, porches and rooftops, cheering and ringing bells in the dark winter night. The applause was for the healthcare workers, first responders and service-industry employees on the frontlines of the pandemic who were risking their lives every day to save people from the virus wreaking havoc around the world. But for hospital cleaner Candice Martinez, the recognition of nurses and doctors has left her feeling empty. ""It's disappointing to me that us 'lower level employees' aren't getting any kind of recognition for what we are doing."" As an Environmental Services Worker at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Ms Martinez is responsible for cleaning the rooms while patients are in hospital or after they are discharged or moved. She is one of the thousands of essential employees in the city who still have to go to work despite the crisis. And one of the 12,571 cases of Covid-19 identified in Chicago. Read the full story here. Trump is asked why the governor of Maryland bought 500,000 testing kits from South Korea when the White House says the states have the ability to do all of the testing that they need. ""The governor of Maryland could have called Mike Pence. He could have saved a lot of money but that's OK,"" says Trump, pointing to a map of testing facilities in Maryland. ""I don't think he needed to go to South Korea. He needed to get a little knowledge,"" he adds. The White House has claimed that states have local laboratories that are capable of doing all the testing that they need. But states say that they are lacking the test kits themselves, rather than the labs in which to check them. Trump pledges to personally look into the case of a business owner who was denied a loan through coronavirus relief funds because of a criminal past. Fox News correspondent John Roberts tells the president he received an email from a man in the north-west who owns a supply business. He says he was refused a loan from the Small Business Administration because he has a non-violent felony from the past five years. As a result he has had to let go 50 employees, many of whom are former criminals trying to get back into society. Roberts queries why the businessman was denied a loan. Trump says: ""If you give me the name of the company and his name Iâll have that checked out, Iâll do that."" The president adds of small business funding, referring to his own company: ""I know I didn't get any."" Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter Oil prices turned negative on Monday as economies on coronavirus lockdowns around the world cause a historic drop in energy demand. The cost of the US oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, for a barrel to be delivered in May plunged to a price of roughly negative $37, as sellers took a loss rather than pay for storage costs. The price of oil for June was also down, though trading higher, at above $20 per barrel, while Brent crude â the other major benchmark - fell more than 7% to about $26 per barrel. The falls come as analysts expect oil demand to contract to levels last seen in 1995, as businesses around the world remain shut and many people remain at home. The International Monetary Fund has predicted the global economy could contract by 3% this year, as coronavirus restrictions bring activity to a halt. Last month, as the rules took hold in Europe and the US, business surveys showed record-setting declines in orders and output in many countries. For its part, the World Trade Organization has warned that global trade could fall by up to a third this year - more than double the 12.5% drop in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Even a recent deal among major oil producers to cut supply by record levels has failed to ease the glut. Since the start of the year, energy prices have fallen by more than 60%. Asked about the sub-zero oil prices, Trump says that short-sellers are to blame. ""Much of it has to do with short sellers. A lot of people got caught,"" says Trump. ""And there are a lot of people not too happy because they got caught.â He calls the record-low prices ""more of a financial thing than an oil situation"". It's ""largely a financial squeeze"", he adds. The current cost oil is negative $37 per barrel, Trump says, noting that he expects the price to jump back up soon. As well as Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina (which we told you about earlier), here's how some other states are planning to relax lockdown rules: Facebook has said it will remove pages and events involved in the organisation of protests that violate state laws on social distancing in the US during the pandemic. The company said it has already removed the promotion of anti-lockdown events in California, New Jersey and Nebraska after consultation with state governments. Protests against coronavirus lockdowns were held in states across the US on Sunday. Hundreds of protesters flouted social-distancing guidelines in defiance of restrictions intended to stem the spread of coronavirus and save lives. Similar events that âdefy governmentâs guidance on social distancing arenât allowed on Facebookâ, a spokesman said on Monday. Appearing on ABCâs Good Morning America on Monday, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was asked whether the organisation of anti-lockdown protests on the platform amounted to âharmful misinformationâ. âWe do classify that as harmful misinformation and we take that down,"" Zuckerberg said, adding that debates about policy would not be stifled. The removal of events has provoked a backlash from conservatives, among them Donald Trump Jr, who accused Facebook of quashing free speech. The US president has expressed support for the protests, suggesting âsome governors have gone too farâ in placing restrictions on life. Washingon state, once the US epicentre, saw one of the biggest protests this weekend Across the country, some groups of Americans are taking to the streets in protest of lockdown orders aimed at limiting the spread of Covid-19. The demonstrations come amid 782,159 confirmed Covid-19 cases nationwide and 41,816 deaths. Numbers are still rising, though infection rates appear to be slowing in some regions. But protesters in more than a dozen states say the stay-at-home measures imposed by state governments to control the spread of coronavirus are an overreaction. As one militia leader in Illinois put it to the BBC: ""Re-open my state or we will re-open it ourselves."" Protests have varied in size across the country - from a few dozen protesters in Virginia and Oregon to rallies of thousands in Michigan and Washington state. Read the full story here. Trump asks Army Corp of Engineer General Todd Semonite to provide an update on the southern US border wall. Semonite had been speaking about the military's effort to build field hospitals at population centres around the US when Trump asked ""how about the wall?"" He then asked the general to speak on ""the quality of that wall in terms of its power for stopping people that shouldn't be coming into our country"". Trump has claimed the wall will help prevent infections from entering the US - however, health experts have pointed out that there are already outbreaks occurring in every state. Many of the initial coronavirus cases in the US were linked to people travelling from China or Europe. Construction of the wall has continued during the pandemic - but local residents in border towns in Arizona have said they fear the influx of construction workers could spread the virus. In response to Trump, Semonite said ""construction is going very, very smooth"", adding that 164 miles have been built as of today. As he leaves the briefing, he adds: ""I have a lot of building to do."" Trump says New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is going to visit him in the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon, and that he'll be joined by ""some of his people"". ""We look forward to that,"" the president adds. Cuomo and Trump have previously gone back and forth over each other's responses to the outbreak. During Cuomo's briefing a few days ago, Trump tweeted: ""Stop talking!"" President Trump now turns to the price of oil, which turned negative for the first time in history on Monday - meaning that oil producers are paying buyers to take the commodity off their hands, over fears that storage capacity could run out. The price of oil, Trump says, is âat a level thatâs very interesting to a lot of peopleâ. Trump says that, with the price plummeting, the US would seek to fill up its petroleum reserves. âWeâre filling up our national petroleum reserves, the strategic reserves. Weâre looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves. That would top it out,â he says. He expressed confidence that his administration can ""get it for the right price"". Demand for oil has dried up as lockdowns across the world have kept people inside. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell as low as minus $37.63 a barrel. Trump says governors ""just don't understand"" how to carry out testing. It comes as governors complain that the federal government has not helped states get testing supplies from overseas. Trump says the Republican governor of Maryland Mike Hogan, and the Democratic governor of Illinois JB Pritzker, ""didnât understand too much what was going on"" with testing. He says Vice-President Mike Pence spoke on the phone with governors today to tell him about their ""tremendous capacity"" to do tests at local labs. Both governors have been critical of the federal response, and earlier today, Hogan attacked Trump for claiming that states had the testing capacity they needed in order to reopen. ""To try to push this off and say the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing - that somehow we arenât doing our job, is just absolutely false,"" Hogan told MSNBC. On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the governmentâs top infectious disease expert, told AP news that the US did not yet have an adequate testing and tracing procedure in place to reopen the economy. President Donald Trump's daily briefing is starting now. He is joined by members of the coronavirus task force including senior co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx, and Vice-President Mike Pence.  Georgia's governor has announced that restaurants, hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and some movie theaters will be allowed to reopen on Friday. It comes as the governor of Tennessee says that by 1 May the ""vast majority of businesses"" will be allowed to reopen. Meanwhile, the South Carolina governor has allowed residents to return to previously closed beaches starting on Tuesday. Non-essential retail businesses will also be allowed to reopen, as long as they can adhere to social distancing guidelines. The White House coronavirus task force briefing is due to begin imminently. It comes as anti-lockdown protests spread in the US, and Facebook bans anti-quarantine demonstrators from using the website to organise in-person gatherings. President Donald Trump also continues to be criticised by state governors for not doing enough to help provide testing equipment. On Monday, a governor from Trump's own Republican party said his Korean-speaking wife had arranged a sale of 500,000 test kits from a company in South Korea. The 2020 event would have marked the 50th anniversary of the NYC Pride March No events will be granted a permit in New York City in the month of June, meaning the 50th anniversary Pride parade is cancelled, as is the Puerto Rican Day Parade, celebrating its 63rd anniversary. The announcement was made by Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference earlier on Monday. De Blasio has heavily criticised the federal governmentâs handling of the outbreak in New York - the epicentre within the US. ""The absence of testing from day one never allowed us to fight this war the right way,"" he told MSNBC. ""If we had had testing in the beginning, we could have done a very intensive containment strategy."" We reported earlier that US oil prices have dropped into negative values for the first time in history. In this graph, you can see just how dramatic the price crash was. In practice, the negative dip means producers have resorted to paying buyers to take oil off their hands, as rapidly decreasing demand has led many producers to fear they'll run out of storage space by May. You can read more about how it happened, and what it means, in our reporthere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
