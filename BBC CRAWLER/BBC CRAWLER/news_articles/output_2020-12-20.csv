Starmer promises to shift power from Westminster,"Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""under no illusion about the scale of the task Labour faces"" in Scotland Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has committed his party to delivering the ""boldest devolution project in a generation"" in a policy speech. He is to set up a constitutional commission to offer a ""positive alternative to the Scottish people"". Sir Keir said leaders had a ""shared duty"" to ""rebuild together"" across the UK in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has argued that independence is ""essential"" to rebuilding Scotland post-pandemic. The SNP have dismissed the plans as ""constitutional tinkering"" while the Scottish Conservatives said Labour were offering nothing new to challenge the SNP's dominance of Scottish politics. Is Scotland moving towards independence? Why are more Scots backing independence? Sir Keir used his speech on Monday - delivered online due to physical distancing - to confirm the setting up of a UK-wide constitutional commission, advised by former prime minister Gordon Brown, to deliver a ""fresh and tangible offer"" to the Scottish people. He said the pandemic had put ""rocket boosters"" under the case for decentralisation of power, saying his party must ""grasp the nettle and offer real devolution of power and resources"" if it is to have any hope of preserving the future of the union. He said: ""It is Labour's duty to offer a positive alternative to the Scottish people. To show that you don't have to choose between a broken status quo and the uncertainty and divisiveness of separatism. ""Boris Johnson isn't Britain, just as Nicola Sturgeon isn't Scotland. ""The United Kingdom is much more than that, more than any individual. It has been before - and can be again - a great force for social justice, for security and for solidarity."" The independence campaign has regained momentum in the polls following defeat in 2014 With polls suggesting support for independence is on the rise, Sir Keir argued that the shared ""history, values and identity"" of the people of the UK mean there should be no place for internal borders. He said Labour's offering must be ""every bit as bold and radical"" as the devolution delivered in the 1990s, saying the constitutional commission would target ""real and lasting political and economic devolution"" to local communities in all parts of the UK. Sir Keir said this was about more than shifting powers from one parliament to another or transferring ""a few jobs out of London"", adding: ""There's a yearning across the United Kingdom for politics and power to be much closer to people."" The project  is to start with a listening exercise, with the party looking to ""hear from as many people as possible across the UK"". The UK leader said he was ""under no illusion about the scale of the task Labour faces"" ahead of May's Scottish Parliament election, with Scottish Labour having been in opposition at Holyrood since 2007. The party has also struggled in other elections north of the border, being reduced to a single Westminster seat in 2019 and finishing fifth in that year's European Parliament elections. The MP said Labour would argue ""passionately"" against a new independence referendum saying it was ""entirely the wrong priority"" to hold a new vote in the teeth of a recession and ""when there is such uncertainty about how Brexit and coronavirus will affect us"" He attacked the SNP's record in power, saying: ""It's no wonder that Nicola Sturgeon wants to make May's election a referendum on another referendum, because on education, health and social justice the SNP have no story to tell."" The next Holyrood election is due in May 2021, with Labour currently the parliament's third party The SNP's deputy Westminster leader Kirsten Oswald dismissed Labour's plans, saying the system was ""broken"" and ""not working for Scotland"". ""No amount of constitutional tinkering of the kind proposed by Labour will protect Scotland from Brexit or the Tory power grab being imposed upon us against our will,"" she said. She said that even Labour supporters doubted their ability to oust the Conservatives from Westminster for another decade at least. The MP added: ""It's clear that only with the full powers of independence will we be able to properly protect our interests and secure our place in Europe - and that decision lies solely with the people of Scotland, not an out-of-touch Westminster system."" The Scottish Conservatives insisted they were the only party capable of taking on the SNP and championing the union. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said: ""This isn't leadership from Labour on the union, this is the same old tired argument that they've made before and they're offering nothing to challenge the SNP. ""Scottish Labour won't work with unionist parties to stop the nationalists, and they won't stand up to Nicola Sturgeon's demand for another independence referendum as early as next year. ""Only the Scottish Conservatives have the strength to take on the SNP right across Scotland and the determination to stop their push for indyref2 again."" The Scottish Liberal Democrats, however, said they are willing to work with Labour on a ""third way"" forward. Leader Willie Rennie said: ""Liberal Democrats support a new federalist settlement that means we can find a better way to agree a common future across the United Kingdom."" By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent Devolution is pretty straightforward when national and devolved leaders agree. When they don't, it becomes a lot harder. Nowhere has that been more obvious than in Scotland - and his speech was Sir Keir's first major foray into the independence debate. For years, many believe Labour in Scotland has been in a constitutional no man's land; stuck between the pro-independence SNP and the strongly unionist Conservatives. Labour has flirted with different positions - and has taken a hammering at the polls as a result. Today's speech was intended to give more clarity on exactly where Sir Keir stands ahead of May's Holyrood election. He has adopted a similar position to the UK government on calls for another independence vote; not now, but not quite ruling it out forever. Labour is open to more powers for Holyrood, presents itself as the party which introduced devolution in the first place, and will oppose what it sees as attacks on devolution from the current UK government.

US reaches long awaited deal for Covid-19 aid,"Economic fallout from the pandemic has left many Americans reliant on food aid The US Congress has passed a long-awaited $900bn (Â£660bn) package of coronavirus pandemic aid after months of political wrangling. Senators approved the bill late on Monday, hours after it was passed by the House of Representatives. The aid includes direct payments for many Americans and support for businesses and unemployment programmes. The money is to accompany a bigger, $1.4tn spending bill to fund government operations over the next nine months. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the package into law quickly. President-elect Joe Biden welcomed the relief package but said Congress needed to get to work to support his Covid-19 relief plan in the new year. Allow Twitter content?

In the House, the bill passed by a vote of 359 to 53 and in the Senate it passed by 92-6. Many Covid-19 relief programmes were set to expire at the end of the month and about 12 million Americans were at risk of losing access to unemployment benefits. But some lawmakers said they felt blind-sided by being asked to vote on a mammoth bill without even having a chance to read it. At nearly 5,600 pages, the legislation was described by the Associated Press news agency as ""the longest bill in memory and probably ever"". The stimulus includes one-off $600 payments to most Americans, and will boost unemployment payments by $300 per week, extending expiration dates for the jobless programmes until the spring. It also contains more than $300bn in support for businesses, and money for vaccine distribution, schools and tenants facing eviction. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home The package includes an extension of an eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of this month, leaving tens of millions of Americans at risk of being thrown out of their homes. It contains $25bn in rental aid. The bill also has a provision to end surprise medical billing - where hospital patients get slapped with fees because they were treated by a doctor who was not covered by their health insurer. President Trump has championed calls to end these stealth fees, which are one of the most unpopular pitfalls of the US healthcare system. The deal was announced on Sunday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican. Speaking on Monday ahead of the vote, he said: ""None of us think this legislation is perfect, but a big bipartisan majority of us recognise the incredible amount of good it will do when we send it to the president's desk. The American people have waited long enough."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, said the package delivered ""urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates"". This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' Lawmakers said the bill would send $600 per adult or child for individuals earning up to $75,000 or married couples earning up to $150,000, with families earning more receiving less. The first cheques could arrive as soon as next week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. The payment is half the amount that Congress approved for direct payments during the first round of pandemic relief last spring. The bill does not include substantial aid to local governments, which had been a top priority for many Democrats. In exchange, Republicans agreed to accept a deal without legal protections for businesses from Covid-related lawsuits. Mr Schumer said the package would ""establish a floor, not a ceiling, for coronavirus relief in 2021"", and that Democrats would push for more aid after President-elect Joe Biden took office on 20 January. Congress had been expected to pass the bill by Friday, but negotiations continued through the weekend. The delays led to concerns over whether the government would shut down without a spending bill. Washington has been operating on temporary funding since October, the start of the federal government's financial year. Economic analysts welcomed the deal, but have warned that it is probably too small and arrives too late to avert a slowdown in the recovery. They have also expressed concerns that money devoted to the stimulus cheques - which some families are likely to save - takes away from other, more targeted programmes that might provide a more effective boost to the economy. ""Any Covid relief bill is better than no Covid relief bill, but the measures set to be passed by Congress... do not represent the most efficient use of the $900bn total cost,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. However, on social media, many said the cheque should have been larger, saying $600 per person wasn't large enough to help meaningfully. ""$600 will hopefully save some lives but we all know it's just barely scraping by,"" wrote one social media user in California. Allow Twitter content?

Some also noted that many pandemic relief schemes have been plagued by fraud or delays in spending the money. In March the US approved more than $2.4tn in economic relief, including one-off $1,200 stimulus payments, funds for businesses and money to boost weekly unemployment payments by $600. The package was credited with cushioning the economic hit of the pandemic, which cast more than 20 million Americans out of work this spring and drove the unemployment rate up to 14.7% in April. The US has regained about half of the jobs lost, but economists and businesses have been pushing Congress to approve further economic relief, as programmes expired and money ran out, prompting recovery to slow. Nearly eight million more Americans are now living in poverty. This year has seen the biggest single year increase since poverty tracking began 60 years ago.

"'We organised our wedding in two hours to beat tier 4'Chloe and Jamie Collins say it was ""a miracle"" they reorganised the wedding at such short notice.","""I've never in my life felt so much love and felt so grateful,"" Chloe Collins said A couple rearranged their wedding in just two hours to ensure they tied the knot before London went into tier four. Chloe Collins, 31, and Jamie Collins, 29, were due to marry on 6 September, but had reorganised three times due to changing coronavirus restrictions. Mrs Collins said ""our hearts sank"" when Boris Johnson announced on Saturday anew tier-four lockdown across south-east Englandwould start on Sunday. The couple were married at 22:00 GMT on Saturday at Edgware United Synagogue. ""I've never in my life felt so much love and felt so grateful,"" Mrs Collins, a lettings negotiator, said. The couple were allowed 15 guests but ""over 100 people logged on to Zoom to watch us"". ""We felt the love, and it felt like they were there,"" Mrs Collins said. The couple were married at Edgware United Synagogue Estate agent Mr Collins said their wedding had been planned with 130 guests at a country estate-turned-hotel in Watford. When coronavirus restrictions meant only 15 guests could attend weddings, the couple moved venue and planned for a wedding on 22 November. They then rearranged for 20 December, after a four week-England wide lockdown came into force through November. Mrs Collins said she ""felt physically sick"" as the prime minister announced new tier four restrictions on Saturday afternoon. ""Our rabbi had the idea to bring the wedding forward,"" Mr Collins said. ""We just started calling people to see what we could do, and the more calls we made the more people said 'yes'. ""It was a miracle that it just kind of came together. It felt like a dream. Some people take years to plan a wedding, but we did it in two hours."" Mr Collins's best man drove more than two hours to attend the wedding, before ""getting back in his car and driving home"", the couple said. Under tier four guidelines, weddings and civil partnerships are only allowed under ""exceptional circumstances"", such as if one partner is seriously ill and not expected to recover. Since the wedding, the couple, from Watford, have been inundated with messages. ""I've been welling up with messages from people who aren't my close friends saying it was amazing,"" Mrs Collins said.

No trade deal unless 'substantial EU shift' - UK,"The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it was ""the moment of truth"" for the talks There will be no post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and EU unless there is a ""substantial shift"" from Brussels in the coming days, a government source has told the BBC. It is understood there is likely to be a decision before Christmas on whether or not a deal can be reached. The two sides have been in negotiations about how many years it will take to phase in new fisheries arrangements. The EU's Michel Barnier said any deal must be ""balanced and reciprocal"". The talks are expected to continue on Monday, a UK government source has said. Writing on Twitter on Sunday,external, Mr Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said the talks were at a ""crucial moment"" and the two sides were working ""hard"" to try to narrow their differences. ""We respect the sovereignty of the UK and we expect the same. Both the EU and Britain must have the right to set their own laws and control their own waters. And we should both be able to act when our interests are at stake."" Whitehall sources say it is increasingly likely the UK will end its post-Brexit transition period without a free trade agreement with the EU, meaning that on 1 January the two sides will rely on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to govern exports and imports. This could see tariffs introduced on goods being sold and bought - which may lead to increased prices for certain products. A government source told the BBC the EU was ""still struggling to get the flexibility needed from member states"" to make a deal possible. ""We need to get any deal right and based on terms which respect what the British people voted for. ""We're continuing to try every possible path to an agreement, but without a substantial shift from the [European] Commission we will be leaving on WTO terms on 31 December."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said an agreement was in both sides' interests ""given all the problems that are going on on the continent as well as here"" with Covid, but the EU needed to give ground. ""I hope the EU moves on its unreasonable demands, that I don't think anybody could reasonably accept, and then we can get a trade deal,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""But we are ready, whatever's necessary."" Brexit: Can the talks be extended? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to keep talking, but warned gaps had yet to be bridged. Senior MEPs in the European Parliament have said they will not be ""rushed"" into signing off a deal on their side and want to see the text of any agreement by Sunday if they are to approve it by the end of the year. A senior EU source told the BBC's Brussels correspondent Nick Beake: ""The Member States are the EU. And as a former member state, the UK knows well that the EU negotiator is there to protect the interest of Europeans. ""We believe it is in both sides' interest to reach a fair deal, which cannot be the case without a level playing field and sustainable arrangements for fisheries."" This video can not be played Michel Barnier says negotiations have ""just a few hours"" The two sides have been at odds over the length of time it will take to introduce new arrangements once the UK leaves the bloc's Common Fisheries Policy. The UK, led by its chief negotiator, David Frost, has insisted its sovereign rights over its waters must be respected from day one and its fleets must be able to keep a much larger share of their own catch. The EU is insisting on a much longer transition period, with guarantees on access and how catches are distributed. The two sides are reported to have made progress in recent days on the issues of fair competition and what to do if the UK is deemed to get an unfair competitive advantage by moving away from EU rules and standards. What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? If a deal is reached between the two sides, it would need to be agreed by parliaments in the UK and the European Union's member states. UK MPs have now finished for the Christmas break, but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said on Thursday that they could be called back to ratify a deal in the coming days, were one to be agreed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit?

Friday Night Dinner star Rosalind Knight dies at 87,"Rosalind Knight also played Beryl Merit in BBC sitcom Gimme Gimme Gimme Actress Rosalind Knight - whose credits include early Carry on films and Channel 4's Friday Night Dinner - has died aged 87, her family has said. The TV, film and theatre actress appeared in Carry On Teacher and Carry On Nurse in the 1950s. More recently, she played the character known as ""Horrible Grandma"" in Channel 4 comedy show Friday Night Dinner. In a statement, her family said the ""well-loved"" actress who had a ""glorious career"" died on Saturday. Her other screen credits include 1957's Blue Murder At St Trinian's, where she played a schoolgirl and a teacher in The Wildcats Of St Trinian's in 1980. She also starred as retired prostitute Beryl in BBC sitcom Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, which ran from 1999 to 2001, with Kathy Burke and James Dreyfus. Knight's family said in their statement: ""She was known to so many generations, for so many different roles, and will be missed as much by the kids today who howl at Horrible Grandma in Friday Night Dinner as by those of us who are old enough to remember her in the very first Carry On films."" Her daughters, theatre director Marianne Elliott and actress Susannah Elliott, said she would be remembered for her ""immense spirit and sense of fun, and her utter individuality"".

US cyber-attack 'genuinely impacted' 50 firms,"Hackers accessed major organisations by compromising software developed by Texas IT firm SolarWinds The cyber-security firm that identified the large-scale hacking of US government agencies says it ""genuinely impacted"" around 50 organisations. Kevin Mandia, CEO of FireEye, said that while some 18,000 organisations had the malicious code in their networks, it was the 50 who suffered major breaches. The US Treasury and departments of homeland security, state and defence are known to have been targeted. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Russia for the hack. So too have the chairs of the Senate and House of Representatives' intelligence committees. However, President Trump cast doubt on Russia's role in two tweets on Saturday, hinting instead at Chinese involvement. Five Russian hacks that transformed US cyber-security SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack is so serious Hacking the heart of the US government Mr Mandia told CBS News that the cyber attack ""was very consistent"" with what US officials know about the work of Russia's foreign intelligence agency, the SVR. ""I think these are folks that we've responded to in the '90s, in the early 2000s. It's a continuing game in cyberspace,"" he said. He said the attack on the Texas-based SolarWinds Orion, the computer network tool at the source of the breach, had the ""earliest evidences of being designed"". It started with a ""dry run"" in October 2019 when ""innocuous code"" was changed. ""Then sometime in March, the operators behind this attack did put malicious code into the supply chain,"" he said, ""injected it in there and that is the backdoor that impacted everybody"". Despite Russia's denials of the ""baseless"" claims, many in the US intelligence community suspect the Russian government is responsible. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Pompeo said on Friday: ""We can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity."" He said that Russia was trying to ""undermine our way of life"", and that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""remains a real risk"". Mr Pompeo has taken a strong line against Russia before. In his time as secretary of state, theUS has pulled out of a key nuclear treatyandthe Open Skies Treaty on aerial surveillance flights. The Republican Chair of the Senate intelligence committee, Marco Rubio, tweeted that it is ""increasingly clear that Russian intelligence conducted the gravest cyber intrusion in our history"". He said the response ""must be proportional but significant"". Adam Schiff, Democrat chair of the House intelligence committee, echoed these views, saying on Sunday: ""I don't think there's any question that it was Russia"". And he took a swipe at President Trump for his comments on the issue saying they were ""just uniformly destructive and deceitful, and injurious ... to our national security."" The president has long been ambivalent towards Moscow, downplaying such incidents asallegations that Russia offered the Taliban bounties to kill US troops. In his tweets on Saturday, Mr Trump again turned on what he labels the ""fake news media"" for exaggerating the matter. He wrote: ""The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. ""I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!)."" President-elect Joe Biden, who is due to be sworn in on 20 January, has vowed to make cyber-security a ""top priority"" of his administration. ""We need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber-attacks in the first place,"" he said on Thursday. ""We will do that by, among other things, imposing substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks, including in co-ordination with our allies and partners."" Hackers managed to gain access to major organisations by compromising network management software developed by the Texas-based IT company SolarWinds. The access could have allowed the hackers to take a high degree of control over the networks of organisations using that software, but appears to have been used to steal data rather than for any disruptive or destructive impact. The US government agencies hacked It is thought they targeted a narrow number of organisationsin an attempt to steal national security, defence and other related information. However, while software may have been downloaded, that does not necessarily mean data was taken. SolarWinds Orion earlier said that 18,000 of its 300,000 customers might have been affected, but there is no indication that significant theft of customer or citizen data was an aim of the cyber-attack. Researchers, who have named the hack Sunburst, say it could take years to fully comprehend it. For more than three decades,hackers linked to Moscow are believed to have tried to steal US secrets online. Several other organisations around the world, including in the UK, are understood to have been targeted by hackers using the same network management software. Why US spy world is feeling so uneasy right now US cyber-security firm hit by 'state-sponsored' attack This video can not be played Experts have been warning for years that it's not a matter of if, but when, hackers will kill somebody US energy department caught up in giant cyber-hack More US government agencies hacked US Treasury and commerce department hacked UK assessing impact of major hacking campaign At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Tui cancels flights out of Luton Airport,"Travel company Tui said it has cancelled flights out of Luton Airport because it falls under the new tier four Covid restrictions. Tui flights from the London airport are cancelled between 20 and 30 December. It said: ""We will be in direct contact with these customers to offer them a full refund or the option to amend their booking.""

A company spokesperson said: ""Any customers that live in tier four and are due to depart in the next 14 days will be entitled to cancel and receive a full refund or amend for free to any holiday that's currently on sale."" Luton, Heathrow and London City airports are all located in areas of England facing the toughest restrictions under measures aimed at stopping the spread of a new coronavirus variant. A number of European countries are banning or considering stopping flights from the UK following the emergence of a new variant of the virus. Italy has joined the Netherlands and Belgium in suspending flights to the UK, and other nations are considering the move. Trains to Belgium have also been banned. What is tier 4 and who is in it? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Belgium and Netherlands ban flights from UK over variant The government is recommending,externalthat people living in tier four regions should not travel abroad unless for legally permitted reasons such as for work.

Nations impose UK travel bans over new variant,"Gatwick Airport on Sunday, as European nations began imposing travel bans European nations have begun to impose travel bans on the UK after it reported a more-infectious and ""out of control"" coronavirus variant. Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium are all halting flights. The measures vary and are initially short-term but the French rules also affect Channel freight. An EU meeting on Monday morning will discuss a more co-ordinated response. The new variant has spread quickly in London and south-east England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday introduced a new tier four level of restrictions for those areas, scrapping a planned relaxation of rules over the Christmas period for millions of people. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Londoners who crowded on to trains ""totally irresponsible"" Top health officials said that there was no evidence the new variant was more deadly, or would react differently to vaccines, but it was proving to be up to 70% more transmissible. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the new strain ""was out of control. We have got to get it under control"", admitting that this was ""an incredibly difficult end to frankly an awful year"". Within hours of the UK announcement on Saturday,the Netherlandssaid it would ban all passenger flights from the UK until 1 January. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? What is tier four and who is in it? Later on Sunday it said it would also bar ferry passengers arriving from the UK, although freight would continue. The country on Sunday reported a daily increase of more than 13,000 cases - a new record, despite tough lockdown measures being applied on 14 December. As Sunday wore on, major new restrictions were imposed by key European nations. There are already huge lorry queues to enter Dover port in Kent because of Christmas stockpiling and Brexit concerns Francesuspended all travel links, including freight lorries, with the UK for 48 hours from midnight on Sunday (23:00 GMT). Thousands of lorries move between the countries every day. In response to France's ban,Eurotunnelsaid it would suspend access to its Folkestone terminal from 22:00 GMT for traffic heading to Calais. People booked to travel on Monday can get a refund. Trains will still run from Calais to Folkestone. The ferry terminal at Dover is now closed for all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further noticebecause of the French restrictions. The freight issue has become so pressing that Mr Johnson will chair a COBRA emergency response meeting on the matter on Monday. InIreland, which has significant passenger traffic with the UK at this time of year, the government announced that flights arriving from England, Wales and Scotland would be banned for 48 hours at least from midnight, and ""in the interests of public health, people in Britain, regardless of nationality, should not travel to Ireland, by air or sea"". Ferry crossings for freight would continue. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? InGermany, an order from the ministry of transport said planes from the UK would not be allowed to land after midnight on Sunday, although cargo would be an exception. Health Minister Jens Spahn said the UK variant had not yet been detected in Germany. What are the Covid symptoms and how do I protect myself? Belgiumsuspended flights and train arrivals from the UK from midnight on Sunday for at least 24 hours as a ""precautionary measure"". Italyis blocking all flights from the UK until 6 January. The first case of the UK variant has also been detected in Italy, the health ministry reported on Sunday. The patient is in isolation in Rome. Austriais to ban flights from the UK.Bulgariahas suspended flights to and from the UK from midnight but, unlike the short-term measures in many other nations, its ban lasts until 31 January. Turkeyhas temporarily banned all flights from the UK as hasSwitzerland. A European Council meeting will be held at 10:00 GMT on Monday on co-ordinating EU actions. The new variant was first detected in September. In November it made up around a quarter of cases in London. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London. This variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is it emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. There is no evidence yet to suggest the variant makes the infection more deadly, and at least for now the developed vaccines will almost certainly work against it. However, if the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine, then ""vaccine escape"" happens, and this may be the most concerning element.

Cases rise as Christmas rules come into force,"Oxford Street, in central London, was virtually deserted on Sunday Coronavirus cases in the UK have risen by 35,928 - nearly double the number recorded last Sunday,figures show,external. Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle said the ""sharp"" rise in cases was of ""serious concern"". It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that a new variant of the virus was ""getting out of control"". Christmas plans have been scrapped or restricted for millionsacross the UK amid warnings the variant is up to 70% more transmissible than previous types. The number of new UK infections on Sunday is an all-time high for recorded cases and nearly double the 18,447 cases reported a week ago. However, it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in the spring, with testing capacity too limited at the time to detect the true number of daily cases. Prof Doyle said most of the new cases in England were concentrated in London and the South East, although it was too early to say if this was linked to the new variant. What is tier four and who is in it? What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live The government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) estimates the variant could increase the R number by between 0.4 and 0.9,minutes released on Sunday show.,external The R number is how many other people one person will infect on average; an epidemic is growing if it rises above 1. A growing number of countries have banned travel from the UKas a result of this variant, including  Ireland, France, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. Eurotunnel is suspending access to its Folkestone terminal from 22:00 GMT for traffic and freight heading to Calais due to the 48-hour travel ban introduced by France. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Hancock said the news about the new variant ""has been an incredibly difficult end to frankly an awful year"". He said: ""Of course we don't want to cancel Christmas... we don't want to take any of these measures, but it's our duty to take them when the evidence is clear."" Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, told Andrew Marr there was evidence that people with the new strain had ""higher viral loads"", which meant they were more infectious. Wales locks down as Christmas plans cut What is tier four and who is in it? Should you see your family at Christmas? 'I won't have next summer let alone next Christmas' Some 21 million people in England and Wales who entered new restrictions at midnight are being told to stay at home, while non-essential shops and businesses have to close. Those living under the newly-created tier four restrictions in England will now be unable to mix with other households indoors at Christmas, unless they are part of their existing support bubble. The health secretary said it was not clear how long the tier four measures would be in place, but it could be for months, ""until we can get the vaccine going"". He added that people in tier four should act as if they may have the virus. This video can not be played Starmer: Boris Johnson ""has once again been caught behind the curve"" In the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, relaxed indoor mixing rules will only apply on Christmas Day. Covid rules had been relaxed across the UK to allow up to three households to mix indoors for five days over the Christmas period. A ban on travel between Scotland and the rest of the UK will also apply over the festive period. Police Scotland saidit would be doubling its patrols on the borders but it would not be introducing check points. Mainland Scotland is being placedunder the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. Wales has also entered a new shutdown, with the health minister sayingthe new variant was ""seeded"" in every part of the country. In Northern Ireland, where the planned relaxation of rules for Christmas is going ahead unchanged,four of the five main parties have called for an urgent meeting to discuss the restrictions. Northern Ireland is already due to enter a six-week lockdown on Boxing Day. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What do tier four restrictions mean for sport? NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' Nurse Rachel Adams said she was potentially missing the last Christmas with her parents People whose Christmas plans were affected as a result of the changes have told the BBC of their anguish at being unable to see loved ones. Nurse Rachel Adams had been planning to see her parents, who are in their 70s. Her father has prostate cancer. She lives with her husband and two daughters, aged 18 and 21, in Thame, Oxfordshire, which is in tier two, and her parents live five hours away in Northumberland, which is in tier three. ""I am absolutely heartbroken,"" she said. ""I am missing potentially the last Christmas with my parents."" Gaynor Cawood said she couldn't believe the short notice given to cancel plans Grandmother Gaynor Cawood, who lives near Loughborough in Leicestershire, was expecting to see her son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren for Christmas. But she lives in tier three and they live in London, which is now in tier four - meaning a ban on travel to other tiers. ""I can't believe the short notice the government have given us to cancel plans,"" she says. ""Not only am I now unable to get our Christmas presents to my son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren - how do you explain to a five-year-old that all the exciting plans we made will now not happen?"" But not everyone will be obeying the restrictions over Christmas. Alex, a teacher from Huddersfield, which is in tier three, said: ""I will be continuing with my plans and meeting family on three days over Christmas."" He said he had recently recovered from Covid-19 and his family are being careful by taking tests and self-isolating. ""As a teacher I'm expected to work till the last day, mixing with 70 random households in an early years bubble, most of which I know do not follow the rules outside of school, or face legal action from [Education Secretary] Gavin Williamson. ""Therefore for three days, when I'm probably safest, as I know we are all OK, I'll continue as normal."" The PM's announcement on Saturday of new restrictions came just days after he defended plans to relax restrictions for five days during the festive period - despite calls by some in the medical profession to scrap the change. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party supported the latest restrictions, but he accused Boris Johnson of ""gross negligence"" in failing to act earlier. Sir Keir told an online press conference that it was ""blatantly obvious last week"" that Mr Johnson's plans to relax the rules over Christmas was ""a risk too far"", adding that his claim that ""this is all down to a new form of the virus that has just emerged does not stand up to scrutiny"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan told BBC Breakfast the ""11th-hour announcement is a bitter blow"" for families and businesses, saying it is the ""chop-change, stop-start, that's led to so much anguish, despair, sadness and disappointment"". Tier four restrictions: Similar to England's second national lockdown - tier four applies to Kent, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey (excluding Waverley), Gosport, Havant, Portsmouth, Rother and Hastings. It also applies in London (all 32 boroughs and the City of London) and the east of England (Bedford, Central Bedford, Milton Keynes, Luton, Peterborough, Hertfordshire and Essex (excluding Colchester, Uttlesford and Tendring). Residents told to stay at home, with exemptions for those who have to travel for work or education Household mixing indoors is not allowed, unless you live with them, or they are part of your existing support bubble All non-essential retail to close, including hairdressers, nail bars, indoor gyms and leisure facilities Social mixing cut to meeting one person in an open public space Communal religious worship is still allowed The measures will be reviewed on 30 December.

Germany and Finland bring home women from IS camps,"The women and children were brought back to Germany and Finland this weekend (file photo) Germany and Finland have repatriated five women and 18 children from Syrian camps housing suspected family members of Islamic State (IS) militants. The foreign ministries of both nations said the women and children were brought back this weekend for humanitarian reasons. Three of the women were under investigation for allegedly belonging to IS, German media said. Hundreds of Europeans who joined IS are in Kurdish-run camps in northern Syria. They were moved there along with thousands of others who were displaced after IS was declared territorially defeated in Syria and Iraq in March 2019. Many of them are suspected wives and children of IS fighters or sympathisers of the jihadist group. The women and children no-one wants IS women defiant in face of lost caliphate Concerned about the security risk they pose, some European governments have been reluctant to repatriate their citizens from the camps. The case of Shamima Begum, the British schoolgirl who joined IS in 2015 andwas later stripped of her UK citizenship on security grounds, is one prominent example. But human rights groups have urged governments to take their citizens back, arguing that leaving women and children in the camps puts them at risk of illness and radicalisation.

Mr Maas said the repatriations were ""humanitarian cases, primarily orphans and children who were ill"" and their need was ""deemed particularly necessary and urgent"". He said it was not legally possible to repatriate children without their mothers. Tens of thousands of women and children are housed in camps in northern Syria German broadcaster SVR said,externalone of the female returnees had been arrested at Frankfurt Airport on suspicion of being an IS member, among other alleged crimes. Prosecutors said the woman, from the central German state of Saxony-Anhalt, was believed to have travelled to Syria at the age of 15 and joined IS. A report by German magazine Der Spiegel said,externalthe two other female returnees were also being investigated on suspicion of IS membership. The three women were ""wives of jihadists"" of IS and ""in very poor health,"" a spokesman for the Kurdish administration's foreign relations office, Kamal Akif, told AFP news agency. In Finland,the foreign ministry said,externalit had brought home six children and two mothers. ""Under the constitution, Finnish public authorities are obligated to safeguard the basic rights of the Finnish children interned in the camps insofar as this is possible,"" it said. The Finnish government estimates that more than 9,000 foreign women and children, two-thirds of them children, are still being held in the al-Hol and Roj camps in north-eastern Syria. Of those, about 600 children and 300 women are EU citizens. ""The camps in north-east Syria constitute a long-term security risk,"" the Finnish foreign ministry added. ""The longer the children remain in the camps, without protection and education, the harder it will be to counter radical extremism.""

'We organised our wedding in two hours to beat tier 4',"""I've never in my life felt so much love and felt so grateful,"" Chloe Collins said A couple rearranged their wedding in just two hours to ensure they tied the knot before London went into tier four. Chloe Collins, 31, and Jamie Collins, 29, were due to marry on 6 September, but had reorganised three times due to changing coronavirus restrictions. Mrs Collins said ""our hearts sank"" when Boris Johnson announced on Saturday anew tier-four lockdown across south-east Englandwould start on Sunday. The couple were married at 22:00 GMT on Saturday at Edgware United Synagogue. ""I've never in my life felt so much love and felt so grateful,"" Mrs Collins, a lettings negotiator, said. The couple were allowed 15 guests but ""over 100 people logged on to Zoom to watch us"". ""We felt the love, and it felt like they were there,"" Mrs Collins said. The couple were married at Edgware United Synagogue Estate agent Mr Collins said their wedding had been planned with 130 guests at a country estate-turned-hotel in Watford. When coronavirus restrictions meant only 15 guests could attend weddings, the couple moved venue and planned for a wedding on 22 November. They then rearranged for 20 December, after a four week-England wide lockdown came into force through November. Mrs Collins said she ""felt physically sick"" as the prime minister announced new tier four restrictions on Saturday afternoon. ""Our rabbi had the idea to bring the wedding forward,"" Mr Collins said. ""We just started calling people to see what we could do, and the more calls we made the more people said 'yes'. ""It was a miracle that it just kind of came together. It felt like a dream. Some people take years to plan a wedding, but we did it in two hours."" Mr Collins's best man drove more than two hours to attend the wedding, before ""getting back in his car and driving home"", the couple said. Under tier four guidelines, weddings and civil partnerships are only allowed under ""exceptional circumstances"", such as if one partner is seriously ill and not expected to recover. Since the wedding, the couple, from Watford, have been inundated with messages. ""I've been welling up with messages from people who aren't my close friends saying it was amazing,"" Mrs Collins said. ""I think it's just nice to hear nice news for a change."" When will all wedding restrictions be lifted?

Mocked drive-through Santa's grotto now 'magical',"A Scrooge character who gave one youngster nightmares has been deemed to be an unsuitable sight for little children Organisers of a drive-through Santa's grotto described as ""shambolic"" have blamed ""teething problems"" and insisted that improvements have been made. The event in the grounds of Taverham Hall, near Norwich, opened on Friday. Later that day, the event's Facebook page contained complaints about traffic chaos and ""creepy"" performers. But Ollie George, from organisers We Make Events, said the feedback was now ""much more positive"". Saturday grotto visitors found it ""magical"", he added. People commenting on social media on Friday said they queued for up to three hours in rush-hour traffic, having bought tickets for a time slot. Many turned away with tired, upset children, with one parent stating: ""Would've been quicker to get to the North Pole."" The ""festive magic"" that was originally promised is now on offer, organisers claim Mr George said a Scrooge-like character had since been removed after being deemed ""too frightening for very young children"". Louise Purdy, who visited on Friday, previously said: ""The Scrooge guy called us all mutants, said Santa has crashed his sleigh and the presents are in the mud, and there was a man in chains by a tree just staring at the car."" Mr George also said the entry system had been altered to alleviate the traffic issues, although he pointed out that some customers had not arrived at their allotted time and this had caused congestion. Louise Purdy said she told her three-year-old son the inflatables were having a sleep He said the organisers had ""taken on board the complaints and concerns that we have received"" and were still making improvements. ""We're asking everyone who didn't have a great experience to get in contact and we are in the process of refunding people who are eligible.""

Dover port halts exports to France for 48 hours,"The government and trade groups have warned of ""serious disruption"" after France blocked arrivals of UK passengers for 48 hours over concerns about the new coronavirus variant. Freight lorries cannot cross by sea or through the Eurotunnel and the Port of Dover has closed to outbound traffic. About 10,000 lorries a day travel between Dover and Calais during peak periods such as Christmas. UK ministers will discuss the move at a Cobra emergency committee on Monday. On Sunday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps urged the public and hauliers not to travel to ports in Kent, saying ""significant disruption"" was likely in the area. Kent Police have mobilised Operation Stack - a system to park lorries on the M20 motorway in Kent at times of disruption - to deal with the build-up of traffic. Richard Burnett, head of the Road Haulage Association, told the BBC's Today programme that the ban could deter EU hauliers from coming to the UK over fears they will end up being stranded. ""The retailers have done a good job of stocking up on ambient products [for Christmas] - there will be plenty of stock,"" he added. ""But the fresh food supply, where it's short shelf life and there will be product on its way now, that's where the challenge comes from. ""The retailers will absolutely be assessing their inbound flows this morning and understanding whether or not those flows are on their way into the retail distribution centres around the country and I'm sure there will be further reassurance given today that those things are in control."" Kent Police said it had implemented the closure of the coast-bound carriageway of the motorway between Junctions 8 and 11 as a ""contingency measure"". The Department for Transport has said that Manston Airport in Kent is being readied to take up to 4,000 lorries to ease congestion in the county. The Port of Dover is closed to traffic leaving the UK ""until further notice"" due to border restrictions in France,port authorities said in a statement,external. ""Both accompanied freight and passenger customers are asked not to travel to the port,"" it said. ""We understand that the restrictions will be in place for 48 hours from midnight."" Freight coming to Britain from France will be allowed, but there are fears lorry drivers will not travel to avoid being stuck in the UK. Unaccompanied freight, such as containers or lorry trailers on their own can still be transported, but outbound vans, lorries and trucks are banned. Hauliers are advised to find other routes into the continent. Cases rise as Christmas rules come into force Nations impose UK travel bans over new variant New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Border restrictions could mean disruption to food supplies, as well as difficulties in meeting orders of British goods in continental Europe. ""Tonight's suspension of accompanied freight traffic from the UK to France has the potential to cause serious disruption to UK Christmas fresh food supplies - and exports of UK food and drink,"" Food and Drink Federation (FDF) chief executive Ian Wright warned on Sunday. ""The government must very urgently persuade the French government to exempt accompanied freight from its ban."" Freight industry lobby group Logistics UK said it was concerned about the welfare of drivers going from the UK to France, and said they should have access to regular testing. It appealed for calm from shoppers, and said it was ""maintaining close contact with UK government to ensure that supplies of fresh produce are available throughout Christmas and the new year"". The British Retail Consortium (BRC) joined the FDF in appealing to the government to find a solution, but also added that there should be no immediate shortages. ""Retailers have stocked up on goods ahead of Christmas which should prevent immediate problems,"" the BRC said. The government does not think the restrictions will affect the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines to the UK, according to BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called on the government to extend the Brexit transition period as it deals with the new coronavirus variant, saying it was a ""profoundly serious situation"" which ""demands our 100% attention"". The current transition period is due to expire at the end of the year and the EU and UK are still negotiating a trade deal. Without it both sides will have to collect expensive tariffs that the Office for Budget Responsibility says could harm the UK's economy. Labour's Rachel Reeves, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, called the development ""deeply worrying"". ""The country needs to hear credible plans and reassurance that essential supplies will be safeguarded, including our NHS, supermarkets and manufacturers with crucial supply chains,"" she said. The block on freight traffic into France came as a number of European countries banned flights and other travel from the UK  over fears about VUI - a mutation of the coronavirus that is spreading rapidly in the UK. France, Italy, Ireland, Germany, Belgium the Netherlands and Turkey are among those to have banned flights from the UKwhile other nations are considering the move.

What are new Christmas rules?,"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary. You cannot go to the pub with members of your Christmas bubble. In England, if you have formed asupport bubblewith another household, that counts as one household. In Scotland,guidance,externalsays any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"". People who are self-isolatingshould not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone has to self-isolate. Under-18s whose parents live apart can join two Christmas bubbles, so they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household. University students whotravel homewill be counted as part of their family household straight away.

Christmas to bring 'pain' but there is hope - WelbyThe Archbishop of Canterbury urges people to plan for proper celebrations in the future.UK,"The cancellation of Christmas plans for millions of people across the UK will bring ""intense pain"" but there is ""hope"" for the future, the Archbishop of Canterbury has said. Justin Welby told the BBC he had spent Christmases alone and had ""no illusions about how dark it feels"". ""But as the vaccine comes in, things will change,"" the archbishop said. He urged people to take practical steps to avoid loneliness and plan for proper celebrations in the future. He also said the elderly and vulnerable should not feel compelled to go to church this Christmas. On Saturday, the planned relaxation of Covid rules for Christmas werescrapped for London and parts of south-east and east Englandand cut to just Christmas Day for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales. Speaking on The Andrew Marr show, the archbishop acknowledged that for many families this year has been difficult and that many will be feeling lonely. Asked directly whether Christmas was cancelled, he replied: ""No. The celebrations are cancelled - we'll come to those again. ""This is very different to what we hoped for and longed for and it is the most intense pain for a lot of people. ""But it's not cancelled because at the heart of Christmas is Jesus coming into the world, God coming into the world and then coming onto Easter. ""This is a moment of God saying 'I am with you in the mess and there is hope'."" 'Our duty' to act over Christmas plans - Hancock What are the new restrictions? What are the rules on mixing at Christmas? The archbishop said people should share memories of lost loved ones, speak to friends and family, and make plans for the future when the pandemic has eased. He said: ""Talk to people on the phone - ring, share and plan. ""Something about planning for the future helps us dream. ""What are you going to do? What are we going to do when this time is over? ""It may be many months yet but as the vaccine comes in things will change. ""What are we going to do to celebrate? ""And to mourn and to grieve, but crying and laughing to celebrate."" The Archbishop of Canterbury also said people needed to decide for themselves whether it was too risky to attend church at Christmas. Places of worship will remain open over the festive period, even in areas in tier four - the toughest level of restrictions in England. He said his mother, who is in her 90s, would not be going because it was ""too dangerous"". ""There are clergy who have underlying health conditions, who will not be going to church,"" he added. For those who decide to attend church in person, they should not ""mingle"" after services and should stay away from the choir. ""Wave happily to people and go home,"" he said.

St Pancras crowds 'totally irresponsible',"Footage showed large crowds at St Pancras station hours before tier-four restrictions came into force. Londoners who crowded on to trains to leave the capital on Saturday night were ""totally irresponsible"", the health secretary has said. London has moved into tier-four restrictions, meaning it is illegal to leave the capital from 00.01 GMT Sunday unless for essential travel. Footage shared on social media showed large crowds at St Pancras station. Matt Hancock called for people to act responsibly but said the majority of people were abiding by the guidelines. The announcement of the new rules, shortly after 16.00 GMT on Saturday, prompted a rush to London's railway stations. By 19.00, there were no tickets available online from several stations including Paddington, Kings Cross and Euston. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At St Pancras, which connects south-east England with the East Midlands and North, several passengers told the BBC they were catching pre-booked trains and had not heard about the new rules being brought in. However one passenger, who did not wish to be named, said she and her partner had made the ""split decision"" to take their young son to her parents' home on the coast. ""We just made the decision to leave based on the fact that my parents said come, and we couldn't bear the thought of no fresh air and a toddler going rogue round a small flat for the foreseeable,"" she said. East Midlands Railway said it had run a full service on Saturday and only two of its 10 evening departures had been full. A spokesman for the railway apologised for any ""inconvenience and discomfort caused"" by the ""unexpected surge in passengers"". Some 21 million people are now under tier-four restrictions which ban households from mixing as well as requiring non-essential shops and businesses to close. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan criticised the government for making the announcement ""late"", following days of reassurances restrictions would be relaxed over the Christmas period. He said crowded stations were ""a direct consequence of the chaotic way the announcement was made"". Matt Hancock said only ""relatively small numbers"" were breaking the rules Mr Khan urged people in London and the South East to stay at home and avoid ""breaking the rules"". He said: ""Yesterday, technically speaking, you may not have been breaking the rules but you may well have the virus and not realise you've got the virus. ""Keep [the virus] within London, follow the rules and let's get on top of this."" Mr Hancock said only ""relatively small numbers"" were breaking the rules. ""The large, vast majority of people throughout this whole pandemic have followed the rules,"" he said.

New coronavirus variant: What do we know?How has a new coronavirus variant become the most common form of the virus in parts of England?Health,"The rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus has been blamed for the introduction of strict tier four mixing rules for millions of people, harsher restrictions on mixing at Christmas in England, Scotland and Wales, and other countries placing the UK on a travel ban. So how has it gone from being non-existent to the most common form of the virus in parts of England in a matter of months? The government's advisers on new infections now say they have ""high"" confidence that it is more able to transmit than other variants. All the work is at an early stage, contains huge uncertainties and a long list of unanswered questions. As I've written before,viruses mutate all the time and it's vital to keep a laser focuson whether the virus' behaviour is changing. Three things are coming together that mean it is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily. However, we do not have absolute certainty. New strains can become more common simply by being in the right place at the right time - such as London, which had only tier two restrictions until recently. But already the justification for tier four restrictions is in part to reduce the spread of the variant. ""Laboratory experiments are required, but do you want to wait weeks or months [to see the results and take action to limit the spread]? Probably not in these circumstances,"" Prof Nick Loman, from the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium, told me. It was first detected in September. In November around a quarter of cases in London were the new variant. This reached nearly two-thirds of cases in mid-December. You can see how the variant has come to dominate the results of testing in some centres such as the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Laboratory. Allow Twitter content?

Mathematicians have been running the numbers on the spread of different variants in an attempt to calculate how much of an edge this one might have. But teasing apart what is due to people's behaviour and what is due to the virus is hard. The figure mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was that the variant may be up to 70% more transmissible. He said this may be increasing the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by 0.4. That 70% number appearedin a presentation by Dr Erik Volz, from Imperial College London,external, on Friday. During the talk he said: ""It is really too early to tellâ¦ but from what we see so far it is growing very quickly, it is growing faster than [a previous variant] ever grew, but it is important to keep an eye on this."" There is no ""nailed on"" figure for how much more infectious the variant may be. Scientists, whose work is not yet public, have told me figures both much higher and much lower than 70%. But there remain questions about whether it is any more infectious at all. ""The amount of evidence in the public domain is woefully inadequate to draw strong or firm opinions on whether the virus has truly increased transmission,"" said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. It is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations. The variant can be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, the South East and eastern England. Cases elsewhere in the country do not seem to have taken off. Data from Nextstrain, which has been monitoring the genetic codes of the viral samples around the world, suggest cases in Denmark and Australia have come from the UK. The Netherlands has also reported cases. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A similar variant that has emerged in South Africa shares some of the same mutations, but appears to be unrelated to this one. Yes. The virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, is not the same one you will find in most corners of the world. TheD614G mutation emerged in Europe in February,externaland became the globally dominant form of the virus. Another, called A222V, spread across Europe andwas linked to people's summer holidays in Spain,external. An initial analysis of the new variant has been published andidentifies 17 potentially important alterations,external. There have been changes to the spike protein - this is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway to our body's cells. One mutation called N501Y alters the most important part of the spike, known as the ""receptor-binding domain"". This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. ""It looks and smells like an important adaptation,"" said Prof Loman. The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion, in which a small part of the spike is removed - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink. Work by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge has suggested this mutation increases infectivity two-fold in lab experiments. Studies by the same group suggest the deletionmakes antibodies from the blood of survivors less effective at attacking the virus,external. Prof Gupta told me: ""It is rapidly increasing, that's what's worried government, we are worried, most scientists are worried."" The variant is unusually highly mutated. The most likely explanation is the variant has emerged in a patient with a weakened immune system that was unable to beat the virus. Instead their body became a breeding ground for the virus to mutate. There is no evidence to suggest that it does, although this will need to be monitored. However, just increasing transmission would be enough to cause problems for hospitals. If the new variant means more people are infected more quickly, that would in turn lead to more people needing hospital treatment. Almost certainly yes, or at least for now. All three leading vaccines develop an immune response against the existing spike, which is why the question comes up. Vaccines train the immune system to attack several different parts of the virus, so even though part of the spike has mutated, the vaccines should still work. ""But if we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying,"" said Prof Gupta. ""This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that."" Vaccine escape happens when the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine and continues to infect people. This may be the most concerning element of what is happening with the virus. This variant is just the latest to show the virus is continuing to adapt as it infects more and more of us. A presentation by Prof David Robertson, from the University of Glasgow on Friday, concluded: ""The virus will probably be able to generate vaccine escape mutants,external."" That would put us in a position similar to flu, where the vaccines need to be regularly updated. Fortunately the vaccines we have are very easy to tweak.

New restrictions in Sydney as Covid outbreak growsCurbs on gatherings are announced as authorities urge people to stay at home.Australia,"Sydney residents have been told to stay at home Australia's most populous state has announced new restrictions for the Greater Sydney area in an attempt to contain a growing outbreak of Covid-19. Household gatherings will be capped at 10 people and hospitality venues at 300 until Wednesday. Residents had already been told to stay at home. The cases were found in the city's Northern Beaches area, which entered a five-day lockdown on Saturday. Since then Sydney residents have rushed to leave the city ahead of Christmas. Thousands have travelled from the city in New South Wales (NSW) to the neighbouring state of Victoria. In response, Victoria will close its borders to residents of Greater Sydney and the NSW Central Coast from midnight. People will then face a 14-day quarantine. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? New Zealand and Australia agree Covid travel bubble How Melbourne's long lockdown crushed a second wave South Australia state also said all arrivals from the Greater Sydney area would have to quarantine for 14 days from midnight. People who have been in the Northern Beaches area will be barred from the state entirely. The outbreak has also forced organisers of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race to cancel the event for the first time in its history. Until Wednesday, Australia had recorded just one locally transmitted infection in the past fortnight. The country, which is considered a relative success story of the pandemic, has recorded about 28,000 infections and 908 deaths in total,according to a Johns Hopkins University tally,external. A five-week lockdown started on Saturday in Sydney's Northern Beaches area The restrictions in Greater Sydney,external- including the Central Coast and Blue Mountains - can be lifted if no cases of community transmission are reported. They include: The rule of one person per 4 sq m (43 sq ft) will return for all indoor settings including hospitality venues and places of worship A cap of 300 people will be introduced in those places Singing and chanting at indoor venues will not be allowed Dance floors will not be permitted, apart from weddings when up to 20 people from the bridal party will be allowed Speaking at a news conference, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people in the Sydney area to wear face masks in public although it was not mandatory. Earlier she pleaded with all residents to limit their activities over the next few days and stay at home ""unless you really have to"" go out. Sydney's Northern Beaches outbreak grew to 68 cases on Sunday, with 30 new cases recorded in the previous 24 hours. The new cluster emerged just days before the Christmas period, prompting concern that travel restrictions may impact festive plans. More than 250,000 residents have been banned from leaving their homes except for work, exercise, essential shopping and compassionate reasons until Wednesday. Those living in other parts of Sydney have been told to avoid the area. The NSW government has urged all locals to wear masks in public areas like supermarkets and churches and to be on ""high alert"". The next five days has been described as a ""tipping point"" by epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws. ""We can only hope that it remains focused in the Northern Beaches, but if it goes across all of Australia then we will need more tightening."" All of Sydney's residents have been told to limit their activities over the next few days Tests have shown that the outbreak is similar to a strain of Covid-19 found recently in quarantined travellers, state officials said. But authorities still do not know how it got into the community. They said it had spread after one couple failed to isolate at home while awaiting coronavirus test results. Their 11 December visit to a popular lawn bowls club and pub in the Northern Beaches suburb of Avalon has now been identified as the ""super spreader"" event. However, it is unclear how the couple - who had not travelled overseas - became infected. Since Australia closed its borders in March, its outbreaks have largely begun with breaches in its hotel quarantine system for returned international travellers. Such instances led to Australia's biggest outbreak in Melbourne.

Germany and Finland bring home women from IS campsThree of the women are under investigation for allegedly belonging to the Islamic State (IS) group.Europe,"The women and children were brought back to Germany and Finland this weekend (file photo) Germany and Finland have repatriated five women and 18 children from Syrian camps housing suspected family members of Islamic State (IS) militants. The foreign ministries of both nations said the women and children were brought back this weekend for humanitarian reasons. Three of the women were under investigation for allegedly belonging to IS, German media said. Hundreds of Europeans who joined IS are in Kurdish-run camps in northern Syria. They were moved there along with thousands of others who were displaced after IS was declared territorially defeated in Syria and Iraq in March 2019. Many of them are suspected wives and children of IS fighters or sympathisers of the jihadist group. The women and children no-one wants IS women defiant in face of lost caliphate Concerned about the security risk they pose, some European governments have been reluctant to repatriate their citizens from the camps. The case of Shamima Begum, the British schoolgirl who joined IS in 2015 andwas later stripped of her UK citizenship on security grounds, is one prominent example. But human rights groups have urged governments to take their citizens back, arguing that leaving women and children in the camps puts them at risk of illness and radicalisation. This video can not be played Children held in Islamic State group camps 'are a time bomb' On Sunday Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he was ""very relieved that we were able to repatriate another 12 children and three mothers from camps in north-eastern Syria yesterday"". Mr Maas said the repatriations were ""humanitarian cases, primarily orphans and children who were ill"" and their need was ""deemed particularly necessary and urgent"". He said it was not legally possible to repatriate children without their mothers. Tens of thousands of women and children are housed in camps in northern Syria German broadcaster SVR said,externalone of the female returnees had been arrested at Frankfurt Airport on suspicion of being an IS member, among other alleged crimes. Prosecutors said the woman, from the central German state of Saxony-Anhalt, was believed to have travelled to Syria at the age of 15 and joined IS. A report by German magazine Der Spiegel said,externalthe two other female returnees were also being investigated on suspicion of IS membership. The three women were ""wives of jihadists"" of IS and ""in very poor health,"" a spokesman for the Kurdish administration's foreign relations office, Kamal Akif, told AFP news agency. In Finland,the foreign ministry said,externalit had brought home six children and two mothers. ""Under the constitution, Finnish public authorities are obligated to safeguard the basic rights of the Finnish children interned in the camps insofar as this is possible,"" it said. The Finnish government estimates that more than 9,000 foreign women and children, two-thirds of them children, are still being held in the al-Hol and Roj camps in north-eastern Syria. Of those, about 600 children and 300 women are EU citizens. ""The camps in north-east Syria constitute a long-term security risk,"" the Finnish foreign ministry added.

Border police patrols to double after travel ban,"Police patrols will be stepped up but road blocks are not envisaged Police patrols on Scotland's borders are to be doubled but there are no plans for checkpoints or road blocks. Police Scotland's chief constable said he expected roads to be quieter in the coming days and that most people would ""do the right thing"". But Iain Livingstone ruled out setting up checkpoints, saying they were not ""appropriate"" or ""proportionate"". The first minister announced on Saturday that cross-border travel would be banned for the festive period. Lockdown looms at Scotland tightens Christmas rules What are the level four restrictions? Nicola Sturgeon saidtighter travel rules were essential, along with a number of extra measures,to prevent a new variant of Covid-19 spreading rapidly. There are only a limited number of specific exemptions to the law. In addition to the cross-border travel ban, the whole of Scotland will move into either level four or level three Covid restrictions from 26 December, meaning people are only allowed to make essential journeys outside their council area. The chief constable said he had compassion for all those affected by ""highly restrictive measures"" but insisted they were ""absolutely necessary"" to save lives. ""Following the announcement by the first minister, there can be no doubt that, other than for the most essential journeys, people should not be travelling between Scotland and other parts of the UK,"" he said. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said policing of travel restrictions must be ""proportionate"" Mr Livingstone said the increase in Covid alert levels from midnight on 26 December amounted to a ""blanket ban"" for mainland Scotland. But he added: ""I remain clear I do not consider it appropriate or proportionate for officers to establish check points or road blocks to simply enforce travel restrictions ""These restrictions are a preventative measure to halt the progress of Covid and Police Scotland will support this approach with a strong operational profile to deter those who would put others at risk. ""Today, I have authorised the doubling of our operational presence in the border areas of Scotland."" He said the force's experience throughout the pandemic was that the ""overwhelming majority"" of people had ""demonstrated personal responsibility to do the right thing"". He added: ""It is the consent of the public from which policing in Scotland draws its legitimacy. As our communities expect, where officers encounter wilful, persistent or flagrant breaches we will act decisively to enforce the law."" British Transport Police have also boosted the number of officers at stations across the UK's rail network. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said: ""As has been the case throughout the pandemic, officers will be supporting rail staff through high-visibility patrols across England, Scotland and Wales, ensuring those on the network are safe. ""Our policing method remains the same - officers will engage with passengers and only use enforcement if absolutely necessary. ""Anyone planning a journey over the festive period is urged to consider whether travelling is essential and encouraged to stay at home as per latest Government advice.""

New restrictions in Sydney as Covid outbreak grows,"Sydney residents have been told to stay at home Australia's most populous state has announced new restrictions for the Greater Sydney area in an attempt to contain a growing outbreak of Covid-19. Household gatherings will be capped at 10 people and hospitality venues at 300 until Wednesday. Residents had already been told to stay at home. The cases were found in the city's Northern Beaches area, which entered a five-day lockdown on Saturday. Since then Sydney residents have rushed to leave the city ahead of Christmas. Thousands have travelled from the city in New South Wales (NSW) to the neighbouring state of Victoria. In response, Victoria will close its borders to residents of Greater Sydney and the NSW Central Coast from midnight. People will then face a 14-day quarantine. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? New Zealand and Australia agree Covid travel bubble How Melbourne's long lockdown crushed a second wave South Australia state also said all arrivals from the Greater Sydney area would have to quarantine for 14 days from midnight. People who have been in the Northern Beaches area will be barred from the state entirely. The outbreak has also forced organisers of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race to cancel the event for the first time in its history. Until Wednesday, Australia had recorded just one locally transmitted infection in the past fortnight. The country, which is considered a relative success story of the pandemic, has recorded about 28,000 infections and 908 deaths in total,according to a Johns Hopkins University tally,external. A five-week lockdown started on Saturday in Sydney's Northern Beaches area The restrictions in Greater Sydney,external- including the Central Coast and Blue Mountains - can be lifted if no cases of community transmission are reported. They include: The rule of one person per 4 sq m (43 sq ft) will return for all indoor settings including hospitality venues and places of worship A cap of 300 people will be introduced in those places Singing and chanting at indoor venues will not be allowed Dance floors will not be permitted, apart from weddings when up to 20 people from the bridal party will be allowed Speaking at a news conference, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people in the Sydney area to wear face masks in public although it was not mandatory. Earlier she pleaded with all residents to limit their activities over the next few days and stay at home ""unless you really have to"" go out. Sydney's Northern Beaches outbreak grew to 68 cases on Sunday, with 30 new cases recorded in the previous 24 hours. The new cluster emerged just days before the Christmas period, prompting concern that travel restrictions may impact festive plans. More than 250,000 residents have been banned from leaving their homes except for work, exercise, essential shopping and compassionate reasons until Wednesday. Those living in other parts of Sydney have been told to avoid the area. The NSW government has urged all locals to wear masks in public areas like supermarkets and churches and to be on ""high alert"". The next five days has been described as a ""tipping point"" by epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws. ""We can only hope that it remains focused in the Northern Beaches, but if it goes across all of Australia then we will need more tightening."" All of Sydney's residents have been told to limit their activities over the next few days Tests have shown that the outbreak is similar to a strain of Covid-19 found recently in quarantined travellers, state officials said. But authorities still do not know how it got into the community. They said it had spread after one couple failed to isolate at home while awaiting coronavirus test results. Their 11 December visit to a popular lawn bowls club and pub in the Northern Beaches suburb of Avalon has now been identified as the ""super spreader"" event. However, it is unclear how the couple - who had not travelled overseas - became infected. Since Australia closed its borders in March, its outbreaks have largely begun with breaches in its hotel quarantine system for returned international travellers. Such instances led to Australia's biggest outbreak in Melbourne.

'Our duty' to act over Christmas plans - Hancock,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""If you act like you have the virus, that will stop the virus from spreading to others"" The government does not want to cancel Christmas but it is ""our duty"" to act as a new coronavirus variant is ""out of control"", the health secretary says. A strict new lockdown in London, the South East and east of England could last for months, Matt Hancock said. Millions of people across the UK have seen theirfestive plans severely restricted or scrapped. On Sunday, the number of recorded daily infections in the UK reached anall-time high of 35,928 new cases,external. The figure is nearly twice the number of cases - 18,447 - reported a week ago. However, it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring, with testing capacity too limited at the time to detect the true number of daily cases. Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""This sharp and sudden increase is of serious concern. ""Most of the new cases reported today are concentrated in London and the South East, although it is too early to tell if this is linked to the new variant."" A growing number of countries have banned travel from the UK- including Ireland, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands - over the new variant. The government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group estimates this variant could increase the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by between 0.4 and 0.9,newly released minutes show,external. Wales locks down as Christmas plans cut What is tier four and who is in it? Should you see your family at Christmas? 'I won't have next summer let alone next Christmas' Some 21 million people in England and Wales who entered new restrictions at midnight are being told to stay at home, while non-essential shops and businesses have to close. The planned relaxation of rules for Christmas has been scrapped for those under England's toughest new tier four measures, while in the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, relaxed indoor mixing rules over the holidays have been cut from five days to Christmas Day only. Mr Hancock said it was ""important for everybody to act like they might have the virus"" because we need to bring the new variant ""under control"". He added: ""Of course we don't want to cancel Christmas... we don't want to take any of these measures, but it's our duty to take them when the evidence is clear."" The health secretary said he did not know how long the tier four measures would be in place but ""it may be for some time, until we can get the vaccine going"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party supported the latest restrictions but he accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""gross negligence"" in failing to act earlier. Residents in tier four are being asked to stay at home unless for essential journeys, while people in other tiers are advised not to travel into the new tier four areas. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was very important that people followed the new travel guidance in England and ""do not attempt to travel"", saying extra British Transport Police officers were being deployed. A ban on travel between Scotland and the rest of the UK will also apply over the festive period. Police Scotland saidit would be doubling its patrols on the borders but it would not be introducing check points. Scotland's restrictions willonly be relaxed on Christmas Day, with mainland Scotland being placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. Wales has also entered a new shutdown, with the health minister sayingthe new variant was ""seeded"" in every part. In Northern Ireland, where the planned relaxation of rules for Christmas is going ahead unchanged,four of the five main parties have called for an urgent meeting to discuss the restrictions. This video can not be played Starmer: Boris Johnson ""has once again been caught behind the curve"" The PM's announcement of new restrictions came just days after he defended plans to relax restrictions for five days during the festive period - despite calls by some in the medical profession to scrap the change. Sir Keir told an online press conference that it was ""blatantly obvious last week"" that Mr Johnson's plans to relax the rules over Christmas was ""a risk too far"", adding that his claim that ""this is all down to a new form of the virus that has just emerged does not stand up to scrutiny"". He said the ""alarm bells have been ringing for weeks"" with rising infections and the NHS reaching capacity in some parts of the country ""but the prime minister chose to ignore"" it. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What do tier four restrictions mean for sport? NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' London Mayor Sadiq Khan told BBC Breakfast the ""11th-hour announcement is a bitter blow"" for families and businesses, saying it is the ""chop-change, stop-start, that's led to so much anguish, despair, sadness and disappointment"". He urged Londoners to follow the rules which he said had been brought in ""for a very good reason"", adding that the NHS had told him that hospitals in London had as many Covid patients this weekend as they did at the peak of the virus in April. Tier four restrictions: Similar to England's second national lockdown - tier four applies to Kent, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey (excluding Waverley), Gosport, Havant, Portsmouth, Rother and Hastings. It also applies in London (all 32 boroughs and the City of London) and the east of England (Bedford, Central Bedford, Milton Keynes, Luton, Peterborough, Hertfordshire and Essex (excluding Colchester, Uttlesford and Tendring). Residents told to stay at home, with exemptions for those who have to travel for work or education Household mixing indoors is not allowed, unless you live with them, or they are part of your existing support bubble All non-essential retail to close, including hairdressers, nail bars, indoor gyms and leisure facilities Social mixing cut to meeting one person in an open public space Communal religious worship is still allowed The measures will be reviewed on 30 December. Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, said they alerted the government on Friday that the new variant - first identified in the middle of October from a sample taken in September - was spreading faster than other viruses circulating. Dr Hopkins told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that there was evidence that people with the new strain had ""higher viral loads"" - which meant they were more infectious. She also said findings had shown the new variant was up to 70% more transmissible based on modelling the rate of increase in the new strain compared to others in circulation.

New coronavirus variant 'in every part of Wales',"Non-essential shops have now been closed as Wales begins its lockdown There could be a spike in coronavirus cases after Christmas, even with the early lockdown, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said thestay-at-home rulewas introduced from midnight ""partly"" as a result of anew variant of the virus. The variant is ""seeded"" in all parts of Wales, including the north, he said. Opposition leaders are calling for the Welsh Parliament to be recalled during recess. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said announcing the stricter Covid restrictions sooner would have stoppedpeople rushing to the shopson Saturday night. All of Wales is in the highest level of lockdown -level four,external- with all but essential shops closed, and people being told to ""stay home"" to save lives. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Q&A: What has changed as Wales locks down? Christmas lockdown kindness gives gifts and dinners Meeting up is now limited to two households and a single person support bubble on Christmas Day only. Pressure on the NHS has exceeded the Welsh Government's worst case scenario and without action there will be an ""even bigger spike in cases"", Mr Gething said. ""It would [the NHS] be in danger of not being able to cope if we don't act - and there's still a risk even now,"" he said. Further cases were ""baked in"" due to people mixing in the run up to lockdown, he told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement. ""Over the next few weeks we know that there'll be a problem,"" he said. ""We know that despite the rules some people will still mix."" New virus variant: How worried should we be? Countries ban flights from UK over new variant Mr Gething said the new variant was ""in every part of Wales, including right across north Wales"", adding that ministers had been shown evidence that it was ""much more infectious"". ""We've seen cases rise significantly in the south,"" he said. Shoppers queued outside Marks and Spencer near Cardiff on Saturday night Plaid Cymru leader Mr Price told theDewi Llwyd programmeon BBC Radio Cymru he had urged the first minister on Wednesday to bring in ""stricter restrictions in those areas with high infection rates before Christmas anyway, even before this new information on the new variant of the virus"". Conservative shadow health minister Andrew RT Davies said there was ""colossal"" pressure on the NHS, but said ministers needed to provide evidence to support their actions. ""I don't doubt the sincerity of ministers at all, but I do believe we need to see the evidence as a matter of urgency,"" he said. ""I woke up this morning and went into my inbox and it is just full of bewildered people at the speed of what has exactly happened."" Gyms, hairdressers, beauty salons and non-essential shops closed at the end of trading on Saturday Bars and restaurants will only be able to open for takeaways People will only be allowed to travel for ""essential reasons"" People cannot mix with anyone they do not live with, with only single person households allowed to form an exclusive support bubble with one other household The exception is for Christmas Day when two households can meet, along with a single person support bubble Places of worship are allowed to be open to the public Weddings and funerals can take place, but receptions and wakes are not allowed Moving homes is still allowed, if the moving date cannot be switched Driving lessons cannot take place during lockdown and booked theory tests will need to be rearranged The Welsh Government has published more guidancehere,external The Christmas market in Cardiff is being taken down because of the new rules Ben Francis, from the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales, acknowledged concern about the number of Covid cases, but he said the lockdown was ""nothing short of devastating"" for businesses. ""This situation creates a new level of urgency for businesses to receive funding from Welsh Government upon which they will be heavily reliant,"" he said. Hairdresser and mother-of-three Kristy Wood said she reopened her salon, Kristy's Hair Design Studio in Newport, after the announcement on Saturday afternoon to try to safely fit in several clients before closing the doors before the midnight lockdown. ""I was calling clients and put out a notice on Facebook - most were in their pyjamas watching theStrictly finalwith a glass of wine!"" she said. ""If we could have been told the day before, or earlier that afternoon, we could have planned more. It was such short notice, so we were thrown in the deep end. It could have been done in a better way."" She added it seemed unfair that businesses had made so much effort to adhere to safety guidelines, while supermarkets seemed less restricted. ""We take clients' temperatures at the door, do track and trace, sanitise, wear PPE - masks, visors, aprons and gloves,"" she added. ""It's frustrating that we've put all this in place but you go into a supermarket and they don't do it. It really does feel unfair."" Jonathan Barnes is one of many people now facing Christmas alone Meanwhile, father-of-two Jonathan Barnes, 40, said he faced the prospect of beingalone over Christmas, unable to travel from Suffolk to Pembrokeshire to join his family due to the coronavirus rules. The Covid-19 case rate for Wales has jumped to 613.3 cases per 100,000 for the past seven days, up from 530.2 on Thursday. The seven day rolling case rate remains highest in Merthyr Tydfil at 1,225, followed by Bridgend on 1,118 and Blaenau Gwent on 981.9. The Welsh Government held an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday amid""serious concerns""over the new variant of coronavirus. The World Health Organization has said it is in""close contact"" with UK officialsover its emergence, although it is not believed to be more deadly. In astatement,external, Wales chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said ""hospital admissions have increased markedly in areas with higher levels of the variant"". The owner of a pub in Neath Port Talbot who hosted a gathering after the latest lockdown rules came into force in the early hours was among the first to receive a fine, according to atweet,externalby South Wales Police. Coronavirus restrictions are being enforced by local authority enforcement officers and the police, with Â£60 fixed penalty notices issued for the first offence rising to a maximum of Â£1,920. The Welsh Government has spoken to councils and the police ""because we do want to see more enforcement take place"", Mr Gething said. But officers in Wales say they have been called on toenforce sometimes ""unpopular"" Covid rules. Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said: ""Where we do get information that people are flouting the rules, maybe house parties are taking place, the police will be there to respond. ""The key here is for people to take personal responsibility in relation to their movements over the next few weeks and, in particular, on Christmas Day. ""The guidance is there for a reason.

What's the advice on travelling over Christmas?,"Wales has different coronavirus restrictions to other parts of the UK People in Wales have been told to stay at home and not travel over the new year after the country went into national lockdown. Stay-at-home restrictions come into effect from the Sunday before Christmas. The new lockdown rules meant the easing of Christmas rules were reduced to just Christmas Day from the previous plans for afive-day bubble. Wales lockdown at midnight as Christmas plans cut Q&A: What has changed as lockdown brought forward? People are also being told to avoid social contact to help halt soaring Covid rates - and the lockdown will be reviewed every three weeks. Travel is not permitted in, out or around Wales unless it is essential - except on Christmas Day - so for things like education, childcare, providing care or work when you cannot work from home. A modern browser with Javascript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. The Welsh Government said: ""If you live in Wales, you will be able to travel to meet one other household on Christmas Day anywhere in Wales. ""You can also leave Wales, subject to the local restrictions in the area you would be travelling to, and the need to be back at home by the end of the day."" But people are not able to enter areas of Englandunder the new tier four restrictions, mainly in London and the south-east, at all - even on Christmas Day. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What are the different rules around the UK?

All accommodation businesses are to be closed, except where they provide accommodation for anybody who is living there as their main residence - or is staying there at that time and is unable to return to their main residence.

Q&A: What has changed as Wales locks down?,"Face masks are no longer legally required in Welsh shops The last Covid restrictions are set to end in Wales on Monday after 26 months. The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in health and social care services from Monday 30 May. It will be the first time there will be no Covid restrictions in Wales since the first lockdown in March 2020. The country is currently atalert level zero,external, the lowest tier of Covid rules, with numbers testing positive having fallen in recent weeks. The UK's last remaining Covid restrictions New Zealand to scrap some Covid vaccine mandates The lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic. We were last in alert level zero at Christmas. Under it, most curbs to our daily life have been removed, and all businesses have been allowed to reopen. Self-isolation rules did still apply, but were scrapped from 28 March. It is no longer a legal requirement but people are still strongly recommended to use face coverings in any health setting to protect the most vulnerable. The Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Since 22 December, those identified as being a close contact of someone who tests positive for Covid-19 in Wales have not had to self-isolate automatically, if they are fully vaccinated, aged between five and 18, or participating in a vaccine clinical trial. Instead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests. Since 28 January, people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests required on days five and six. Until then, the self-isolation period was seven days,down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on days six and seven. The Welsh government put the measures in place on 26 December to protect customers and staff in businesses The Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive. It advised meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated. People, it said, should leave at least a day between social events. From 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. But under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January. The rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended. People are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped. While wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing. Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August and remain the same Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August. For important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. All guests will need to take a lateral flow test. People attending weddings, civil partnerships or alternative wedding ceremonies or receptions, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero. The Welsh government advised people to wear face coverings indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing. You can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply. On 25 January 2022, theWelsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidaysfor the first time since the start of the pandemic. Nightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four-stage plan, they have been allowed to open since 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. Covid passes were scrapped on 18 February for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. As cases continued to remain low, sports fans were allowed to return to events From 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500. On 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. Gyms, swimming pools, leisure centres, community centres and fitness facilities are open Pupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January. From 18 February, they were no longer required to wear face coverings and schools could decide their own rules. Working from home is no longer law in Wales A legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with Â£60 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, was scrapped on 28 January. You have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April 2021, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations. It also means people from other parts of the UK can come here. All holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May.

"'Our duty' to act over Christmas plans - HancockIt comes as the number of daily infections in the UK reaches an all-time high of 35,928 new cases.UK","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""If you act like you have the virus, that will stop the virus from spreading to others"" The government does not want to cancel Christmas but it is ""our duty"" to act as a new coronavirus variant is ""out of control"", the health secretary says. A strict new lockdown in London, the South East and east of England could last for months, Matt Hancock said. Millions of people across the UK have seen theirfestive plans severely restricted or scrapped. On Sunday, the number of recorded daily infections in the UK reached anall-time high of 35,928 new cases,external. The figure is nearly twice the number of cases - 18,447 - reported a week ago. However, it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring, with testing capacity too limited at the time to detect the true number of daily cases. Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""This sharp and sudden increase is of serious concern. ""Most of the new cases reported today are concentrated in London and the South East, although it is too early to tell if this is linked to the new variant."" A growing number of countries have banned travel from the UK- including Ireland, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands - over the new variant. The government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group estimates this variant could increase the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by between 0.4 and 0.9,newly released minutes show,external. Wales locks down as Christmas plans cut What is tier four and who is in it? Should you see your family at Christmas? 'I won't have next summer let alone next Christmas' Some 21 million people in England and Wales who entered new restrictions at midnight are being told to stay at home, while non-essential shops and businesses have to close. The planned relaxation of rules for Christmas has been scrapped for those under England's toughest new tier four measures, while in the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, relaxed indoor mixing rules over the holidays have been cut from five days to Christmas Day only. Mr Hancock said it was ""important for everybody to act like they might have the virus"" because we need to bring the new variant ""under control"". He added: ""Of course we don't want to cancel Christmas... we don't want to take any of these measures, but it's our duty to take them when the evidence is clear."" The health secretary said he did not know how long the tier four measures would be in place but ""it may be for some time, until we can get the vaccine going"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party supported the latest restrictions but he accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""gross negligence"" in failing to act earlier. Residents in tier four are being asked to stay at home unless for essential journeys, while people in other tiers are advised not to travel into the new tier four areas. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was very important that people followed the new travel guidance in England and ""do not attempt to travel"", saying extra British Transport Police officers were being deployed. A ban on travel between Scotland and the rest of the UK will also apply over the festive period. Police Scotland saidit would be doubling its patrols on the borders but it would not be introducing check points. Scotland's restrictions willonly be relaxed on Christmas Day, with mainland Scotland being placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. Wales has also entered a new shutdown, with the health minister sayingthe new variant was ""seeded"" in every part. In Northern Ireland, where the planned relaxation of rules for Christmas is going ahead unchanged,four of the five main parties have called for an urgent meeting to discuss the restrictions. This video can not be played Starmer: Boris Johnson ""has once again been caught behind the curve"" The PM's announcement of new restrictions came just days after he defended plans to relax restrictions for five days during the festive period - despite calls by some in the medical profession to scrap the change. Sir Keir told an online press conference that it was ""blatantly obvious last week"" that Mr Johnson's plans to relax the rules over Christmas was ""a risk too far"", adding that his claim that ""this is all down to a new form of the virus that has just emerged does not stand up to scrutiny"". He said the ""alarm bells have been ringing for weeks"" with rising infections and the NHS reaching capacity in some parts of the country ""but the prime minister chose to ignore"" it. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What do tier four restrictions mean for sport? NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' London Mayor Sadiq Khan told BBC Breakfast the ""11th-hour announcement is a bitter blow"" for families and businesses, saying it is the ""chop-change, stop-start, that's led to so much anguish, despair, sadness and disappointment"". He urged Londoners to follow the rules which he said had been brought in ""for a very good reason"", adding that the NHS had told him that hospitals in London had as many Covid patients this weekend as they did at the peak of the virus in April. Tier four restrictions: Similar to England's second national lockdown - tier four applies to Kent, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey (excluding Waverley), Gosport, Havant, Portsmouth, Rother and Hastings. It also applies in London (all 32 boroughs and the City of London) and the east of England (Bedford, Central Bedford, Milton Keynes, Luton, Peterborough, Hertfordshire and Essex (excluding Colchester, Uttlesford and Tendring). Residents told to stay at home, with exemptions for those who have to travel for work or education Household mixing indoors is not allowed, unless you live with them, or they are part of your existing support bubble All non-essential retail to close, including hairdressers, nail bars, indoor gyms and leisure facilities Social mixing cut to meeting one person in an open public space Communal religious worship is still allowed The measures will be reviewed on 30 December. Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, said they alerted the government on Friday that the new variant - first identified in the middle of October from a sample taken in September - was spreading faster than other viruses circulating. Dr Hopkins told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that there was evidence that people with the new strain had ""higher viral loads"" - which meant they were more infectious. She also said findings had shown the new variant was up to 70% more transmissible based on modelling the rate of increase in the new strain compared to others in circulation.

"Sixty nine more Covid deaths and 2,334 new casesThere were 34 deaths in the Cwm Taf health board area alone, Public Health Wales data shows.Wales","There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

'We organised our wedding in 2 hours to beat tier 4',"""I've never in my life felt so much love and felt so grateful,"" Chloe Collins said A couple rearranged their wedding in just two hours to ensure they tied the knot before London went into tier four. Chloe Collins, 31, and Jamie Collins, 29, were due to marry on 6 September, but had reorganised three times due to changing coronavirus restrictions. Mrs Collins said ""our hearts sank"" when Boris Johnson announced on Saturday anew tier-four lockdown across south-east Englandwould start on Sunday. The couple were married at 22:00 GMT on Saturday at Edgware United Synagogue. ""I've never in my life felt so much love and felt so grateful,"" Mrs Collins, a lettings negotiator, said. The couple were allowed 15 guests but ""over 100 people logged on to Zoom to watch us"". ""We felt the love, and it felt like they were there,"" Mrs Collins said. The couple were married at Edgware United Synagogue Estate agent Mr Collins said their wedding had been planned with 130 guests at a country estate-turned-hotel in Watford. When coronavirus restrictions meant only 15 guests could attend weddings, the couple moved venue and planned for a wedding on 22 November. They then rearranged for 20 December, after a four week-England wide lockdown came into force through November. Mrs Collins said she ""felt physically sick"" as the prime minister announced new tier four restrictions on Saturday afternoon. ""Our rabbi had the idea to bring the wedding forward,"" Mr Collins said. ""We just started calling people to see what we could do, and the more calls we made the more people said 'yes'. ""It was a miracle that it just kind of came together. It felt like a dream. Some people take years to plan a wedding, but we did it in two hours."" Mr Collins's best man drove more than two hours to attend the wedding, before ""getting back in his car and driving home"", the couple said. Under tier four guidelines, weddings and civil partnerships are only allowed under ""exceptional circumstances"", such as if one partner is seriously ill and not expected to recover. Since the wedding, the couple, from Watford, have been inundated with messages. ""I've been welling up with messages from people who aren't my close friends saying it was amazing,"" Mrs Collins said. ""I think it's just nice to hear nice news for a change."" When will all wedding restrictions be lifted?

'Stop-start Covid rules cost shops Â£2bn a week',"The government's ""stop-start"" Covid restrictions will cost retailers a further Â£2bn a week in lost sales, according to an industry group. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said it recognised the government had ""difficult decisions to make"" to stop the spread of Covid-19. But it said placing large parts of England into tougher tier four restrictions was ""hugely regrettable"". ""The consequences of this decision will be severe,"" it added. Under the tier four rules, all but essential shops in south-east and eastern England, including London, have been forced to shut just as the retail sector gears up for the key Christmas trading period. Non-essential shops in England had just emerged from closure during a second national lockdown in November when retail sales fell 3.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics. In Wales,a lockdown means non-essential shopswere also forced to shut from Sunday. All of mainland Scotlandwill be placed under the tightest restrictionsfrom 26 December, which includes the closure of non-essential shops. What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Queues form ahead of last-minute lockdown Wales locks down as Christmas plans cut The BRC's chief executive Helen Dickinson said retailers now face losing Â£2bn per week in sales for the third time this year. ""Many businesses will be in serious difficulty and many thousands of jobs could be at risk,"" she said. Ian Morris, owner of the Map Gift Shop in North London started a click and collect service after his shop was forced to shut ahead of what should have been his busiest week of the year, and a crucial one, he told the BBC. ""We plan Christmas from January onwards,"" he said. ""Our Christmas stock will have to go in a sale. There's nothing else we can do with it.""

Its chief executive, Jasmine Whitbread, said: ""So many people now find their holiday plans cancelled at the eleventh hour, while the closure of non-essential retail could see many businesses go under."" Retailers selling Christmas trees are considered essential Despite the new rules coming into force so close to Christmas, supermarket group Waitrose said it did not expect any major changes in people's shopping habits. ""We expect that customers will take the rest of the weekend to figure out what this means for their festive plans and it will be next week before we see any impact,"" it said. ""However, at this late change we are not expecting a profound change in shopping behaviour."" Tesco advised customers not to purchase more than they need to. ""In the run-up to Christmas we want to reassure our customers that we have good availability, so there's no need for customers to buy more than they need,"" said a spokesman for Tesco. ""We will do our best to make sure our customers can enjoy themselves this year and encourage everyone to continue shopping safely and responsibly.""

"'I won't have next summer, let alone next Christmas'","The last-minute change to Covid rules for Christmas has affected millions. Large parts of south-east England will not have the rules relaxed at all, and the rest of England, Scotland and Wales will see them relaxed for just Christmas Day. For some people, this news is an inconvenience. For others, it is a disaster. For Lesley Nelson, who has terminal cancer, it is simply ""not fair"". ""I am terminally ill,"" she said. ""This is likely to be my last Christmas."" ""I've spent the last two Christmases in hospital. I have a small family. We had planned a quiet Christmas as normal - just me, my two sons, my mum and my sister. ""They are all taking care not to mix for the week before. I only see my sister two or three times a year, so this Christmas is important."" What is tier four and who is in it? Should you see your family at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live While she will still be able to see her mum and two sons, Lesley says this may have been her last chance to spend Christmas with her sister. ""I cannot say 'never mind, there's always next year' because there may not be for me. ""I have no idea when I will see my sister again. She was in my Christmas bubble. ""She lives in a tier four area and is on her own. She's been isolating for a week, so there's no risk at all. ""I understand what the government is doing to stop the virus, but sure they must be able to make exceptions?"" Lesley and her husband Ian Like many others who contacted the BBC, Lawrence in north London wanted to express his frustration that the announcement came without much notice. He was due to get married on 23 December but is bracing himself for the register office telling him it can no longer go ahead due to tier four restrictions being put in place. ""My wedding is up in the air,"" he said. ""I have emailed the register office in north London and am waiting to see what they say. ""I'll be upset but it won't be the end of the world because it will take place at some point. ""The wedding not going ahead will see us out of pocket by about Â£500-600. It's not the expense, it's the inconvenience of not having it on the day we want it. This video can not be played 'Tier 4 residents must stay at home' as PM announces tighter restrictions ""I wish the announcement had been done earlier. It's going to affect a lot of people. It's going to affect the lonely and the vulnerable - they are not going to see anyone this Christmas. And what it will do for people's mental health is another matter. ""The government could have done things earlier."" Jonathan Barnes, 40, in Suffolk is facing the prospect of a Christmas alone following the announcement of the Welsh lockdown. ""I'm married with two young children,"" he said. ""Our parents live in Pembrokeshire and we live in Suffolk. ""My wife's mum has a very short period of time left to live so they have gone down to Wales before me to spend some quality time with her. ""I was planning to join on Wednesday after work for the five days over Christmas. The new lockdown in Wales means I shouldn't join my family and instead will be stuck at home in tier two on my own."" His mother-in-law has terminal cancer. And while he says he wants to see her, he thinks it is important to ""err on the side of caution"". ""It's not about getting away with it,"" he said. ""It's about doing the right thing."" ""I'm thinking the wisest thing to do is to spend Christmas alone. ""To announce a Welsh lockdown immediately gives no-one time to plan. The government shouldn't have announced the relaxation of the rules over Christmas originally. ""If they'd have said Christmas is locked down people would have adjusted to that early on. I'm disappointed to be spending Christmas alone but I understand the reasons why.""

Grenfell 'whistleblower' refusing to give evidence,"A self-described whistleblower at the company which made the cladding used on Grenfell Tower has refused new requests to give evidence to the public inquiry. Claude Wehrle, who worked for Arconic, says he fears he might breach a law in France which prevents evidence being given to proceedings abroad. An inquiry letter seen by the BBC reveals he is one of at least two employees who are holding out. Seventy-two people were killed in the fire in North Kensington in June 2017. The inquiry is now in its second phase and is examining the causes of the fire, including how the Grenfell Tower came to be in a condition which allowed the blaze to spread in the way it did. Cladding inspections uncover other fire risks No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Last month, Mr Wehrle told the BBC, working jointly with CBS, that he could not speak without permission from Arconic's lawyers. Arconic says that is not true. Though Mr Wehrle no longer works at the US company, when contacted by phone in November in France, he claimed that law firm DLA Piper was influencing his decisions. ""DLA Piper is handling everything,"" he said. ""Everything has to go through them."" ""I am a good soldier and I follow what is asked of me, and on this point, it is very touchy and important for me to follow the rules."" DLA Piper is an international law firm which is representing Arconic and its current employees during investigations by the Grenfell Tower Inquiry and the Metropolitan Police Service. A joint investigation by the BBC and CBS News has uncovered emails suggesting the firm was handling legal approaches to Mr Wehrle earlier this year. However, in a statement, DLA Piper said it was no longer advising ""certain other individuals associated with [Arconic's architectural subsidiary] AAP SAS in France"". Arconic has been paying for Mr Wehrle to have legal representation since July but stressed that it did not have any influence over his decisions. Another firm in France, Navacelle Law, said it was now representing him independently. Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle Hesham Rahman in the fire, delivered a letter of protest to the French Embassy this week A letter to ""core participants"" of the inquiry, seen by the BBC, reveals Mr Wehrle is one of at least two former employees of the cladding manufacturer Arconic who remain intent on not giving oral evidence. That is despite a statement this week by the French government. It said there was no reason for any French citizen to fear criminalisation at the Grenfell Tower Inquiry. When the BBC spoke to Mr Wehrle in November he said ""my target is not, and will never be, to go against Arconic"". ""It is awful what happened, for sure, but... the fire didn't only have one cause.  It is linked to a lot of events that happened one after the other."" Mr Wherle said he had given the inquiry ""as much as possible, I gave many, many, many exchanges of emails"". When asked whether he felt that he had done the right thing by raising concerns internally he said, ""that's for sure."" ""In French we say ""donner d'alert"". I don't know if you know what I mean by this: whistleblower."" ""That was my role and it was a difficult situation, trust me,"" he said. Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle Hesham Rahman in the fire, delivered a letter of protest to the French Embassy this week. ""We need these people to come to the country and tell the truth. It's in the interest of public safety,"" he said. ""Thousands of people are living in homes with the material that caused the spread of the fire and caused the deaths of their families and they must come here in the interest of public safety. ""They must come and tell the truth so we make sure that this never happens again."" Mr Wehrle was a technical manager at Arconic and his testimony is central to the inquiry's investigations into why flammable cladding was installed on the tower. His knowledge of concerns within the company goes back at least as far as 2010. During this period Arconic tested its Reynobond PE aluminium cladding product and found it to have worse performance than expected when exposed to fire. In an email that year to colleagues, Mr Wehrle said that his company's concerns about the performance of the cladding were something""we have to keep as VERY CONFIDENTIAL"",external. The BBC has alsopreviously revealedthat he emailed customers in 2015 to warn them that according to the new tests the cladding used at Grenfell Tower had a fire rating of class E, on a scale from A1 to F. In the email he said he was attempting to address ""concerns about the product's fire reaction class in the UK"". However, Arconic did not inform the body which issues product specification certificates in the UK. The company says it was not responsible for designing cladding systems which used its product or for ensuring they met the requirements of the building regulations. Mr Wehrle has failed to respond to recent approaches from the BBC.

Cardinal Pell: 'My views drove public against me',"Cardinal Pell had always maintained his innocence George Pell, the Australian cardinal whose conviction for child abuse was overturned this year, has said his conservative Christian views drove public opinion against him. Speaking to the BBC, the 79-year-old said there was ""no doubt"" that his direct style and traditional approach to issues such as abortion had contributed to a hostile atmosphere. The former Vatican treasurer said he would not apologise for those views. His case rocked the Catholic Church. The cardinal, who had been one of the Pope's most senior advisers and always maintained his innocence, had left the Vatican in 2017 to fight the charges against him in his home state of Victoria. Cardinal Pell meets Pope Francis for first time since acquittal Court quashes Cardinal Pell's abuse conviction In his first broadcast interview in the UK, Cardinal Pell said he would not apologise for his conservative views, but had said sorry ""many times"" for the Church's crimes of sexual abuse. ""I think my style is rather direct - the fact that I defend Christian teachings - is irritating to a lot of people,"" he told BBC's Radio 4's Sunday programme. ""For my basic Christian positions I make no apology at all."" Asked about the victims of child abuse and what it must be like living with the consequences of what happened to them, Cardinal Pell said he was ""very much aware of their suffering"". He said that while he regretted what had happened within the Church, he was ""able to sleep quite well on most occasions"". ""I deeply lament the suffering of so many people, but I am also proud of the efforts that we have made in Australia for over 25 years - as inadequate as those might have been."" Cardinal Pell also likened his time in segregation in prison to being in a seminary, where those training to be priests used to endure periods of silence and isolation. The Australian cleric rose in prominence as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, often taking conservative views and advocating for priestly celibacy. He was summoned to Rome in 2014 to clean up the Vatican's finances, and was often described as the Church's third-ranked official. He left his post as Vatican treasurer in 2017 to contest accusations that he had sexually abused two choir boys when he was Archbishop of Melbourne. In December 2018, a jury found him guilty of sexually abusing the two 13-year-old choir boys in the mid-1990s. He was the highest-ranking Catholic figure to receive such a conviction. The trial heard testimony from a man alleged to be the sole surviving victim. Dozens of other witnesses provided alibis and other evidence. Cardinal Pell appealed against the verdict in Victoria's Court of Appeal last year, but three judges upheld the decision by a 2-1 majority. The High Court of Australia quashed the verdict in April, bringing an immediate end to Cardinal Pell's six-year jail sentence. In his appeal to the High Court, the cleric argued that the jury's verdict had relied too heavily on evidence from the surviving victim. His lawyers did not try to discredit that testimony, but argued that other evidence had not been properly considered. This video can not be played Australian court frees Cardinal Pell The court's seven judges ruled unanimously in his favour, and said in their verdict that other testimonies had introduced ""a reasonable possibility that the offending had not taken place"". Cardinal Pell said at the time that an injustice had been ""remedied"", and that he held ""no ill will to my accuser"". He met Pope Francis in October for the first time since his conviction for child sexual abuse was overturned. 'Madness': Pell's police interview released.

WHO 'in contact with UK' over new virus spread,"There is no current evidence to suggest that the new variant is affected any differently by vaccines The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is in ""close contact"" with UK officials over the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus. The new variant is spreading more rapidly than the original version, but it is not believed to be more deadly. Along with the UK, the same mutation of the Covid-19 virus has also been detected in the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia, the WHO told the BBC. There is no evidence to suggest the new variant reacts differently to vaccines. In the UK, large parts of south-east England, including London, are now under a new, stricter level of restrictions in a bid to curb the rapidly spreading virus. New variant: How worried should we be? What is tier four and who is in it? On Sunday, European nations including Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium all announced a halt to flights and travel from the UK. The measures vary and are initially generally short-term. An EU meeting will be held on Monday morning to discuss a more co-ordinated response. Nations impose UK travel bans over new variant The Dutch move came after tests carried out on samples taken in the Netherlands earlier this month revealed the same new variant of coronavirus as that reported in the UK. Pending ""greater clarity"" on the situation in the UK, the Dutch government said that further ""risk of the new virus strain being introduced to the Netherlands should be minimised as much as possible"". The Dutch government also said it would work with other European Union member states in the coming days to ""explore the scope for further limiting the risk of the new strain of the virus being brought over from the UK"". Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove said that specialists had been ""following mutations across the world since the beginning of the pandemic"". The WHO said that it was in contact with UK officials over the new variant. It said the UK was sharing information from ongoing studies into the mutation, and that the WHO would update member states and the public ""as we learn more about the characteristics of this virus variant [and] any implications"". Although there is ""considerable uncertainty"", UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new variant may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old one. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the development was ""going to make things a lot worse"". He said, however, that there were ""really optimistic things if you look, once we get the vaccine out, assuming the vaccine works against this - which at the moment is the working assumption."" Officials say there is no current evidence to suggest the new variant causes a higher mortality rate or that it is affected any differently by vaccines and treatments. The WHO's senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, said nine instances of the same variant as seen in the UK had been reported in Denmark, with one case in Australia and one in the Netherlands. Several other countries had confirmed variants that ""carry some of the genetic changes seen in the UK"", Dr Smallwood added. Mutations of the virus are frequently identified, the WHO's Dr Van Kerkhove told the BBC, adding that it was important to understand ""what these variants do and how they behave"". In theUK,the planned relaxation of Covid rules to allow households to mix over the Christmas period has been scrapped for large parts of south-east England- affecting nearly 18 million people - and cut to just Christmas Day for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales.

Both are the highest numbers in the world,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external. Gen Perna apologised several times to state governors during a telephone briefing to reporters. He said he had given out the numbers of doses based on what he believed would be ready, stressing it was his personal fault. ""I'm the one who approved forecast sheets. I'm the one who approved allocations,"" he said. ""There is no problem with the process. There is no problem with the Pfizer vaccine. There is no problem with the Moderna vaccine. ""I failed. I'm adjusting. I'm fixing and we'll move forward from there."" This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered US media said some states had been told the doses they would get next week would be lower. The New York Times listed 14 states by name, including California, New Jersey and Michigan. Governor Jay Inslee of Washington state tweeted on Thursday: ""This is disruptive and frustrating. We need accurate, predictable numbers to plan and ensure on-the-ground success."" Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said the White House was ""slow-walking the process"". Gen Perna said: ""Please accept my personal apologies if this was disruptive to your decision-making."" Gen Perna said he did not know ""with exactness"" when all the vaccines available would be distributed. This video can not be played The day the US began Covid vaccinations The department of health and human services suggested the discrepancy could be between the number of doses manufactured, and the number actually ready for distribution, given that they have to undergo sterility and other tests. Gen Perna said the newly approved Moderna vaccine would begin shipping out on Sunday and that he was on track to get a combined total about 20 million doses of the vaccines to states by the first week of January. He said he hoped to get the system working ""flawlessly"". Both vaccines are said to be about 95% effective. The US vaccination programme aims to reach 100 million people by April. About 5% of the US population are known to have been infected since the pandemic began. Since mid-November, the seven-day rolling average of Covid-related deaths has soared from just over 1,000 to more than 2,500. A number of states are overwhelmed. California is struggling to find beds for patients - some 17,000 people are in hospital, double the previous high in July. About 130,000 people in the US have so far received vaccine shots in the biggest mass vaccination in US history. The first tranche of 2.9 million doses will go to frontline health-care workers and long-term care facility residents, although this initial tranche will not cover those two categories in full. Some 70%-80% of the US population of 328 million would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, officials believe. The other key problem is a $900bn (Â£665bn) coronavirus economic relief package that has been stalled by months of partisan wrangling. The latest stumbling block appears to be the complicated issue of emergency Federal Reserve powers. These are normally used to deal with market turmoil and the Republicans do not want Joe Biden to have the power to use them on Covid after he takes office on 20 January. Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted: ""We're right within reach.""

St Pancras crowds 'totally irresponsible'Large crowds were filmed at the London station hours before tier-four restrictions came into force.London,"Footage showed large crowds at St Pancras station hours before tier-four restrictions came into force. Londoners who crowded on to trains to leave the capital on Saturday night were ""totally irresponsible"", the health secretary has said. London has moved into tier-four restrictions, meaning it is illegal to leave the capital from 00.01 GMT Sunday unless for essential travel. Footage shared on social media showed large crowds at St Pancras station. Matt Hancock called for people to act responsibly but said the majority of people were abiding by the guidelines. The announcement of the new rules, shortly after 16.00 GMT on Saturday, prompted a rush to London's railway stations. By 19.00, there were no tickets available online from several stations including Paddington, Kings Cross and Euston. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At St Pancras, which connects south-east England with the East Midlands and North, several passengers told the BBC they were catching pre-booked trains and had not heard about the new rules being brought in. However one passenger, who did not wish to be named, said she and her partner had made the ""split decision"" to take their young son to her parents' home on the coast. ""We just made the decision to leave based on the fact that my parents said come, and we couldn't bear the thought of no fresh air and a toddler going rogue round a small flat for the foreseeable,"" she said. East Midlands Railway said it had run a full service on Saturday and only two of its 10 evening departures had been full. A spokesman for the railway apologised for any ""inconvenience and discomfort caused"" by the ""unexpected surge in passengers"". Some 21 million people are now under tier-four restrictions which ban households from mixing as well as requiring non-essential shops and businesses to close. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan criticised the government for making the announcement ""late"", following days of reassurances restrictions would be relaxed over the Christmas period. He said crowded stations were ""a direct consequence of the chaotic way the announcement was made"". Matt Hancock said only ""relatively small numbers"" were breaking the rules Mr Khan urged people in London and the South East to stay at home and avoid ""breaking the rules"". He said: ""Yesterday, technically speaking, you may not have been breaking the rules but you may well have the virus and not realise you've got the virus. ""Keep [the virus] within London, follow the rules and let's get on top of this."" Mr Hancock said only ""relatively small numbers"" were breaking the rules. ""The large, vast majority of people throughout this whole pandemic have followed the rules,"" he said.

Looming lockdown a 'hammer blow' for business,"Business leaders have called for an ""extraordinary"" package of support to keep businesses afloat as Scotland faces a looming lockdown. The Scottish Retail Consortium said closing shops could see retailers lose out on Â£135m per week in lost revenue. Tourism and hospitality leaders warned more support was needed urgently for business and their supply chains. One leading health expert, however, insisted the best way to help businesses was to ""crunch"" the virus. Prof Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, urged the rest of the UK to use Scotland's ""harsh lockdown"" as a model. What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? Scotland tightens Covid rules at Christmas Christmas rules tightened for millions From Boxing Day, mainland Scotland will be underlevel four restrictions,external- which mean the closure of non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms - for at least three weeks. The changes follow the revelation thata new strain of Covid could be 70% more transmissible than previous strains.,external So far 17 cases of the new strain had been identified in Scotland through genomic sequencing, but public health officials believe this is an underestimate of its true prevalence. The Scottish Tourism Alliance - in a letter to the first minister co-signed by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, UKHospitality and Scotland Food & Drink - said it understood a ""decisive response"" was needed. But chief executive Marc Crothall continued:  ""The ask of the industry is that the Scottish government now delivers a similarly swift and committed response to the economic consequences of this action."" He said much of the industry had already been ""decimated"" by the pandemic, and that for businesses to survive an ""additional upweighted extraordinary package of funding must urgently be identified from within the Scottish and UK budgets"". Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) director David Lonsdale earlier warned that the lockdown would come ""slap bang in the middle of peak trading - which so many are depending on to power their recovery and tide them over"". ""The government will need to offer additional financial support to help these businesses get back on an even keel,"" he added. SRC data indicates that over recent months non-food stores are consistently trading about a fifth down on last year. The retailers' trade association claimed many scientists thought closing non-essential retail would only have a ""very minimal impact"" on R values and reducing transmission of the virus. Where are the latest cases in Scotland? How worried should we be about the new Covid strain? This video can not be played David Lonsdale said shops needed ""total clarity"" on when they could reopen Stephen Leckie, of the Scottish Tourism Alliance,told Good Morning Scotlandclosing hospitality again would have a knock-on impact to the supply chain, with Christmas food and drink orders being cancelled. Mr Leckie, who owns the Crieff Hydro Hotel, said he now had to work out what he could offer guests on Christmas day, given that they would not be allowed to stay over on Christmas night. ""We had 30 or 40% bookings for the festive period about a month ago. That's dropped down to 10% now and we're likely to receive further cancellations this week if we remain open in any form."" Some of Scotland's leading health experts, meanwhile, have defended the strict measures as necessary to stop the new variant spreading rapidly. National Clinical Director Prof Jason Leitch said that while people from three households would still be allowed to meet indoors for Christmas Day, people should think carefully about whether it was worth the risk. Christmas bubbles should be used to ""help with social isolation and caring"" but not as an excuse to party at Christmas with people who you have missed, he said. While three households will remain the legal maximum, the official recommendation is that you should only join up with one other household if it is essential in order to reduce loneliness and isolation. Prof Leitch said the new and more transmissible strain of Covid appeared to have a higher reproduction rate than previous strains. He said: ""We think the R number for this version is 0.4 more than the R number for the other one if you just let it run wild. ""So imagine you have an R number right now of 0.9 - you think you are doing well, numbers are falling, everybody is transmitting to fewer than one other person, you are on the right path, then you get this dominant strain and your R number overnight goes to 1.3 and you get exponential growth and you are in big trouble."" Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University and a Scottish government adviser, said measures to ""really crunch"" down on the virus were the best way to help the economy. ""We have got to eliminate as much as possible to the lowest level of this virus because that is how we will reopen our economy,""she told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday,external. ""Scotland was already running a lower infection rate but to go into quite a harsh lockdown over the holiday period, to extend the school holidays, to really try to get those numbers low, I think, I would hope the rest of the UK would follow that model, which is we have got to really crunch this."" Scotland's interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, disclosed new details of why the new variant was able to spread more rapidly. In response to a tweet asking if current hygiene advice was adequate, he replied: ""From what we know so far, it appears that the mutations may allow it to bind to cells and gain entry more easily when we come into contact with it. ""But all the other advice on distancing, coverings and hand hygiene still stands and still offers protection."" VACCINE:When will Scots get it? LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Border police patrols to double after travel banPolice Scotland says more officers will be deployed but there are no plans for check points or road blocks.South Scotland,"Police patrols will be stepped up but road blocks are not envisaged Police patrols on Scotland's borders are to be doubled but there are no plans for checkpoints or road blocks. Police Scotland's chief constable said he expected roads to be quieter in the coming days and that most people would ""do the right thing"". But Iain Livingstone ruled out setting up checkpoints, saying they were not ""appropriate"" or ""proportionate"". The first minister announced on Saturday that cross-border travel would be banned for the festive period. Lockdown looms at Scotland tightens Christmas rules What are the level four restrictions? Nicola Sturgeon saidtighter travel rules were essential, along with a number of extra measures,to prevent a new variant of Covid-19 spreading rapidly. There are only a limited number of specific exemptions to the law. In addition to the cross-border travel ban, the whole of Scotland will move into either level four or level three Covid restrictions from 26 December, meaning people are only allowed to make essential journeys outside their council area. The chief constable said he had compassion for all those affected by ""highly restrictive measures"" but insisted they were ""absolutely necessary"" to save lives. ""Following the announcement by the first minister, there can be no doubt that, other than for the most essential journeys, people should not be travelling between Scotland and other parts of the UK,"" he said. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said policing of travel restrictions must be ""proportionate"" Mr Livingstone said the increase in Covid alert levels from midnight on 26 December amounted to a ""blanket ban"" for mainland Scotland. But he added: ""I remain clear I do not consider it appropriate or proportionate for officers to establish check points or road blocks to simply enforce travel restrictions ""These restrictions are a preventative measure to halt the progress of Covid and Police Scotland will support this approach with a strong operational profile to deter those who would put others at risk. ""Today, I have authorised the doubling of our operational presence in the border areas of Scotland."" He said the force's experience throughout the pandemic was that the ""overwhelming majority"" of people had ""demonstrated personal responsibility to do the right thing"". He added: ""It is the consent of the public from which policing in Scotland draws its legitimacy. As our communities expect, where officers encounter wilful, persistent or flagrant breaches we will act decisively to enforce the law."" British Transport Police have also boosted the number of officers at stations across the UK's rail network. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said: ""As has been the case throughout the pandemic, officers will be supporting rail staff through high-visibility patrols across England, Scotland and Wales, ensuring those on the network are safe. ""Our policing method remains the same - officers will engage with passengers and only use enforcement if absolutely necessary. ""Anyone planning a journey over the festive period is urged to consider whether travelling is essential and encouraged to stay at home as per latest Government advice.""

"Grenfell 'whistleblower' refusing to give evidenceClaude Wehrle is one of at least two cladding firm workers holding out, a letter seen by the BBC reveals.","A self-described whistleblower at the company which made the cladding used on Grenfell Tower has refused new requests to give evidence to the public inquiry. Claude Wehrle, who worked for Arconic, says he fears he might breach a law in France which prevents evidence being given to proceedings abroad. An inquiry letter seen by the BBC reveals he is one of at least two employees who are holding out. Seventy-two people were killed in the fire in North Kensington in June 2017. The inquiry is now in its second phase and is examining the causes of the fire, including how the Grenfell Tower came to be in a condition which allowed the blaze to spread in the way it did. Cladding inspections uncover other fire risks No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Last month, Mr Wehrle told the BBC, working jointly with CBS, that he could not speak without permission from Arconic's lawyers. Arconic says that is not true. Though Mr Wehrle no longer works at the US company, when contacted by phone in November in France, he claimed that law firm DLA Piper was influencing his decisions. ""DLA Piper is handling everything,"" he said. ""Everything has to go through them."" ""I am a good soldier and I follow what is asked of me, and on this point, it is very touchy and important for me to follow the rules."" DLA Piper is an international law firm which is representing Arconic and its current employees during investigations by the Grenfell Tower Inquiry and the Metropolitan Police Service. A joint investigation by the BBC and CBS News has uncovered emails suggesting the firm was handling legal approaches to Mr Wehrle earlier this year. However, in a statement, DLA Piper said it was no longer advising ""certain other individuals associated with [Arconic's architectural subsidiary] AAP SAS in France"". Arconic has been paying for Mr Wehrle to have legal representation since July but stressed that it did not have any influence over his decisions. Another firm in France, Navacelle Law, said it was now representing him independently. Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle Hesham Rahman in the fire, delivered a letter of protest to the French Embassy this week A letter to ""core participants"" of the inquiry, seen by the BBC, reveals Mr Wehrle is one of at least two former employees of the cladding manufacturer Arconic who remain intent on not giving oral evidence. That is despite a statement this week by the French government. It said there was no reason for any French citizen to fear criminalisation at the Grenfell Tower Inquiry. When the BBC spoke to Mr Wehrle in November he said ""my target is not, and will never be, to go against Arconic"". ""It is awful what happened, for sure, but... the fire didn't only have one cause.  It is linked to a lot of events that happened one after the other."" Mr Wherle said he had given the inquiry ""as much as possible, I gave many, many, many exchanges of emails"". When asked whether he felt that he had done the right thing by raising concerns internally he said, ""that's for sure."" ""In French we say ""donner d'alert"". I don't know if you know what I mean by this: whistleblower."" ""That was my role and it was a difficult situation, trust me,"" he said. Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle Hesham Rahman in the fire, delivered a letter of protest to the French Embassy this week. ""We need these people to come to the country and tell the truth. It's in the interest of public safety,"" he said. ""Thousands of people are living in homes with the material that caused the spread of the fire and caused the deaths of their families and they must come here in the interest of public safety. ""They must come and tell the truth so we make sure that this never happens again."" Mr Wehrle was a technical manager at Arconic and his testimony is central to the inquiry's investigations into why flammable cladding was installed on the tower. His knowledge of concerns within the company goes back at least as far as 2010. During this period Arconic tested its Reynobond PE aluminium cladding product and found it to have worse performance than expected when exposed to fire. In an email that year to colleagues, Mr Wehrle said that his company's concerns about the performance of the cladding were something""we have to keep as VERY CONFIDENTIAL"",external. The BBC has alsopreviously revealedthat he emailed customers in 2015 to warn them that according to the new tests the cladding used at Grenfell Tower had a fire rating of class E, on a scale from A1 to F. In the email he said he was attempting to address ""concerns about the product's fire reaction class in the UK"". However, Arconic did not inform the body which issues product specification certificates in the UK. The company says it was not responsible for designing cladding systems which used its product or for ensuring they met the requirements of the building regulations. Mr Wehrle has failed to respond to recent approaches from the BBC.

Cardinal Pell: 'My views drove public against me'The ex-Vatican treasurer was acquitted of child sexual abuse and released from prison this year.,"Cardinal Pell had always maintained his innocence George Pell, the Australian cardinal whose conviction for child abuse was overturned this year, has said his conservative Christian views drove public opinion against him. Speaking to the BBC, the 79-year-old said there was ""no doubt"" that his direct style and traditional approach to issues such as abortion had contributed to a hostile atmosphere. The former Vatican treasurer said he would not apologise for those views. His case rocked the Catholic Church. The cardinal, who had been one of the Pope's most senior advisers and always maintained his innocence, had left the Vatican in 2017 to fight the charges against him in his home state of Victoria. Cardinal Pell meets Pope Francis for first time since acquittal Court quashes Cardinal Pell's abuse conviction In his first broadcast interview in the UK, Cardinal Pell said he would not apologise for his conservative views, but had said sorry ""many times"" for the Church's crimes of sexual abuse. ""I think my style is rather direct - the fact that I defend Christian teachings - is irritating to a lot of people,"" he told BBC's Radio 4's Sunday programme. ""For my basic Christian positions I make no apology at all."" Asked about the victims of child abuse and what it must be like living with the consequences of what happened to them, Cardinal Pell said he was ""very much aware of their suffering"". He said that while he regretted what had happened within the Church, he was ""able to sleep quite well on most occasions"". ""I deeply lament the suffering of so many people, but I am also proud of the efforts that we have made in Australia for over 25 years - as inadequate as those might have been."" Cardinal Pell also likened his time in segregation in prison to being in a seminary, where those training to be priests used to endure periods of silence and isolation. The Australian cleric rose in prominence as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, often taking conservative views and advocating for priestly celibacy. He was summoned to Rome in 2014 to clean up the Vatican's finances, and was often described as the Church's third-ranked official. He left his post as Vatican treasurer in 2017 to contest accusations that he had sexually abused two choir boys when he was Archbishop of Melbourne. In December 2018, a jury found him guilty of sexually abusing the two 13-year-old choir boys in the mid-1990s. He was the highest-ranking Catholic figure to receive such a conviction. The trial heard testimony from a man alleged to be the sole surviving victim. Dozens of other witnesses provided alibis and other evidence. Cardinal Pell appealed against the verdict in Victoria's Court of Appeal last year, but three judges upheld the decision by a 2-1 majority. The High Court of Australia quashed the verdict in April, bringing an immediate end to Cardinal Pell's six-year jail sentence. In his appeal to the High Court, the cleric argued that the jury's verdict had relied too heavily on evidence from the surviving victim. His lawyers did not try to discredit that testimony, but argued that other evidence had not been properly considered. This video can not be played Australian court frees Cardinal Pell The court's seven judges ruled unanimously in his favour, and said in their verdict that other testimonies had introduced ""a reasonable possibility that the offending had not taken place"". Cardinal Pell said at the time that an injustice had been ""remedied"", and that he held ""no ill will to my accuser"". He met Pope Francis in October for the first time since his conviction for child sexual abuse was overturned. 'Madness': Pell's police interview released.

Scotland tightens Covid rules at ChristmasRules will only be relaxed for one day at Christmas and mainland Scotland will then be placed under tighter restrictions.Scotland,"This video can not be played Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made the changes to restrictions in the wake of a new faster-spreading variant of Covid Covid restrictions will only be relaxed on Christmas Day and mainland Scotland will then be placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said ""firm preventative action"" was needed after the emergence of a faster-spreading strain of coronavirus. It had been planned to ease the rules between 23 and 27 December - but that will now only apply on Christmas Day. A ban on travel to the rest of the UK will apply over the festive period. Scotland's toughest level four rules will come into effect across mainland Scotland from 26 December. Until then, local authority areas are expected to remain under their current level of restrictions. Live coverage of the first minister's briefing What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? Christmas rules tightened for millions Schools will return later than originally planned after the Christmas holidays. Ms Sturgeon said they should resume from 11 January, with learning taking place online until at least 18 January. Thelevel four restrictions,external- which mean the closure of non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms - will last for three weeks. They will apply across Scotland, with the exception of Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and other island communities where restrictions have recently been reduced. These areas will be placed inlevel three,external. The first minister said,externaldecisive action was required because of a new strain of Covid which public health officials believe could be 70% more transmissible than previous strains. At this stage she said there was no evidence to suggest the new strain made people sicker than earlier variants, or that it would change the effectiveness of the vaccine. The new variant was first seen in mid-September in London and Kent - but by December it had become the ""dominant variant"" in London. Government advisers believe the new variant could increase the R number - or reproductive rate of the virus - by 0.4 or more. Ms Sturgeon said the speed at which it could spread meant this was ""probably the most serious and potentially dangerous juncture we have faced"" in the pandemic. But, she said Scotland still had the opportunity to act on a preventative basis. Where are the latest cases in Scotland? How worried should we be about the new Covid strain? So far 17 cases of the new strain had been identified in Scotland through genomic sequencing. ""We do not yet know how widely this new strain of virus is circulating in Scotland, but I think we have to be realistic that that is likely to be an understatement of its true prevalence right now,"" she added. There was a ""concern"", however, that this strain may be driving what appears to be faster transmission of Covid in some hospitals and care homes. Covid figures published at 14:00 on Saturday,externalshowed Scotland had recorded 41 new deaths and 572 positive tests over the previous 24 hours. The first minister said Scotland's case numbers did not look as bad as those elsewhere in the UK, and that she understood why people might not understand that these steps were necessary. But she said the new strain of the virus could very quickly ""overwhelm us"". ""Please believe me when I tell you... I would not be standing here on the Saturday before Christmas announcing this if I did not think this was necessary,"" Ms Sturgeon added. Scotland has the lowest case rate in the UK, with 112.6 cases per 100,000 of the population. This compares with 571.7 in Wales, 219.6 in England and 174.9 in Northern Ireland. Restrictions have also been tightened up over the Christmas period in England and Wales. The planned relaxation of the rules has beenscrapped for large parts of south-east England, and cut to just Christmas Day for the rest of England and Wales.A fourth tier has also been created for some of the worst affected areas in England. The first minister said maintaining a ""strict travel ban"" would prevent more of the new strain entering Scotland from other parts of the UK, and reduce the risk of it spreading further within Scotland. This ban will remain in place throughout the festive period, meaning that cross-border travel will only be allowed for essential purposes. Ms Sturgeon said she would be asking the police to consider how the enforcement of the ban could be strengthened. Indoor mixing will be allowed on Christmas Day only. A maximum of eight people from three households will be allowed in law but theadvice is to keep numbers to a minimum,external, celebrate in your own home, and meet others outdoors. But Ms Sturgeon said: ""If you can't make it there and back in the same day, please don't go - and we're asking you not even to do that unless you feel there is genuinely no alternative."" Police Scotland said they would not be routinely stopping vehicles or setting up road blocks. ""However, officers may in the course of their duties come across people who are travelling from one local authority area to another,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs. ""Where travel restrictions apply, officers will continue to use the common sense, discretion and excellent judgement that they have applied since the crisis began."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said families would be ""devastated"", but that he understood why the restrictions were necessary. ""None of us want this, but these sacrifices will save lives,"" he said. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the Scottish government needed to publish ""persuasive evidence"" to avert a ""heightened risk of non-compliance"". The Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens both backed the moves, while calling for schools to close early for Christmas. VACCINE:When will Scots get it?

"WHO 'in contact with UK' over new virus variantThe new variant that spreads more rapidly has also been found in the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia.World","There is no current evidence to suggest that the new variant is affected any differently by vaccines The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is in ""close contact"" with UK officials over the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus. The new variant is spreading more rapidly than the original version, but it is not believed to be more deadly. Along with the UK, the same mutation of the Covid-19 virus has also been detected in the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia, the WHO told the BBC. There is no evidence to suggest the new variant reacts differently to vaccines. In the UK, large parts of south-east England, including London, are now under a new, stricter level of restrictions in a bid to curb the rapidly spreading virus. New variant: How worried should we be? What is tier four and who is in it? On Sunday, European nations including Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium all announced a halt to flights and travel from the UK. The measures vary and are initially generally short-term. An EU meeting will be held on Monday morning to discuss a more co-ordinated response. Nations impose UK travel bans over new variant The Dutch move came after tests carried out on samples taken in the Netherlands earlier this month revealed the same new variant of coronavirus as that reported in the UK. Pending ""greater clarity"" on the situation in the UK, the Dutch government said that further ""risk of the new virus strain being introduced to the Netherlands should be minimised as much as possible"". The Dutch government also said it would work with other European Union member states in the coming days to ""explore the scope for further limiting the risk of the new strain of the virus being brought over from the UK"". Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove said that specialists had been ""following mutations across the world since the beginning of the pandemic"". The WHO said that it was in contact with UK officials over the new variant. It said the UK was sharing information from ongoing studies into the mutation, and that the WHO would update member states and the public ""as we learn more about the characteristics of this virus variant [and] any implications"". Although there is ""considerable uncertainty"", UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new variant may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old one. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the development was ""going to make things a lot worse"". He said, however, that there were ""really optimistic things if you look, once we get the vaccine out, assuming the vaccine works against this - which at the moment is the working assumption."" Officials say there is no current evidence to suggest the new variant causes a higher mortality rate or that it is affected any differently by vaccines and treatments. The WHO's senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, said nine instances of the same variant as seen in the UK had been reported in Denmark, with one case in Australia and one in the Netherlands. Several other countries had confirmed variants that ""carry some of the genetic changes seen in the UK"", Dr Smallwood added. Mutations of the virus are frequently identified, the WHO's Dr Van Kerkhove told the BBC, adding that it was important to understand ""what these variants do and how they behave"". In theUK,the planned relaxation of Covid rules to allow households to mix over the Christmas period has been scrapped for large parts of south-east England- affecting nearly 18 million people - and cut to just Christmas Day for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales.

"Wales locks down as Christmas plans cutAll of Wales is under strict lockdown rules from Sunday, with only one day of mixing at Christmas.Wales","This video can not be played Mark Drakeford: New virus variant is ""more aggressive, spreads more quickly and affects more people"" A Wales-wide lockdown has been brought forward to Sunday with festive plans cancelled for all but Christmas Day. First Minister Mark Drakeford told people to ""stay at home"" after urgent talks with ministersover a new variant of coronavirus. Plans to relax rules from 23 to 27 December to allow people to celebrate with loved-ones have been scrapped. Meeting up is now limited to Christmas Day. Announcing the new measures, meaning people have to stay at home and only go out for essential reasons, Mr Drakeford said hundreds of people had already contracted the new, ""more aggressive"" variant of the virus in Wales. ""While we all want to avoid further disruption to businesses and plans for Christmas, our overriding duty is to protect lives here in Wales,"" he said. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Q&A: Which rules are changing and when? What's the advice on travelling over Christmas? The changes mean the Wales-wide lockdown, which was due to come into effect from 28 December, has been brought forward. Boris Johnson has announced similar rules in England for Christmas, as well as tier four restrictionsfor London and the south east of England. In Scotland,Covid restrictions will only be relaxed for one day at Christmasand mainland Scotland will be placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. From Sunday, all of Wales is in the highest level of lockdown -level four,external- with all but essential shops closed, and people being told to ""stay home"" to save lives. Gyms and beauty salons and non-essential shops will have to close at the end of trading today, while bars and restaurants will only be able to open for takeaways, and people will only be allowed to travel for ""essential reasons"". During the level four lockdown period people will not be allowed to mix with anyone they do not live with, with only single person households allowed to form an exclusive support bubble with one other household. From 23 to 27 December restrictions had been due to be eased to allow people from two households in Wales to meet - plus a single person household. But now this period of relaxed rules has been cancelled, for all but Christmas Day. On Christmas Day people will be able meet others to form a so-called ""Christmas bubble"", but people are being advised not to as cases continue to rise. If you live in Wales, you will be able to travel to meet one other household - and a single person household - on Christmas Day anywhere in Wales. You can also leave Wales to meet your household, subject to the local restrictions in the area you would be travelling to. But the rules say you would need to be back at your own home by the end of the day. What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What are the different rules around the UK? Mr Drakeford said people who had already made plans to meet another household on Christmas Day had to do it ""sensibly and in line with the rules"". Leanne Miller, from Swansea, said the news had left her family's Christmas plans in tatters. ""I've got two boys, 12 and 13, and we were supposed to see my husband's mum and dad. But the important thing is keeping them safe,"" she said. The Welsh Government heldan emergency cabinet meetingon Saturday after serious concerns over a new strain of coronavirus, which has been confirmed in Wales. Prime Minister Boris Johnsonhas introduced tougher rules for London and south-east Englandfor Christmas, in response to rising cases. Shortly afterwards, Mr Drakeford announced the changes for Wales, saying: ""We now know that this new strain is significantly more infectious and spreads more quickly than the original one. ""Throughout the public health emergency, we have had to respond quickly to the rapid changes, which have been so typical of coronavirus. ""Today has been one of those days when new information has required an immediate response."" He said he was told by UK government chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Valance that there was no reason to believe the vaccine would be less effective with the new variant. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said it was clear the rules had to change due to the presence of a new variant of the virus. ""By working together and keeping to the rules we can ensure as many people as possible will be around to celebrate Christmas together in the years to come,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price MS said people would be disappointed but the country had a ""responsibility to keep one another safe"". He added: ""No one wanted a Christmas like this. While we are once again asked to make a sacrifice at what is usually a sociable time of year, our collective effort is necessary, particularly as a new variant of Covid-19 has been identified."" Covid case rates in Wales A total of 120,432 positive cases have now been confirmed in Wales since the start of the pandemic, and 3,046 people have died with Covid-19. The most recent data shows that all of the UK's seven most infected local authorities are in Wales. Almost all health boards in Wales have now suspended some non-emergency services, as the demand on services increases. Chris Williams of Public Health Wales said it was working with other UK organisations to respond to the new variant. ""It is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen.  Although the variant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe,"" he said. ""We are reminding people that all current guidance relating to coronavirus continues to apply to the new variant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination. ""The new variant shows up as positive in Public Health Wales' existing coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual way if they develop coronavirus symptoms. Belinda O'Donnell, owner of Penny Lane Vintage and The Furniture Shop in Cardiff, said the news was ""devastating"". ""I'm really shocked. It's disgusting really,"" she said. ""I recently got Christmas stock in - we're not going to recoup the money lost. They should have stuck to the original plans because we were prepared for that. ""We were working so hard to work towards that date. We haven't had the flow of people through, so we're struggling anyway."" Queues formed outside shops in Talbot Green after the announcement on Saturday CBI Wales director Ian Price said he was not surprised restrictions have been brought forward, ""however painful they may be"". ""Businesses know infection rates must be controlled to save lives and protect against longer-term economic scarring,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, invoking what is effectively a full lockdown at such a crucial time for many businesses - particularly those in the hardest-hit hospitality, retail and tourism sectors - will come as a fresh blow after many months of hardship and once again puts further jobs at risk."" Queues as shops prepare for last-minute lockdown Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? Sara Jones of the Welsh Retail Consortium said it recognised the difficult decisions behind the announcement, but said the consequences would be severe. ""For businesses, the government's stop-start approach is deeply unhelpful - this decision comes in the middle of peak trading which so many are depending on to power their recovery,"" she said. ""Faced with this news - and the prospect of losing Â£100m per week in sales for the third time this year - many businesses will be in serious difficulty and many thousands of jobs could be at risk.""

"Sixty nine more Covid deaths and 2,334 new casesThere have been 69 deaths and 2,334 cases since the pandemic began, Public Health Wales says.Wales","There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

'Stop-start Covid rules cost shops Â£2bn a week'Retailers warn more jobs and businesses are at risk as non-essential shops are forced to close.Business,"The government's ""stop-start"" Covid restrictions will cost retailers a further Â£2bn a week in lost sales, according to an industry group. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said it recognised the government had ""difficult decisions to make"" to stop the spread of Covid-19. But it said placing large parts of England into tougher tier four restrictions was ""hugely regrettable"". ""The consequences of this decision will be severe,"" it added. Under the tier four rules, all but essential shops in south-east and eastern England, including London, have been forced to shut just as the retail sector gears up for the key Christmas trading period. Non-essential shops in England had just emerged from closure during a second national lockdown in November when retail sales fell 3.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics. In Wales,a lockdown means non-essential shopswere also forced to shut from Sunday.

"Dig reveals 'reprisals' after Boudicca's revoltArchaeologists link the destruction of a ""high status"" village to the uprising in Roman Britain.","A number of the larger roundhouses were burned down and the defensive enclosure cleared during the late First Century AD The destruction of a ""clearly high status"" Iron Age village ""may represent reprisals after the Boudiccan revolt"", an archaeologist has said. More than 17 roundhouses were discovered in a defensive enclosure at Cressing, near Braintree in Essex. The site was burned down and abandoned during the late First Century AD. ""The local Trinovantes tribe joined the AD61 rebellion and afterBoudicca's defeatwe know the Romans punished everyone involved,"" said Andy Greef. The four-hectare (10-acre) site had been little disturbed in the centuries since the Iron Age settlement was abandoned One of the more unusual finds was this copper alloy cockerel, which is believed to have been an offering to the gods The excavation by Oxford Archaeology East ahead ofa housing development by Countryside Properties,externalbegan during the first lockdown and lasted eight months. The enclosure was ""clearly an important place"" with an ""avenue-like entrance"" and continued to expand after the Roman invasion in AD43, so archaeologists were surprised it was not resettled after its destruction. Who was Boudicca? Dig reveals 'one of the largest' Roman temples 'Mystery' pit skeleton found during digs Further evidence of the settlement's abandonment was the complete lack of Roman burials in subsequent centuries, Mr Greef added. Despite this, the site remained a centre of ""votive offerings"" - possibly linked to the cult of theRoman god Mercury,external- until the end of the Roman occupation in the Fourth Century AD. Other finds included coins, a tankard handle... ...and more than 100 brooches Mr Greef said: ""More than 100 brooches, 10 Iron Age coins, dozens of Roman coins, hairpins, beads, finger rings and a lovely copper alloy cockerel figurine were discovered. ""It could be there was a shrine on the site that continued to attract people and, as it's very close to the Roman road Stane Street, it was easy to access."" The dig also revealed ""one of the most significant assemblages of late Iron Age pottery from Essex in recent years"".

"New Covid-19 strain 'in every part of Wales'There could be a spike in Covid cases after Christmas, even with lockdown, the health minister says.Wales","Non-essential shops have now been closed as Wales begins its lockdown There could be a spike in coronavirus cases after Christmas, even with the early lockdown, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said thestay-at-home rulewas introduced from midnight ""partly"" as a result of anew variant of the virus. The variant is ""seeded"" in all parts of Wales, including the north, he said. Opposition leaders are calling for the Welsh Parliament to be recalled during recess. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said announcing the stricter Covid restrictions sooner would have stoppedpeople rushing to the shopson Saturday night.

New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Q&A: What has changed as Wales locks down? Christmas lockdown kindness gives gifts and dinners Meeting up is now limited to two households and a single person support bubble on Christmas Day only. Pressure on the NHS has exceeded the Welsh Government's worst case scenario and without action there will be an ""even bigger spike in cases"", Mr Gething said. ""It would [the NHS] be in danger of not being able to cope if we don't act - and there's still a risk even now,"" he said. Further cases were ""baked in"" due to people mixing in the run up to lockdown, he told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement. ""Over the next few weeks we know that there'll be a problem,"" he said. ""We know that despite the rules some people will still mix."" New virus variant: How worried should we be? Countries ban flights from UK over new variant Mr Gething said the new variant was ""in every part of Wales, including right across north Wales"", adding that ministers had been shown evidence that it was ""much more infectious"". ""We've seen cases rise significantly in the south,"" he said. Shoppers queued outside Marks and Spencer near Cardiff on Saturday night Plaid Cymru leader Mr Price told theDewi Llwyd programmeon BBC Radio Cymru he had urged the first minister on Wednesday to bring in ""stricter restrictions in those areas with high infection rates before Christmas anyway, even before this new information on the new variant of the virus"". Conservative shadow health minister Andrew RT Davies said there was ""colossal"" pressure on the NHS, but said ministers needed to provide evidence to support their actions. ""I don't doubt the sincerity of ministers at all, but I do believe we need to see the evidence as a matter of urgency,"" he said. ""I woke up this morning and went into my inbox and it is just full of bewildered people at the speed of what has exactly happened."" Gyms, hairdressers, beauty salons and non-essential shops closed at the end of trading on Saturday Bars and restaurants will only be able to open for takeaways People will only be allowed to travel for ""essential reasons"" People cannot mix with anyone they do not live with, with only single person households allowed to form an exclusive support bubble with one other household The exception is for Christmas Day when two households can meet, along with a single person support bubble Places of worship are allowed to be open to the public Weddings and funerals can take place, but receptions and wakes are not allowed Moving homes is still allowed, if the moving date cannot be switched Driving lessons cannot take place during lockdown and booked theory tests will need to be rearranged The Welsh Government has published more guidancehere,external The Christmas market in Cardiff is being taken down because of the new rules Ben Francis, from the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales, acknowledged concern about the number of Covid cases, but he said the lockdown was ""nothing short of devastating"" for businesses. ""This situation creates a new level of urgency for businesses to receive funding from Welsh Government upon which they will be heavily reliant,"" he said. Hairdresser and mother-of-three Kristy Wood said she reopened her salon, Kristy's Hair Design Studio in Newport, after the announcement on Saturday afternoon to try to safely fit in several clients before closing the doors before the midnight lockdown. ""I was calling clients and put out a notice on Facebook - most were in their pyjamas watching theStrictly finalwith a glass of wine!"" she said. ""If we could have been told the day before, or earlier that afternoon, we could have planned more. It was such short notice, so we were thrown in the deep end. It could have been done in a better way."" She added it seemed unfair that businesses had made so much effort to adhere to safety guidelines, while supermarkets seemed less restricted. ""We take clients' temperatures at the door, do track and trace, sanitise, wear PPE - masks, visors, aprons and gloves,"" she added. ""It's frustrating that we've put all this in place but you go into a supermarket and they don't do it. It really does feel unfair."" Jonathan Barnes is one of many people now facing Christmas alone Meanwhile, father-of-two Jonathan Barnes, 40, said he faced the prospect of beingalone over Christmas, unable to travel from Suffolk to Pembrokeshire to join his family due to the coronavirus rules. The Covid-19 case rate for Wales has jumped to 613.3 cases per 100,000 for the past seven days, up from 530.2 on Thursday. The seven day rolling case rate remains highest in Merthyr Tydfil at 1,225, followed by Bridgend on 1,118 and Blaenau Gwent on 981.9.

The World Health Organization has said it is in""close contact"" with UK officialsover its emergence, although it is not believed to be more deadly. In astatement,external, Wales chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said ""hospital admissions have increased markedly in areas with higher levels of the variant"". The owner of a pub in Neath Port Talbot who hosted a gathering after the latest lockdown rules came into force in the early hours was among the first to receive a fine, according to atweet,externalby South Wales Police. Coronavirus restrictions are being enforced by local authority enforcement officers and the police, with Â£60 fixed penalty notices issued for the first offence rising to a maximum of Â£1,920. The Welsh Government has spoken to councils and the police ""because we do want to see more enforcement take place"", Mr Gething said. But officers in Wales say they have been called on toenforce sometimes ""unpopular"" Covid rules. Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said: ""Where we do get information that people are flouting the rules, maybe house parties are taking place, the police will be there to respond.

UK's Smith loses super-middleweight title to AlvarezSaul 'Canelo' Alvarez dominates Callum Smith with a near-flawless display to inflict the first defeat of the British fighter's career.BBC SportComments,"Alvarez applied pressure and regularly backed Smith to the ropes Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez produced a near-flawless display to unpick Callum Smith and take the British fighter's WBA world super-middleweight title. The Mexican, 30, shone in Texas as he all but froze Smith out over 12 rounds with calculated pressure, spiteful punching and evasive defensive work. Smith, 30, struggled to land anything heavy and was told by his corner he had ""one more round"" after a torrid ninth. He admirably fought on but lost 119-109 119-109 117-111 on the judges' cards. Reaction and analysis as Alvarez dominates Smith Costello & Bunce analyse 'Canelo' v Smith Alvarez - who has only one defeat on his record from 57 fights - also picked up the vacant WBC world super-middleweight title, meaning he holds two of the four significant belts at 168lbs. ""I'm devastated. I came here to win,"" Smith told DAZN at the Alamodome in San Antonio. ""No excuses, he was very good. ""It could have been a better version of me. He is smart and he is clever. He closes ground, sets traps and before you know it he's closed the ground up. I maybe let him close the ground up too easily."" Around 12,000 fans were allowed into the Alamodome and Alvarez used a Mexican Mariachi band during his ring walk Smith's seven-inch height advantage had formed much of the foundation for those suggesting he could defy his underdog status. But Alvarez refused to take a step back at any point. He shut down space patiently, remained compact, showed head movement and ultimately made himself difficult to hit. When he was close enough, he jabbed smartly and loaded up with his trademark shots to the body. At the end of the fifth, Smith's three older fighting brothers shouted ""better"" from ringside as he began to throw more but in the seventh, Alvarez - the youngest of seven fighting brothers - landed hard body shots on the counter and a fine uppercut. A hard right hand sent Smith slumping into the ropes in the ninth and, with his nose bloodied, he replied to trainer Joe Gallagher that he was ""fine"" after it was made clear he would only get one more round. Ominously, four-weight world champion Alvarez explained he knew he could take Smith's power ""from the first round"" and it was later revealed the Liverpool fighter may have torn a bicep early in the contest. Alvarez simply presented a puzzle his opponent never looked like solving. By the 10th round, US broadcasters were calling the fight ""a bad beating"". ""This is one of the best nights I have had,"" said Alvarez, who added he would consider a third fight with Gennady Golovkin, whobeat Kamil Szeremeta24 hours earlier. ""One of the greatest nights. I will go for more. I want all the belts, it doesn't matter who has them. I don't run from anybody. I have fought against the best. I have shown the world I fight the best."" Alvarez now has two of the four world super-middleweight titles Alvarez has now reeled off five wins since hissix-month ban for failing drugs tests in 2018.His sole loss in 15 years was against Floyd Mayweather in 2013 but his current momentum and this well-rounded display underline why he is the sport's best-paid star. A restricted crowd of about 12,000 may have impacted on his overall earnings in his first bout in 13 months but his quality is undeniable, his rivals look a class below, and crucially his hunger appears undiminished. The iconic middleweight Marvin Hagler once said: ""It's tough to get out of bed to do roadwork at 5am when you've been sleeping in silk pyjamas."" The sight of Alvarez walking round the fight hotel's bubble in designer pyjamas this week prompted questions as to how much more he could give. His status, earning power and lifestyle are far removed from the life he knew on his family's farm as a child but there can be no doubt his grit and desire remain, and future rivals will need to find something special to stop him. Smith can be proud of his own journey to face a man he once dreamed of fighting. Alvarez, though, was simply too good. Alvarez now has a record of 54 wins, two draws and one defeat Cutting a dejected figure in his corner, Smith said he would take time out and consider a move up to the 175lbs light-heavyweight division. His sentiment led BBC 5 Live commentator Mike Costello to wonder if he was considering calling time on his career at the age of 30. Britain's Billy Joe Saunders - who holds the WBO belt at super-middleweight - quickly tweeted to call on Alvarez to ""get it on"" in 2021 but for the most part, the boxing world was simply left praising the sport's biggest star. Promoter Eddie Hearn confirmed Smith damaged his arm early on in his San Antonio defeat and revealed the fighter was ""in tears"" in the changing room. ""It was a masterclass from Canelo,"" Hearn told 5 Live. ""I just left Callum's changing room and everyone is talking about Alvarez. He's just so good. Callum never stopped throwing but he came up against the best fighter on the planet."" Former world champion George Groves told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Canelo bullied Smith, marched him down and used his punch power to control the entire fight."" And BBC Radio 5 Live boxing analyst Steve Bunce added: ""That's what happens when you fight Canelo. You discover things about yourself you didn't know and things about him you didn't recognise before you got in the ring. ""Smith has been broken. Canelo took away his height, reach and confidence. That is class.""

"'I won't have next summer, let alone next Christmas'Three people tell BBC News how the new Christmas coronavirus rules will affect them.","The last-minute change to Covid rules for Christmas has affected millions. Large parts of south-east England will not have the rules relaxed at all, and the rest of England, Scotland and Wales will see them relaxed for just Christmas Day. For some people, this news is an inconvenience. For others, it is a disaster. For Lesley Nelson, who has terminal cancer, it is simply ""not fair"". ""I am terminally ill,"" she said. ""This is likely to be my last Christmas."" ""I've spent the last two Christmases in hospital. I have a small family. We had planned a quiet Christmas as normal - just me, my two sons, my mum and my sister. ""They are all taking care not to mix for the week before. I only see my sister two or three times a year, so this Christmas is important."" What is tier four and who is in it? Should you see your family at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live While she will still be able to see her mum and two sons, Lesley says this may have been her last chance to spend Christmas with her sister. ""I cannot say 'never mind, there's always next year' because there may not be for me. ""I have no idea when I will see my sister again. She was in my Christmas bubble. ""She lives in a tier four area and is on her own. She's been isolating for a week, so there's no risk at all. ""I understand what the government is doing to stop the virus, but sure they must be able to make exceptions?"" Lesley and her husband Ian Like many others who contacted the BBC, Lawrence in north London wanted to express his frustration that the announcement came without much notice. He was due to get married on 23 December but is bracing himself for the register office telling him it can no longer go ahead due to tier four restrictions being put in place. ""My wedding is up in the air,"" he said. ""I have emailed the register office in north London and am waiting to see what they say. ""I'll be upset but it won't be the end of the world because it will take place at some point. ""The wedding not going ahead will see us out of pocket by about Â£500-600. It's not the expense, it's the inconvenience of not having it on the day we want it. This video can not be played 'Tier 4 residents must stay at home' as PM announces tighter restrictions ""I wish the announcement had been done earlier. It's going to affect a lot of people. It's going to affect the lonely and the vulnerable - they are not going to see anyone this Christmas. And what it will do for people's mental health is another matter. ""The government could have done things earlier."" Jonathan Barnes, 40, in Suffolk is facing the prospect of a Christmas alone following the announcement of the Welsh lockdown. ""I'm married with two young children,"" he said. ""Our parents live in Pembrokeshire and we live in Suffolk. ""My wife's mum has a very short period of time left to live so they have gone down to Wales before me to spend some quality time with her. ""I was planning to join on Wednesday after work for the five days over Christmas. The new lockdown in Wales means I shouldn't join my family and instead will be stuck at home in tier two on my own."" His mother-in-law has terminal cancer. And while he says he wants to see her, he thinks it is important to ""err on the side of caution"". ""It's not about getting away with it,"" he said. ""It's about doing the right thing."" ""I'm thinking the wisest thing to do is to spend Christmas alone. ""To announce a Welsh lockdown immediately gives no-one time to plan. The government shouldn't have announced the relaxation of the rules over Christmas originally. ""If they'd have said Christmas is locked down people would have adjusted to that early on. I'm disappointed to be spending Christmas alone but I understand the reasons why.""

WHO 'in contact with UK' over new virus variant,"There is no current evidence to suggest that the new variant is affected any differently by vaccines The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is in ""close contact"" with UK officials over the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus. The new variant is spreading more rapidly than the original version, but it is not believed to be more deadly. Along with the UK, the same mutation of the Covid-19 virus has also been detected in the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia, the WHO told the BBC. There is no evidence to suggest the new variant reacts differently to vaccines. In the UK, large parts of south-east England, including London, are now under a new, stricter level of restrictions in a bid to curb the rapidly spreading virus. New variant: How worried should we be? What is tier four and who is in it? On Sunday, European nations including Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium all announced a halt to flights and travel from the UK. The measures vary and are initially generally short-term. An EU meeting will be held on Monday morning to discuss a more co-ordinated response. Nations impose UK travel bans over new variant The Dutch move came after tests carried out on samples taken in the Netherlands earlier this month revealed the same new variant of coronavirus as that reported in the UK. Pending ""greater clarity"" on the situation in the UK, the Dutch government said that further ""risk of the new virus strain being introduced to the Netherlands should be minimised as much as possible"". The Dutch government also said it would work with other European Union member states in the coming days to ""explore the scope for further limiting the risk of the new strain of the virus being brought over from the UK"". Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove said that specialists had been ""following mutations across the world since the beginning of the pandemic"". The WHO said that it was in contact with UK officials over the new variant. It said the UK was sharing information from ongoing studies into the mutation, and that the WHO would update member states and the public ""as we learn more about the characteristics of this virus variant [and] any implications"". Although there is ""considerable uncertainty"", UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new variant may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old one. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the development was ""going to make things a lot worse"". He said, however, that there were ""really optimistic things if you look, once we get the vaccine out, assuming the vaccine works against this - which at the moment is the working assumption."" Officials say there is no current evidence to suggest the new variant causes a higher mortality rate or that it is affected any differently by vaccines and treatments. The WHO's senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, said nine instances of the same variant as seen in the UK had been reported in Denmark, with one case in Australia and one in the Netherlands. Several other countries had confirmed variants that ""carry some of the genetic changes seen in the UK"", Dr Smallwood added. Mutations of the virus are frequently identified, the WHO's Dr Van Kerkhove told the BBC, adding that it was important to understand ""what these variants do and how they behave"". In theUK,the planned relaxation of Covid rules to allow households to mix over the Christmas period has been scrapped for large parts of south-east England- affecting nearly 18 million people - and cut to just Christmas Day for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales. This video can not be played ""Tier 4 residents must stay at home"" as PM announces tighter restrictions Italyhasordered a nationwide lockdown over much of the Christmas and New Year period.The country will be under ""red-zone"" restrictions over the public holidays, with non-essential shops, restaurants and bars closed, and Italians only allowed to travel for limited reasons. TheNetherlandsandGermanyhave imposed lockdowns until January. In Germany, Christmas will see a slight easing, with one household allowed to host up to four close family members. Austriais set to enter its third lockdown after Christmas. From 26 December, non-essential shops will be shut and movement outside homes restricted. Swedenhas recommended wearing face masks on public transport during the rush hour, reversing its earlier guidance. France's President Emmanuel Macron is in a ""stable"" condition after testing positive for coronavirus, his office said on Saturday. He is still experiencing symptoms, such as coughing and fatigue, but they are not preventing him from working, it said. Slovakia's Igor Matovic with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this month Slovakia's Prime Minister Igor Matovic, who attended an EU summit with Mr Macron last week, said he had tested positive for coronavirus on Friday. Several other European leaders who were also at the summit said they would self-isolate. Australia'smost populous state, New South Wales, has announcednew restrictions on household gatherings and hospitality venues for the Greater Sydney areain an attempt to contain a growing outbreak there. Residents had already been told to stay at home.

Jonathan Barnes is one of many people now facing Christmas alone Meanwhile, father-of-two Jonathan Barnes, 40, said he faced the prospect of beingalone over Christmas, unable to travel from Suffolk to Pembrokeshire to join his family due to the coronavirus rules. The Covid-19 case rate for Wales has jumped to 613.3 cases per 100,000 for the past seven days, up from 530.2 on Thursday. The seven day rolling case rate remains highest in Merthyr Tydfil at 1,225, followed by Bridgend on 1,118 and Blaenau Gwent on 981.9.

The World Health Organization has said it is in""close contact"" with UK officialsover its emergence, although it is not believed to be more deadly. In astatement,external, Wales chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said ""hospital admissions have increased markedly in areas with higher levels of the variant"". The owner of a pub in Neath Port Talbot who hosted a gathering after the latest lockdown rules came into force in the early hours was among the first to receive a fine, according to atweet,externalby South Wales Police. Coronavirus restrictions are being enforced by local authority enforcement officers and the police, with Â£60 fixed penalty notices issued for the first offence rising to a maximum of Â£1,920.

Millions go into toughest Covid restrictions,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""If you act like you have the virus, that will stop the virus from spreading to others"" The government does not want to cancel Christmas but it is ""our duty"" to act as a new coronavirus variant is ""out of control"", the health secretary says. A strict new lockdown in London, the South East and east of England could last for months, Matt Hancock said. Millions of people across the UK have seen theirfestive plans severely restricted or scrapped. On Sunday, the number of recorded daily infections in the UK reached anall-time high of 35,928 new cases,external. The figure is nearly twice the number of cases - 18,447 - reported a week ago. However, it is thought the infection rate was higher during the first peak in spring, with testing capacity too limited at the time to detect the true number of daily cases. Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""This sharp and sudden increase is of serious concern. ""Most of the new cases reported today are concentrated in London and the South East, although it is too early to tell if this is linked to the new variant."" A growing number of countries have banned travel from the UK- including Ireland, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands - over the new variant. The government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group estimates this variant could increase the R number - which indicates if an epidemic is growing or shrinking - by between 0.4 and 0.9,newly released minutes show,external. Wales locks down as Christmas plans cut What is tier four and who is in it? Should you see your family at Christmas? 'I won't have next summer let alone next Christmas' Some 21 million people in England and Wales who entered new restrictions at midnight are being told to stay at home, while non-essential shops and businesses have to close. The planned relaxation of rules for Christmas has been scrapped for those under England's toughest new tier four measures, while in the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, relaxed indoor mixing rules over the holidays have been cut from five days to Christmas Day only. Mr Hancock said it was ""important for everybody to act like they might have the virus"" because we need to bring the new variant ""under control"". He added: ""Of course we don't want to cancel Christmas... we don't want to take any of these measures, but it's our duty to take them when the evidence is clear."" The health secretary said he did not know how long the tier four measures would be in place but ""it may be for some time, until we can get the vaccine going"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party supported the latest restrictions but he accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""gross negligence"" in failing to act earlier. Residents in tier four are being asked to stay at home unless for essential journeys, while people in other tiers are advised not to travel into the new tier four areas. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was very important that people followed the new travel guidance in England and ""do not attempt to travel"", saying extra British Transport Police officers were being deployed. A ban on travel between Scotland and the rest of the UK will also apply over the festive period. Police Scotland saidit would be doubling its patrols on the borders but it would not be introducing check points. Scotland's restrictions willonly be relaxed on Christmas Day, with mainland Scotland being placed under the tightest restrictions from Boxing Day. Wales has also entered a new shutdown, with the health minister sayingthe new variant was ""seeded"" in every part. In Northern Ireland, where the planned relaxation of rules for Christmas is going ahead unchanged,four of the five main parties have called for an urgent meeting to discuss the restrictions. This video can not be played Starmer: Boris Johnson ""has once again been caught behind the curve"" The PM's announcement of new restrictions came just days after he defended plans to relax restrictions for five days during the festive period - despite calls by some in the medical profession to scrap the change. Sir Keir told an online press conference that it was ""blatantly obvious last week"" that Mr Johnson's plans to relax the rules over Christmas was ""a risk too far"", adding that his claim that ""this is all down to a new form of the virus that has just emerged does not stand up to scrutiny"". He said the ""alarm bells have been ringing for weeks"" with rising infections and the NHS reaching capacity in some parts of the country ""but the prime minister chose to ignore"" it. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What do tier four restrictions mean for sport? NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' London Mayor Sadiq Khan told BBC Breakfast the ""11th-hour announcement is a bitter blow"" for families and businesses, saying it is the ""chop-change, stop-start, that's led to so much anguish, despair, sadness and disappointment"". He urged Londoners to follow the rules which he said had been brought in ""for a very good reason"", adding that the NHS had told him that hospitals in London had as many Covid patients this weekend as they did at the peak of the virus in April. Tier four restrictions: Similar to England's second national lockdown - tier four applies to Kent, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey (excluding Waverley), Gosport, Havant, Portsmouth, Rother and Hastings. It also applies in London (all 32 boroughs and the City of London) and the east of England (Bedford, Central Bedford, Milton Keynes, Luton, Peterborough, Hertfordshire and Essex (excluding Colchester, Uttlesford and Tendring). Residents told to stay at home, with exemptions for those who have to travel for work or education Household mixing indoors is not allowed, unless you live with them, or they are part of your existing support bubble All non-essential retail to close, including hairdressers, nail bars, indoor gyms and leisure facilities Social mixing cut to meeting one person in an open public space Communal religious worship is still allowed The measures will be reviewed on 30 December. Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, said they alerted the government on Friday that the new variant - first identified in the middle of October from a sample taken in September - was spreading faster than other viruses circulating. Dr Hopkins told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that there was evidence that people with the new strain had ""higher viral loads"" - which meant they were more infectious. She also said findings had shown the new variant was up to 70% more transmissible based on modelling the rate of increase in the new strain compared to others in circulation.

Queues ahead of last-minute lockdown,"Shoppers have been queuing for last-minute gifts in Llandudno Shop owners have rushed to get orders out to customers as shoppers raced to pick up Christmas presents before Wales headed into lockdown. From Sundayall non-essential shops are closed as a Wales-wide ""stay-at-home"" lockdown begins. Following the announcement at 17:00 GMT on Saturday some shops reopened and queues formed outside. But First Minister Mark Drakeford urged people ""not to rush"" on the shops. ""As we move to alert level four in Wales most shops must close but supermarkets will remain open, and click and collect will be available,"" he said. ""The best gift we can give our loved ones this year is a coronavirus-free Christmas."" Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March many retailers have seen their doors closed for months on end under restrictions. Shoppers were seen queuing outside Marks and Spencer near Cardiff Following Saturday's announcement shoppers were seen queuing down the road at toy shops in Swansea, and Llandudno. In Carmarthenshire a number of independent shops reopened their doors after their usual closing time in a bid to get customers their presents in time for Christmas. Allow Twitter content?

Before the new restrictions came into force, many had been preparing for the last few days of Christmas sales. When Mair Jones shut up her shop in Carmarthen on Saturday evening she went home for dinner ahead of an expected packed day of customers ahead of the Christmas break. But just hours later, the owner of a children's shoe shop was back in, rushing to fit infants with their first shoes ahead of the midnight cut-off. ""I was eating my supper and then I heard the announcement,"" she said. ""I didn't know what to do."" Ms Jones, who owns Esgidiau Cic Shoes, said she was inundated with calls from customers who were scheduled for fittings in the coming days and so reopened the shop, with customers bringing in their children in their pyjamas. ""I couldn't leave children without shoes over Christmas, especially now it would be nice for them to go out for walks,"" she said. ""It's my first year of business and we have had to shut three times already, it's been a massive blow, and there was no warning this time."" Queues formed outside shops in Talbot Green after the announcement At Jackie James fashion boutique in Carmarthen, staff were preparing for customers to pick up thousands of pounds worth of orders for Christmas when lockdown was announced. ""The lockdown is needed to keep people safe, but don't give me 30 seconds notice,"" said Eurig Lewis, speaking from the store after opening until the cut-off at midnight. ""Worse than that it is OK for those who have millions of pounds to spend getting all their Christmas presents in one hit, but a lot of people have been buying them over months."" Mr Lewis said the store had been bombarded with calls from customers asking if they could pick their orders up, so he decided to stay open until midnight to try and give people the chance to get their presents. He said retailers had been struggling due to the repeated lockdowns and restrictions for months, but that they would ""try"" to help customers all they could. Ahead of the lockdown people were out shopping in Cardiff on the last Saturday before Christmas The Welsh Retail Consortium said it understood difficult decisions had to be made to curb the spread of the virus, but the eleventh-hour lockdown would have ""severe consequences"" for businesses. Sara Jones from the group said: ""Faced with this news - and the prospect of losing Â£100m per week in sales for the third time this year - many businesses will be in serious difficulty and many thousands of jobs could be at risk.Â ""The Welsh Government will need to offer additional and immediate financial support to help these businesses get back on an even keel - an extension to business rates relief in 2021 is the best place to start."" Announcing the lockdown Mr Drakeford said: ""While we all want to avoid further disruption to businesses and plans for Christmas, our overriding duty is to protect lives here in Wales.""

"Publish furlough list over fraud concerns, say MPs","This video can not be played Furlough fraud, a whistleblowerâs story MPs want the government to publish a list of the companies that signed up to the furlough scheme amid concerns money is being lost through fraud and error. Under the scheme, the government pays up to 80% of staff wages. ""Opportunistic fraud"", where furloughed staff continue to work, could be running at between 7% and 34% of cases, the Public Accounts Committee said. The wages of more than nine million workers have been paid by the government at a cost of Â£46bn. Furlough scheme extended for another month Can I go back on furlough? Furlough extension buys time as vaccine is rolled out The Commons Public Accounts Committee, which is responsible for overseeing government expenditures, wants HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to release a list of employers that have received funding from the scheme by the end of January. The committee said the Treasury had not been able to give a ""ballpark figure"" or explain how it would determine whether the spending represented good value for money. Chancellor Rishi Sunak last weekextended the furlough scheme for one monthuntil the end of April and self-employed support is due to continue until the end of January. As of October, the furlough scheme and the income support scheme for the self employed had cost more than Â£55bn. A further Â£21bn of taxpayers' money will be paid into the furlough scheme by the end of April next year, the Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated. Under existing plans, the true scale of the losses will not be known until the end of next year at the earliest. Committee chair Meg Hillier said full transparency was needed. MPs also want HMRC and the Treasury to do more to help the estimated 2.9 million workers who have been excluded from both furlough and the income support scheme for the self-employed. ""HM Treasury and HMRC should investigate whether more data within and outside of the tax system could be used to determine eligibility for currently excluded groups and write to the committee within six weeks to explain their findings,"" the committee said. ""Many workers including freelancers and entrepreneurs have not had a penny and are really struggling as they continue to fall through the gaps."" Meanwhile, the government's hotline for furlough fraudhas received more than 20,000 tips since it was set up. A government spokesperson said: ""The furlough scheme has saved millions of jobs and kept businesses in operation.

Dig reveals 'reprisals' after Boudicca's revolt,"A number of the larger roundhouses were burned down and the defensive enclosure cleared during the late First Century AD The destruction of a ""clearly high status"" Iron Age village ""may represent reprisals after the Boudiccan revolt"", an archaeologist has said. More than 17 roundhouses were discovered in a defensive enclosure at Cressing, near Braintree in Essex. The site was burned down and abandoned during the late First Century AD. ""The local Trinovantes tribe joined the AD61 rebellion and afterBoudicca's defeatwe know the Romans punished everyone involved,"" said Andy Greef. The four-hectare (10-acre) site had been little disturbed in the centuries since the Iron Age settlement was abandoned One of the more unusual finds was this copper alloy cockerel, which is believed to have been an offering to the gods The excavation by Oxford Archaeology East ahead ofa housing development by Countryside Properties,externalbegan during the first lockdown and lasted eight months. The enclosure was ""clearly an important place"" with an ""avenue-like entrance"" and continued to expand after the Roman invasion in AD43, so archaeologists were surprised it was not resettled after its destruction. Who was Boudicca? Dig reveals 'one of the largest' Roman temples 'Mystery' pit skeleton found during digs Further evidence of the settlement's abandonment was the complete lack of Roman burials in subsequent centuries, Mr Greef added. Despite this, the site remained a centre of ""votive offerings"" - possibly linked to the cult of theRoman god Mercury,external- until the end of the Roman occupation in the Fourth Century AD. Other finds included coins, a tankard handle... ...and more than 100 brooches Mr Greef said: ""More than 100 brooches, 10 Iron Age coins, dozens of Roman coins, hairpins, beads, finger rings and a lovely copper alloy cockerel figurine were discovered. ""It could be there was a shrine on the site that continued to attract people and, as it's very close to the Roman road Stane Street, it was easy to access."" The dig also revealed ""one of the most significant assemblages of late Iron Age pottery from Essex in recent years"".

"'I won't have next summer, let alone next Christmas'Three people tell BBC News how the new Christmas coronavirus rules will affect them.UK","The last-minute change to Covid rules for Christmas has affected millions. Large parts of south-east England will not have the rules relaxed at all, and the rest of England, Scotland and Wales will see them relaxed for just Christmas Day. For some people, this news is an inconvenience. For others, it is a disaster. For Lesley Nelson, who has terminal cancer, it is simply ""not fair"". ""I am terminally ill,"" she said. ""This is likely to be my last Christmas."" ""I've spent the last two Christmases in hospital. I have a small family. We had planned a quiet Christmas as normal - just me, my two sons, my mum and my sister. ""They are all taking care not to mix for the week before. I only see my sister two or three times a year, so this Christmas is important."" What is tier four and who is in it? Should you see your family at Christmas? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live While she will still be able to see her mum and two sons, Lesley says this may have been her last chance to spend Christmas with her sister. ""I cannot say 'never mind, there's always next year' because there may not be for me. ""I have no idea when I will see my sister again. She was in my Christmas bubble. ""She lives in a tier four area and is on her own. She's been isolating for a week, so there's no risk at all. ""I understand what the government is doing to stop the virus, but sure they must be able to make exceptions?"" Lesley and her husband Ian Like many others who contacted the BBC, Lawrence in north London wanted to express his frustration that the announcement came without much notice. He was due to get married on 23 December but is bracing himself for the register office telling him it can no longer go ahead due to tier four restrictions being put in place. ""My wedding is up in the air,"" he said. ""I have emailed the register office in north London and am waiting to see what they say. ""I'll be upset but it won't be the end of the world because it will take place at some point. ""The wedding not going ahead will see us out of pocket by about Â£500-600. It's not the expense, it's the inconvenience of not having it on the day we want it.

It's going to affect the lonely and the vulnerable - they are not going to see anyone this Christmas. And what it will do for people's mental health is another matter. ""The government could have done things earlier."" Jonathan Barnes, 40, in Suffolk is facing the prospect of a Christmas alone following the announcement of the Welsh lockdown. ""I'm married with two young children,"" he said. ""Our parents live in Pembrokeshire and we live in Suffolk. ""My wife's mum has a very short period of time left to live so they have gone down to Wales before me to spend some quality time with her. ""I was planning to join on Wednesday after work for the five days over Christmas. The new lockdown in Wales means I shouldn't join my family and instead will be stuck at home in tier two on my own."" His mother-in-law has terminal cancer. And while he says he wants to see her, he thinks it is important to ""err on the side of caution"". ""It's not about getting away with it,"" he said. ""It's about doing the right thing."" ""I'm thinking the wisest thing to do is to spend Christmas alone. ""To announce a Welsh lockdown immediately gives no-one time to plan. The government shouldn't have announced the relaxation of the rules over Christmas originally. ""If they'd have said Christmas is locked down people would have adjusted to that early on.

'No time to waste': Biden unveils climate team,"Joe Biden said the US needed a ""unified national response"" to climate change US President-elect Joe Biden has introduced his climate and energy team, saying they will lead an ""ambitious plan"" to combat climate change. Mr Biden has vowed to make the issue a top priority in an agenda that reverses many Trump administration policies. He said there was ""no time to waste"".

Nominees include North Carolina's top environmental regulator Michael Regan, who would be the first African-American man to head the EPA, and New Mexico representative Deb Haaland who would be the first Native American to lead the Department of the Interior. Ms Haaland hailed her nomination as a ""profound"" moment in the history of the country. Environmental lawyer and Obama administration official Brenda Mallory was nominated to run the Council on Environmental Quality. If confirmed, she would be the first African American to hold the position. Former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm was nominated for the position of energy secretary. Last month Mr Bidennamed John Kerry, a former secretary of state and one of the leading architects of the Paris agreement, as his climate envoy. The Biden transition team said the position would see him ""fight climate change full-time"". He is also set to be the first official dedicated to climate change to sit on the National Security Council. How big are Biden's climate change ambitions? How diverse is Biden's new cabinet?

WHO 'in contact with UK' over new Covid variant,"There is no current evidence to suggest that the new variant is affected any differently by vaccines The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is in ""close contact"" with UK officials over the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus. The new variant is spreading more rapidly than the original version, but it is not believed to be more deadly. Along with the UK, the same mutation of the Covid-19 virus has also been detected in the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia, the WHO told the BBC. There is no evidence to suggest the new variant reacts differently to vaccines. In the UK, large parts of south-east England, including London, are now under a new, stricter level of restrictions in a bid to curb the rapidly spreading virus. New variant: How worried should we be? What is tier four and who is in it? On Sunday, European nations including Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium all announced a halt to flights and travel from the UK. The measures vary and are initially generally short-term. An EU meeting will be held on Monday morning to discuss a more co-ordinated response. Nations impose UK travel bans over new variant The Dutch move came after tests carried out on samples taken in the Netherlands earlier this month revealed the same new variant of coronavirus as that reported in the UK. Pending ""greater clarity"" on the situation in the UK, the Dutch government said that further ""risk of the new virus strain being introduced to the Netherlands should be minimised as much as possible"". The Dutch government also said it would work with other European Union member states in the coming days to ""explore the scope for further limiting the risk of the new strain of the virus being brought over from the UK"". Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove said that specialists had been ""following mutations across the world since the beginning of the pandemic"". The WHO said that it was in contact with UK officials over the new variant. It said the UK was sharing information from ongoing studies into the mutation, and that the WHO would update member states and the public ""as we learn more about the characteristics of this virus variant [and] any implications"". Although there is ""considerable uncertainty"", UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new variant may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old one. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the development was ""going to make things a lot worse"". He said, however, that there were ""really optimistic things if you look, once we get the vaccine out, assuming the vaccine works against this - which at the moment is the working assumption."" Officials say there is no current evidence to suggest the new variant causes a higher mortality rate or that it is affected any differently by vaccines and treatments. The WHO's senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, said nine instances of the same variant as seen in the UK had been reported in Denmark, with one case in Australia and one in the Netherlands. Several other countries had confirmed variants that ""carry some of the genetic changes seen in the UK"", Dr Smallwood added. Mutations of the virus are frequently identified, the WHO's Dr Van Kerkhove told the BBC, adding that it was important to understand ""what these variants do and how they behave"". In theUK,the planned relaxation of Covid rules to allow households to mix over the Christmas period has been scrapped for large parts of south-east England- affecting nearly 18 million people - and cut to just Christmas Day for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales.

TheNetherlandsandGermanyhave imposed lockdowns until January. In Germany, Christmas will see a slight easing, with one household allowed to host up to four close family members. Austriais set to enter its third lockdown after Christmas. From 26 December, non-essential shops will be shut and movement outside homes restricted. Swedenhas recommended wearing face masks on public transport during the rush hour, reversing its earlier guidance. France's President Emmanuel Macron is in a ""stable"" condition after testing positive for coronavirus, his office said on Saturday. He is still experiencing symptoms, such as coughing and fatigue, but they are not preventing him from working, it said. Slovakia's Igor Matovic with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this month Slovakia's Prime Minister Igor Matovic, who attended an EU summit with Mr Macron last week, said he had tested positive for coronavirus on Friday. Several other European leaders who were also at the summit said they would self-isolate. Australia'smost populous state, New South Wales, has announcednew restrictions on household gatherings and hospitality venues for the Greater Sydney areain an attempt to contain a growing outbreak there. Residents had already been told to stay at home.

'Publish furlough list amid fraud concerns' - MPs,"This video can not be played Furlough fraud, a whistleblowerâs story MPs want the government to publish a list of the companies that signed up to the furlough scheme amid concerns money is being lost through fraud and error. Under the scheme, the government pays up to 80% of staff wages. ""Opportunistic fraud"", where furloughed staff continue to work, could be running at between 7% and 34% of cases, the Public Accounts Committee said. The wages of more than nine million workers have been paid by the government at a cost of Â£46bn. Furlough scheme extended for another month Can I go back on furlough? Furlough extension buys time as vaccine is rolled out The Commons Public Accounts Committee, which is responsible for overseeing government expenditures, wants HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to release a list of employers that have received funding from the scheme by the end of January. The committee said the Treasury had not been able to give a ""ballpark figure"" or explain how it would determine whether the spending represented good value for money. Chancellor Rishi Sunak last weekextended the furlough scheme for one monthuntil the end of April and self-employed support is due to continue until the end of January. As of October, the furlough scheme and the income support scheme for the self employed had cost more than Â£55bn. A further Â£21bn of taxpayers' money will be paid into the furlough scheme by the end of April next year, the Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated. Under existing plans, the true scale of the losses will not be known until the end of next year at the earliest. Committee chair Meg Hillier said full transparency was needed. MPs also want HMRC and the Treasury to do more to help the estimated 2.9 million workers who have been excluded from both furlough and the income support scheme for the self-employed. ""HM Treasury and HMRC should investigate whether more data within and outside of the tax system could be used to determine eligibility for currently excluded groups and write to the committee within six weeks to explain their findings,"" the committee said. ""Many workers including freelancers and entrepreneurs have not had a penny and are really struggling as they continue to fall through the gaps."" Meanwhile, the government's hotline for furlough fraudhas received more than 20,000 tips since it was set up. A government spokesperson said: ""The furlough scheme has saved millions of jobs and kept businesses in operation. ""We will consider carefully the findings and recommendations of the PAC (Public Accounts Committee) report and respond in due course."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

"What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas?How many cases in your area?Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid?","The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary. You cannot go to the pub with members of your Christmas bubble. In England, if you have formed asupport bubblewith another household, that counts as one household. In Scotland,guidance,externalsays any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"". People who are self-isolatingshould not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone has to self-isolate. Under-18s whose parents live apart can join two Christmas bubbles, so they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household. University students whotravel homewill be counted as part of their family household straight away. But if a family has three or more grown-up children not at university, they cannot all form a Christmas bubble with their parents, even in areas where mixing is still possible.
