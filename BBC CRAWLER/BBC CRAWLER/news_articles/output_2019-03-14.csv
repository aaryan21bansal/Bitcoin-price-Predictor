Cable to quit as Lib Dem leader in May,"Sir Vince Cable has announced he will step down as Liberal Democrat leader after May's English local elections. Sir Vince said he wanted to pave the way for a ""new generation"". He became party leader without a contest after Tim Farron's resignation in 2017 - but the party has struggled to make an impact in the polls since. The former business secretary said in September he would stand down as party leader ""once Brexit is resolved or stopped"". But inan interview with the Daily Mail,external, he said: ""It now looks as if it will be a protracted process, and may never happen."" Sir Vince was a leading figure in the Lib Dem/Conservative coalition government before being ejected as an MP in the 2015 general election, when his party lost most of their 57 MPs. Cable to quit 'once Brexit is resolved' Gina Miller rules out leadership bid Brexit: A really simple guide He returned to Parliament in 2017 as MP for Twickenham and took on the job of leading the party's 12 MPs, which recently went down to 11 when one of them quit to vote for Theresa May's Brexit deal. Under Sir Vince's leadership, the Lib Dems led calls for another EU referendum as a means of stopping Brexit - and joined forces with pro-referendum campaigners in other parties in the People's Vote campaign. But despite some gains in local elections and a claimed increase in membership, the party struggled to get out of single figures in the opinion polls. In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight, he conceded that the Independent Group of MPs, who have broken away from Labour and the Conservatives as a new ""centrist"" force, had taken media attention away from his party. But he added: ""We have made a lot of steady progress after two very difficult general elections."" And he said he welcomed the formation of the Independent group, which he said had the potential to become a major political movement. Deputy leader Jo Swinson will be seen as a frontrunner to replace him Last autumn, he announced plans to transform the party's fortunes by opening up the leadership to non-party members. Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller addressed the Lib Dem annual conference - earning a better reception than many of its MPs - but she declined to join its ranks. In a statement, Sir Vince said: ""I indicated last year that once the Brexit story had moved on, and we had fought this year's crucial local elections in 9,000 seats across England, it would be time for me to make way for a new generation. ""I set considerable store by having an orderly, business-like, succession unlike the power struggles in the other parties."" He said he would ask the party to begin a leadership contest in May. He added: ""It has been my great privilege to lead the Liberal Democrats at this crucial time. ""I inherited the leadership after two difficult and disappointing general elections. But I take pride in seeing the party recovering strongly, with last year's local election results the best in 15 years, record membership and a central role in the People's Vote campaign."" Deputy leader Jo Swinson - who declined to stand for the leadership in 2017 due to family commitments - will be seen as a frontrunner to replace him. Ms Swinson tweeted: ""It has been an honour to work with Vince for a more open, liberal & tolerant Britain. He has helped LibDems through challenges of last two years & led us to some of our best local election results in a decade - and I'm confident we'll celebrate another strong set of wins in May."" Layla Moran, another MP who has been talked about as a possible leadership contender, tweeted: ""Vince Cable I want you to know how grateful I am for all you've done. Thank you so much for your service to the Party and Brexit.""

Liberal Democrats suspend former leader,"Lord Steel gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in Manchester on Wednesday The Liberal Democrats have suspended former leader David Steel over remarks he made to a child abuse inquiry about the late MP Cyril Smith. Lord Steel said he asked Smith in 1979 about claims he abused boys at a Rochdale hostel in the 1960s. He said he came away from the conversation ""assuming"" that Smith had committed the offences but claimed it was ""nothing to do with me"". A Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesman said an investigation would take place. The spokesman said: ""Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on 13th March 2019 the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed. ""The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation. That work will now commence. ""It is important that everyone in the party, and in wider society, understands the importance of vigilance and safeguarding to protect people from abuse, and that everyone has confidence in the seriousness with which we take it. ""We appreciate the difficult work that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is doing on behalf of the victims and survivors of abuse, and the country as a whole."" Leader 'assumed' Cyril Smith was an abuser The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard that no formal inquiry was held by the party into the claims against Smith, which were investigated by the police in 1969 but no prosecution was brought. Smith served as a Labour councillor in Rochdale in the 1960s before becoming the Liberal and then Liberal Democrat MP for the town between 1972 and 1992. Allegations that he abused a number of boys found a wider public spotlight after he died in 2010. Lord Steel, 80, told the inquiry he discussed the allegations with Smith in 1979, after an article appeared in Private Eye. He said Smith had told him ""it was correct, the matter had been investigated by police, no further action was taken and that was the end of the story"". Cyril Smith (left) and David Steel (right) discussed the allegations in 1979 Lord Steel said he had ""assumed"" that Smith had committed the offences, but said he took no further action because: ""It was before he was an MP, before he was even a member of my party. It had nothing to do with me."" Lord Steel also described recommending Smith for a knighthood in 1988 and said he did not pass on any allegations about the sexual abuse of children because ""I was not aware of any such allegations other than the matter referred toâ¦which appeared to have been fully investigated"". And he said it had not occurred to him that children could still have been at risk from Smith. In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, Lord Steel said: ""I would like to clarify what happened in 1979 when I asked Cyril Smith about the report in Private Eye. ""As I told the inquiry yesterday I did not have that report with me when I tackled him, nor did we discuss the details in it. ""He admitted to me that the report was correct in that he had been investigated by the police at the time and no action taken against him. ""I had already told the inquiry in writing that in my opinion he had been abusing his position in Rochdale Council [that is to gain access to council-run children's homes], but that had been properly a matter for the police and the council, and not for me as he was neither an MP nor even a member of the Liberal Party at the time. ""I was in no position to re-open the investigation."" The statement continued: ""I am reinforced in my view by reading the previous report of the inquiry sent to me today, which says inter alia 'the Crown Prosecution Service found that the advice which had previously been given could not be faulted (given the law and guidance in place at the time)' and that the honours scrutiny committee had seriously considered his nomination for a knighthood and sent a 'warning of risk' letter to Margaret Thatcher as PM, and that 'clearly she took a similar view' as he was granted the knighthood. ""It is unfortunate that some sections of the media have chosen to extract certain passages of evidence and present them without the full context. ""The inquiry has a serious and sensitive job to undertake and spinning evidence to generate sensationalist headlines only serves to distract from panel's search of the truth."" Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon who is acting on behalf of seven victims in the abuse inquiry, said Lord Steel's admission that he assumed Smith had committed offences would ""cause victims great anger"". He added: ""Steel's inaction was an appalling dereliction of duty and I hope the inquiry will condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Lord Steel became the Liberal MP for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles in 1965, and became the party's leader in 1976 after the resignation of Jeremy Thorpe, who later stood trial on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder. He was elected as an MSP when the Scottish Parliament opened in 1999, and was appointed as the parliament's first presiding officer. He has been a life peer in the House of Lords since 1997.

Court stops immigration removals from UK,"Hundreds of immigration removals are in doubt after the High Court ordered the Home Office to stop using a controversial ""no warning"" tactic. A charity defending detainees has won an injunction after saying the policy breached the right to access justice. Medical Justice said the policy prevented immigrants having a fair chance to put their case before they were put on a plane out of the country. It said the policy had affected a huge range of people living in the UK. These include members of the Windrush generation and victims of torture, it said. Ordering the injunction, Mr Justice Walker told the Home Office to stop the removals, pending a full review of their lawfulness. The decision means the Home Office must immediately cancel 69 removals scheduled for the coming days but during the hearing, the court heard that hundreds, if not thousands, of people were probably subject to the policy in any one year. The challenge from the charity, represented byThe Public Law Project,external, relates to a policy known as the ""Removal Notice Window"" in which an individual is given three days' notice that they will be removed on any day after that. The individual can then be detained with no further warning - to all intents keeping secret the date of their removal and preventing many of them mounting an effective challenge. In one example, a suicidal man with a serious mental illness was detained and removed on the same day - only for a judge to order the Home Office to bring him back because he had been denied the chance to put his case. In another, a Jamaican man who had been living legally in the UK for decades was detained out of the blue. It took him weeks to compile the comprehensive evidence of his right to live in the UK - and he narrowly avoided being placed on a removal flight. How 15 immigration removal protesters brought an airport to a halt Windrush generation: Who are they and why are they facing problems? Windrush: Home Office accused of ignoring warnings Lawyers for the charity said the vast majority of those targeted had no time to prepare evidence or appeals which they were entitled to present to officials and the courts before a rush to remove them. Charlotte Kilroy QC, for the charity, said the policy was a flagrant interference with the right to seek justice and amounted to a threat to the rule of law. ""The policy is hardwired to produce a situation where there's no access to justice in relation to the decision the secretary of state makes,"" she said. ""There is a significant risk that if interim relief [an injunction] is not granted, individuals will be removed without referral to the courts."" The Home Office's standard removal power remains lawful - meaning officials can still try to remove suspected illegal immigrants, providing they are giving a specific date of when it would happen. Lawyers for the home secretary told the court that the Removal Notice Window policy had been introduced to prevent people deploying ""last-minute attempts to sabotage removal"" under the standard procedure. But ruling against the policy, and halting its use, Mr Justice Walker said concerns raised by the charity meant there had to be a full examination in the summer of whether the policy was lawful. Welcoming the decision, the charity said: ""Denying extremely vulnerable people access to justice on this massive scale is a hidden issue causing serious harm and risking life.""

Police bait thieves with fake masterpiece,"This copy of Crucifixion, by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, is housed in Budapest Police in Italy are unconcerned about the daring theft of a Flemish master's painting - because they had replaced it with a fake a month ago. The painting by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, worth millions, apparently vanished from a church on Wednesday. Thieves used a hammer to smash open its display case and made off in a car. Hours later, Italian police revealed they had heard rumours of the planned heist - and installed cameras to catch the thieves in the act. The painting of the crucifixion had also been replaced with a copy, and the original kept safe and sound, they said. It all happened in the town of Castelnuovo Magra in Liguria, where the painting of the crucifixion is kept in a side alcove of the Santa Maria Maddalena church. The surveillance footage of the raid is now being carefully studied and investigators are chasing down those responsible. Earlier, before the switch was revealed, Mayor Daniele Montebello told Italy's Ansa news agency that the painting was ""a work of inestimable value, a hard blow for our community"". Stolen Degas painting found on a bus The mystery of the stolen Klimt The world's most famous missing painting On Wednesday night, he revealed he had been in on the ruse, explaining that ""today for investigative reasons we could not reveal anything"". He also thanked members of the church for holding their peace - ""because some faithful had noticed that the one on display was not the original, but did not reveal the secret"". Pieter Brueghel the Younger was the son of another Flemish artist - Pieter Bruegel the Elder - and is famous for both his own paintings and the copies he made of his father's work. The Crucifixion is a well-known piece of which several copies exist, with small differences between them - including one in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, Hungary. All are believed to be variations on an original by Bruegel the Elder - but no original by his hand is known to survive.

Female jockey creates Cheltenham history,"Frost had steered Frodon to three wins earlier in the season Bryony Frost made history aboard Frodon as she became the first female jockey to ride a top-level Grade One Cheltenham Festival winner over jumps on an extraordinary day, which was called ""one of the most significant in the meeting's recent history"". Frost, 23, wiped away tears while a rapturous crowd of nearly 70,000 saluted her dramatic victory in the Ryanair Chase. ""He's got his day, he's Pegasus,"" she said of the 9-2 winner - trained by Paul Nicholls - before more emotional scenes followed at the track. Lizzie Kelly chalked up another triumph for the women on Siruh Du Lac, while Paisley Park landed the Stayers' Hurdle for his blind owner Andrew Gemmell. Frost, who started riding aged two on a donkey called Nosey, punched the air and sported a wide smile after securing the most high-profile victory by a female rider at the showpiece meeting. ""He has wings and he is the most incredible battler. He travelled, and by God he jumps,"" said the Devon-born jockey after finishing ahead of 33-1 outsider Asos and Road To Respect (9-2). Ten-time champion trainer Paul Nicholls, who has saddled racing greats such as Kauto Star and Denman, called it ""one of the best days ever"". A buoyant crowd at the Gloucestershire course roared their approval again in the following race as favourite Paisley Park survived a final-flight scare to seal victory for jockey Aidan Coleman and trainer Emma Lavelle. Delighted owner Gemmell, 66, has never seen a racehorse but has put his disability behind him to travel the world and follow sporting events via radio commentaries and help from friends. Carrying his white stick, and wearing a donated claret football scarf, the West Ham fan was helped to the winner's podium by friend Tom Friel, the landlord of the Black Lion pub in East London where Hammers' 1966 World Cup winners Bobby Moore and Sir Geoff Hurst used to drink. Read more:'I couldn't see it but the roar was incredible' BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght This has the ability to be one of the most significant days in the recent history of the Festival. The amount of times people say to me 'oh, horse racing is so old-fashioned, it's all men, all middle-class and really dull'. The fact is, racing has a lot to be confident and on the front foot about, particularly in terms of female participants who weren't even allowed to be part of it until the late 1960s. Bryony Frost guiding Frodon to victory, then 45 minutes later Emma Lavelle being the trainer of Paisley Park, and then Lizzie Kelly goes and rides a winner. These are really significant results. It is really important in a world where other sports are so much more powerful that racing has had a headline-grabbing day. Bryony has everything that's required to be a star in the wider modern sporting world: consummate skills, obviously, but also a communication ability to match - to say the irrepressible Frost has both in bundles doesn't entirely do her justice. There is no doubt that this talented, interesting, bubbly character - the crowds adore her - is a classic poster-person and role model about whom more and more people are sure to be hearing. Television presenter and author Clare Balding praised the achievements of Frost and Kelly Former GB hockey player Sam Quek said both Frost and Lizzie Kelly are superb role models Frost and Frodon have built a perfect partnership over the last two seasons and they were smoothly into their rhythm at the front from the start of the race over two miles and five furlongs. The seven-year-old gelding had been considered for a tilt at the longer Cheltenham Gold Cup on Friday, but it was felt he would be better suited by this contest on rain-softened ground, and he relished the trip. Sub Lieutenant and Road To Respect vied for the lead at one stage, but it was only 33-1 outsider Aso, ridden by Charlie Deutsch for trainer Venetia Williams, who could stay with the leader before having to settle for second. Frost, who was landing her second Grade One win after victory in the Kauto Star Novices' Chase at Kempton in December on Black Corton, said: ""He's the most incredible battler! ""He travelled, my God he jumped, and the moment he got overtaken two out, most horses would have quit. He grabbed me by the hands and said don't you dare give up. He's unbelievable. ""He deserves every single high five, pat and carrot."" Frost is from Buckfastleigh in south Devon Frost is one of a new generation of female jockeys making their mark in a sport where women often compete against men on equal terms. Kelly, who became the first female jockey to win a Grade One jumps race in Britain in December 2015, is another. And she joined Frost on the 2019 roll of honour later on Thursday when Siruh Du Lac claimed the Grade Three handicap chase. The 9-2 chance had to battle all the way to the line to hold off the challenge of favourite Janika. Thursday's double followed Tuesday's first Festival success for Rachael Blackmore - who is bidding to become the first female champion jockey in Ireland - on A Plus Tard. BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt reflects on a memorable day's racing at the Festival Frost has bounced back after suffering serious injuries in a fall last year which ruled her out for three months. She was joined by her family for the celebrations on Thursday, including brother Hadden who flew back from the US for the race. ""Incredible, so proud of her. She and the horse did not miss a beat out there,"" said her father Jimmy. ""We walked the course this morning together and she took it all in, as she showed in the race."" Frost said Frodon had 'made her dreams come true' In a pre-Festivalcolumn for BBC Sport, Frost described her partnership with Frodon, a Cheltenham specialist who has won five times at the Gloucestershire track. ""He's numb in his braveness. He's more competitive and braver than I am. He wants it. He knows his races and courses so well,"" she said. ""If he was a kid who went to school, he would definitely come out with A stars. ""When he was younger, he was quite bullish and a know-it-all. This year, we have really clicked, we have just found this wave we are riding on together. ""I know for a fact he will offer me 100% of himself, and I will give it right back. 'Frod' is the man. It's a privilege to be with him.""

First New York crime boss killed since 1985,"This video can not be played Police at the scene of the shooting in Staten Island The reputed head of New York's Gambino crime family, Frank Cali, has been killed outside his home, say the city's police. Cali, 53, was shot several times in the Todt Hill district of Staten Island on Wednesday evening and died later in hospital. The unidentified killer fled the scene in a blue car, witnesses said. New York media say it is the first targeted killing of a mob boss in the city since 1985. The Gambino operation is said to be one of the five historic Italian-US mafia families in New York. New York Mafia: What's happening to the Five Families? Extortion and omerta: The mafia where it all began Police said Cali's killer shot him at least six times and then ran him over before fleeing the scene. Family members were seen to rush into the street and sit crying next to his body. The motive was not known, according to police. ""There are no arrests and the investigation is ongoing,"" a statement said. A 2008 image of Frank Cali given out by Italian police NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said in a news conference on Thursday that Cali may have been lured outside the home by a car accident before he was attacked. Detective Shea said his Cadillac SUV, which was parked outside the home, was struck leading to Cali to rush outside. After a minute-long conversation, the assassin pulled out a gun and opened fire on him, police say. ""Needless to say, with the potential organised crime angle, it gets the utmost importance [of] the NYPD and the entire detective bureau,"" the detective said, adding that video exists of the attack. New York media say it is the first killing of a family boss in the city since the Gambino family's Paul Castellano was shot dead outside a restaurant in 1985 on the orders of John Gotti. What happened to crime in New York City? The secret lives of Sicily's Mafia hunters Gotti then ran the Gambino family until he was convicted in 1992 of racketeering and five counts of murder. He died in prison in 2002. The Gambino family was once considered the biggest organised crime group in the US, but began to decline after Gotti and other senior figures were jailed. Francesco ""Franky Boy"" Cali is said to have taken over the running of the organisation from Domenico Cefalu in 2015. It is believed he only had one criminal conviction, for conspiring to extort money in 2008 for which he served 16 months in prison. Staten Island's affluent Todt Hill neighbourhood is renowned for its crime connections. It was used as the location for fictional crime boss Don Corleone's compound in the 1972 film The Godfather. Paul Castellano also owned a home there. This house in Todt Hill was the setting for the Corleone family residence in the film The Godfather Neighbours Will and Karen Curitore told CBS News the neighbourhood always seemed safe to them. ""We know there used to be a mob presence here,"" said Mr Curitore. ""We thought this was one of the safer neighbourhoods on Staten Island."" ""I guess unless you're in the mafia,"" Mrs Curitore added. The Genovese, Gambino, Lucchese, Colombo and Bonanno mafia families are believed to have controlled organised crime in New York for decades. Last week,Carmine Persico, the 85-year-old former boss of the Colombo organisation, diedafter serving 33 years of a 139-year prison sentence. On Wednesday,two heads of the Bonanno family, Joseph Cammarano Jr and John Zancocchio, were acquitted,externalin a Manhattan court of racketeering and conspiracy to commit extortion. Last October, 71-year-old Sylvester Zottola, a reputed associate of the Bonanno organisation, was shot dead at a takeaway restaurant in the Bronx, New York.

MP's staff member threatened at office,"A Scottish MP's staff member was threatened by two men who turned up at his constituency office in Crieff on Wednesday night. Conservative Luke Graham, who represents Ochil and South Perthshire, told the Commons the woman was told she was going to be hanged. He called for more to be done to protect people who work for politicians. Speaker John Bercow described the incident as ""despicable"". Mr Graham brought the issue to light when he raised a point of order with the Commons Speaker. He said on Thursday: ""Last night two individuals approached my constituency office, banging on the windows at the one member of staff who was in there. ""She was on her own, she approached the individuals and was told 'in an independent Scotland all of you will be hanging', and 'we will be there at the front cheering on'. ""And also 'I can't wait to come and drag you from this office and get you to the noose'."" He added: ""Mr Speaker, my member of staff was on her own, if she was here now she would say she was a tough woman who was happy to take them, but she shouldn't have to."" The incident came on the nightMPs voted to reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances. Mr Graham added: ""So could I ask your guidance how to stay as respectful as possible in this place and on social media and what can be done to help the security of our staff in our constituencies?"" Mr Bercow said ""that behaviour was despicable and should be condemned unreservedly"", adding he was ""sorry for what ghastly experience his staffer has undergone"". On the point about respect, he said: ""May I suggest these are difficult watchwords, none of us observes them unfailingly, including me, but my watchwords in terms of how we all conduct ourselves are this; political difference, personal amiability."" He gave the example of veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke, the Father of the House, who he said is able to ""express a robust view but to play the ball rather than the man or woman"". The Speaker added that people who make threats or use violence because of a disagreement of view ""need to be shown that is not acceptable, and where they break the law the full force will be applied to them"". Police Scotland confirmed officers were aware of the incident and would be making inquiries about what happened.

Mushrooms may 'prevent mild brain decline',"Eating mushrooms more than twice a week could prevent memory and language problems occurring in the over-60s, research from Singapore suggests. A unique antioxidant present in mushrooms could have a protective effect on the brain, the study found. The more mushrooms people ate, the better they performed in tests of thinking and processing. But researchers said it was not possible to prove a direct link between the fungi and brain function. The National University of Singapore study's findings were based on 663 Chinese adults, aged over 60, whose diet and lifestyle were tracked from 2011 to 2017. Over the six-year study, the researchers found that eating mushrooms lowered the chances of mild cognitive impairment, so that roughly nine out of 100 people who ate more than two portions a week were diagnosed, compared with 19 out of 100 among those who ate fewer than one portion. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can make people forgetful, affect their memory and cause problems with language, attention and locating objects in spaces - but the changes can be subtle. It is not serious enough to be defined as dementia. The participants in the study were asked how often they ate six different types of mushrooms: oyster, shiitake, white button, dried, golden and tinned. Mushroom eaters performed better in brain tests and were found to have faster processing speed - and this was particularly noticeable in those who ate more than two portions a week, or more than 300g (10.5oz). ""This correlation is surprising and encouraging,"" said assistant professor Lei Feng, the lead study author, from the university's department of psychological medicine. ""It seems that a commonly available single ingredient could have a dramatic effect on cognitive decline. ""But we are talking about a combination of many factors - tea, green leafy vegetables, nuts and fish are also beneficial."" Brain clue to 'broken heart' syndrome Brain function of night owls and larks differ, study suggests Devon artist: 'Why mushrooms are my muse' The researchers point to the fact that mushrooms are one of the richest dietary sources of ergothioneine - an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory which humans are unable to make on their own. Mushrooms also contain other important nutrients and minerals such as vitamin D, selenium and spermidine, which protect neurons from damage. But there is still a long way to go before evidence of a direct link can be established. This study relied on self-reported information on mushroom intake and other dietary factors, which may not be accurate, the researchers acknowledged. Dr James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""There are lots of factors that contribute to the development of dementia and it's estimated that up to a third of cases could be prevented by changes in lifestyle, including diet. ""Dementia is one of the top 10 causes of death, but people can take action to reduce their risk, so it's important that we base our advice on consistent evidence that's built up over multiple studies, and don't get carried away with the findings of any one single study. ""So while eating a diet full of fruit and vegetables, including mushrooms, is a great starting point, our best advice is to also cut down on sugar and salt, be physically active, drink in moderation and avoid smoking.""

Kuenssberg: March Brexit out of reach,"More than 80 times Theresa May vowed we would leave the European Union at the end of this month. As the days, then weeks, then months passed with first delays in reaching a deal, and then MPs rejecting it twice, slowly, but surely, that date became less and less realistic. But it was disquiet in Parliament that forced her to relinquish it publicly. Now, it is still technically possible that we could leave at the end of this month - the law has not changed. But politically it is now almost entirely out of reach. MPs vote to seek delay to Brexit Brexit delay: What just happened? The prime minister is accepting she will miss one of the biggest targets she has ever set herself. Tonight's vote is awkward for another reason, as it again displays the Conservatives' fundamental divisions. This is more than a quarrel among friends, but a party that is split down the middle on one of the most vital questions this administration has posed, with cabinet ministers, as well as backbench Brexiteers, lining up to disagree with Theresa May. But it matters that Number 10 escaped an attempt by MPs from different parties to grab hold of this process in a formal way, in tonight's votes. Assumptions have often been made about the power of former Remainers whose strength in numbers, even if narrowly, often falls short. Now two tracks continue - Number 10 will keep working, pushing and grinding on to try again to make the case for their Brexit compromise. And MPs will carry on hunting - and arguing - for alternatives that could take the place of that compromise if it ultimately fails.

Labour MPs quit roles,"Stephanie Peacock was one of those to quit her frontbench roles Five Labour MPs have quit party roles to defy orders and vote against holding a fresh Brexit referendum. Labour ordered its MPs to abstain on a cross-party bid to delay Brexit to allow a referendum on backing whatever deal is agreed or remaining in the EU. But 41 of its MPs rebelled, with 24 supporting a referendum and 17 voting to oppose one. Stephanie Peacock quit as a whip, saying she had been elected to honour the 2016 referendum result. In her letter to Jeremy Corbyn she wrote: ""The people of Barnsley elected me to honour that promise and that is what I did tonight. ""I felt in all good conscience I had to vote tonight to clearly rule out any form of second referendum. I believe the people spoke in 2016 and we need to enact their decision."" MPs vote to seek delay to Brexit Brexit delay 'only a stay of execution' Brexit delay: What just happened? Her Labour colleague Ruth Smeeth, MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, quit as parliamentary private secretary to Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson - saying it was a ""difficult decision but I have a duty to support the will of my constituents"". She wrote: ""We need to leave and leave with a deal that works for the Potteries."" Shadow housing minister Yvonne Fovargue, shadow education minister Emma Lewell-Buck, and shadow business minister Justin Madders, also quit their roles to oppose a referendum. Mr Corbyn thanked them for their service adding: ""I understand the difficulties MPs have felt representing the views of their constituents during this process."" Labour came in for heavy criticism from the SNP and Lib Dems for abstaining on the call for another referendum. The party said it was not the right time to push for another public vote. MPs rejected the amendment, from Independent Group MP Sarah Wollaston, by 334 votes to 85. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Corbyn said: ""I reiterate my conviction that a deal can be agreed based on our alternative plan that can command support across the House. ""I also reiterate our support for a People's Vote - not as a political point-scoring exercise but as a realistic option to break the deadlock."" A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn and other senior Labour figures had held talks with backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, who have put forward a plan to back Theresa May's Brexit deal, in exchange for a referendum. He said it was ""part of Labour's engagement with MPs across Parliament, to find a practical solution to break the Brexit deadlock"". But the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the party of being ""absolutely spineless"" on the issue, tweeting: ""We have lost a people's vote amendment by 334 votes to 85 votes. Labour abstained. ""An opportunity to drive forward the need for such a vote and Labour flunk it. They are the midwifes to Theresa May's Brexit."" Meanwhile most Conservative MPs voted against their own government's motion to delay Brexit after being allowed a free vote on the issue. It meant Mrs May had to rely on Labour and other opposition votes to get her motion through. Seven cabinet ministers were among those to vote against the motion: Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson.

Facebook blames server tweak for issues,"Facebook has only just offered an explanation for the problems it has experienced over the past 24 hours Facebook has said that a ""server configuration change"" was to blame for the worst outage in its history. It said it had ""triggered a cascading series of issues"" for its platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram. The disruption, which lasted for more than 14 hours, left most of its products inaccessible around the globe. It took the social network giant a full day from when the problems began to offer any explanation. It added that everything was now back to normal. ""Yesterday, we made a server configuration change that triggered a cascading series of issues,"" facebook said. ""As a result, many people had difficulty accessing our apps and services. ""We have resolved the issues and our systems have been recovering over the last few hours. ""We are very sorry for the inconvenience and we appreciate everyone's patience."" Commentators have questioned the length of time it took the social network to issue an explanation for the disruption, which affected advertisers who have marketing campaigns on the platform as well as consumers. Independent security analyst Graham Cluley told the BBC: ""Facebook's motto always used to be 'move fast and break things'. That's fine when you're an innovative start-up, but when billions of people are using your site every month it's not a good way to run the business."" Some early reports suggested that the social network could be under cyber-attack, something that Facebook was quick to deny on rival platform Twitter. ""When popular sites like these go dark many people often think there must be a sinister explanation - such as a hacker attack,"" said Mr Cluley. ""However, anyone who has worked in IT for any length of time knows that screw-ups are all too common.  It doesn't always have to be cyber-criminals who are to blame.""

Facebook loses two top executives,"Chris Cox was one of Facebook's longest-serving executives and a confidante of Mr Zuckerberg. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has announced the departure of the firm's chief product officer Chris Cox and head of WhatsApp Chris Daniels. Mr Cox joined in 2005, a year after Facebook was founded, while Mr Daniels took up his role only a year ago. No reason has explicitly been given for their departure. The changes come shortly after Mr Zuckerbergoutlined his plan to transform Facebook into a ""privacy-focused platform."" This week the social media giant and its platforms WhatsApp and Instagramalso experienced the worst outage in the company's history. Facebook later blamed the blackout on a ""server configuration change"". Facebook revamps its privacy controls WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger to 'merge' Mr Cox, a confidante of Mr Zuckerberg, started as a software engineer at the firm and helped to build several key features including News Feed. He also held several senior roles, heading up human resources and helping to launch Facebook's business platform Workplace. In a separate Facebook post,Mr Cox addressed the recent proposal,externalto shift Facebook further towards private, encrypted communication. ""This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through."" He did not give a reason for leaving, but Mr Zuckerberg insisted that he had ""been discussing... his desire to do something else"" for several years. Mr Daniels, meanwhile, started as head of Whatsapp after five years of running Internet.org, an initiative to boost internet connectivity around the world. He will be replaced by Will Cathcart, who currently heads up Facebook's mobile app. Fidji Simo, who ran the app while Mr Cathcart was away on paternity leave, will take on his role. No replacement has been announced for Mr Cox. Facebook has lost several top executives during the last two years, including its general counsel, chief security officer, and co-founders of WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, a virtual reality firm it bought in 2014. Facebook has been sharply criticised in the past over lack of user privacy and the spread of offensive content and misinformation. Despite the scandal, Facebook says its user numbers have continued to grow.It says the number of people who logged into its site at least once a month jumped 9% last year, to 2.32 billion people. User numbers in the US - its second-largest market - have fallen by 15 million since 2017, however, according to market research firm Edison Research.

Honours panel 'told of Savile abuse in 1998',"The committee that recommends people for knighthoods received allegations of child sexual abuse against Jimmy Savile in 1998, an inquiry has heard. The head of the Honours Committee also resisted pressure from Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to knight Savile, according to letters seen by the probe. Savilesexually abused at least 72 people, including eight who were raped. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuseis investigating both institutions and public figures. Savile, who died in 2011, was ultimately knighted in 1990 in recognition of his charity work. How did Savile get away with it? The victims' stories Thatcher fought to knight Savile The Westminster strand of the inquiry heard civil servants were wary of Savile as early as 1984. In letters exchanged with then prime minister Mrs Thatcher's secretary, committee head Lord Robert Armstrong cited interviews with Savile published in the Sun the previous year in which the BBC DJ boasted about sleeping with hundreds of girls, having people assaulted, and telling a suicidal man how he could take his own life. ""My committee did not feel that sufficient time has elapsed since Mr Savile's unfortunate revelations in the popular press in April of this year,"" Lord Armstrong wrote. ""He is much in the public eye and it is unlikely that the lurid details of his story will have been forgotten. I fear it would be best if Mr Savile were to wait a little longer."" He later refused to include him in the birthday honours list, saying time had ""served only to strengthen the doubts felt about a knighthood for Mr Savile"". He had been advised awarding a knighthood to Savile would bring the honours system into ""disrepute"", he wrote. This video can not be played ""Jane"" was abused by Savile when she was staying in hospital aged 16 In 1998, the committee received an anonymous letter that said ""reports of a paedophilia nature"" could emerge about Savile and allegations about his involvement with boys. It said: ""While within limits and bounds homosexuality can be rationalised in a modern society, we must not lose sight that paedophilia goes beyond any boundaries which right-minded people of whatever political persuasions find abhorrent."" Giving evidence to the inquiry, senior civil servant Helen MacNamara - who currently heads the Honours and Appointments Secretariat - said such a letter would now be passed to police immediately. She added that she did not know how the letter was dealt with at the time or if any concerns were raised with authorities. Jimmy Savile report: Key sections Jimmy Savile and the NHS 'How could this be allowed to happen?' The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces, and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. The inquiry is being led by Prof Alexis Jay, a former director of social services who headed the inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham.

Brexit delay: What just happened?,"Three more months of Brexit debate, then? British MPs have voted for a delay in the Brexit process for three months or more, after struggling to agree on what terms the UK should leave the European Union on 29 March. You might think, after months of division, infighting and uncertainty that surely,surely, this means everything will go smoothly from here. Well... no. Here's what just happened, why it matters, and what might happen next. Members of Parliament have struggled to agree how Britain should leave the EU on 29 March. Deals proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May (and agreed with the EU) have twice failed to get through the House of Commons. Now, MPs hope their 413 to 202 vote on Thursday will help them agree a deal. Any problem? Yes - the Brexit deadline is legally binding, and can't be extended without the agreement of all 27 other EU countries. Even if the deadline is extended to help prompt the divided British Parliament (and divided governing Conservative Party) to agree a Brexit deal, there's no guarantee they will. Latest updates A really simple guide to Brexit This is all coming to a head now because the British government triggered the start of the two-year departure process on 29 March 2017. With days to go until that finishing post, it's no clearer on what terms the UK should pull out (on trade, the transition period and the status of the Irish border, for example). Brexit: What could happen next? The prime minister's two (rather similar) proposals have failed to get the backing of a majority in Parliament, partly because the more hardline but influential Brexiteers within her own party have snubbed her proposals. Which leaves us where we are now. There are serious concerns that leaving the EU without a deal in place could damage the economy and lead to shortages or price increases in food and medicine, among other consequences. MPs voted on Wednesday to rule out leaving with no deal, but that vote isn't binding. Here are 10 ways a no-deal could affect people Now MPs hope that the delay of three months or more they agreed on Thursday can help them finally find a consensus. If only it were that straightforward. The British government can't just click its fingers and extend the deadline. It will need to make a convincing case to the 27 other EU countries as towhythe deadline should be extended. The EU would then need to agree that this is the best way forward. The question of how long it should be extended also now comes into play. How can Brexit date be delayed? What do MPs actually want from Brexit? On Thursday, the British Parliament agreed that Brexit could be delayed by three months, until 30 June. However, that is on the condition that MPs agree a deal by next Wednesday so there is enough breathing space before it's implemented. But the only deal on the table right now is the same one MPs rejected on Tuesday. What's to say it won't be rejected again? On the other hand, the EU has indicated that it wants a longer deadline. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Donald Tusk, the European Council president who represents all EU members' interests, said on Thursday he would urge those countries ""to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it"". That agreement would have to come at a summit in Brussels next week. For this to happen, the EU has said it would want the UK to demonstrate a clear strategy. What Europe thinks of extending deadline But a longer deadline still wouldn't offer a guarantee that the British Parliament would agree a deal in that time - it might just prolong the arguments. And a longer delay (that would still need to be agreed by both parties) would probably, awkwardly, require the UK to take part in European elections in late May. So could there be a second referendum? That too was ruled out by MPs on Thursday. One of the biggest bones of contention is what should happen to the so-called backstop. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Both sides have committed to avoiding the return of a hard border - physical checks or infrastructure - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK leaves the EU. The backstop is a safety net, an arrangement that will apply to the Irish border after Brexit if a wider deal or technological solution can't be found that keeps the border as frictionless as it is today. But Conservative Brexiteers are concerned that the backstop could keep the UK indefinitely locked into an arrangement with the EU, if no alternative is found. Will the EU accept a Brexit delay?

Does the UK need to hold European elections?,"It is becoming a key question in this complex Brexit process. If the UK was to request, or be offered, a lengthy extension of its membership of the European Union (EU), would there be an obligation to take part in May's European elections? Both the UK government and the European Commission (EC) say that there would; but legal opinion is divided, and many lawyers argue that a satisfactory fix could be found. The elections are taking place between 23 and 26 May, although the new parliament will not sit, and new members will not be sworn in, until  2 July. That is why it has been argued thatan extension of Article 50 until the end of Junewould not prove to be a problem. But what about a much longer extension - potentially as long as 21 months until the end of 2020? That takes the debate into much trickier legal and political territory. The issue has taken on renewed relevance afterthe President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, wrote in a tweet,externalthat he will appeal to the 27 other EU leaders over the next few days ""to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy"". Theresa May has indicated that she would only favour a ""short technical extension"" to the UK's EU membership, if that was necessary in order to turn a last-minute agreement into law. But a longer extension, she told MPs, ""would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament (EP) elections in May 2019"". Yes - as the ""guardian of the treaties"", the Commission has strong views on this. In a letter to Mr Tusk on March 11,,externalJean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said that if the UK is still part of the EU at the end of May ""it will be legally required to hold these elections, in line with the rights and obligations of all Member States as set out in the Treaties"". There is no question that the UK would be in breach of those treaty obligations if it failed to hold elections. But how much would that matter, if the UK was on a path out of the EU anyway? That is an unresolved debate that may eventually have to be tested in court. A legal opinion issued by the German Bundestag's Europe Department says that Article 50 cannot be extended beyond the end of May unless the UK holds elections. It suggests that the European Commission might choose to begin treaty infringement proceedings against the UK for denying the vote to UK or EU citizens in the UK. The UK'sDepartment for Exiting the European Union argues,externalthat the UK would have to take part in the elections because ""the EU Treaties provide that EU citizens have the right to be represented"" and the European Parliament ""needs to be properly constitutedâ¦ with duly elected representatives from all Member States"" in order to perform its functions. How can Article 50 be extended? Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? But others disagree. A confidential legal opinion, written by the European Parliament's own legal service and seen by the BBC, argues that the new parliament could be legally constituted even if the UK had not taken part in the elections. ""The potential infringement by a Member State of its duties and responsibilities under the Treaties and the Electoral Act cannot amount,"" the opinion says, ""to an absolute bar to the regular functioning of the Institution."" If the UK didn't take part in the elections, there would be considerable concern about legal challenges, either from those who might argue that their right to be represented was being denied, or from those who might argue that the UK was paying money into the EU budget without receiving all the benefits. But representation is not necessarily the same thing as holding elections. When countries join the EU, there have been periods when national MPs have been appointed to serve as representatives in the European Parliament until the next European elections take place. This happened with Romania and Bulgaria in 2007. Could a similar temporary measure apply as an existing EU member seeks to leave? Perhaps. Another alternative that has been suggested is that the UK's current MEPs could continue to sit in the next European Parliament until the end of the Article 50 period, or they could be granted some form of observer status. All of this is uncharted legal territory. Jean-Claude Juncker says the UK ""will be legally required to hold these elections"" if it is still part of the EU at the end of May But the UK's most senior lawyer at the European Court of Justice, Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston, seems convinced that a solution can be found. There would be a need, she wrote on Twitter, ""to arrange for British MEPs to sit in the new (parliament) as additional members on a temporary 'Brexit-limited' basis"". Any suggestion that the European elections represent an ""insuperable obstacle"" to a longer extension of Article 50 is, she added, ""an oversimplified and ultimately fallacious presentation of the facts"". Ms Sharpston emphasised that she was writing in a personal capacity, but her opinion clearly carries some weight. ""If the political will to agree a longer extension of Article 50 is there, she concluded, ""a legal mechanism can be found to accommodate that desire and 'deal with' the issue of the EP elections."" A legal solution could be found within Article 50 itself. It is already being used to offer the UK an extensive transition period after Brexit, even though it does not mention transition explicitly. ""An argument could be made that extending existing MEPs also qualifies as a transitional arrangement,"" says Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, ""The formal position is that the UK would need to hold elections,"" Prof Barnard says. ""But it is likely that those MEPs would only serve for a maximum of two years, so it would be in the interest of both sides to find a creative solution. ""One possibility is to see how far Article 50 can be stretched."" Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external How does another Brexit delay work?

Boeing 737 aircraft grounded 'until May',"All Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 aircraft will remain grounded at least until May after the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said. The aircraft will not fly until a software update can be tested and installed, the US regulator said. Sunday's crash, shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa, killed 157 people from 35 nations. It was the second crash involving a 737 Max in six months. Some people have pointed to similarities between the incidents, with some experts citing satellite data and evidence from the crash scene as showing links between Sunday's disaster and October's crash in Indonesia of the Lion Air jet that killed 189 people. US Representative Rick Larsen said the software upgrade would take a few weeks to complete, and installing it on all the aircraft would take ""at least through April"". The FAA said on Wednesday that a software fix for the 737 Max that Boeing had been working on since the Lion Air crash would take months to complete. Meanwhile, investigators in France have taken charge of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines aircraft's black boxes as they attempt to uncover what caused the Boeing 737 Max disaster. The Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) received the flight data and cockpit voice recorders on Thursday. The first readings could take days, but a lot depends on the boxes' condition. Regulators across the world continue to ground the Boeing aircraft. On Thursday, Russia, Japan and Tunisia banned the jet from their airspace. Late on Wednesday, the FAA told the country's airlines to ground their fleets, but was criticised for not doing it sooner. Boeing grounded: What it means for air travel Ethiopian Airlines probe: What do we know? Boeing grounds entire crash aircraft fleet Ethiopian Airlines crash: Six charts on what we know Possible similarities between the accidents, focussing on the aircraft's anti-stall system, have shocked the aviation industry and raised questions over Boeing's, and the FAA's, insistence earlier this week the the Max 737 was safe to fly. In addition to Max aircraft in service, about another 5,000 are on order from airlines. Garuda Indonesia said there was a possibility it would cancel its 20-strong order for Max jets, depending on what the FAA does. This video can not be played Trump: Boeing 737 Max planes grounded A BEA spokesman said he did not know what condition the black boxes were in. ""First we will try to read the data,"" the spokesman said, adding that the first analyses could take between half a day and several days. There have been reports, including by Reuters, that there was a tussle over which safety authority would take the lead in examining the black boxes. Reports said Germany was initially asked to conduct the analysis because Ethiopian Airlines had been unhappy at the way the Paris-based organisation had investigated a crash in Lebanon in 2010. Britain and the US both have highly-respected crash investigation agencies. How long the analysis by the BEA will take depends on a number of things. First, the state of the recorders themselves. They are contained in very robust housings designed to withstand tremendous forces, and they are placed in the rear of the aircraft where they may be sheltered from the worst effects of an impact. Nevertheless, they can still be damaged, particularly by intense fire. The investigators will need to extract the memory modules, basically circuit boards covered with memory chips, and carry out any necessary repairs. The modules are designed so that information is spread across a series of chips. If one part is damaged, there should still be useable information elsewhere. Once downloaded, the data also has to be read. Surprisingly, it is not recorded in a standard form - so investigators will need to know how to make it useable. That will need input from the airline itself. If all goes well, the investigators will have access to thousands of pieces of data about the aircraft - not only what was going on on the fatal flight itself, but also on previous journeys. They will also be able to hear what was going on in the cockpit, what the pilots said to one another, and if any audible warnings were sounding. All of that should go a long way towards establishing the immediate causes of the accident - and finding out whether there really were common factors with the Lion Air crash.

Brexit delay 'only a stay of execution',"A vote in Parliament to seek a delay to Brexit could only be ""a stay of execution"", according to business group the CBI. Industry bodies saw a glimmer of hope in the vote, but said the UK could still crash out of the EU with no deal. The British Chambers of Commerce said the vote ""leaves firms with no real clarity on the future."" The pound fell a third of a cent against the dollar immediately following the vote. The fall follows a climb to nine-month highs against the US dollar and a nearly two-year high against the euro after a vote on Wednesday. The House of Commons voted by a majority of 210 for Theresa May to request an extension to the two-year Brexit negotiation process, pushing the EU exit back from its current 29 March deadline, as long as the 27 other European Union states agree. The latest vote came after MPs rejected Theresa May's withdrawal agreement for the second time and then ruled out a no-deal Brexit. Mrs May will now renew efforts to get her Brexit deal approved by Parliament. She is putting pressure on MPs to back her by threatening a longer delay if they vote against her. However, business groups remained sceptical about the Brexit process. Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: ""After an exasperating few days, Parliament's rejection of no deal and desire for an extension shows there is still some common sense in Westminster. But without a radically new approach, business fears this is simply a stay of execution."" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: ""Britain stands on a knife edge. Parliament must put an end to this uncertainty."" ""Without definitive action by MPs in the next six days, we will see the UK crashing out of the EU on 29 March without a deal."" Brexit uncertaintyhas had mixed effects on the UK economy. Retail spending slowed sharply towards the end of last year, while surveys suggest an increase in manufacturing has largely been driven by companies speeding up production due to the risk of no-deal disruption. Business investment has been one casualty of the uncertainty, with a slow down in December recorded by theOffice for National Statistics,external. It said that investment had fallen quarter on quarter all through the year for the first time since the economic downturn of 2008 to 2009. The Bank of England ascribed the falls to ""rising uncertainty, mostly related to concerns around Brexit"". Business groups have beenincreasingly exasperatedby a lack of progress in Parliament on Brexit. Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""Once again, businesses are left waiting for Parliament to reach a consensus on the way forward and are losing faith that they will achieve this. ""In the meantime, firms are continuing to enact their contingency plans, anxiety amongst many businesses is rising, and customers are being lost. ""Businesses, jobs, investment and our communities are still firmly in the danger zone."" Catherine McGuinness, policy chair of The City of London Corporation said: ""The clock is ticking. Further delays will mean households and businesses remain hostage to the crippling economic uncertainty that has already plagued them since the referendum.""

"Court stops immigration removals from UKHundreds of immigration removals are in doubt after a court halts a controversial ""no warning"" tactic.","Hundreds of immigration removals are in doubt after the High Court ordered the Home Office to stop using a controversial ""no warning"" tactic. A charity defending detainees has won an injunction after saying the policy breached the right to access justice. Medical Justice said the policy prevented immigrants having a fair chance to put their case before they were put on a plane out of the country. It said the policy had affected a huge range of people living in the UK. These include members of the Windrush generation and victims of torture, it said. Ordering the injunction, Mr Justice Walker told the Home Office to stop the removals, pending a full review of their lawfulness. The decision means the Home Office must immediately cancel 69 removals scheduled for the coming days but during the hearing, the court heard that hundreds, if not thousands, of people were probably subject to the policy in any one year. The challenge from the charity, represented byThe Public Law Project,external, relates to a policy known as the ""Removal Notice Window"" in which an individual is given three days' notice that they will be removed on any day after that. The individual can then be detained with no further warning - to all intents keeping secret the date of their removal and preventing many of them mounting an effective challenge. In one example, a suicidal man with a serious mental illness was detained and removed on the same day - only for a judge to order the Home Office to bring him back because he had been denied the chance to put his case. In another, a Jamaican man who had been living legally in the UK for decades was detained out of the blue. It took him weeks to compile the comprehensive evidence of his right to live in the UK - and he narrowly avoided being placed on a removal flight.

"Woman smashes pi world recordEmma Haruka Iwao calculates the value of pi to 31 trillion digits, after a lifelong fascination.Technology","Emma Haruka Iwao The value of the number pi has been calculated to a new world record length of 31 trillion digits, far past the previous record of 22 trillion. Emma Haruka Iwao, a Google employee from Japan, found the new digits with the help of the company's cloud computing service. Pi is the number you get when you divide a circle's circumference by its diameter. The first digits, 3.14, are well known but the number is infinitely long. Extending the known sequence of digits in pi is very difficult because the number follows no set pattern. Pi is used in engineering, physics, supercomputing and space exploration - because its value can be used incalculations for waves,external, circles and cylinders. The pursuit of longer versions of pi is a long-standing pastime among mathematicians. And Ms Iwao said she had been fascinated by the number since she had been a child. The calculation required 170TB of data (for comparison, 200,000 music tracks take up 1TB) and took 25 virtual machines 121 days to complete. US beats China in supercomputer list The race to make the world's most powerful computer ever Coding the future:  What will the future of computing look like? The symbol for pi is also the 16th letter in the Greek alphabet ""I feel very surprised,"" Ms Iwao, who has worked at Google for the past three years, said of her achievement. ""I am still trying to adjust to the reality. The world record has been really hard."" But she still hopes to expand on her work. ""There is no end with pi, I would love to try with more digits,"" she told BBC News. It would take 332,064 years to say the 31.4 trillion digit number. Google announced the news in a blog on Pi Day (14 March - ""3.14"" in American date notation). Nasa has previously publisheda list of some of the ways in which it uses pi,external. These include: calculating the size of a parachute required to send a rover down on to the surface of Mars working out how many rectangular camera images will be needed to map the surface of a planet getting spacecraft to brake at just the right time to enter orbit around planets ""Pi is useful not only for measuring circles but it also appears in calculations for everything from the period of a pendulum to the buckling force of a beam,"" said mathematician Matt Parker. ""Modern maths, physics, engineering and technology could not function without pi."" In 2010, Nicholas Sze used Yahoo cloud computing tocalculate that the two quadrillionth digit of Pi was zero- a calculation that would have taken 500 years on a standard computer at that time. However, he did not calculate all the digits in between. 78,000 x 550? This boy knows the answer. Video, 00:00:5978,000 x 550?

Stolen masterpiece was switched with fake,"This copy of Crucifixion, by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, is housed in Budapest Police in Italy are unconcerned about the daring theft of a Flemish master's painting - because they had replaced it with a fake a month ago. The painting by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, worth millions, apparently vanished from a church on Wednesday. Thieves used a hammer to smash open its display case and made off in a car. Hours later, Italian police revealed they had heard rumours of the planned heist - and installed cameras to catch the thieves in the act. The painting of the crucifixion had also been replaced with a copy, and the original kept safe and sound, they said. It all happened in the town of Castelnuovo Magra in Liguria, where the painting of the crucifixion is kept in a side alcove of the Santa Maria Maddalena church. The surveillance footage of the raid is now being carefully studied and investigators are chasing down those responsible. Earlier, before the switch was revealed, Mayor Daniele Montebello told Italy's Ansa news agency that the painting was ""a work of inestimable value, a hard blow for our community"". Stolen Degas painting found on a bus The mystery of the stolen Klimt The world's most famous missing painting On Wednesday night, he revealed he had been in on the ruse, explaining that ""today for investigative reasons we could not reveal anything"". He also thanked members of the church for holding their peace - ""because some faithful had noticed that the one on display was not the original, but did not reveal the secret"". Pieter Brueghel the Younger was the son of another Flemish artist - Pieter Bruegel the Elder - and is famous for both his own paintings and the copies he made of his father's work. The Crucifixion is a well-known piece of which several copies exist, with small differences between them - including one in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, Hungary. All are believed to be variations on an original by Bruegel the Elder - but no original by his hand is known to survive.

Scholes resigns as Oldham manager,"Paul Scholes played more than 700 times for Manchester United during his playing career Former Manchester United and England midfielder Paul Scholes has left his role as Oldham boss after just 31 days. The 44-year-old took on his first managerial job on 11 February and was only in charge of the League Two club for seven games, winning one. Scholes said in a statement that he had decided to resign with ""great regret"". ""It unfortunately became clear that I would not be able to operate as I intended and was led to believe prior to taking on the role,"" he continued. 'A dream that turned into a nightmare' - how it went wrong for Scholes at Oldham Scholes took over with the Latics 14th in the table, nine points off the play-offs, and leaves with them in the same position. He began his reign with a4-1 win over Yeovil Town, but three draws and two defeats followed prior to his final match, a 2-0 defeat by league leaders Lincoln City on Tuesday. ""I hoped to, at the very least, see out my initial term of 18 months as the manager of a club I've supported all my life,"" he said. ""The fans, players, my friends and family all knew how proud and excited I was to take this role. ""I wish the fans, the players and the staff - who have been tremendous - all the best for the rest of the season and will continue to watch and support the club as a fan."" Scholes made 718 appearances for Manchester United, including 499 in the Premier League, and scored 155 goals in all competitions. He initially announced his retirement at the end of the 2010-11 season, but made a comeback at the start of 2012 beforefinally calling time on his career in 2013, having won 11 Premier League titles, three FA Cups, two League Cups, five Community Shields and two Champions Leagues. He also played 66 times for England, retiring after Euro 2004 to focus on his club career. Scholes resigned as a director of National League side Salford upon taking over at Boundary Park, but he retained his shareholding and could now return. Salford could be promoted to League Two this season and EFL rules prevent a person holding roles with two clubs at the same time without prior consent, although a holding of 10% or less in a club is disregarded providing it is held ""purely for investment purposes"". Paul Scholes was first interested in the Oldham manager's job in 2016, and finally landed it last month Moroccan football agent Abdallah Lemsagam became Oldham owner in January 2018 and is now looking for his fifth manager, although Scholes' predecessor Pete Wild was only in charge in a caretaker capacity. A club statement said: ""Oldham Athletic Football Club can confirm that Paul Scholes has resigned from his position as first-team manager with immediate effect. ""We would like to place on record our thanks to Paul for his efforts during his spell in charge of the club and would like to wish him well for the future. ""An update on the permanent replacement will be made as soon as possible."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone There were plenty, privately as well as publicly, who told Scholes that cutting his managerial teeth at Oldham was a bad idea. But, such was his long-held desire to manage his hometown club, he ignored them all. As he has proved so regularly as a pundit, Scholes is a straight talker. He is also decisive. It was always the case he would resist any outside interference, which is a claim that has been levelled at Oldham owner Abdallah Lemsagam on more than one occasion, and in the end, the former Manchester United midfielder's status became untenable. To many, it will not come as a surprise. To others, there will be a sense of satisfaction given how brutal Scholes has been at dishing out criticism from the comfort of the pundit's chair. Yet there is sadness too - sadness that Scholes couldn't make his dream job work, and sadness that one of those most gifted players of his generation should find himself on the outside again when surely, there is a role for him inside.

Senate revolts against Trump over border,"President Trump says the situation on the southern border constitutes a national crisis Rebel members of President Donald Trump's party have helped pass a vote to reject his declaration of an emergency on the US-Mexico border. Twelve Republican senators broke party ranks to side with Democrats, approving a proposal to revoke the proclamation by 59-41. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last month backed the measure. Following Thursday's vote, Mr Trump tweeted: ""VETO!"" Congress needs a two-thirds majority of both chambers to override a presidential veto, which is viewed as unlikely in this case. Nevertheless, the vote will be seen as an embarrassing loss for the president on his signature domestic issue. On Twitter, Mr Trump slammed the vote, calling it a ""Democrat inspired Resolution which would OPEN BORDERS while increasing Crime, Drugs and Trafficking in our Country"". Allow Twitter content?

It comes just a day after the Senate rebuked him on foreign policyby approving a bill to end US support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The Republican rebels on Thursday were Mitt Romney and Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Rob Portman of Ohio, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Thom Tillis of North Carolina changed his mind minutes before the vote and said he would oppose it. The Republican president declared the emergency on 15 February after Congress refused funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border, a key campaign pledge. He aims to circumvent Congress and build his long-promised barrier by raiding military budgets. It could free up almost $8bn (Â£6bn) for the wall, which is still considerably short of the estimated $23bn cost of a barrier along almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) of border, but far more than the nearly $1.4bn begrudgingly allotted last month by Congress. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington By any standards this is a big rebellion by Republicans in the Senate and therefore a significant embarrassment for the president. But what it's not, is a repudiation by them of his border wall policy which many of them support with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Which begs the question: what were they bothered about? In straightforward terms, the use of national emergency powers was seen as overreach by the president in two ways: First, it is a pretty blatant attempt to bypass Congress's power of the purse - its constitutional right to raise and spend money. The president had demanded billions for the wall, Congress hadn't agreed it; the government shutdown; and eventually the White House backed down. So going after the cash by this route was seen as not playing by the rules. Second, Democrats and some Republicans regard this as a power grab that could set a dangerous precedent. In the past, a constant refrain from Republicans was that former President Barack Obama regularly abused executive powers to do things he should have won congressional backing for. And many of the current batch of Republican Senators will be in situ long after President Trump has departed. They might find it harder, if they'd backed the president now, to argue that a future Democratic president couldn't use emergency powers to, say, move on gun ownership or climate change. So these rebellious Republicans get to have their cake and eat it. A marker has been laid down, but, with no chance of a veto override, the president still gets his way. Or at least for the time being. Ultimately it will be the nine justices of the Supreme Court who will decide where legitimate authority ends and overreach begins. Earlier on Thursday Mr Trump called Democrats ""border deniers"" and said any Republican opposing him would be casting ""a vote for Nancy Pelosi"". Allow Twitter content?

He says the barrier is needed to combat illegal immigration on the southern border which he has described as a ""crisis"". Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan Reaction to Trump's national emergency A major land grab by Trump Democrats say the declaration is unconstitutional, Mr Trump has manufactured the border emergency and a wall would be a boondoggle. The resolution to revoke the declaration passed the House by a margin of 245-182 in February. Thirteen Republicans sided with Democrats. Lawmakers used a provision from the National Emergencies Act to overrule the president. Most Republicans supported Mr Trump's decision and accused Democrats of ignoring an emergency at the border. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the declaration is ""the predictable and understandable consequences of Democrats' decision to put partisan obstruction ahead of the national interest"". The renegade conservatives largely condemned Mr Trump's declaration for setting up a dangerous presidential precedent while still agreeing with his border policies. ""This issue is not about strengthening our border security, a goal that I support and have voted to advance,"" Mrs Collins said ahead of the vote. ""It is a solemn occasion involving whether or not this body will stand up for its institutional prerogatives and will support the separation of powers enshrined in our constitution."" Mr Paul agreed Congress must fund border security, ""but no president should go around Congress"". He added that if the declaration stands, it could allow a future ""socialist-inclined president"" to pass environmental or gun control legislation. Mr Romney echoed a similar sentiment, calling the use of an emergency an ""overreach"" that ""is an invitation to further expansion and abuse by future presidents"".

Burglary death victim's 999 call released,"This video can not be played Maureen Whale told the 999 call handler she was finding it hard to breathe before she went quiet as an ambulance was called A recording of a 999 call made by a 77-year-old woman who died following a burglary at her home has been released. Maureen Whale's home in Barnet, north London, was broken into on 4 December. She collapsedwhile speaking to the emergency services. A post-mortem examination gave her cause of death as coronary heart disease brought on by stress. Ms Whale'sstolen handbag was found in a hedge near her home in Bells Hill. The Metropolitan Police are trying to trace three suspects and have offered a Â£20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh said: ""Maureen died for the few pounds that were in her purse. ""It is so wrong that a woman who was so adventurous travelling the world in her younger days should die in such awful circumstances, for just a few pounds, in her own home."" Ms Whale had lived in Bells Hill all her life On the 999 call, Ms Whale can be heard telling the operator the two men had been in her house ""two minutes ago"" and had walked off with her handbag. She was shaking, finding it hard to breathe and could not talk. The operator pleaded: ""Maureen hang on in there please."" But there was no response. Ms Whale's family had lived in the house since 1928.

To her, it was home. ""The fact someone broke in to somewhere she felt secure is just tragic. ""Hearing the last phone call made by my aunt is extremely distressing but we hope that, by releasing this to the public, someone somewhere will be moved to come forward with information. ""No-one deserves to die in this way."" Police have released CCTV images of the three suspects The incident is being linked to burglaries at two more properties in the same road on the same evening and another about half a mile away in Sampson Avenue at 11:45 GMT that day.

Woman smashes pi world record,"Emma Haruka Iwao The value of the number pi has been calculated to a new world record length of 31 trillion digits, far past the previous record of 22 trillion. Emma Haruka Iwao, a Google employee from Japan, found the new digits with the help of the company's cloud computing service. Pi is the number you get when you divide a circle's circumference by its diameter. The first digits, 3.14, are well known but the number is infinitely long. Extending the known sequence of digits in pi is very difficult because the number follows no set pattern. Pi is used in engineering, physics, supercomputing and space exploration - because its value can be used incalculations for waves,external, circles and cylinders. The pursuit of longer versions of pi is a long-standing pastime among mathematicians. And Ms Iwao said she had been fascinated by the number since she had been a child. The calculation required 170TB of data (for comparison, 200,000 music tracks take up 1TB) and took 25 virtual machines 121 days to complete. US beats China in supercomputer list The race to make the world's most powerful computer ever Coding the future:  What will the future of computing look like? The symbol for pi is also the 16th letter in the Greek alphabet ""I feel very surprised,"" Ms Iwao, who has worked at Google for the past three years, said of her achievement. ""I am still trying to adjust to the reality. The world record has been really hard."" But she still hopes to expand on her work. ""There is no end with pi, I would love to try with more digits,"" she told BBC News. It would take 332,064 years to say the 31.4 trillion digit number. Google announced the news in a blog on Pi Day (14 March - ""3.14"" in American date notation). Nasa has previously publisheda list of some of the ways in which it uses pi,external. These include: calculating the size of a parachute required to send a rover down on to the surface of Mars working out how many rectangular camera images will be needed to map the surface of a planet getting spacecraft to brake at just the right time to enter orbit around planets ""Pi is useful not only for measuring circles but it also appears in calculations for everything from the period of a pendulum to the buckling force of a beam,"" said mathematician Matt Parker. ""Modern maths, physics, engineering and technology could not function without pi."" In 2010, Nicholas Sze used Yahoo cloud computing tocalculate that the two quadrillionth digit of Pi was zero- a calculation that would have taken 500 years on a standard computer at that time. However, he did not calculate all the digits in between. 78,000 x 550? This boy knows the answer. Video, 00:00:5978,000 x 550?

"NHS let me down, says health manager with cancer","Lisa Pammen waited three months for bowel cancer treatment Lisa Pammen has spent most of her working life in the NHS - first as a paramedic and then as a manager of a group of GP practices. But when she really needed the NHS, it was not there for her. For 18 months, she struggled with abdominal pains - but despite visits to the GP and hospital, her cancer was not spotted. Only after the 49-year-old ended up in accident and emergency (A&E) was she diagnosed with late-stage bowel cancer, which had by then spread to her ovaries and abdomen. It took her three months to start treatment from the original GP referral - despite the fact the NHS is meant to do this within two months. Mrs Pammen, from York, said: ""I feel let down. ""It was extremely frustrating as I felt like I was left floundering for weeks and no-one was listening to me. ""I was in intense pain and had a family history of bowel cancer and yet it felt like these things were being ignored. ""I genuinely feel that because of these long referral times all my worry and anxieties were heightened, and it's made the treatment 10 times harder to deal with."" Sadly, the problems experienced by Mrs Pammen are not unique. Latest figures from the NHS in England show only half of patients are diagnosed at an early stage, while nearly one in four patients waits longer than they should for treatment to start - the worst performance since records began, in 2009.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Sara Hiom, of Cancer Research UK, said the whole system was being undermined by a lack of staff. ""The figures show an NHS under continued strain, with many patients still waiting too long to get a diagnosis and start treatment."" Pressure has been growing for some time. The target to see patients within two months has been missed for more than three years. In fact, this target has been met in only three months out of the past 60. And during that time, 130,000 patients have waited longer than they should have for their life-saving treatment. Dominic Bell, a manager at Macmillan Cancer Support's helpline, said it was as bad as he had known. ""I've worked on the support line for the last seven years and throughout that time we've taken more and more calls from people going out of their mind with worry while they wait for a diagnosis and treatment. ""Dealing with the prospect or the reality of a cancer diagnosis can be one of the most difficult experiences people will go through in their lifetime."" Other parts of the UK are also struggling. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all expect 95% of patients to be seen in 62 days. The last time any of those nations met the target was 2012. And, of course, the problems are not just confined to cancer. The latest figures show A&E performance has also dropped to its worst level. Under 85% of A&E patients were seen within four hours during February - well below the 95% target. Patricia Marquis, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""What's worrying about all the figures is that they come at a point when we haven't yet had severe weather in England, and flu and norovirus levels are low."" A spokesman for the NHS in England accepted there were challenges but said the increases in demand had been ""significant"". He said extra money was being invested in the health service in the coming years to provide more care to more people.

Burglary death victim's 999 call releasedMaureen Whale collapsed while on a 999 call about her home being burgled and died later in hospital.London,"This video can not be played Maureen Whale told the 999 call handler she was finding it hard to breathe before she went quiet as an ambulance was called A recording of a 999 call made by a 77-year-old woman who died following a burglary at her home has been released. Maureen Whale's home in Barnet, north London, was broken into on 4 December. She collapsedwhile speaking to the emergency services. A post-mortem examination gave her cause of death as coronary heart disease brought on by stress. Ms Whale'sstolen handbag was found in a hedge near her home in Bells Hill. The Metropolitan Police are trying to trace three suspects and have offered a Â£20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh said: ""Maureen died for the few pounds that were in her purse. ""It is so wrong that a woman who was so adventurous travelling the world in her younger days should die in such awful circumstances, for just a few pounds, in her own home."" Ms Whale had lived in Bells Hill all her life On the 999 call, Ms Whale can be heard telling the operator the two men had been in her house ""two minutes ago"" and had walked off with her handbag. She was shaking, finding it hard to breathe and could not talk. The operator pleaded: ""Maureen hang on in there please."" But there was no response. Ms Whale's family had lived in the house since 1928. Right to Buy owners 'sold within weeks' Heart op mum refused school absences MP ridiculed over knife GPS tweet Her niece Gina told the BBC: ""My aunt had lived in Bells Hill since she was a little girl. To her, it was home. ""The fact someone broke in to somewhere she felt secure is just tragic. ""Hearing the last phone call made by my aunt is extremely distressing but we hope that, by releasing this to the public, someone somewhere will be moved to come forward with information. ""No-one deserves to die in this way."" Police have released CCTV images of the three suspects The incident is being linked to burglaries at two more properties in the same road on the same evening and another about half a mile away in Sampson Avenue at 11:45 GMT that day.

Senate revolts against Trump over borderRepublican rebels backed a measure revoking the president's emergency declaration.US & Canada,"President Trump says the situation on the southern border constitutes a national crisis Rebel members of President Donald Trump's party have helped pass a vote to reject his declaration of an emergency on the US-Mexico border. Twelve Republican senators broke party ranks to side with Democrats, approving a proposal to revoke the proclamation by 59-41. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last month backed the measure. Following Thursday's vote, Mr Trump tweeted: ""VETO!"" Congress needs a two-thirds majority of both chambers to override a presidential veto, which is viewed as unlikely in this case. Nevertheless, the vote will be seen as an embarrassing loss for the president on his signature domestic issue. On Twitter, Mr Trump slammed the vote, calling it a ""Democrat inspired Resolution which would OPEN BORDERS while increasing Crime, Drugs and Trafficking in our Country"". Allow Twitter content?

It comes just a day after the Senate rebuked him on foreign policyby approving a bill to end US support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The Republican rebels on Thursday were Mitt Romney and Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Rob Portman of Ohio, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Thom Tillis of North Carolina changed his mind minutes before the vote and said he would oppose it. The Republican president declared the emergency on 15 February after Congress refused funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border, a key campaign pledge. He aims to circumvent Congress and build his long-promised barrier by raiding military budgets. It could free up almost $8bn (Â£6bn) for the wall, which is still considerably short of the estimated $23bn cost of a barrier along almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) of border, but far more than the nearly $1.4bn begrudgingly allotted last month by Congress. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington By any standards this is a big rebellion by Republicans in the Senate and therefore a significant embarrassment for the president. But what it's not, is a repudiation by them of his border wall policy which many of them support with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Which begs the question: what were they bothered about? In straightforward terms, the use of national emergency powers was seen as overreach by the president in two ways: First, it is a pretty blatant attempt to bypass Congress's power of the purse - its constitutional right to raise and spend money. The president had demanded billions for the wall, Congress hadn't agreed it; the government shutdown; and eventually the White House backed down. So going after the cash by this route was seen as not playing by the rules. Second, Democrats and some Republicans regard this as a power grab that could set a dangerous precedent. In the past, a constant refrain from Republicans was that former President Barack Obama regularly abused executive powers to do things he should have won congressional backing for. And many of the current batch of Republican Senators will be in situ long after President Trump has departed. They might find it harder, if they'd backed the president now, to argue that a future Democratic president couldn't use emergency powers to, say, move on gun ownership or climate change. So these rebellious Republicans get to have their cake and eat it. A marker has been laid down, but, with no chance of a veto override, the president still gets his way. Or at least for the time being. Ultimately it will be the nine justices of the Supreme Court who will decide where legitimate authority ends and overreach begins. Earlier on Thursday Mr Trump called Democrats ""border deniers"" and said any Republican opposing him would be casting ""a vote for Nancy Pelosi"". Allow Twitter content?

He says the barrier is needed to combat illegal immigration on the southern border which he has described as a ""crisis"". Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan Reaction to Trump's national emergency A major land grab by Trump Democrats say the declaration is unconstitutional, Mr Trump has manufactured the border emergency and a wall would be a boondoggle. The resolution to revoke the declaration passed the House by a margin of 245-182 in February. Thirteen Republicans sided with Democrats. Lawmakers used a provision from the National Emergencies Act to overrule the president. Most Republicans supported Mr Trump's decision and accused Democrats of ignoring an emergency at the border. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the declaration is ""the predictable and understandable consequences of Democrats' decision to put partisan obstruction ahead of the national interest"". The renegade conservatives largely condemned Mr Trump's declaration for setting up a dangerous presidential precedent while still agreeing with his border policies. ""This issue is not about strengthening our border security, a goal that I support and have voted to advance,"" Mrs Collins said ahead of the vote. ""It is a solemn occasion involving whether or not this body will stand up for its institutional prerogatives and will support the separation of powers enshrined in our constitution."" Mr Paul agreed Congress must fund border security, ""but no president should go around Congress"". He added that if the declaration stands, it could allow a future ""socialist-inclined president"" to pass environmental or gun control legislation. Mr Romney echoed a similar sentiment, calling the use of an emergency an ""overreach"" that ""is an invitation to further expansion and abuse by future presidents"".

Four Brexits and a Divorce: What do MPs want?,"Towards the end of the 1994 film Four Weddings and a Funeral, the commitment-phobic Charles (played by Hugh Grant) has a meltdown minutes before his marriage. Panicking in the vestry he can't believe that after years of guzzling salmon and champagne at other people's weddings he's still deliberating and wracked by doubt on the brink of his own. In the end a reassuring vicar helps him towards the altar. In a Red Nose Day special on BBC One on Friday we'll find out what happened to the characters 25 years on. But I'm reminded of Charles every time I talk to an anguished MP (and that's most of them) fretting about the choices in front of them. At this five minutes to midnight moment, the House of Commons is still thinking. PM to bring third Brexit deal vote to MPs Latest updates: Fallout from no-deal vote Brexitcast: Something has changed It's been clear for two years what MPs do not want. Theresa May's deal has now been rejected twice, while Labour's plan for joining a customs union has never secured a majority. Most MPs did not want to leave the EU, but apart from a minority insisting another referendum is needed to break the stalemate, they are reconciled to leaving. The question is how? And it is extraordinary that with the two-year Article 50 process about to expire, they are still kicking around alternative plans for the UK's future relationship the EU. In a farce that could be called Four Brexits and a Divorce, various cross-party groups of backbench MPs have spent months working on their own ideas for how the UK might leave the EU. For instance, in the so-called Malthouse Compromise, a group of Tory MPs has put forward a proposal that would involve the UK buying a two-year transition period from the EU, but without a formal withdrawal agreement. One of its supporters, former cabinet minster Damian Green, told me the UK and EU would use the time to negotiate a trade deal and the controversial Irish backstop would not be needed. The EU's current refusal to countenance such a plan has not deflated its supporters. Other Conservatives have joined forces with several Labour MPs to advocate UK membership of the single market and a new customs arrangement - a plan dubbed ""Common Market 2.02 or ""Norway plus"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has recently shown an interest in this idea too. Former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke believes a Brexit that keeps the UK closer to the EU economically is the option most likely to find a majority in the Commons. ""I've never seen such chaos in my whole life,"" the veteran MP says wearily. Mr Clarke thinks the sensible thing would be for Parliament to simply to revoke Article 50, the mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, but says there's no chance Parliament will do that. Former Conservative and now Independent Group MP Anna Soubry insists another referendum ""is the only way out of this mess"" - but there does not appear to be a majority in the Commons for that step yet. Meanwhile, at the other end of Parliamentary opinion, Brexit-backing Conservative MP Nigel Evans has no fear about the UK leaving the EU without any withdrawal agreement. ""It's not the ideal outcome and I would prefer a deal, but we are where we are,"" says Mr Evans. The basic choice facing MPs has always been the same: If they don't want the UK to leave without a deal in a fortnight, they must either pass a withdrawal agreement, revoke Article 50 or ask the EU for an extension. But it's pretty clear the EU will want clarity about what an extension is for. With time almost up and a UK request to extend Brexit looking likely, there is now an urgent need for MPs to prove what they can support. A series of Parliamentary votes sifting and sorting these ideas seems inevitable. But if an alternative Brexit plan does not emerge in the next few days, MPs could again face a choice between the government's deal or no deal at all.

What are MPs voting on?,"MPs will vote later on whether or not the UK should seek permission from the EU to delay Brexit beyond 29 March. Backbench MPs and opposition parties put forward eleven amendments to show what they want to do next. Speaker John Bercow has selected four amendments for debate, although not all will necessarily be put to a vote at 1700 GMT. But his decision to allow one calling for another referendum - but not one ruling another referendum out - has been questioned by some Brexiteers. Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois said it was signed by ""127 members of this House including the entirety of the DUP, 13 members of the Labour Party, and one independent to boot"" as well as more than 100 Conservative MPs - and asked Mr Bercow why it had not been selected. Mr Bercow told him ""members do have to take the rough with the smooth"" and he tried to ""always do my best to be fair to the miscellany of different points of view represented in this House"". The government motion for debate on Thursday is: (1) notes the resolutions of the House of 12 and 13 March, and accordingly agrees that the government will seek to agree with the European Union an extension of the period specified in Article 50(3); (2) agrees that, if the House has passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then the government will seek to agree with the European Union a one-off extension of the period specified in Article 50(3) for a period ending on 30 June 2019 for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation; and (3) notes that, if the House has not passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then it is highly likely that the European Council at its meeting the following day would require a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019 would require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament elections in May 2019. The campaign for another referendum has many supporters outside Parliament The cross-party amendment (h) from independent MP Sarah Wollaston, the SNP's Philippa Whitford and Joanna Cherry, Lib Dem Tom Brake and Labour's Neil Coyle calls for another referendum and would be the first to be voted on. It changes the wording of the government motion to instruct the prime minister to request an extension to the Article 50 process ""sufficient for the purposes of legislating for and conducting a public vote in which the people of the United Kingdom may give their consent for either leaving the European Union on terms to be determined by Parliament or retaining the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union."" If it is supported, the following two amendments - from Hilary Benn and the Labour frontbench - would not then go to the vote and MPs would be asked to vote on Chris Bryant's amendment next. If it is rejected, MPs would vote on the next one on this list. Labour will not be backing this amendment, saying it is not the right time to push for another public vote, reducing its chances of success. Hilary Benn's amendment opens the way to a series of Commons votes to indicate what MPs might support This cross-party amendment (i) would allow MPs to take control of the process in Parliament on Wednesday 20 March, to force a series of indicative votes to establish MPs' preferred option for Brexit. It is backed by senior backbenchers: Labour's Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, the Conservatives' Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, Lib Dem Norman Lamb and the SNP's Stewart Hosie. It calls for an extension to the Article 50 process - delaying Brexit beyond 29 March - in order to ""enable the House of Commons to find a way forward that can command majority support"". In the Commons, Mr Benn said he would support an amendment to his amendment, from the Labour MP Lucy Powell, which adds that any extension to the Brexit process should end by 30 June. In a separate move, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has said that, if Theresa May's deal is rejected for a third time by MPs next week, the government will stage two weeks of debate following the European Council on 21 and 22 March, to allow the Commons to try to find a majority for a different plan. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said it appeared the government was trying to spike the Benn amendment - which had a fairly good chance of getting through. If MPs reject it, they will be asked to vote on the Labour frontbench amendment next. If they back it, they will not vote on the Labour amendment and will go straight to a vote on the Chris Bryant amendment. Jeremy Corbyn's amendment would delay Brexit beyond 29 March to allow time for MPs to try to agree on a ""different approach"" Amendment (e), is in the name of Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn and Labour frontbenchers Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, John McDonnell, Valerie Vaz and chief whip Nick Brown. It rejects the prime minister's deal, rejects no deal, seeks an extension of the Article 50 process to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 29 March and to allow the Commons to ""provide parliamentary time"" for the Commons to ""find a majority for a different approach"". Whether this is supported or rejected, MPs will then be asked to vote on the next amendment blocking a third ""meaningful vote"" on Mrs May's withdrawal deal. MPs held their second vote on Theresa May's withdrawal deal this week - a third is due next week. The fourth amendment (j) selected by the Speaker is another cross-party affair, backed by Labour's Chris Bryant, Stephen Doughty and Alison McGovern, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts and the SNP's Philippa Whitford. It orders the government not to put Theresa May's deal to MPs again for a third time. It notes that the parliamentary rulebook, Erskine May, ""states that a motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided in the affirmative or negative during the current session may not be brought forward again during that session"".

What do MPs want?,"Towards the end of the 1994 film Four Weddings and a Funeral, the commitment-phobic Charles (played by Hugh Grant) has a meltdown minutes before his marriage. Panicking in the vestry he can't believe that after years of guzzling salmon and champagne at other people's weddings he's still deliberating and wracked by doubt on the brink of his own. In the end a reassuring vicar helps him towards the altar. In a Red Nose Day special on BBC One on Friday we'll find out what happened to the characters 25 years on. But I'm reminded of Charles every time I talk to an anguished MP (and that's most of them) fretting about the choices in front of them. At this five minutes to midnight moment, the House of Commons is still thinking. PM to bring third Brexit deal vote to MPs Latest updates: Fallout from no-deal vote Brexitcast: Something has changed It's been clear for two years what MPs do not want. Theresa May's deal has now been rejected twice, while Labour's plan for joining a customs union has never secured a majority. Most MPs did not want to leave the EU, but apart from a minority insisting another referendum is needed to break the stalemate, they are reconciled to leaving. The question is how? And it is extraordinary that with the two-year Article 50 process about to expire, they are still kicking around alternative plans for the UK's future relationship the EU. In a farce that could be called Four Brexits and a Divorce, various cross-party groups of backbench MPs have spent months working on their own ideas for how the UK might leave the EU. For instance, in the so-called Malthouse Compromise, a group of Tory MPs has put forward a proposal that would involve the UK buying a two-year transition period from the EU, but without a formal withdrawal agreement. One of its supporters, former cabinet minster Damian Green, told me the UK and EU would use the time to negotiate a trade deal and the controversial Irish backstop would not be needed. The EU's current refusal to countenance such a plan has not deflated its supporters. Other Conservatives have joined forces with several Labour MPs to advocate UK membership of the single market and a new customs arrangement - a plan dubbed ""Common Market 2.02 or ""Norway plus"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has recently shown an interest in this idea too. Former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke believes a Brexit that keeps the UK closer to the EU economically is the option most likely to find a majority in the Commons. ""I've never seen such chaos in my whole life,"" the veteran MP says wearily. Mr Clarke thinks the sensible thing would be for Parliament to simply to revoke Article 50, the mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, but says there's no chance Parliament will do that. Former Conservative and now Independent Group MP Anna Soubry insists another referendum ""is the only way out of this mess"" - but there does not appear to be a majority in the Commons for that step yet. Meanwhile, at the other end of Parliamentary opinion, Brexit-backing Conservative MP Nigel Evans has no fear about the UK leaving the EU without any withdrawal agreement. ""It's not the ideal outcome and I would prefer a deal, but we are where we are,"" says Mr Evans. The basic choice facing MPs has always been the same: If they don't want the UK to leave without a deal in a fortnight, they must either pass a withdrawal agreement, revoke Article 50 or ask the EU for an extension. But it's pretty clear the EU will want clarity about what an extension is for. With time almost up and a UK request to extend Brexit looking likely, there is now an urgent need for MPs to prove what they can support. A series of Parliamentary votes sifting and sorting these ideas seems inevitable. But if an alternative Brexit plan does not emerge in the next few days, MPs could again face a choice between the government's deal or no deal at all.

Bloody Sunday: What happened?,"Thirteen people were killed and 15 wounded on Bloody Sunday Thirteen people were shot dead and at least 15 others injured when members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in the Bogside - a predominantly Catholic part of Londonderry - on Sunday 30 January 1972. The day became known as Bloody Sunday. It is widely regarded as one of the darkest days of the Northern IrelandTroubles. About 15,000 people gathered in the Creggan area of Derry on the morning of 30 January 1972 to take part in a civil rights march. Five months earlier, in August 1971 and against a backdrop of escalating violence and increased bombings in Northern Ireland, a new law was introduced giving the authorities the power to imprison people without trial - internment. The government had decided it was the only way it could restore order. Thousands gathered in Derry on that January day for a rally organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to protest at internment. The Stormont government had banned such protests. Troops were deployed to police the march. 5 Oct 1968 - the day the Troubles began? The march began shortly after 15:00 GMT and the intended destination was the city centre. However, Army barricades blocked marchers. The majority of demonstrators were instead directed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. Many demonstrators marched towards Free Derry Corner After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00 GMT, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. Two men were shot and wounded. At 16:07 GMT, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10 GMT, soldiers began to open fire. According to Army evidence, 21 soldiers fired their weapons, discharging 108 live rounds between them. The shootings led to widespread anger in Derry and further afield. The British Embassy in Dublin was burned to the ground by an angry crowd. The day after Bloody Sunday the government announced there would be an inquiry led by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery. The victims, top row (l to r): Patrick Doherty, Gerald Donaghey, John Duddy, Hugh Gilmour, Michael Kelly, Michael McDaid and Kevin McElhinney. Bottom row : Bernard McGuigan, Gerard McKinney, William McKinney, William Nash, James Wray and John Young The Widgery Tribunal largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame, although he described the soldiers' shooting as ""bordering on the reckless"". It was derided as a whitewash by the victims' families, who spent years campaigning for a fresh public inquiry. Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that a new inquiry would be held, headed by judge Lord Saville. It was set up in 1998 and reported back in 2010, becoming the longest-running inquiry in British legal history and costing about Â£200m. The inquiry found that none of the casualties were posing a threat or doing anything that would justify their shooting. It said no warning was given to any civilians before the soldiers opened fire and that none of the soldiers fired in response to attacks by petrol bombers or stone throwers. Saville found there was ""some firing by republican paramilitaries"" but that on balance the Army fired first. Prime Minister David Cameron said the killings were ""unjustified and unjustifiable"". Derry's Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation after the Saville report was released. It took a number of years to complete and detectives thensubmitted their files to the Public Prosecution Servicetowards the end of 2016. Having weighed up 125,000 pages of material, prosecutors said on 14 March that they will prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. He had also faced charges for the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). In a statement, the PPS said after ""careful consideration"" the decision had been taken due to another recent court ruling which found evidence being relied upon in the prosecutionof Soldier A and Soldier C for the killing of Joe McCannwas inadmissible. This was due to the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by the brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims.

The victims,"Top row, left to right: Patrick ""Paddy"" Doherty, Gerald Donaghey, John ""Jackie"" Duddy, Hugh Gilmour, Michael Kelly, Michael McDaid, Kevin McElhinney. Bottom row, left to right: Bernard McGuigan, Gerard McKinney, William McKinney, William Nash, James Wray, John Young Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on marchers during a civil rights march in Londonderry on 30 January 1972. It became known as Bloody Sunday and these are the victims: Married father-of-six Patrick Doherty, known as Paddy, was 31 years old when he joined the march. He worked in the city's Du Pont factory and was an active member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. Mr Doherty died as he was trying to crawl to safety. In the Saville Report - a re-examination of the events of Bloody Sunday carried out by Lord Mark Saville and published in 2010 - said Mr Doherty was unarmed. The inquiry also found there was ""no doubt"" he was shot by Soldier F, who changed his story over the years. The Widgery Inquiry - announced the day after Bloody Sunday and chaired by Lord Widgery - largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame, although he described the soldiers' shooting as ""bordering on the reckless"". That earlier inquiry said that if the soldier had shot Mr Doherty in the belief he had a pistol, that belief was ""mistaken"". The 17year-old was a member of the IRA's youth wing, Fianna na Ãireann. He had become involved in the civil unrest and had been jailed for six months for rioting the year before. A police photograph taken shortly after he was pronounced dead showed a nailbomb in Mr Donaghey's pocket. A soldier later said he had found four nailbombs among Mr Donaghey's clothing. Widgery dismissed claims that the devices had been planted after death - saying nobody had offered any evidence to the contrary. But the Saville Inquiry heard that neither the soldier who first examined Mr Donaghey nor the Army medical officer who received him at an aid post had found anything suspicious when they checked the teenager. In conclusion, Saville found the nailbombs were ""probably"" on Mr Donaghey but said he was not preparing to throw them at the time nor was he shot because he was carrying them. The report said he was shot by Soldier G while trying to escape from the soldiers. One of a family of 15, the factory worker is thought to have been the first to be killed. The 17-year-old boxer, known a Jackie, had represented his club in bouts across Ireland and in Liverpool. He had attended the march ""for the craic"" with his friends and against his father's advice. The picture above shows a group of people carrying the dying teenager though the streets of Derry, lead by the then Fr (later Bishop) Edward Daly waving a bloodied handkerchief. It became one of the enduring images of Northern Ireland's Troubles. The Saville report concluded Mr Duddy was unarmed and ""probably"" shot by Soldier R, as he ran away from soldiers. Widgery said he had not been armed and was probably hit by a bullet intended for someone else. The 17-year-old was the youngest of eight children and a trainee tyre fitter. He was shot as he was running away from the soldiers in a crowd of up to 50 people. A woman said she heard him cry ""I'm hit, I'm hit"". A single bullet had struck him in the chest and arm. The teenager was pulled to safety behind a barricade but died shortly afterwards. Saville said Mr Gilmour was unarmed and Soldier U had fired at him as he ran away from the soldiers. Widgery concluded Mr Gilmour was not shot from behind and had probably been standing on a barricade when he was hit. The 17-year-old had been training to be a sewing machine mechanic and the march was his first taste of the civil rights movement. He went, his family said, because his friends were going. He was shot in the stomach near a barricade. He was carried to the safety of a house and died in an ambulance on the way to hospital. At Saville, Soldier F admitted that he had shot Michael Kelly - but said that he had only fired at people with bombs or weapons. However, Saville concluded Mr Kelly was unarmed. Widgery said forensic tests found firearms residue on Mr Kelly's right cuff and that indicated he was close to someone who was firing at the soldiers from the barricade. ""But I do not think that this was Kelly, nor am I satisfied that he was throwing a bomb at the time when he was shot,"" said Widgery. The second-youngest of a family of 12, the 20-year-old worked as a barman. Mr McDaid was arrested but then escaped out of the back of an Army vehicle before being shot near a barricade. Saville concluded that Mr McDaid was unarmed and he was shot by either Soldier P, Soldier J or Soldier E. Widgery could not identify who had fired the shot. Forensic tests found lead particles on Mr McDaid's jacket and right hand, and Widgery discounted the possibility that the clothing and body had been contaminated by residue from soldiers or their vehicles. The 17-year-old was the middle child of five and was described as a hardworking supermarket employee. He was shot as he tried to make his way to safety. Saville said Soldier L or Soldier M shot Mr McElhinney, who was ""unarmed"", as he crawled away from the soldiers. It suggests they probably did so on the orders of senior officers. Widgery said the firer was probably ""Sergeant K"". ""He described two men crawling from the barricade in the direction of the door of the flats and said that the rear man was carrying a rifle. He fired one aimed shot but could not say whether it hit. ""Sergeant K obviously acted with responsibility and restraint."" A 41-year-old married man with six children, Bernard McGuigan was a factory worker and handyman. Shot as he went to the aid of Patrick Doherty, Mr McGuigan was waving a white handkerchief as a single bullet struck the back of his head. He fell to the ground, beside a 19-year-old paramedic. ""He raised his hand in the air and shouted 'Don't shoot, don't shoot'. And seconds later he was just shot and landed in my lap."" Saville found there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot an unarmed Mr McGuigan. Widgery said forensic tests had found lead residue on his hands and a scarf, consistent with the cloth having been wrapped around a revolver that had been fired. His widow denied the scarf belonged to her husband, and Widgery concluded it was not possible to say whether Mr McGuigan was using or carrying a weapon. A father-of-eight whose youngest was born eight days after his death on Bloody Sunday and named after him. Mr McKinney managed a junior soccer team and ran the city's Ritz rollerskating rink. The 35-year-old was shot as he tried to make his way to safety. The Saville Report concluded Soldier G, a private, shot an ""unarmed"" Gerard McKinney. That bullet passed through him before hitting another victim, Gerald Donaghey. Widgery said his death was one of the most confusing episodes of the day and that forensic tests found no evidence that Mr McKinney had handled weapons. A printer at the Derry Journal newspaper, the 27-year-old was the oldest of 10 and was engaged to be married. A keen amateur photographer, he had set out to film the Bloody Sunday march on a camera he had received as a Christmas present. Like Gerald McKinney (no relation), he was in a group and was shot as he ran for cover. ""Willie was not a stone-thrower, a bomber or a gunman. He had gone to the civil rights march in the role of amateur photographer,"" said the newspaper's tribute to him. Saville said there were four soldiers -  E, F, G or H -  who could have fired at Mr McKinney and another victim, Jim Wray. Up to five more people were injured by the same group of soldiers. All four soldiers insisted they had shot at people carrying bombs or firearms - claims rejected by Saville. The Widgery report put William McKinney's death in the same category as Gerald McKinney - both men had been shot without justification. In March 2019, the Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. On 2 July 2021,it was announcedthe prosecution of Soldier F would not continue. Reviews of the cases were prompted by the collapse of the trial in Belfast of two other veterans for Troubles-era offences. The PPS said that given ""related evidential features"", it concluded ""there was no longer a reasonable prospect of key evidence in proceedings against Soldier F... being ruled admissible"". The 19-year-old dock worker was the seventh of 13 children and the brother of Olympic boxer Charlie Nash. Mr Nash was shot in the chest near a barricade. Alexander Nash saw his son being shot and went to help him, and was then shot himself. Saville concluded that shots fired by Soldier P, Soldier J and Soldier E, caused the deaths of William Nash, as well as victims Michael McDaid and John Young. The inquiry rejected claims that the three soldiers fired because the men were armed. Soldier P told Widgery that he had returned fire after a man consistent with Mr Nash's description had fired first. ""In view of the site of the injury it is possible that Soldier P has given an accurate account of the death of Nash,"" said the report. The 22-year-old had worked in England for some time and was engaged to an English girl. Friends said he was outgoing and worked in a city bar and dancehall at weekends. His entire family had attended the march after going to Mass together. Mr Wray's death, like that of Gerald McKinney and William McKinney, happened during the chaos as people ran for cover. Saville said Mr Wray, who posed no great danger, was shot twice in the back and there were four soldiers who could have fired at him  - soldiers E, F, G or H. The second shot was probably fired as he lay wounded, said Saville, meaning there could have been ""no possible justification"". Widgery said there was no photographic evidence of what had happened to Mr Wray, but he had been in the general vicinity of where soldiers claimed that civilians had opened fired. On 2 July 2021,it was announcedthe prosecution of Soldier F for the murder of James Wray and William McKinney would not continue. The 17-year-old was the youngest of six and worked in a menswear shop. He was shot near a barricade as he tried to take cover. Saville concluded John Young was killed in the same shooting incident that claimed the lives of William Nash and Michael McDaid. He also said he was unarmed and shot by soldiers P, J or E. One witness told Widgery that Mr Young had gone to help another teenager who had been shot. Widgery said: ""Young was undoubtedly associated with the youths who were throwing missiles at the soldiers from the barricade and the track of the bullet suggests that he was facing the soldiers at the time.""

"Bloody Sunday murder charges for soldierThe sole prosecution is seen as a ""terrible disappointment"" by some of the families of the 13 people killed.","James Wray and William McKinney were among 13 people shot dead at a civil rights march A former British soldier faces murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. The sole prosecution is seen as a ""terrible disappointment"" by some of the families of the 13 people killed. They were shot dead at a civil rights march on 30 January 1972. The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Bloody Sunday decision reaction What next after Bloody Sunday charges?

This video can not be played What was Bloody Sunday? On the same day as the funerals were held for 11 of the Bloody Sunday victims, the British Embassy in Dublin was burned to the ground by an angry crowd. Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. BBC News NI's Home Affairs Correspondent Julian O'Neill said it could be a ""period of months"" before Soldier F makes his first court appearance. The former paratrooper is being referred to only as Soldier F because all military witnesses were granted anonymity through the Saville Inquiry into the circumstances around the killings. The PPS said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute 16 other soldiers and two Official IRA men. James Wray's brother Liam said he was ""very saddened for the other families"" of those killed on Bloody Sunday. ""Their hearts must be broken,"" he said. ""It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved."" He added: ""There are a lot of sad and heartbroken people today."" A number of relatives of those killed walked to Derry city centre ahead of the PPS decision. William McKinney's brother Michael said it was ""disappointing"" for families who had not received news of prosecutions. Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: ""It has been a long road for the families... and today will be another extremely difficult day for many of them.

This video can not be played One soldier will be prosecuted over Bloody Sunday, the PPS said Soldier F gave evidence anonymously to the Saville Inquiry in 2003 and admitted firing 13 rounds on Bloody Sunday. His assertion that there were ""gunmen and bombers killed"" was rejected in Lord Saville's report. The Saville Inquiry stated that there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot father-of-six Paddy Doherty, who was unarmed. Saville also found there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot an unarmed Bernard McGuigan on Bloody Sunday as he went to the aid of Patrick Doherty, waving a white handkerchief. At the Saville Inquiry, Soldier F admitted he had shot 17-year-old Michael Kelly - but he said that he had only fired at people with bombs or weapons. However, Saville concluded Mr Kelly was unarmed. The Saville Inquiry found that both William McKinney and James Wray could have been shot by Soldier F and three other soldiers. The inquiry report also stated Soldier F had changed his story over the years. Bloody Sunday gained notoriety around the world, partly due to the image of a Catholic priest waving a bloodstained handkerchief as he tried to help a victim Mr Herron said the decisions to prosecute announced on Thursday ""relate only to allegations of criminal conduct on Bloody Sunday itself"". ""Consideration will now be given to allegations of perjury in respect of those suspects reported by police,"" he said. by Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent Bloody Sunday might have happened 47 years ago, but it has cast a very long shadow, extending far beyond victims' families and those involved. It fuelled the Troubles and, two decades after they ended, it will once again throw a searchlight on how Northern Ireland deals with its past. Legacy issues, as they are termed, can poison the present day and they have been allowed to fester. Bloody Sunday has fed into the ongoing debate, with the government considering legislation as part of its next steps. Will that involve a de facto amnesty from prosecutions in future, and whom might that cover? This is the bigger picture against the backdrop of the Bloody Sunday decisions, significant as they are in their own right. The intention to charge a former soldier has clawed at emotions not just in Derry, but among bereaved families and victims in thousands of other Troubles cases left pondering truth and justice. The case could come before a court for a preliminary hearing quite quickly, says the legal expert, Joshua Rozenberg. He expects Soldier F to be brought before a court in Northern Ireland and to be named. UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government would offer full legal support to Soldier F - including paying his legal costs and providing welfare support. ""We are indebted to those soldiers who served with courage and distinction to bring peace to Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The welfare of our former service personnel is of the utmost importance."" He said the the Ministry of Defence is working ""to drive through a new package of safeguards to ensure our armed forces are not unfairly treated."" ""And the Government will urgently reform the system for dealing with legacy issues,"" he said. ""Our serving and former personnel cannot live in constant fear of prosecution."" Following Mr Williamson's statement, lawyers acting on behalf of the family of William Nash said they had contacted the Northern Ireland attorney general accusing the defence secretary of contempt of court. A public inquiry conducted by a senior judge in 1972 was branded a whitewash by victims' families. This video can not be played Liam Wray expressed relief that a soldier was to be prosecuted for his brother's murder After decades of campaigning, a fresh inquiry was eventually ordered by then prime minister Tony Blair in 1998. Lord Saville's 5,000-page report stated none of the casualties was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury and that soldiers had lost their self-control. The prime minister at the time of the report's publication, David Cameron, apologised for the soldiers' conduct, saying the killings were unjustified and unjustifiable, A police investigation into Bloody Sunday followed Lord Saville's 12-year, Â£200m public inquiry. A file was sent to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in November 2016. In total, police reported 20 suspects to the PPS - 18 of them former soldiers, one of whom died last year. Papers before prosecutors included 668 witness statements and numerous photos, video and audio evidence. The march began shortly after 15:00 GMT on 30 January 1972, and the intended destination was the city centre. However, Army barricades blocked marchers. The majority of demonstrators were instead directed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. Graffitti appeared on Free Derry Corner after the announcement on Thursday After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. Two people were shot and wounded. At 16:07, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10, soldiers began to open fire.

DUP in government talks over Brexit deal,"Arlene Foster and Leo Varadkar attended the same event in Washington DC on Wednesday A vote by MPs to ask for a Brexit delay has been welcomed by Leo Varadkar. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) said the vote ""reduces the likelihood of a cliff edge, no-deal Brexit"". Theresa May said Brexit could be delayed by three months, to 30 June, if MPs back her withdrawal deal in a third vote, but could be delayed for longer if they reject her deal again. Mr Varadkar urged the UK government to make clear the purpose of an extension ""and how long it would last"". Brexit: Direct rule for Northern Ireland 'real possibility' Brexit: Does NI tariffs plan violate WTO law? UK MPs vote to seek delay to Brexit Brexit: What happens now? The vote in the Commons on Thursday night, means the UK may not now leave on 29 March as previously planned. Any delay has to be agreed by the other 27 EU member states. On the EU agreeing a potential delay, Mr Varadkar said: ""We need to be open to any request they [the UK] make, listen attentively and be generous in our response."" The taoiseach said a potential further delay would be discussed at a European Council meeting later in March. Mr Varadkar's remarks follow comments by Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney, who said a Brexit extension of 21 months is possible. Earlier on Thursday DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was possible a deal on Brexit could still be reached in the coming weeks. The European Commission has warned there will be no further negotiations or clarifications on the Brexit deal The ""final part of a negotiation"" is when it matters most, the DUP leader said, as it is ""when you start to see the whites in people's eyes"". Her party is in discussions with the government, amid reports it could back the PM's Brexit deal. This follows MPs' rejection of the idea of leaving the EU with no deal. Mrs Foster, who is attending St Patrick's Day events in Washington DC this week, said DUP representatives were speaking to the government and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox about changes to the deal. ""Nobody wants to leave without a deal and we want to make sure we get there,"" she told BBC News NI. The government's deal was rejected for a second time on Tuesday in Parliament. The DUP leader said her party wanted the UK to leave the EU with a deal, but that her party had certain tests it must meet before they will back it. Allow Twitter content?

How did my MP vote on no-deal?,"In a dramatic night in the Commons MPs have voted twice to reject ano-deal Brexit. The first vote, called for by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, passed by a small margin. It amended the government's motion ruling out a no-deal Brexit on the 29 March, and instead sought to rule out a no-deal Brexit at any time. The second vote on the amended motion was then passed by 321 votes to 278. To find out how your MP voted use the look-up below.

Brexit amendments: What might MPs vote on?,"MPs will vote later on whether or not the UK should seek permission from the EU to delay Brexit beyond 29 March. Backbench MPs and opposition parties put forward eleven amendments to show what they want to do next. Speaker John Bercow has selected four amendments for debate, although not all will necessarily be put to a vote at 1700 GMT. But his decision to allow one calling for another referendum - but not one ruling another referendum out - has been questioned by some Brexiteers. Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois said it was signed by ""127 members of this House including the entirety of the DUP, 13 members of the Labour Party, and one independent to boot"" as well as more than 100 Conservative MPs - and asked Mr Bercow why it had not been selected. Mr Bercow told him ""members do have to take the rough with the smooth"" and he tried to ""always do my best to be fair to the miscellany of different points of view represented in this House"". The government motion for debate on Thursday is: (1) notes the resolutions of the House of 12 and 13 March, and accordingly agrees that the government will seek to agree with the European Union an extension of the period specified in Article 50(3); (2) agrees that, if the House has passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then the government will seek to agree with the European Union a one-off extension of the period specified in Article 50(3) for a period ending on 30 June 2019 for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation; and (3) notes that, if the House has not passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then it is highly likely that the European Council at its meeting the following day would require a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019 would require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament elections in May 2019. The campaign for another referendum has many supporters outside Parliament The cross-party amendment (h) from independent MP Sarah Wollaston, the SNP's Philippa Whitford and Joanna Cherry, Lib Dem Tom Brake and Labour's Neil Coyle calls for another referendum and would be the first to be voted on. It changes the wording of the government motion to instruct the prime minister to request an extension to the Article 50 process ""sufficient for the purposes of legislating for and conducting a public vote in which the people of the United Kingdom may give their consent for either leaving the European Union on terms to be determined by Parliament or retaining the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union."" If it is supported, the following two amendments - from Hilary Benn and the Labour frontbench - would not then go to the vote and MPs would be asked to vote on Chris Bryant's amendment next. If it is rejected, MPs would vote on the next one on this list. Labour will not be backing this amendment, saying it is not the right time to push for another public vote, reducing its chances of success. Hilary Benn's amendment opens the way to a series of Commons votes to indicate what MPs might support This cross-party amendment (i) would allow MPs to take control of the process in Parliament on Wednesday 20 March, to force a series of indicative votes to establish MPs' preferred option for Brexit. It is backed by senior backbenchers: Labour's Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, the Conservatives' Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, Lib Dem Norman Lamb and the SNP's Stewart Hosie. It calls for an extension to the Article 50 process - delaying Brexit beyond 29 March - in order to ""enable the House of Commons to find a way forward that can command majority support"". In the Commons, Mr Benn said he would support an amendment to his amendment, from the Labour MP Lucy Powell, which adds that any extension to the Brexit process should end by 30 June. In a separate move, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has said that, if Theresa May's deal is rejected for a third time by MPs next week, the government will stage two weeks of debate following the European Council on 21 and 22 March, to allow the Commons to try to find a majority for a different plan. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said it appeared the government was trying to spike the Benn amendment - which had a fairly good chance of getting through. If MPs reject it, they will be asked to vote on the Labour frontbench amendment next. If they back it, they will not vote on the Labour amendment and will go straight to a vote on the Chris Bryant amendment. Jeremy Corbyn's amendment would delay Brexit beyond 29 March to allow time for MPs to try to agree on a ""different approach"" Amendment (e), is in the name of Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn and Labour frontbenchers Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, John McDonnell, Valerie Vaz and chief whip Nick Brown. It rejects the prime minister's deal, rejects no deal, seeks an extension of the Article 50 process to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 29 March and to allow the Commons to ""provide parliamentary time"" for the Commons to ""find a majority for a different approach"". Whether this is supported or rejected, MPs will then be asked to vote on the next amendment blocking a third ""meaningful vote"" on Mrs May's withdrawal deal. MPs held their second vote on Theresa May's withdrawal deal this week - a third is due next week. The fourth amendment (j) selected by the Speaker is another cross-party affair, backed by Labour's Chris Bryant, Stephen Doughty and Alison McGovern, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts and the SNP's Philippa Whitford. It orders the government not to put Theresa May's deal to MPs again for a third time. It notes that the parliamentary rulebook, Erskine May, ""states that a motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided in the affirmative or negative during the current session may not be brought forward again during that session"".

Crash plane's black boxes sent to Paris,"All Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 aircraft will remain grounded at least until May after the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said. The aircraft will not fly until a software update can be tested and installed, the US regulator said. Sunday's crash, shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa, killed 157 people from 35 nations. It was the second crash involving a 737 Max in six months. Some people have pointed to similarities between the incidents, with some experts citing satellite data and evidence from the crash scene as showing links between Sunday's disaster and October's crash in Indonesia of the Lion Air jet that killed 189 people. US Representative Rick Larsen said the software upgrade would take a few weeks to complete, and installing it on all the aircraft would take ""at least through April"". The FAA said on Wednesday that a software fix for the 737 Max that Boeing had been working on since the Lion Air crash would take months to complete. Meanwhile, investigators in France have taken charge of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines aircraft's black boxes as they attempt to uncover what caused the Boeing 737 Max disaster. The Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) received the flight data and cockpit voice recorders on Thursday. The first readings could take days, but a lot depends on the boxes' condition. Regulators across the world continue to ground the Boeing aircraft. On Thursday, Russia, Japan and Tunisia banned the jet from their airspace. Late on Wednesday, the FAA told the country's airlines to ground their fleets, but was criticised for not doing it sooner. Boeing grounded: What it means for air travel Ethiopian Airlines probe: What do we know? Boeing grounds entire crash aircraft fleet Ethiopian Airlines crash: Six charts on what we know Possible similarities between the accidents, focussing on the aircraft's anti-stall system, have shocked the aviation industry and raised questions over Boeing's, and the FAA's, insistence earlier this week the the Max 737 was safe to fly. In addition to Max aircraft in service, about another 5,000 are on order from airlines. Garuda Indonesia said there was a possibility it would cancel its 20-strong order for Max jets, depending on what the FAA does. This video can not be played Trump: Boeing 737 Max planes grounded A BEA spokesman said he did not know what condition the black boxes were in. ""First we will try to read the data,"" the spokesman said, adding that the first analyses could take between half a day and several days. There have been reports, including by Reuters, that there was a tussle over which safety authority would take the lead in examining the black boxes. Reports said Germany was initially asked to conduct the analysis because Ethiopian Airlines had been unhappy at the way the Paris-based organisation had investigated a crash in Lebanon in 2010. Britain and the US both have highly-respected crash investigation agencies. How long the analysis by the BEA will take depends on a number of things. First, the state of the recorders themselves. They are contained in very robust housings designed to withstand tremendous forces, and they are placed in the rear of the aircraft where they may be sheltered from the worst effects of an impact. Nevertheless, they can still be damaged, particularly by intense fire. The investigators will need to extract the memory modules, basically circuit boards covered with memory chips, and carry out any necessary repairs. The modules are designed so that information is spread across a series of chips. If one part is damaged, there should still be useable information elsewhere. Once downloaded, the data also has to be read. Surprisingly, it is not recorded in a standard form - so investigators will need to know how to make it useable. That will need input from the airline itself. If all goes well, the investigators will have access to thousands of pieces of data about the aircraft - not only what was going on on the fatal flight itself, but also on previous journeys. They will also be able to hear what was going on in the cockpit, what the pilots said to one another, and if any audible warnings were sounding. All of that should go a long way towards establishing the immediate causes of the accident - and finding out whether there really were common factors with the Lion Air crash.

Liberal Democrats investigate former leader,"Lord Steel gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in Manchester on Wednesday The Liberal Democrats have suspended former leader David Steel over remarks he made to a child abuse inquiry about the late MP Cyril Smith. Lord Steel said he asked Smith in 1979 about claims he abused boys at a Rochdale hostel in the 1960s. He said he came away from the conversation ""assuming"" that Smith had committed the offences but claimed it was ""nothing to do with me"". A Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesman said an investigation would take place. The spokesman said: ""Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on 13th March 2019 the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed. ""The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation. That work will now commence. ""It is important that everyone in the party, and in wider society, understands the importance of vigilance and safeguarding to protect people from abuse, and that everyone has confidence in the seriousness with which we take it. ""We appreciate the difficult work that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is doing on behalf of the victims and survivors of abuse, and the country as a whole."" Leader 'assumed' Cyril Smith was an abuser The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard that no formal inquiry was held by the party into the claims against Smith, which were investigated by the police in 1969 but no prosecution was brought. Smith served as a Labour councillor in Rochdale in the 1960s before becoming the Liberal and then Liberal Democrat MP for the town between 1972 and 1992. Allegations that he abused a number of boys found a wider public spotlight after he died in 2010. Lord Steel, 80, told the inquiry he discussed the allegations with Smith in 1979, after an article appeared in Private Eye. He said Smith had told him ""it was correct, the matter had been investigated by police, no further action was taken and that was the end of the story"". Cyril Smith (left) and David Steel (right) discussed the allegations in 1979 Lord Steel said he had ""assumed"" that Smith had committed the offences, but said he took no further action because: ""It was before he was an MP, before he was even a member of my party. It had nothing to do with me."" Lord Steel also described recommending Smith for a knighthood in 1988 and said he did not pass on any allegations about the sexual abuse of children because ""I was not aware of any such allegations other than the matter referred toâ¦which appeared to have been fully investigated"". And he said it had not occurred to him that children could still have been at risk from Smith. In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, Lord Steel said: ""I would like to clarify what happened in 1979 when I asked Cyril Smith about the report in Private Eye. ""As I told the inquiry yesterday I did not have that report with me when I tackled him, nor did we discuss the details in it. ""He admitted to me that the report was correct in that he had been investigated by the police at the time and no action taken against him. ""I had already told the inquiry in writing that in my opinion he had been abusing his position in Rochdale Council [that is to gain access to council-run children's homes], but that had been properly a matter for the police and the council, and not for me as he was neither an MP nor even a member of the Liberal Party at the time. ""I was in no position to re-open the investigation."" The statement continued: ""I am reinforced in my view by reading the previous report of the inquiry sent to me today, which says inter alia 'the Crown Prosecution Service found that the advice which had previously been given could not be faulted (given the law and guidance in place at the time)' and that the honours scrutiny committee had seriously considered his nomination for a knighthood and sent a 'warning of risk' letter to Margaret Thatcher as PM, and that 'clearly she took a similar view' as he was granted the knighthood. ""It is unfortunate that some sections of the media have chosen to extract certain passages of evidence and present them without the full context. ""The inquiry has a serious and sensitive job to undertake and spinning evidence to generate sensationalist headlines only serves to distract from panel's search of the truth."" Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon who is acting on behalf of seven victims in the abuse inquiry, said Lord Steel's admission that he assumed Smith had committed offences would ""cause victims great anger"". He added: ""Steel's inaction was an appalling dereliction of duty and I hope the inquiry will condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Lord Steel became the Liberal MP for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles in 1965, and became the party's leader in 1976 after the resignation of Jeremy Thorpe, who later stood trial on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder.

Three found guilty of boy's stab murder,"Tavis Spencer-Aitkens died in hospital after being stabbed 15 times Two men and a teenager have been found guilty of murdering a 17-year-old boy. Tavis Spencer-Aitkens was stabbed 15 times and hit over the head with a glass bottle on 2 June in Ipswich. Aristote Yenge and Adebayo Amusa were convicted at Ipswich Crown Court with Kyreis Davies, 17, who can be named after the judge lifted a court order. Callum Plaats was found not guilty of murder, but convicted of manslaughter. Leon Glasgow was acquitted of both murder and manslaughter. The jury is still considering its verdict on Isaac Calver, who denies murder, and has been sent home for the night. Aristote Yenge (left) and Kyreis Davies were found guilty of murder Yenge, 23, and Davies had refused to attend court so were absent when the verdicts were returned. In the packed public gallery, Tavis's mum cried when they were found guilty. She walked out when the verdict on Plaats, 23, came back and there were gasps when Mr Glasgow was cleared. The reporting restriction on naming Davies was lifted following an application by the BBC. (L-R) Aristote Yenge, Adebayo Amusa, Callum Plaats, Isaac Calver, Leon Glasgow and Kyreis Davies - whose identity could not be revealed during the trial - denied murdering Tavis Flowers and messages of condolence were left at a shrine where Tavis was stabbed 15 times During the three-month trial, the jury heard Tavis was killed in revenge for trouble that flared between two rival gangs. The court heard Tavis was friends with a group which called themselves Neno or The Three - after the IP3 postcode of Ipswich. His attackers were from a gang known as J-Block. Tavis was attacked in the Nacton estate area of Ipswich The court had heard how 20-year-old Amusa's DNA was found on the neck of the unopened bottle of alcohol used in the attack. Yenge, of no fixed abode, Amusa, of Barking in east London, Davies, from Colchester, and Plaats, of Ipswich, will be sentenced at a later date.

Trump facing Senate revolt in border vote,"President Trump says the situation on the southern border constitutes a national crisis Rebel members of President Donald Trump's party have helped pass a vote to reject his declaration of an emergency on the US-Mexico border. Twelve Republican senators broke party ranks to side with Democrats, approving a proposal to revoke the proclamation by 59-41. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last month backed the measure. Following Thursday's vote, Mr Trump tweeted: ""VETO!"" Congress needs a two-thirds majority of both chambers to override a presidential veto, which is viewed as unlikely in this case. Nevertheless, the vote will be seen as an embarrassing loss for the president on his signature domestic issue. On Twitter, Mr Trump slammed the vote, calling it a ""Democrat inspired Resolution which would OPEN BORDERS while increasing Crime, Drugs and Trafficking in our Country"". Allow Twitter content?

It comes just a day after the Senate rebuked him on foreign policyby approving a bill to end US support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The Republican rebels on Thursday were Mitt Romney and Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Rob Portman of Ohio, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Roger Wicker of Mississippi. Thom Tillis of North Carolina changed his mind minutes before the vote and said he would oppose it. The Republican president declared the emergency on 15 February after Congress refused funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border, a key campaign pledge. He aims to circumvent Congress and build his long-promised barrier by raiding military budgets. It could free up almost $8bn (Â£6bn) for the wall, which is still considerably short of the estimated $23bn cost of a barrier along almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) of border, but far more than the nearly $1.4bn begrudgingly allotted last month by Congress. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington By any standards this is a big rebellion by Republicans in the Senate and therefore a significant embarrassment for the president. But what it's not, is a repudiation by them of his border wall policy which many of them support with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Which begs the question: what were they bothered about? In straightforward terms, the use of national emergency powers was seen as overreach by the president in two ways: First, it is a pretty blatant attempt to bypass Congress's power of the purse - its constitutional right to raise and spend money. The president had demanded billions for the wall, Congress hadn't agreed it; the government shutdown; and eventually the White House backed down. So going after the cash by this route was seen as not playing by the rules. Second, Democrats and some Republicans regard this as a power grab that could set a dangerous precedent. In the past, a constant refrain from Republicans was that former President Barack Obama regularly abused executive powers to do things he should have won congressional backing for. And many of the current batch of Republican Senators will be in situ long after President Trump has departed. They might find it harder, if they'd backed the president now, to argue that a future Democratic president couldn't use emergency powers to, say, move on gun ownership or climate change. So these rebellious Republicans get to have their cake and eat it. A marker has been laid down, but, with no chance of a veto override, the president still gets his way. Or at least for the time being. Ultimately it will be the nine justices of the Supreme Court who will decide where legitimate authority ends and overreach begins. Earlier on Thursday Mr Trump called Democrats ""border deniers"" and said any Republican opposing him would be casting ""a vote for Nancy Pelosi"". Allow Twitter content?

He says the barrier is needed to combat illegal immigration on the southern border which he has described as a ""crisis"". Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan Reaction to Trump's national emergency A major land grab by Trump Democrats say the declaration is unconstitutional, Mr Trump has manufactured the border emergency and a wall would be a boondoggle. The resolution to revoke the declaration passed the House by a margin of 245-182 in February. Thirteen Republicans sided with Democrats. Lawmakers used a provision from the National Emergencies Act to overrule the president. Most Republicans supported Mr Trump's decision and accused Democrats of ignoring an emergency at the border. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the declaration is ""the predictable and understandable consequences of Democrats' decision to put partisan obstruction ahead of the national interest"". The renegade conservatives largely condemned Mr Trump's declaration for setting up a dangerous presidential precedent while still agreeing with his border policies. ""This issue is not about strengthening our border security, a goal that I support and have voted to advance,"" Mrs Collins said ahead of the vote. ""It is a solemn occasion involving whether or not this body will stand up for its institutional prerogatives and will support the separation of powers enshrined in our constitution."" Mr Paul agreed Congress must fund border security, ""but no president should go around Congress"". He added that if the declaration stands, it could allow a future ""socialist-inclined president"" to pass environmental or gun control legislation. Mr Romney echoed a similar sentiment, calling the use of an emergency an ""overreach"" that ""is an invitation to further expansion and abuse by future presidents"".

What will MPs vote on?,"MPs will vote later on whether or not the UK should seek permission from the EU to delay Brexit beyond 29 March. Backbench MPs and opposition parties put forward eleven amendments to show what they want to do next. Speaker John Bercow has selected four amendments for debate, although not all will necessarily be put to a vote at 1700 GMT. But his decision to allow one calling for another referendum - but not one ruling another referendum out - has been questioned by some Brexiteers. Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois said it was signed by ""127 members of this House including the entirety of the DUP, 13 members of the Labour Party, and one independent to boot"" as well as more than 100 Conservative MPs - and asked Mr Bercow why it had not been selected. Mr Bercow told him ""members do have to take the rough with the smooth"" and he tried to ""always do my best to be fair to the miscellany of different points of view represented in this House"". The government motion for debate on Thursday is: (1) notes the resolutions of the House of 12 and 13 March, and accordingly agrees that the government will seek to agree with the European Union an extension of the period specified in Article 50(3); (2) agrees that, if the House has passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then the government will seek to agree with the European Union a one-off extension of the period specified in Article 50(3) for a period ending on 30 June 2019 for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation; and (3) notes that, if the House has not passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then it is highly likely that the European Council at its meeting the following day would require a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019 would require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament elections in May 2019. The campaign for another referendum has many supporters outside Parliament The cross-party amendment (h) from independent MP Sarah Wollaston, the SNP's Philippa Whitford and Joanna Cherry, Lib Dem Tom Brake and Labour's Neil Coyle calls for another referendum and would be the first to be voted on. It changes the wording of the government motion to instruct the prime minister to request an extension to the Article 50 process ""sufficient for the purposes of legislating for and conducting a public vote in which the people of the United Kingdom may give their consent for either leaving the European Union on terms to be determined by Parliament or retaining the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union."" If it is supported, the following two amendments - from Hilary Benn and the Labour frontbench - would not then go to the vote and MPs would be asked to vote on Chris Bryant's amendment next. If it is rejected, MPs would vote on the next one on this list. Labour will not be backing this amendment, saying it is not the right time to push for another public vote, reducing its chances of success. Hilary Benn's amendment opens the way to a series of Commons votes to indicate what MPs might support This cross-party amendment (i) would allow MPs to take control of the process in Parliament on Wednesday 20 March, to force a series of indicative votes to establish MPs' preferred option for Brexit. It is backed by senior backbenchers: Labour's Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, the Conservatives' Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, Lib Dem Norman Lamb and the SNP's Stewart Hosie. It calls for an extension to the Article 50 process - delaying Brexit beyond 29 March - in order to ""enable the House of Commons to find a way forward that can command majority support"". In the Commons, Mr Benn said he would support an amendment to his amendment, from the Labour MP Lucy Powell, which adds that any extension to the Brexit process should end by 30 June. In a separate move, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has said that, if Theresa May's deal is rejected for a third time by MPs next week, the government will stage two weeks of debate following the European Council on 21 and 22 March, to allow the Commons to try to find a majority for a different plan. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said it appeared the government was trying to spike the Benn amendment - which had a fairly good chance of getting through. If MPs reject it, they will be asked to vote on the Labour frontbench amendment next. If they back it, they will not vote on the Labour amendment and will go straight to a vote on the Chris Bryant amendment. Jeremy Corbyn's amendment would delay Brexit beyond 29 March to allow time for MPs to try to agree on a ""different approach"" Amendment (e), is in the name of Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn and Labour frontbenchers Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, John McDonnell, Valerie Vaz and chief whip Nick Brown. It rejects the prime minister's deal, rejects no deal, seeks an extension of the Article 50 process to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 29 March and to allow the Commons to ""provide parliamentary time"" for the Commons to ""find a majority for a different approach"". Whether this is supported or rejected, MPs will then be asked to vote on the next amendment blocking a third ""meaningful vote"" on Mrs May's withdrawal deal. MPs held their second vote on Theresa May's withdrawal deal this week - a third is due next week. The fourth amendment (j) selected by the Speaker is another cross-party affair, backed by Labour's Chris Bryant, Stephen Doughty and Alison McGovern, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts and the SNP's Philippa Whitford. It orders the government not to put Theresa May's deal to MPs again for a third time. It notes that the parliamentary rulebook, Erskine May, ""states that a motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided in the affirmative or negative during the current session may not be brought forward again during that session"".

MPs face 'stark' choice on Brexit delay,"MPs face a ""stark"" choice between a short delay to Brexit - if they back Theresa May's deal - or a much longer one if they reject it, a minister said. David Lidington - Mrs May's second-in-command - was speaking ahead of a series of Commons votes on delaying the UK's departure from the EU on 29 March. The PM will make a third attempt to get MPs to back her deal in the next week. If it fails again, Mr Lidington said MPs would get two weeks to decide what they wanted to do instead. A series of votes began at 17.00 GMT, with the result of a vote on the main government motion to delay Brexit expected shortly. MPs have rejected Amendment H, which called for the UK to request an extension of Article 50 to allow another referendum on EU membership, by 334 votes to 85, with most Labour MPs abstaining. The cross-party amendment had been tabled by independent MP Sarah Wollaston, the SNP's Philippa Whitford and Joanna Cherry, Lib Dem Tom Brake and Labour's Neil Coyle. MPs narrowly rejected Labour MP Lucy Powell's amendment which asked for an extension to Article 50 to run until 30 June ""to enable the House of Commons to find a way forward that can command majority support,"" by 314 votes to 311. Members also narrowly rejected Labour MP Hilary Benn's plan - to delay Brexit and for MPs to take control of the process on 20 March in order to try and find a way forward that is not the PM's deal - by just two votes: 314 votes to 312. Laura Keunssberg, the BBC's political editor, said the result was very significant and a huge relief for the government. A Jeremy Corbyn-backed amendment was defeated by 318 votes to 302. It sought to reject the prime minister's deal, reject a no deal Brexit, and called for an extension of the Article 50 process beyond 29 March to allow MPs time to ""find a majority for a different approach"" to the PM's deal. MPs are now voting on the main government motion on an extension to the Article 50 process for leaving the EU until 30 June if Parliament approves the government's Brexit deal by 20 March. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The idea of bringing back the deal for a third time, without even the pretence that anything has changed, other than, of course, using up more time, is an act of desperation.""

He said a government motion simply calling for a delay to Brexit would be easily passed, but by ""wrapping it up"" with a third vote on her deal, the PM risked further ""splits and divisions"" in her own party, something he said was ""absurd and irresponsible"". US President Donald Trump has also weighed into the debate, saying Brexit is ""tearing countries apart"". ""I'm surprised at how badly it has all gone from a stand point of negotiations but I gave the prime minister my ideas of how to negotiate it, she didn't listen to that and that's fine but it could have been negotiated in a different manner,"" said Mr Trump. He was speaking in the Oval Office after greeting Irish premier Leo Varadkar. In July last year, Mrs May saidMr Trump had advised her to sue the EUrather than negotiate over Brexit. In the Commons, David Lidington indicated that the government would allow MPs to hold a series of votes on possible ways forward on Brexit if MPs again rejected the PM's deal. But he warned that a longer extension would mean ""a sustained period of uncertainty... which I fear would do real damage to the public's faith in politics and faith in democracy"". And it would also mean that the UK would have to contest the European Parliament elections in May, he added. MPs will vote later on a motion calling for a three month delay to Brexit if MPs back Mrs May's deal - or a longer one if MPs do not support it by 20 March, the day before the next EU summit. Any length of extension has to be agreed by the EU. European Council president Donald Tusk has indicated that the EU may be ready to offer a lengthy extension to negotiations if the UK wants to ""rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it"". Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which twice rejected Mrs May's deal in the Commons - earlierheld talks with the governmentto see if a solution could be found allowing its MPs to support the PM in a future vote.

Go-ahead given to tram scheme extension,"An artist's impression of the tram travelling on Leith's Constitution Street Edinburgh's tram line is to be extended from the city centre to Newhaven at a cost of up to Â£207m. Supporters of the plan to lengthen the tram line by 2.8 miles (4.6km) say it is needed to match the city's population growth. But funding concerns have been raised after it was revealedthe project's costs had jumped by 25%. Works should be completed by 2022 and the extended line should be operational in the first quarter of 2023. The project was approved after a vote at the full meeting of Edinburgh City Council. It will be funded through borrowing paid back by future tram fare revenues, along with a special Â£20m dividend from the city's public bus firm Lothian Buses. The original tram project came in at twice its original budget and the mistakes made on that scheme are subject to anongoing public inquiry. The tram route will be extended to Newhaven Edinburgh City Council's transport convenor Lesley Macinnes said: ""This is a crucial decision for Edinburgh - for today's residents and for generations to come. ""Taking trams to Newhaven will allow brownfield development sites to be transformed, opening up the whole of north Edinburgh to a wealth of opportunities in terms of jobs, housing and local facilities. ""I firmly believe the tram project is in the best interests of the city's current and future residents and, as an administration, we will do everything in our power to make sure it's delivered on time and on budget."" The tram extension will be funded through borrowing paid back by future tram fare revenues It was initially estimated the tram extension would cost Â£165m but the final business case for the project now states it will be Â£207m, including a contingency fund. In the first year of operation, the council predicts 16 million passengers will use the line. Paul Tetlaw, of transport lobby group Transform Scotland, said: ""This will serve a key transport corridor and boost development in the city creating more sustainable travel patterns. ""In the UK Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester and Blackpool are all extending their systems and across the water Dublin is doing likewise. ""Edinburgh's initial tram route has been a great success, it has consistently outperformed passenger projections and there is ample evidence that it has encouraged  motorists to leave their cars behind and take the tram into the city."" Critics remain sceptical about the cost and disruption that will be caused by the tram extension through Leith. Harald Tobermann, of the Community Councils Together on Trams group, is calling for controlled parking zones along the tram route, claiming this is ""key to preventing the tram corridor from turning into Edinburgh's largest park and ride area"". He added: ""We recognise that a strong feeling exists among many people in our communities that this project is being pushed through with undue and unnecessary haste."" The council's transport and environment committee had alreadybacked the extensiondespite concerns about cost and disruption. Taking into account lessons learnt in the first phase of the tram project, construction is planned using a ""one-dig"" approach - closing each work site only once and opening them again only once all works are complete.

Bloody Sunday murder charges for soldier,"James Wray and William McKinney were among 13 people shot dead at a civil rights march A former British soldier faces murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. The sole prosecution is seen as a ""terrible disappointment"" by some of the families of the 13 people killed. They were shot dead at a civil rights march on 30 January 1972. The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Bloody Sunday decision reaction What next after Bloody Sunday charges?

This video can not be played What was Bloody Sunday? On the same day as the funerals were held for 11 of the Bloody Sunday victims, the British Embassy in Dublin was burned to the ground by an angry crowd. Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. BBC News NI's Home Affairs Correspondent Julian O'Neill said it could be a ""period of months"" before Soldier F makes his first court appearance. The former paratrooper is being referred to only as Soldier F because all military witnesses were granted anonymity through the Saville Inquiry into the circumstances around the killings. The PPS said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute 16 other soldiers and two Official IRA men. James Wray's brother Liam said he was ""very saddened for the other families"" of those killed on Bloody Sunday. ""Their hearts must be broken,"" he said. ""It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved."" He added: ""There are a lot of sad and heartbroken people today."" A number of relatives of those killed walked to Derry city centre ahead of the PPS decision. William McKinney's brother Michael said it was ""disappointing"" for families who had not received news of prosecutions. Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: ""It has been a long road for the families... and today will be another extremely difficult day for many of them. ""We wanted to meet them personally to explain the decisions taken and to help them understand the reasons."" Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she feels ""let down by a law and a justice system that's supposed to protect people"".

The most difficult thing I had to do today was to call my children and tell them that there are no prosecutions for their granda and uncle."" Her sister Kate said they would appeal the decision.

His assertion that there were ""gunmen and bombers killed"" was rejected in Lord Saville's report. The Saville Inquiry stated that there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot father-of-six Paddy Doherty, who was unarmed. Saville also found there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot an unarmed Bernard McGuigan on Bloody Sunday as he went to the aid of Patrick Doherty, waving a white handkerchief. At the Saville Inquiry, Soldier F admitted he had shot 17-year-old Michael Kelly - but he said that he had only fired at people with bombs or weapons. However, Saville concluded Mr Kelly was unarmed. The Saville Inquiry found that both William McKinney and James Wray could have been shot by Soldier F and three other soldiers. The inquiry report also stated Soldier F had changed his story over the years. Bloody Sunday gained notoriety around the world, partly due to the image of a Catholic priest waving a bloodstained handkerchief as he tried to help a victim Mr Herron said the decisions to prosecute announced on Thursday ""relate only to allegations of criminal conduct on Bloody Sunday itself"". ""Consideration will now be given to allegations of perjury in respect of those suspects reported by police,"" he said. by Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent Bloody Sunday might have happened 47 years ago, but it has cast a very long shadow, extending far beyond victims' families and those involved. It fuelled the Troubles and, two decades after they ended, it will once again throw a searchlight on how Northern Ireland deals with its past. Legacy issues, as they are termed, can poison the present day and they have been allowed to fester. Bloody Sunday has fed into the ongoing debate, with the government considering legislation as part of its next steps. Will that involve a de facto amnesty from prosecutions in future, and whom might that cover? This is the bigger picture against the backdrop of the Bloody Sunday decisions, significant as they are in their own right. The intention to charge a former soldier has clawed at emotions not just in Derry, but among bereaved families and victims in thousands of other Troubles cases left pondering truth and justice. The case could come before a court for a preliminary hearing quite quickly, says the legal expert, Joshua Rozenberg. He expects Soldier F to be brought before a court in Northern Ireland and to be named. UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government would offer full legal support to Soldier F - including paying his legal costs and providing welfare support. ""We are indebted to those soldiers who served with courage and distinction to bring peace to Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The welfare of our former service personnel is of the utmost importance."" He said the the Ministry of Defence is working ""to drive through a new package of safeguards to ensure our armed forces are not unfairly treated."" ""And the Government will urgently reform the system for dealing with legacy issues,"" he said. ""Our serving and former personnel cannot live in constant fear of prosecution."" Following Mr Williamson's statement, lawyers acting on behalf of the family of William Nash said they had contacted the Northern Ireland attorney general accusing the defence secretary of contempt of court. A public inquiry conducted by a senior judge in 1972 was branded a whitewash by victims' families. This video can not be played Liam Wray expressed relief that a soldier was to be prosecuted for his brother's murder After decades of campaigning, a fresh inquiry was eventually ordered by then prime minister Tony Blair in 1998. Lord Saville's 5,000-page report stated none of the casualties was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury and that soldiers had lost their self-control. The prime minister at the time of the report's publication, David Cameron, apologised for the soldiers' conduct, saying the killings were unjustified and unjustifiable, A police investigation into Bloody Sunday followed Lord Saville's 12-year, Â£200m public inquiry. A file was sent to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in November 2016. In total, police reported 20 suspects to the PPS - 18 of them former soldiers, one of whom died last year. Papers before prosecutors included 668 witness statements and numerous photos, video and audio evidence. The march began shortly after 15:00 GMT on 30 January 1972, and the intended destination was the city centre. However, Army barricades blocked marchers. The majority of demonstrators were instead directed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. Graffitti appeared on Free Derry Corner after the announcement on Thursday After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. Two people were shot and wounded. At 16:07, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10, soldiers began to open fire. According to Army evidence, 21 soldiers fired their weapons, discharging 108 live rounds between them. Tense wait for Bloody Sunday decision What happened on Bloody Sunday?

EU's Tusk to propose long Brexit extension,"This video can not be played Brexit: Will the EU accept a delay to Article 50? European Council President Donald Tusk has said he will appeal to EU leaders ""to be open to a long extension"" of the Brexit deadline, if the UK needs to rethink its strategy and get consensus. His intervention came as UK MPs voted to seek a delay of the 29 March deadline to leave the EU. EU leaders meet in Brussels on 21 March and they would have the final say. Prime Minister Theresa May has said that if her Brexit deal is not approved a longer extension may be necessary. After two resounding defeats in the House of Commons, she will make another attempt by 20 March to push through her Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. Brexit delay: What just happened? MPs backed a government motion on Thursday to extend the two-year deadline to 30 June if the Mrs May's deal is passed next week, while noting that a longer extension would be necessary if it is rejected. All 27 other EU nations would have to agree to an extension, and Mr Tusk, who is the bloc's summit chairman, will hold talks with several leaders ahead of next week's Brussels meeting. While European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has insisted that any postponement ""should be complete before the European elections"" at the end of May, Mr Tusk made clear a longer delay was on the cards.

While he did not specify the length of the delay, officials suggested it would have to be at least a year if the UK prime minister's deal was rejected a third time. Mr Tusk said earlier this year that the EU's hearts were still open to the UK if it changed its mind about Brexit. He provoked an angry reaction from pro-Brexit supporters when he said there was a ""special place in hell"" for those who had promoted Brexit ""without even a sketch of a plan of how to carry it out safely"". MPs to vote on delaying Brexit How could Brexit be delayed? Tusk: Place in hell for no-plan Brexiteers So at this crucial point, what do Europe's leaders think about extending Article 50, the two-year treaty provision that the UK invoked on 29 March 2017? Jenny Hill in Berlin ""A lot of the trust is gone."" Among business and political figures in Berlin, there's growing frustration, even anger, at developments in Britain. Nevertheless, Germany is likely to do all it can to help facilitate the orderly Brexit which Angela Merkel insists is still possible. The German chancellor won't be drawn publicly on whether she would support an extension to Article 50, but it's widely accepted here that she and her government would be willing do so. There are those who believe that support should be conditional upon Britain's ability to outline its reasons and expectations before such an extension is granted. And there are significant concerns about the impact of a longer extension upon the EU elections but Germany's interests lie in avoiding a no-deal Brexit â and the damage that could wreak on the German economy. Its government will do what it can to achieve that aim. This video can not be played Is the UK in a crisis over leaving the EU? Dr Norbert Roettgen, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, urged Britain and the EU to take their time. ""Everything is hectic, hysterical, unclear. Let's slow down and try to get a clear head,"" he said. ""The world will not end if we all take time for a breather, focus on important points."" ""If we try to rush a result now it will definitely go wrong."" Brexit uncertainty exasperates Europe's papers Hugh Schofield in Paris As a ""frontline"" country which effectively shares a border with the UK â thanks to the Channel Tunnel â  France has more to fear than most from a no-deal Brexit. Yet when it comes to granting London more time, President Emmanuel Macron is expected to insist on conditions. He will not approve an extension if it simply means putting off the pain. A ""technical"" extension of a few weeks would be an easy matter, according to Elvire Fabry of the Jacques Delors Institute in Paris. Even if the House of Commons had approved Theresa May's plan on Tuesday, such an extension would probably have been inevitable, and automatically approved at the EU summit next week. France is connected to the UK by the Channel Tunnel and queues formed on Wednesday because of industrial action ""But a longer extension poses all sorts of problems. No-one is comfortable with the idea of the UK taking part in the EU elections in May. It would be a most unwelcome distraction,"" Ms Fabry said. ""So for a longer extension there would have to be a very clear and precise objective written in - for example new elections in the UK or a new referendum."" She said that Brussels ""was pretty favourable"" to the idea â but in the last few days things had changed. ""No-one over here is saying, 'let's just get it over with and have a No Deal.' That fatigue seems to be gaining ground in the UK, but not in Europe."" ""Here everyone is exhausted and impatient â but we feel there is nothing much more we can do. It's the Brits who have to sort this out among themselves."" Adam Easton in Warsaw ""The British people have decided the UK should leave, it should be concluded. Otherwise it would be a humiliation."" That's how one MEP from the governing party, Ryszard Legutko, put it, adding: ""A second referendum or too long an extension would also be a humiliation"". Top officials are a little more gentle. Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, has said the UK may need a little more time. One British MEP at the European Parliament kept abreast of the headlines back home ""We are watching what is happening in the UK - the votes, there are certain expectations about how they will end. Maybe we will need toâ¦ extend this period a bit, maybe a little more time is needed for reflection,"" he told reporters in the Polish parliament. ""From our point of view a no-deal Brexit is the worst solution."" For Warsaw, securing the rights of the estimated one million Poles living in the UK has always been and remains the number one priority, and the two governments are in ""constant contact"". But Poland is hoping for a deal and a smooth transition period. That's because the UK is Poland's third-largest sales market. Northern Ireland's Polish community considers future Anna Holligan in Rotterdam Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok has told the BBC his country would look ""with benevolence"" at any request to extend Article 50. But ""without a clear goal an extension won't solve anything"", he warned. The mantra ""hope for the best, prepare for the worst"" underpins the Dutch approach, and Mr Blok was at an event showcasing the government's preparations for a no-deal exit. ""I'm looking forward to any solution that will solve the problem, but that has to come from London now."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Four Brexits and a Divorce: What do MPs want?Does the UK need to hold European elections?Brexit amendments: What might MPs vote on?VideoVideoIs the UK in a crisis?,"Towards the end of the 1994 film Four Weddings and a Funeral, the commitment-phobic Charles (played by Hugh Grant) has a meltdown minutes before his marriage. Panicking in the vestry he can't believe that after years of guzzling salmon and champagne at other people's weddings he's still deliberating and wracked by doubt on the brink of his own. In the end a reassuring vicar helps him towards the altar. In a Red Nose Day special on BBC One on Friday we'll find out what happened to the characters 25 years on. But I'm reminded of Charles every time I talk to an anguished MP (and that's most of them) fretting about the choices in front of them. At this five minutes to midnight moment, the House of Commons is still thinking. PM to bring third Brexit deal vote to MPs Latest updates: Fallout from no-deal vote Brexitcast: Something has changed It's been clear for two years what MPs do not want. Theresa May's deal has now been rejected twice, while Labour's plan for joining a customs union has never secured a majority. Most MPs did not want to leave the EU, but apart from a minority insisting another referendum is needed to break the stalemate, they are reconciled to leaving. The question is how? And it is extraordinary that with the two-year Article 50 process about to expire, they are still kicking around alternative plans for the UK's future relationship the EU. In a farce that could be called Four Brexits and a Divorce, various cross-party groups of backbench MPs have spent months working on their own ideas for how the UK might leave the EU. For instance, in the so-called Malthouse Compromise, a group of Tory MPs has put forward a proposal that would involve the UK buying a two-year transition period from the EU, but without a formal withdrawal agreement. One of its supporters, former cabinet minster Damian Green, told me the UK and EU would use the time to negotiate a trade deal and the controversial Irish backstop would not be needed. The EU's current refusal to countenance such a plan has not deflated its supporters. Other Conservatives have joined forces with several Labour MPs to advocate UK membership of the single market and a new customs arrangement - a plan dubbed ""Common Market 2.02 or ""Norway plus"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has recently shown an interest in this idea too. Former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke believes a Brexit that keeps the UK closer to the EU economically is the option most likely to find a majority in the Commons. ""I've never seen such chaos in my whole life,"" the veteran MP says wearily. Mr Clarke thinks the sensible thing would be for Parliament to simply to revoke Article 50, the mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, but says there's no chance Parliament will do that. Former Conservative and now Independent Group MP Anna Soubry insists another referendum ""is the only way out of this mess"" - but there does not appear to be a majority in the Commons for that step yet. Meanwhile, at the other end of Parliamentary opinion, Brexit-backing Conservative MP Nigel Evans has no fear about the UK leaving the EU without any withdrawal agreement. ""It's not the ideal outcome and I would prefer a deal, but we are where we are,"" says Mr Evans. The basic choice facing MPs has always been the same: If they don't want the UK to leave without a deal in a fortnight, they must either pass a withdrawal agreement, revoke Article 50 or ask the EU for an extension. But it's pretty clear the EU will want clarity about what an extension is for. With time almost up and a UK request to extend Brexit looking likely, there is now an urgent need for MPs to prove what they can support. A series of Parliamentary votes sifting and sorting these ideas seems inevitable. But if an alternative Brexit plan does not emerge in the next few days, MPs could again face a choice between the government's deal or no deal at all.

Does the UK need to hold European elections?Brexit amendments: What might MPs vote on?VideoVideoIs the UK in a crisis?,"It is becoming a key question in this complex Brexit process. If the UK was to request, or be offered, a lengthy extension of its membership of the European Union (EU), would there be an obligation to take part in May's European elections? Both the UK government and the European Commission (EC) say that there would; but legal opinion is divided, and many lawyers argue that a satisfactory fix could be found. The elections are taking place between 23 and 26 May, although the new parliament will not sit, and new members will not be sworn in, until  2 July. That is why it has been argued thatan extension of Article 50 until the end of Junewould not prove to be a problem. But what about a much longer extension - potentially as long as 21 months until the end of 2020? That takes the debate into much trickier legal and political territory. The issue has taken on renewed relevance afterthe President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, wrote in a tweet,externalthat he will appeal to the 27 other EU leaders over the next few days ""to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy"". Theresa May has indicated that she would only favour a ""short technical extension"" to the UK's EU membership, if that was necessary in order to turn a last-minute agreement into law. But a longer extension, she told MPs, ""would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament (EP) elections in May 2019"". Yes - as the ""guardian of the treaties"", the Commission has strong views on this. In a letter to Mr Tusk on March 11,,externalJean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said that if the UK is still part of the EU at the end of May ""it will be legally required to hold these elections, in line with the rights and obligations of all Member States as set out in the Treaties"". There is no question that the UK would be in breach of those treaty obligations if it failed to hold elections. But how much would that matter, if the UK was on a path out of the EU anyway? That is an unresolved debate that may eventually have to be tested in court. A legal opinion issued by the German Bundestag's Europe Department says that Article 50 cannot be extended beyond the end of May unless the UK holds elections. It suggests that the European Commission might choose to begin treaty infringement proceedings against the UK for denying the vote to UK or EU citizens in the UK. The UK'sDepartment for Exiting the European Union argues,externalthat the UK would have to take part in the elections because ""the EU Treaties provide that EU citizens have the right to be represented"" and the European Parliament ""needs to be properly constitutedâ¦ with duly elected representatives from all Member States"" in order to perform its functions. How can Article 50 be extended? Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? But others disagree. A confidential legal opinion, written by the European Parliament's own legal service and seen by the BBC, argues that the new parliament could be legally constituted even if the UK had not taken part in the elections. ""The potential infringement by a Member State of its duties and responsibilities under the Treaties and the Electoral Act cannot amount,"" the opinion says, ""to an absolute bar to the regular functioning of the Institution."" If the UK didn't take part in the elections, there would be considerable concern about legal challenges, either from those who might argue that their right to be represented was being denied, or from those who might argue that the UK was paying money into the EU budget without receiving all the benefits. But representation is not necessarily the same thing as holding elections. When countries join the EU, there have been periods when national MPs have been appointed to serve as representatives in the European Parliament until the next European elections take place. This happened with Romania and Bulgaria in 2007. Could a similar temporary measure apply as an existing EU member seeks to leave? Perhaps. Another alternative that has been suggested is that the UK's current MEPs could continue to sit in the next European Parliament until the end of the Article 50 period, or they could be granted some form of observer status. All of this is uncharted legal territory. Jean-Claude Juncker says the UK ""will be legally required to hold these elections"" if it is still part of the EU at the end of May But the UK's most senior lawyer at the European Court of Justice, Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston, seems convinced that a solution can be found. There would be a need, she wrote on Twitter, ""to arrange for British MEPs to sit in the new (parliament) as additional members on a temporary 'Brexit-limited' basis"". Any suggestion that the European elections represent an ""insuperable obstacle"" to a longer extension of Article 50 is, she added, ""an oversimplified and ultimately fallacious presentation of the facts"". Ms Sharpston emphasised that she was writing in a personal capacity, but her opinion clearly carries some weight. ""If the political will to agree a longer extension of Article 50 is there, she concluded, ""a legal mechanism can be found to accommodate that desire and 'deal with' the issue of the EP elections."" A legal solution could be found within Article 50 itself. It is already being used to offer the UK an extensive transition period after Brexit, even though it does not mention transition explicitly. ""An argument could be made that extending existing MEPs also qualifies as a transitional arrangement,"" says Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, ""The formal position is that the UK would need to hold elections,"" Prof Barnard says. ""But it is likely that those MEPs would only serve for a maximum of two years, so it would be in the interest of both sides to find a creative solution. ""One possibility is to see how far Article 50 can be stretched."" Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external How does another Brexit delay work?

Brexit amendments: What might MPs vote on?VideoVideoIs the UK in a crisis?,"MPs will vote later on whether or not the UK should seek permission from the EU to delay Brexit beyond 29 March. Backbench MPs and opposition parties put forward eleven amendments to show what they want to do next. Speaker John Bercow has selected four amendments for debate, although not all will necessarily be put to a vote at 1700 GMT. But his decision to allow one calling for another referendum - but not one ruling another referendum out - has been questioned by some Brexiteers. Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois said it was signed by ""127 members of this House including the entirety of the DUP, 13 members of the Labour Party, and one independent to boot"" as well as more than 100 Conservative MPs - and asked Mr Bercow why it had not been selected. Mr Bercow told him ""members do have to take the rough with the smooth"" and he tried to ""always do my best to be fair to the miscellany of different points of view represented in this House"". The government motion for debate on Thursday is: (1) notes the resolutions of the House of 12 and 13 March, and accordingly agrees that the government will seek to agree with the European Union an extension of the period specified in Article 50(3); (2) agrees that, if the House has passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then the government will seek to agree with the European Union a one-off extension of the period specified in Article 50(3) for a period ending on 30 June 2019 for the purpose of passing the necessary EU exit legislation; and (3) notes that, if the House has not passed a resolution approving the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by 20 March 2019, then it is highly likely that the European Council at its meeting the following day would require a clear purpose for any extension, not least to determine its length, and that any extension beyond 30 June 2019 would require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament elections in May 2019. The campaign for another referendum has many supporters outside Parliament The cross-party amendment (h) from independent MP Sarah Wollaston, the SNP's Philippa Whitford and Joanna Cherry, Lib Dem Tom Brake and Labour's Neil Coyle calls for another referendum and would be the first to be voted on. It changes the wording of the government motion to instruct the prime minister to request an extension to the Article 50 process ""sufficient for the purposes of legislating for and conducting a public vote in which the people of the United Kingdom may give their consent for either leaving the European Union on terms to be determined by Parliament or retaining the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union."" If it is supported, the following two amendments - from Hilary Benn and the Labour frontbench - would not then go to the vote and MPs would be asked to vote on Chris Bryant's amendment next. If it is rejected, MPs would vote on the next one on this list. Labour will not be backing this amendment, saying it is not the right time to push for another public vote, reducing its chances of success. Hilary Benn's amendment opens the way to a series of Commons votes to indicate what MPs might support This cross-party amendment (i) would allow MPs to take control of the process in Parliament on Wednesday 20 March, to force a series of indicative votes to establish MPs' preferred option for Brexit. It is backed by senior backbenchers: Labour's Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, the Conservatives' Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, Lib Dem Norman Lamb and the SNP's Stewart Hosie. It calls for an extension to the Article 50 process - delaying Brexit beyond 29 March - in order to ""enable the House of Commons to find a way forward that can command majority support"". In the Commons, Mr Benn said he would support an amendment to his amendment, from the Labour MP Lucy Powell, which adds that any extension to the Brexit process should end by 30 June. In a separate move, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has said that, if Theresa May's deal is rejected for a third time by MPs next week, the government will stage two weeks of debate following the European Council on 21 and 22 March, to allow the Commons to try to find a majority for a different plan. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said it appeared the government was trying to spike the Benn amendment - which had a fairly good chance of getting through. If MPs reject it, they will be asked to vote on the Labour frontbench amendment next. If they back it, they will not vote on the Labour amendment and will go straight to a vote on the Chris Bryant amendment. Jeremy Corbyn's amendment would delay Brexit beyond 29 March to allow time for MPs to try to agree on a ""different approach"" Amendment (e), is in the name of Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn and Labour frontbenchers Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, John McDonnell, Valerie Vaz and chief whip Nick Brown. It rejects the prime minister's deal, rejects no deal, seeks an extension of the Article 50 process to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 29 March and to allow the Commons to ""provide parliamentary time"" for the Commons to ""find a majority for a different approach"". Whether this is supported or rejected, MPs will then be asked to vote on the next amendment blocking a third ""meaningful vote"" on Mrs May's withdrawal deal. MPs held their second vote on Theresa May's withdrawal deal this week - a third is due next week. The fourth amendment (j) selected by the Speaker is another cross-party affair, backed by Labour's Chris Bryant, Stephen Doughty and Alison McGovern, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts and the SNP's Philippa Whitford. It orders the government not to put Theresa May's deal to MPs again for a third time. It notes that the parliamentary rulebook, Erskine May, ""states that a motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided in the affirmative or negative during the current session may not be brought forward again during that session"".

"MPs face 'stark' choice on Brexit delayThe government urges MPs to back the PM's deal, as they debate delaying the UK's 29 March departure.UK Politics","MPs face a ""stark"" choice between a short delay to Brexit - if they back Theresa May's deal - or a much longer one if they reject it, a minister said. David Lidington - Mrs May's second-in-command - was speaking ahead of a series of Commons votes on delaying the UK's departure from the EU on 29 March. The PM will make a third attempt to get MPs to back her deal in the next week. If it fails again, Mr Lidington said MPs would get two weeks to decide what they wanted to do instead. A series of votes began at 17.00 GMT, with the result of a vote on the main government motion to delay Brexit expected shortly. MPs have rejected Amendment H, which called for the UK to request an extension of Article 50 to allow another referendum on EU membership, by 334 votes to 85, with most Labour MPs abstaining. The cross-party amendment had been tabled by independent MP Sarah Wollaston, the SNP's Philippa Whitford and Joanna Cherry, Lib Dem Tom Brake and Labour's Neil Coyle. MPs narrowly rejected Labour MP Lucy Powell's amendment which asked for an extension to Article 50 to run until 30 June ""to enable the House of Commons to find a way forward that can command majority support,"" by 314 votes to 311. Members also narrowly rejected Labour MP Hilary Benn's plan - to delay Brexit and for MPs to take control of the process on 20 March in order to try and find a way forward that is not the PM's deal - by just two votes: 314 votes to 312. Laura Keunssberg, the BBC's political editor, said the result was very significant and a huge relief for the government. A Jeremy Corbyn-backed amendment was defeated by 318 votes to 302. It sought to reject the prime minister's deal, reject a no deal Brexit, and called for an extension of the Article 50 process beyond 29 March to allow MPs time to ""find a majority for a different approach"" to the PM's deal. MPs are now voting on the main government motion on an extension to the Article 50 process for leaving the EU until 30 June if Parliament approves the government's Brexit deal by 20 March. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The idea of bringing back the deal for a third time, without even the pretence that anything has changed, other than, of course, using up more time, is an act of desperation."" Latest updates: Fallout from no-deal vote Brexit amendments: What will MPs vote on? Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Four Brexits and a Divorce: What do MPs want? He said a government motion simply calling for a delay to Brexit would be easily passed, but by ""wrapping it up"" with a third vote on her deal, the PM risked further ""splits and divisions"" in her own party, something he said was ""absurd and irresponsible"". US President Donald Trump has also weighed into the debate, saying Brexit is ""tearing countries apart"". ""I'm surprised at how badly it has all gone from a stand point of negotiations but I gave the prime minister my ideas of how to negotiate it, she didn't listen to that and that's fine but it could have been negotiated in a different manner,"" said Mr Trump. He was speaking in the Oval Office after greeting Irish premier Leo Varadkar. In July last year, Mrs May saidMr Trump had advised her to sue the EUrather than negotiate over Brexit. In the Commons, David Lidington indicated that the government would allow MPs to hold a series of votes on possible ways forward on Brexit if MPs again rejected the PM's deal. But he warned that a longer extension would mean ""a sustained period of uncertainty... which I fear would do real damage to the public's faith in politics and faith in democracy"". And it would also mean that the UK would have to contest the European Parliament elections in May, he added. MPs will vote later on a motion calling for a three month delay to Brexit if MPs back Mrs May's deal - or a longer one if MPs do not support it by 20 March, the day before the next EU summit. Any length of extension has to be agreed by the EU. European Council president Donald Tusk has indicated that the EU may be ready to offer a lengthy extension to negotiations if the UK wants to ""rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it"". Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which twice rejected Mrs May's deal in the Commons - earlierheld talks with the governmentto see if a solution could be found allowing its MPs to support the PM in a future vote. MPs voted on Wednesday eveningto reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances. No date has yet been set for the third so-called ""meaningful vote"".

"Liberal Democrats investigate former leaderDavid Steel told a child abuse inquiry on Wednesday that he had ""assumed"" former MP Cyril Smith was an abuser, but took no action.Scotland politics","Lord Steel gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in Manchester on Wednesday The Liberal Democrats have suspended former leader David Steel over remarks he made to a child abuse inquiry about the late MP Cyril Smith. Lord Steel said he asked Smith in 1979 about claims he abused boys at a Rochdale hostel in the 1960s. He said he came away from the conversation ""assuming"" that Smith had committed the offences but claimed it was ""nothing to do with me"". A Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesman said an investigation would take place. The spokesman said: ""Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on 13th March 2019 the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed. ""The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation. That work will now commence. ""It is important that everyone in the party, and in wider society, understands the importance of vigilance and safeguarding to protect people from abuse, and that everyone has confidence in the seriousness with which we take it. ""We appreciate the difficult work that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is doing on behalf of the victims and survivors of abuse, and the country as a whole."" Leader 'assumed' Cyril Smith was an abuser The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard that no formal inquiry was held by the party into the claims against Smith, which were investigated by the police in 1969 but no prosecution was brought. Smith served as a Labour councillor in Rochdale in the 1960s before becoming the Liberal and then Liberal Democrat MP for the town between 1972 and 1992. Allegations that he abused a number of boys found a wider public spotlight after he died in 2010. Lord Steel, 80, told the inquiry he discussed the allegations with Smith in 1979, after an article appeared in Private Eye. He said Smith had told him ""it was correct, the matter had been investigated by police, no further action was taken and that was the end of the story"". Cyril Smith (left) and David Steel (right) discussed the allegations in 1979 Lord Steel said he had ""assumed"" that Smith had committed the offences, but said he took no further action because: ""It was before he was an MP, before he was even a member of my party. It had nothing to do with me."" Lord Steel also described recommending Smith for a knighthood in 1988 and said he did not pass on any allegations about the sexual abuse of children because ""I was not aware of any such allegations other than the matter referred toâ¦which appeared to have been fully investigated"". And he said it had not occurred to him that children could still have been at risk from Smith. In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, Lord Steel said: ""I would like to clarify what happened in 1979 when I asked Cyril Smith about the report in Private Eye. ""As I told the inquiry yesterday I did not have that report with me when I tackled him, nor did we discuss the details in it. ""He admitted to me that the report was correct in that he had been investigated by the police at the time and no action taken against him. ""I had already told the inquiry in writing that in my opinion he had been abusing his position in Rochdale Council [that is to gain access to council-run children's homes], but that had been properly a matter for the police and the council, and not for me as he was neither an MP nor even a member of the Liberal Party at the time. ""I was in no position to re-open the investigation."" The statement continued: ""I am reinforced in my view by reading the previous report of the inquiry sent to me today, which says inter alia 'the Crown Prosecution Service found that the advice which had previously been given could not be faulted (given the law and guidance in place at the time)' and that the honours scrutiny committee had seriously considered his nomination for a knighthood and sent a 'warning of risk' letter to Margaret Thatcher as PM, and that 'clearly she took a similar view' as he was granted the knighthood. ""It is unfortunate that some sections of the media have chosen to extract certain passages of evidence and present them without the full context. ""The inquiry has a serious and sensitive job to undertake and spinning evidence to generate sensationalist headlines only serves to distract from panel's search of the truth."" Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon who is acting on behalf of seven victims in the abuse inquiry, said Lord Steel's admission that he assumed Smith had committed offences would ""cause victims great anger"". He added: ""Steel's inaction was an appalling dereliction of duty and I hope the inquiry will condemn it in the strongest possible terms."" Lord Steel became the Liberal MP for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles in 1965, and became the party's leader in 1976 after the resignation of Jeremy Thorpe, who later stood trial on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder. He was elected as an MSP when the Scottish Parliament opened in 1999, and was appointed as the parliament's first presiding officer. He has been a life peer in the House of Lords since 1997.

Aristote Yenge and Adebayo Amusa were convicted at Ipswich Crown Court with Kyreis Davies, 17, who can be named after the judge lifted a court order. Callum Plaats was found not guilty of murder, but convicted of manslaughter. Leon Glasgow was acquitted of both murder and manslaughter. The jury is still considering its verdict on Isaac Calver, who denies murder, and has been sent home for the night. Aristote Yenge (left) and Kyreis Davies were found guilty of murder Yenge, 23, and Davies had refused to attend court so were absent when the verdicts were returned. In the packed public gallery, Tavis's mum cried when they were found guilty. She walked out when the verdict on Plaats, 23, came back and there were gasps when Mr Glasgow was cleared. The reporting restriction on naming Davies was lifted following an application by the BBC.

Family appeal to catch killer driver,"Lionel Simenya was fatally injured on Fords Road in the Saughton area of Edinburgh The brother of a chef who was killed after being struck by a stolen car in Edinburgh has urged those responsible for the murder to give themselves up.

Mr Simenya, who was originally from Burundi, had lived in the UK for several years. A week on from the murder, his brother addressed a media conference in a bid to bring those responsible to justice. Nicolas Simenya addressed the media at a police press conference in Edinburgh He said: ""Lionel worked hard and never asked for help from anyone. ""Lionel was in his prime and would have been 37 yesterday (Wednesday) had he not been taken away from us. ""Yesterday we visited his body at the mortuary. He looked so peaceful. The same way he lived his life."" Mr Simenya, 35, asked those with information to examine their consciences. The export manager added: ""Lionel did not deserve to die such an atrocious death. ""He should be living his life to the fullest, instead of having been cruelly taken away from us. ""As his family, we urge anyone with information to come forward and contact the police so that we can start grieving."" The father-of-one, who lives in Belgium, was joined at the media conference by Det Insp Stuart Alexander from Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team.

""I'm surprised at how badly it has all gone from a standpoint of negotiations but I gave the prime minister my ideas of how to negotiate it, she didn't listen to that and that's fine but it could have been negotiated in a different manner."" Mr Varadkar told reporters he had a different view to Mr Trump on how Brexit should be handled, and that it would be ""a few years"" before the UK ""sorted itself out"". Mr Varadkar, who is gay, brought his partner to meet US Vice-President Mike Pence, who has been criticised for his conservative views on LGBT rights Earlier on Thursday, Mr Varadkar met the US Vice-President Mike Pence, at an event where he said that he is judged not by his sexual orientation but by his political actions. Mr Pence has been criticised in the past for his conservative views on LGBT rights, and last year there was much focus on his meeting with the taoiseach. At that time, Mr Pence invited Mr Varadkar and his partner to visit him. On Thursday, the taoiseach and his partner, Matt Barrett, met Mr Pence and his sister at his residence in Washington DC. Mr Varadkar has invited Mr Pence to visit the Republic of Ireland, who confirmed that he is planning a trip with his mother at some stage.

Knife offences in courts at nine-year high,"This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? The number of crimes related to knives and other offensive weapons dealt with by the criminal justice system reached a nine-year high in 2018, figures show. The Ministry of Justice reported a total of 21,484 offences in England and Wales, the equivalent of 59 every single day. Of all those convicted or cautioned, just over a fifth were under 18. The figures show 37% of all offences led,externalto an immediate jail sentence, compared with 23% in 2009. Cautions and fines are only half as likely to be used now as they were in 2009. The average length of custodial sentences classed as ""immediate"" - therefore not including suspended sentences - was 8.1 months last year. That is the longest average term since comparable records began in 2008. The MoJ figures cover not just knives, but other offensive weapons such as deliberately broken bottles, sharpened screwdrivers, knuckle dusters and corrosive liquids.

Responding to the figures, Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""Surely the Tories don't need any further evidence that not enough is being done to tackle knife crime?""

God of War leads Bafta gaming nominations,"God of War, Red Dead Redemption 2, Return of the Obra Dinn and Florence lead the nominations at this year's Bafta 2019 games awards. God of War has been nominated for ten while Red Dead, Obra Dinn and Florence all pick up six. These four, plus Astro Bot: Rescue Mission and Assassin's Creed: Odyssey compete for the big award of best game. The category is a mix of big budget games and critically acclaimed indie titles. You've probably heard of some famous franchises but Florence, Return of Obra Dinn and Celeste (which has five nominations) will be unknown to some players. Florence is a puzzle game based on a relationship between a bored woman and a musician, which was created to be a violence-free alternative to aggressive games that dominate the mainstream.

Christopher Judge, Danielle Bisutti, Jeremy Daniels, Sunny Suljic will compete with Red Dead and Assassin's Creed actors for the performance prize. Christopher Judge, Danielle Bisutti, Jeremy Daniels are all nominated for their acting skills at the 2019 gaming BAFTAs In the evolving game category, online shooters Fortnite and Overwatch will compete against each other and Destiny 2, Elite Dangerous: Beyond, Sea of Thieves and Rainbow Six. Florence, Frostpunk, God of War, Marvel's Spider-Man, Red Dead Redemption and Return of the Obra Dinn are nominated for the best narrative award. Analysis by Steffan Powell, Radio 1 Newsbeat gaming reporter These nominations can be read in two ways. The first is that story-driven experiences are still very much alive, kicking and have a bright future. Games like God of War, Red Dead Redemption and Celeste lead the nominations. Despite the dominance of Fortnite and the Battle Royale genre this surely shows that audiences still crave games that take you on a journey - making you laugh, cry and jump along the way. Fortnite is the only Battle Royal game nominated in the best evolving game category - although with Apex Legends missing the nominations cut-off date, maybe next year will be different. The second way of interpreting the nominations is that there's a growing gulf between the members of the industry who decide the nominations, and the players themselves. Lots of independent games have nominations, but there's nothing for really popular titles like Call of Duty and Fifa - and Assassins Creed only has the one. Are they out of touch? The titles nominated in the best game category are genuinely deserving either way and, while it looks like a straight shoot-out between God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2 for the title, these awards are renowned for throwing up a surprising result.

PM to bring third Brexit deal vote to MPs,"This video can not be played How MPs rejected a no-deal Brexit Theresa May will make a third attempt to get her EU withdrawal deal through Parliament in the next week. She told MPs that if her deal fails again to get their backing, a lengthy delay to Brexit may be needed. The prime minister's warning comes ahead of a Commons vote later on whether to ask the EU for permission to delay Brexit beyond 29 March. MPs voted on Wednesday eveningto reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances. No date has yet been set for the third so-called ""meaningful vote"". Latest updates: Fallout from no-deal vote Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Four Brexits and a Divorce: What do MPs want? MPs will vote on a government motion which could see a delay to the UK's departure from the EU. The UK government said there could be a short delay until 30 June, if MPs approve Mrs May's deal by 20 March - the day before the next EU summit in Brussels. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that even if the UK is given until the end of June to pass the legislation required to leave the EU, the government will try to do that earlier, if Mrs May's deal is passed next week. Alternatively, there could be a much longer delay, requiring the UK to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May, the prime minister has said, in the event her deal is not approved. However, any length of extension has to be agreed by the EU. The DUP - which twice rejected Mrs May's deal in the Commons - isholding talks with the governmentto see if a solution could be found allowing its MPs to support the PM in a future vote. In a night of high drama on Wednesday, the Commons first voted on an amendment to reject the UK exiting the EU without a deal under any circumstances, by a margin of four. That meant the government's original motion - which had stated that the UK should not leave the EU without a deal on 29 March - was changed at the last minute. What is a no-deal Brexit? Brexitcast: Something has changed What Europe thinks of giving UK more time for Brexit How could Brexit be delayed? The government had wanted to keep control of the Brexit process, and keep no-deal on the table, so they then ordered Conservative MPs to vote against their own motion. That tactic failed. Government ministers defied those orders and there were claims Mrs May had lost control of her party. The updated motion, to reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances, was passed by 321 to 278, a majority of 43. However, Wednesday's no-deal vote is not binding - under current law the UK could still leave without a deal on 29 March, unless an extension is agreed with the EU. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Speaking after the result of the vote was read out, Mrs May said: ""The options before us are the same as they always have been. ""The legal default in EU and UK law is that the UK will leave without a deal unless something else is agreed. The onus is now on every one of us in this House to find out what that is."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Parliament must now take control of the Brexit process and his party will work across the House of Commons to seek a compromise solution. On Thursday morning, European Council president Donald Tusk tweeted that he would ""appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it"".

BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said that before approving any extension to Article 50 - the legal instrument by which the UK will leave the EU - EU leaders would want to know ""how long an extension the UK requires and how it proposes to use the time"". A European Commission spokesperson said: ""There are only two ways to leave the EU: with or without a deal. The EU is prepared for both. ""To take no deal off the table, it is not enough to vote against no deal - you have to agree to a deal. ""We have agreed a deal with the prime minister and the EU is ready to sign it."" Thirteen government ministers - including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Business Secretary Greg Clark, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Scottish Secretary David Mundell - defied the government whips by abstaining in the vote. The papers: A 'no-no' to no-deal and May's final warning Work and pensions minister Sarah Newton voted against the orders of the whips and has now resigned. Mr Mundell said he backed the PM's deal and had always made clear his opposition to a no-deal Brexit. In a crisis there can be opportunity. This is now a crisis - the rules that traditionally have preserved governments are out of the window. The prime minister has been defeated again. Her authority - if not all gone - is in shreds. But for Number 10 there's an opportunity too, because MPs will soon be presented with a new choice - back the PM's deal, which has already been defeated twice, or accept the chance of a delay to Brexit. This isn't the choice of a government that's in control. But the tactic is to make the best of chaos. Read more from Laura here. MPs also voted by 374 to 164 to reject a plan to delay the UK's departure from the EU until 22 May 2019, so that there can be what its supporters call a ""managed no-deal"" Brexit. This amendment was known as the Malthouse Compromise - after Kit Malthouse, the government minister who devised it.

Crash plane's black boxes sent to ParisInvestigators in France are to analyse the crashed Ethiopian Airlines aircraft's flight and voice boxes.Business,"All Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 aircraft will remain grounded at least until May after the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said. The aircraft will not fly until a software update can be tested and installed, the US regulator said. Sunday's crash, shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa, killed 157 people from 35 nations. It was the second crash involving a 737 Max in six months. Some people have pointed to similarities between the incidents, with some experts citing satellite data and evidence from the crash scene as showing links between Sunday's disaster and October's crash in Indonesia of the Lion Air jet that killed 189 people. US Representative Rick Larsen said the software upgrade would take a few weeks to complete, and installing it on all the aircraft would take ""at least through April"". The FAA said on Wednesday that a software fix for the 737 Max that Boeing had been working on since the Lion Air crash would take months to complete. Meanwhile, investigators in France have taken charge of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines aircraft's black boxes as they attempt to uncover what caused the Boeing 737 Max disaster. The Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) received the flight data and cockpit voice recorders on Thursday. The first readings could take days, but a lot depends on the boxes' condition. Regulators across the world continue to ground the Boeing aircraft. On Thursday, Russia, Japan and Tunisia banned the jet from their airspace. Late on Wednesday, the FAA told the country's airlines to ground their fleets, but was criticised for not doing it sooner. Boeing grounded: What it means for air travel Ethiopian Airlines probe: What do we know? Boeing grounds entire crash aircraft fleet Ethiopian Airlines crash: Six charts on what we know Possible similarities between the accidents, focussing on the aircraft's anti-stall system, have shocked the aviation industry and raised questions over Boeing's, and the FAA's, insistence earlier this week the the Max 737 was safe to fly. In addition to Max aircraft in service, about another 5,000 are on order from airlines. Garuda Indonesia said there was a possibility it would cancel its 20-strong order for Max jets, depending on what the FAA does. This video can not be played Trump: Boeing 737 Max planes grounded A BEA spokesman said he did not know what condition the black boxes were in. ""First we will try to read the data,"" the spokesman said, adding that the first analyses could take between half a day and several days. There have been reports, including by Reuters, that there was a tussle over which safety authority would take the lead in examining the black boxes. Reports said Germany was initially asked to conduct the analysis because Ethiopian Airlines had been unhappy at the way the Paris-based organisation had investigated a crash in Lebanon in 2010. Britain and the US both have highly-respected crash investigation agencies. How long the analysis by the BEA will take depends on a number of things. First, the state of the recorders themselves. They are contained in very robust housings designed to withstand tremendous forces, and they are placed in the rear of the aircraft where they may be sheltered from the worst effects of an impact. Nevertheless, they can still be damaged, particularly by intense fire. The investigators will need to extract the memory modules, basically circuit boards covered with memory chips, and carry out any necessary repairs. The modules are designed so that information is spread across a series of chips. If one part is damaged, there should still be useable information elsewhere. Once downloaded, the data also has to be read. Surprisingly, it is not recorded in a standard form - so investigators will need to know how to make it useable. That will need input from the airline itself. If all goes well, the investigators will have access to thousands of pieces of data about the aircraft - not only what was going on on the fatal flight itself, but also on previous journeys. They will also be able to hear what was going on in the cockpit, what the pilots said to one another, and if any audible warnings were sounding. All of that should go a long way towards establishing the immediate causes of the accident - and finding out whether there really were common factors with the Lion Air crash.

Boeing grounds entire crash aircraft fleetThe US plane-maker suspends the 737 Max after investigators find new evidence at disaster site.Business,"This video can not be played Trump: Boeing 737 Max planes grounded Boeing has grounded its entire global fleet of 737 Max aircraft after investigators uncovered new evidence at the scene of the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash. The US plane-maker said it would suspend all 371 of the aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration said fresh evidence as well as newly refined satellite data prompted the decision to temporarily ban the jets. The FAA had previously held out while many countries banned the aircraft. All 157 passengers and crew died in Sunday's crash. Ethiopian Airlines said on Thursday that the black box flight recorders from the aircraft have been flown to Paris for analysis. ""An Ethiopian delegation led by Accident Investigation Bureau has flown the Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder to Paris, France for investigation,"" the airline wrote on Twitter. The FAA has a team investigating the disaster at the Ethiopian Airlines crash site working with the National Transportation Safety Board. Dan Elwell, acting administrator at the FAA, said on Wednesday: ""It became clear to all parties that the track of the Ethiopian Airlines [flight] was very close and behaved very similarly to the Lion Air flight.""

Boeing, the US plane manufacturer, said that it ""continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max"". However, it added that after consultation with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board it had decided to ground the flights ""out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft's safety"".

Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondent With other aviation authorities around the world deciding to ground the 737 Max, the FAA - which provides the safety certification for the new aircraft - was under intense pressure to fall into line. What's interesting here, though, is what the FAA has actually said. While the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, for example, said its actions were simply precautionary, the FAA has gone further. The US regulator, which is actually involved in the investigation, says it has made its decision as a result of new evidence collected at the site and analysed today - as well as satellite data. That will have set alarm bells ringing at Boeing's headquarters in Chicago. Since the accident, analysts have focused on similarities between Sunday's tragedy, and another crash involving a 737 Max off Indonesia last October. Has the FAA found evidence that suggests those similarities were more than just superficial? And does that mean Boeing's MCAS anti-stall system, already implicated in the Indonesia crash, may also have played a role in the latest disaster? Pilots in the US had complained late last year about problems controlling the Boeing 737 Max 8 during take-off. They reported difficulties similar to those that contributed to the fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October. The Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed minutes into its flight. Flightradar24, an air traffic monitor, said the plane's ""vertical speed was unstable after take-off"". Documents reveal that pilots flying last November reported engaging autopilot only for the aircraft's nose to pitch lower, prompting the warning system to exclaim: ""Don't sink! Don't sink!"" Two US pilots reported separate incidents involving the 737 Max's automatic anti-stalling system in November. The feature, which was new to the 737 Max family, is designed to keep the plane from stalling. The system prevents the aircraft from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. However, according to filings with the US Aviation Safety Reporting System, which pilots use to disclose information anonymously, it appeared to force the nose down. In both cases, pilots were forced to intervene to stop the plane from descending. After the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued a bulletin on what to do regarding erroneous readings from the sensor, which sends out information about what angle a plane is flying at.

God of War leads Bafta gaming nominationsBig budget games and independent titles will compete across a variety of categories at a ceremony in April.,"God of War, Red Dead Redemption 2, Return of the Obra Dinn and Florence lead the nominations at this year's Bafta 2019 games awards. God of War has been nominated for ten while Red Dead, Obra Dinn and Florence all pick up six. These four, plus Astro Bot: Rescue Mission and Assassin's Creed: Odyssey compete for the big award of best game. The category is a mix of big budget games and critically acclaimed indie titles. You've probably heard of some famous franchises but Florence, Return of Obra Dinn and Celeste (which has five nominations) will be unknown to some players. Florence is a puzzle game based on a relationship between a bored woman and a musician, which was created to be a violence-free alternative to aggressive games that dominate the mainstream.

Christopher Judge, Danielle Bisutti, Jeremy Daniels, Sunny Suljic will compete with Red Dead and Assassin's Creed actors for the performance prize. Christopher Judge, Danielle Bisutti, Jeremy Daniels are all nominated for their acting skills at the 2019 gaming BAFTAs In the evolving game category, online shooters Fortnite and Overwatch will compete against each other and Destiny 2, Elite Dangerous: Beyond, Sea of Thieves and Rainbow Six. Florence, Frostpunk, God of War, Marvel's Spider-Man, Red Dead Redemption and Return of the Obra Dinn are nominated for the best narrative award. Analysis by Steffan Powell, Radio 1 Newsbeat gaming reporter These nominations can be read in two ways. The first is that story-driven experiences are still very much alive, kicking and have a bright future. Games like God of War, Red Dead Redemption and Celeste lead the nominations. Despite the dominance of Fortnite and the Battle Royale genre this surely shows that audiences still crave games that take you on a journey - making you laugh, cry and jump along the way. Fortnite is the only Battle Royal game nominated in the best evolving game category - although with Apex Legends missing the nominations cut-off date, maybe next year will be different. The second way of interpreting the nominations is that there's a growing gulf between the members of the industry who decide the nominations, and the players themselves. Lots of independent games have nominations, but there's nothing for really popular titles like Call of Duty and Fifa - and Assassins Creed only has the one. Are they out of touch? The titles nominated in the best game category are genuinely deserving either way and, while it looks like a straight shoot-out between God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2 for the title, these awards are renowned for throwing up a surprising result.

Volkswagen boss apologises for Nazi pun,"Herbert Diess was put in charge of VW last year The chief executive of Volkswagen has apologised for evoking a Nazi slogan to describe the importance of boosting the group's profits. Herbert Diess used the line ""Ebit macht frei"" at a company event on Tuesday. The phrase echoes the maxim ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" - meaning ""work sets you free"" - which was famously emblazoned in wrought-iron on the gates of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Ebit is a commonly used acronym for ""earnings before interest and taxes"". The slogan ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" was placed at the entrances to a number of Nazi concentration camps In a statement, Mr Diess said he was sorry for what he described as ""definitely an unfortunate choice of words"". He explained that he was referring to the freedom afforded to VW brands in strong financial health, and added: ""At no time was it my intention for this statement to be placed in a false context. At the time, I simply did not think of this possibility."" The German chief executive also acknowledged his company's ""special responsibility in connection with the Third Reich"". Volkswagen: A brief history Auschwitz's sign of death and defiance,external Volkswagen was founded in 1937, as part of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's vision to enable German families to own their first car. During World War Two, the Wolfsburg-based firm manufactured vehicles for the German army, using more than 15,000 slave labourers from nearby concentration camps. The Nazi aim was that by saving a few marks a week, every German family would be able to afford to buy a car Although popularised by the Nazis, ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" was coined by the 19th Century linguist, ethnologist and author Lorenz Diefenbach. Politicians in the Weimar Republic in the 1920s used the phrase to promote employment policies. The inscription appeared at the Dachau concentration camp, set up by Heinrich Himmler in 1933 to use dissidents as slave labour, and later became part of the Nazis' deception for the real use of the concentrations camps. In a separate announcement prior to Mr Diess' remarks, Volkswagen said it would cut 7,000 jobs, as it shifts its focus to electric cars, which require fewer workers to build. Earlier this week, the company announced annual profits of â¬12bn (Â£10bn), despite having to pay out large sums to compensate for the Dieselgate emissions scandal.

"PM to bring third Brexit deal vote to MPsThe vote is due in the coming days, after MPs decide later whether to ask the EU to delay Brexit.UK Politics","This video can not be played How MPs rejected a no-deal Brexit Theresa May will make a third attempt to get her EU withdrawal deal through Parliament in the next week. She told MPs that if her deal fails again to get their backing, a lengthy delay to Brexit may be needed. The prime minister's warning comes ahead of a Commons vote later on whether to ask the EU for permission to delay Brexit beyond 29 March. MPs voted on Wednesday eveningto reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances. No date has yet been set for the third so-called ""meaningful vote"". Latest updates: Fallout from no-deal vote Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Four Brexits and a Divorce: What do MPs want? MPs will vote on a government motion which could see a delay to the UK's departure from the EU. The UK government said there could be a short delay until 30 June, if MPs approve Mrs May's deal by 20 March - the day before the next EU summit in Brussels. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that even if the UK is given until the end of June to pass the legislation required to leave the EU, the government will try to do that earlier, if Mrs May's deal is passed next week. Alternatively, there could be a much longer delay, requiring the UK to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May, the prime minister has said, in the event her deal is not approved. However, any length of extension has to be agreed by the EU. The DUP - which twice rejected Mrs May's deal in the Commons - isholding talks with the governmentto see if a solution could be found allowing its MPs to support the PM in a future vote. In a night of high drama on Wednesday, the Commons first voted on an amendment to reject the UK exiting the EU without a deal under any circumstances, by a margin of four. That meant the government's original motion - which had stated that the UK should not leave the EU without a deal on 29 March - was changed at the last minute. What is a no-deal Brexit? Brexitcast: Something has changed What Europe thinks of giving UK more time for Brexit How could Brexit be delayed? The government had wanted to keep control of the Brexit process, and keep no-deal on the table, so they then ordered Conservative MPs to vote against their own motion. That tactic failed. Government ministers defied those orders and there were claims Mrs May had lost control of her party. The updated motion, to reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances, was passed by 321 to 278, a majority of 43. However, Wednesday's no-deal vote is not binding - under current law the UK could still leave without a deal on 29 March, unless an extension is agreed with the EU. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Speaking after the result of the vote was read out, Mrs May said: ""The options before us are the same as they always have been. ""The legal default in EU and UK law is that the UK will leave without a deal unless something else is agreed. The onus is now on every one of us in this House to find out what that is."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Parliament must now take control of the Brexit process and his party will work across the House of Commons to seek a compromise solution. On Thursday morning, European Council president Donald Tusk tweeted that he would ""appeal to the EU27 to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it"".

BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said that before approving any extension to Article 50 - the legal instrument by which the UK will leave the EU - EU leaders would want to know ""how long an extension the UK requires and how it proposes to use the time"". A European Commission spokesperson said: ""There are only two ways to leave the EU: with or without a deal. The EU is prepared for both. ""To take no deal off the table, it is not enough to vote against no deal - you have to agree to a deal. ""We have agreed a deal with the prime minister and the EU is ready to sign it."" Thirteen government ministers - including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Business Secretary Greg Clark, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Scottish Secretary David Mundell - defied the government whips by abstaining in the vote. The papers: A 'no-no' to no-deal and May's final warning Work and pensions minister Sarah Newton voted against the orders of the whips and has now resigned. Mr Mundell said he backed the PM's deal and had always made clear his opposition to a no-deal Brexit. In a crisis there can be opportunity. This is now a crisis - the rules that traditionally have preserved governments are out of the window. The prime minister has been defeated again. Her authority - if not all gone - is in shreds. But for Number 10 there's an opportunity too, because MPs will soon be presented with a new choice - back the PM's deal, which has already been defeated twice, or accept the chance of a delay to Brexit. This isn't the choice of a government that's in control. But the tactic is to make the best of chaos. Read more from Laura here. MPs also voted by 374 to 164 to reject a plan to delay the UK's departure from the EU until 22 May 2019, so that there can be what its supporters call a ""managed no-deal"" Brexit. This amendment was known as the Malthouse Compromise - after Kit Malthouse, the government minister who devised it.

"Supercharge Superdry? No thanks, says firmClothing chain says its co-founders' plan to ""supercharge"" the company would be ""extremely damaging"".Business","Julian Dunkerton Superdry has rejected a business plan proposed by its co-founder Julian Dunkerton and urged shareholders not to allow him back on the board. Mr Dunkerton stepped down from the board a year ago since when the shares had lost 70% of their value. Now he has demanded to be reappointed and has published a plan -""Supercharging Superdry"",external. However,in a blunt statement,externalSuperdry said his return, 'in any capacity, would be extremely damaging'. Its official statement just released, says: ""The Board unanimously believes that Mr Dunkerton's return to the company, in any capacity, would be extremely damaging to the company and its prospects."" It adds the plan has ""no clear articulation of the proposed strategy or action plan"". The statement uses capital letters and underscoring to urge shareholders to ""VOTE AGAINST"" a motion at a general meeting on 2 April appointing Mr Dunkerton to the board along with Peter Williams, chairman of online retailer Boohoo. Mr Dunkerton and James Holder founded Superdry from a small stall in Cheltenham market 16 years ago. Mr Holder left the company in 2016 and Mr Dunkerton stepped down last year citing ""other demands on his time"", although more recently he blamed ""my fundamental disagreement"" with the company's strategy. Mr Dunkerton is the company's largest shareholder with 18%. He and Mr Holder have a combined stake of 28.5%. Since Mr Dunkerton's departure Superdry's fortunes have declined. In December it issued a profit warning, and this month the company announced it would cut up to 200 jobs. Don't come back, Superdry tells founder What went wrong at Superdry? Mr Dunkerton criticised the retailer's ""misguided strategy"" - including a reduction in stock both in stores and online - which he claimed he had always predicted would fail, and has set up a websiteSave Superdry,external. On it he launched his business plan saying Superdry had undergone a ""dramatic shift from being a design-led business with innovative creative input, a strong brand identity and an innate understanding of the customer, to follow a misguided consultant-led business model"" Superdry said that its fall in profits were due to unseasonably warm weather and tough competition from discounters. In his business plan Mr Dunkerton said ""The weather isn't the issue, the strategy is.""

"Right to Buy owners' ÃÂ£3m profit 'in weeks'One former council tenant bought their home for ÃÂ£8,000 and sold it on for ÃÂ£285,000 nine days later.UK","The Right-to-Buy policy has been blamed for contributing to the lack of affordable housing A total of 139 former council tenants bought their homes under Right to Buy and resold them within one month, the BBC found. Those resold homes created a Â£2.8m collective profit. Opponents of the scheme said too many people had profited from a policy that had ""much bigger social ambitions"". Supporters said Right to Buy helped people climb the housing ladder and secure their families' financial futures. The former tenants were allowed to buy their homes at prices below the market rate. However, those who sell within five years of purchasing, should have to pay back some or all of the discount they received. Repaid discounts, which are calculated on a sliding scale depending how long the purchaser kept their home, were not included in data the BBC obtained on 92,000 sales across the UK. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) said it was ""shocking to see the extent of the profit margin in black and white"". It called for Right to Buy to be suspended in England. In January it was halted in Wales, as it was in Scotland in 2016. Housing commentator Henry Pryor said: ""Far too many... simply profited from a scheme that had much bigger social ambitions."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The BBC's Shared Data Unit obtained and analysed data from HM Land Registry, the Registers of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Data for 92,000 comparable sales was published in Freedom of Information responses. The investigation found homes in Britain bought under the scheme had been sold on for Â£6.4bn in collective profit since 2000. Jane Thorp said people's experience of Right to Buy would be very different if they bought their houses and owned the freehold Jane Thorp bought her Brighton flat leasehold under Right to Buy in 1993 for Â£15,000 after she had been a tenant there for seven years. The grandmother of one said it was ""quite desirable for a council estate near the sea"". The former HR manager pays a monthly service charge to her council for repairs to her block and said she was sometimes charged ""a huge bill"" for major works such as new wall insulation. ""I think we have five non-resident landlords [who bought ex-Right to Buy homes] in this block. They're not rich people, they're just looking for a bit of income for their retirement. ""I wouldn't have been able to buy without Right to Buy. I was lucky, I still have equity. Some people are stuck there in perpetuity, because you can't downsize from a council flat."" Burglary death victim's 999 call released Stonehenge 'hub for massive parties' Mum of boy with cancer hails 'generosity' Kerry Devlin is buying the housing association home in Thrapston, Northamptonshire, where she has lived for 20 years - at a 50% discount. The care home assistant manager originally moved there as a single parent and has since married. The mother of one, aged 48, said: ""It's a way of securing our future. Otherwise [If I didn't have this discount] I would be pushed to my absolute [financial] limits."" ""It's just a shame more young people cannot go on this scheme. It would give them a huge step up because they're struggling to get on the housing ladder. ""I'm fortunate this opportunity has arisen."" Lola Hutcheson says she's among the ""hidden homeless"" because she is in the housing system seemingly with nowhere to go Lola Hutcheson is in emergency temporary accommodation in Fishponds, Bristol, after being evicted when she was not working in December. Now working as a locum for a charity to tackle rough sleeping, the 39-year-old said: ""It's quite stressful. ""We're lucky we haven't been moved more than once. ""I visit the HomeChoice website every week where they rent social homes and there are three or four each week. ""There are regularly 100 people in the queue bidding before me and I cannot see how many there are after me."" Margaret Thatcher personally handed over the first council house sold in 1980 Since October 1980, council tenants have been able to buy their homes at a discount, which now stands at a maximum of 70% - depending on the length of the tenancy - or Â£80,900 across England and Â£108,000 in London boroughs (whichever is lower). Then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it would pave the way for a ""property-owning democracy"". Some 2.6 million council homes have been sold in Great Britain since the policy came into effect. Former tenants who sold within the first 10 years of buying homes had to offer their council the chance to buy back the property first, the government highlighted. Across the UK, the devolved governments have adopted differing approaches to the policy in recent years. Between 2000 and 2018, some 53,000 homeowners made Â£5bn in profit, or Â£4.3bn in real terms. About one in 20 made a loss in real terms. The average time people kept their Right to Buy (RtB) home before selling it on was seven-and-a-half years. Twenty people bought and sold their RtB home again within one week. In England, the policy has been extended for housing association tenants to buy their homes at a discount ina few pilot areas. A final cut-off date for applications to buy under the policy across Wales expired on 26 January. Homeowners from 39,000 sales we analysed made Â£2.3bn in profit or Â£2.05bn in real terms. Some one in 50 sellers made a real terms loss. The average time someone kept their RtB home before selling it on was about five years and eight months. Seventeen people bought and sold their RtB house within one week, three of those did so on the same day - one at a Â£60,700 mark-up. The scheme was brought to an end in Scotland in 2016, a move Shelter Scotland greeted with a ""welcome obituary,external"". Northern Ireland does not record sales prices. Between 1982 and 2018, some 120,950 former social homes were sold including 500 homes with five or more bedrooms. Aconsultation on the future of House Sales Schemes,external, the equivalent of RtB in Northern Ireland, was launched in 2018. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said the scheme had ""stored up serious trouble for the future"". ""We're still building far fewer homes than we're selling off"", she said. Paul Dossett, head of local government at financial services firm Grant Thornton UK LLP, said the policy had been a ""disaster for the UK taxpayer"". The policy was ""unsustainable"" and he backed calls for councils to keep much more money from house sales, he said. Labour's housing spokesman on the London Assembly, Tom Copley AM, said he ""wouldn't begrudge anyone taking a decision in their own financial best interests"" but RtB's legacy was ""a massive transfer of wealth from the many to the few"". Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation, said it was working with ministers to develop ""safeguards to stop the loss of social housing"" by insisting on the replacement of a new affordable home for every property sold. Lord Heseltine, who wasthe Secretary of State for the Environment when the policy was introduced,external, declined to answer questions about its impact.

"Cancer wait times breached for 1,000 days","Lisa Pammen waited three months for bowel cancer treatment Lisa Pammen has spent most of her working life in the NHS - first as a paramedic and then as a manager of a group of GP practices. But when she really needed the NHS, it was not there for her. For 18 months, she struggled with abdominal pains - but despite visits to the GP and hospital, her cancer was not spotted. Only after the 49-year-old ended up in accident and emergency (A&E) was she diagnosed with late-stage bowel cancer, which had by then spread to her ovaries and abdomen. It took her three months to start treatment from the original GP referral - despite the fact the NHS is meant to do this within two months. Mrs Pammen, from York, said: ""I feel let down. ""It was extremely frustrating as I felt like I was left floundering for weeks and no-one was listening to me. ""I was in intense pain and had a family history of bowel cancer and yet it felt like these things were being ignored. ""I genuinely feel that because of these long referral times all my worry and anxieties were heightened, and it's made the treatment 10 times harder to deal with."" Sadly, the problems experienced by Mrs Pammen are not unique. Latest figures from the NHS in England show only half of patients are diagnosed at an early stage, while nearly one in four patients waits longer than they should for treatment to start - the worst performance since records began, in 2009.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Sara Hiom, of Cancer Research UK, said the whole system was being undermined by a lack of staff. ""The figures show an NHS under continued strain, with many patients still waiting too long to get a diagnosis and start treatment."" Pressure has been growing for some time. The target to see patients within two months has been missed for more than three years. In fact, this target has been met in only three months out of the past 60. And during that time, 130,000 patients have waited longer than they should have for their life-saving treatment. Dominic Bell, a manager at Macmillan Cancer Support's helpline, said it was as bad as he had known. ""I've worked on the support line for the last seven years and throughout that time we've taken more and more calls from people going out of their mind with worry while they wait for a diagnosis and treatment. ""Dealing with the prospect or the reality of a cancer diagnosis can be one of the most difficult experiences people will go through in their lifetime."" Other parts of the UK are also struggling. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all expect 95% of patients to be seen in 62 days. The last time any of those nations met the target was 2012. And, of course, the problems are not just confined to cancer. The latest figures show A&E performance has also dropped to its worst level. Under 85% of A&E patients were seen within four hours during February - well below the 95% target. Patricia Marquis, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""What's worrying about all the figures is that they come at a point when we haven't yet had severe weather in England, and flu and norovirus levels are low."" A spokesman for the NHS in England accepted there were challenges but said the increases in demand had been ""significant"". He said extra money was being invested in the health service in the coming years to provide more care to more people.

Knife offences at nine-year highThe figures show just over a third of the offences dealt with by the courts led to a jail sentence.UK,"This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? The number of crimes related to knives and other offensive weapons dealt with by the criminal justice system reached a nine-year high in 2018, figures show. The Ministry of Justice reported a total of 21,484 offences in England and Wales, the equivalent of 59 every single day. Of all those convicted or cautioned, just over a fifth were under 18. The figures show 37% of all offences led,externalto an immediate jail sentence, compared with 23% in 2009. Cautions and fines are only half as likely to be used now as they were in 2009. The average length of custodial sentences classed as ""immediate"" - therefore not including suspended sentences - was 8.1 months last year. That is the longest average term since comparable records began in 2008. The MoJ figures cover not just knives, but other offensive weapons such as deliberately broken bottles, sharpened screwdrivers, knuckle dusters and corrosive liquids. Motives and circumstances behind killings have varied - as have the age and gender of the victims. Faces of the dead: The UK's first 100 victims What is the punishment for carrying a knife? 10 charts that help explain the rise in knife crime The annual figures have been published following a spate of fatal stabbings, including the killings of three 17-year-olds in less than a week earlier this month. And it is a day afterpolice have been promised an extra Â£100mby the government to help them tackle a knife crime in England and Wales. The government has said offenders are now more likely to go to jail for knife or offensive weapons crimes. Seventeen-year-olds Jodie Chesney, Yousef Ghaleb Makki and Ayub Hassan were all stabbed to death Justice Minister Rory Stewart said: ""Knife crime destroys lives and shatters communities, and this government is doing everything in its power to tackle its devastating consequences. ""Sentences for those carrying knives are getting tougher - they are more likely to be sent straight to prison - and for longer - than at any time in the last decade."" Responding to the figures, Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""Surely the Tories don't need any further evidence that not enough is being done to tackle knife crime?"" She called on the government to ""stop talking"" about its approach to fighting knife crime and said it should instead ""properly"" fund the police and youth services. In Scotland, which has a separate legal system, the number of offences of handling offensive weaponsrecorded by Police Scotland,externalbetween April and September 2017 was 4,060 - nearly double the figure measured for the same period four years earlier. A separate report by the Scottish government,externallast year said the proportion of convictions resulting in a custodial sentence had ""generally fluctuated"" between 30% and 40% between 2007-08 and 2016-17. In Northern Ireland, the number of offences of handling offensive weaponsrecorded by Police Service Northern Ireland,externalbetween February 2017 and February 2018 was 970 - a rise of 9% on the previous year's figures. A separate government report published last year,externalsaid 20% of all convictions in Northern Ireland in 2017 that were related to possession of weapons resulted in imprisonment.

Innovation Minister Ivan McKee Innovation Minister Ivan McKee welcomes that everyone that took part in this debate were serious about Scotland's place in the space race. Mr McKee argues the people working on data science will get the biggest boost from the space sector in the coming decades. The minister reiterates numerous calls from MSPs to encourage young people into STEM subjects. He encourages the space industry to visit schools to facilitate this. Enterprise zones are being looked at, says the minister, but he does not commit to them at this stage. We aim to capture  Â£4bn via the space industry by 2030, he says. Tory MSP Gordon Lindhurst Tory MSP Gordon Lindhurst says the focus on space has become about much more than putting a man on the moon. It has been eye-opening to understand how ready Scotland is for going forward in this area, he tells the chamber. Mr Lindhurst highlights Edinburgh's place in the space sector due to its excellence in data science and geoscience. The Edinburgh city deal aims to train 100,000 data scientists and foster data start-up companies over the next 15 years he states. Labour MSP Rhoda Grant Labour MSP Rhoda Grant agrees with Mr Scott that there should be more than one launch site in Scotland. Ms Grant backs the Lib Dem amendment saying it is important to encourage all the areas of Scotland. She argues any local concerns about launch sites will soon be overcome. The Labour MSP goes on to argue young people must be encouraged to take up STEM subjects to provide the skills base the space industry requires. Elsewhere, theCommittee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints,externalhas been meeting in private since 3pm. As agreed, it returned to public to announce any decisions taken. Convener Linda Fabiani says the legal context, ministerial code and Scottish government harassment procedures were all discussed at the meeting in private. The committee is expecting a comprehensive response from the Scottish government shortly, following its letter which called for the government's full cooperation with the committee. It will next meet on 28 March, where it expects to be able to discuss said response, Ms Fabiani confirms. MSPs are to hold an inquiry which may focus on meetings between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond Lib Dem MSP Tavish Scott Lib Dem MSP Tavish Scott is back for the closing speeches, saying his concern is the competition across Europe, citing Portugal as a competitor. Mr Scott points out space can help get young girls and boys into STEM subjects. He argues there will be more than one launch one site in Scotland. The commercial market is the real bit that we want in Scotland, no matter where. A Glasgow company was commissioned to build Ukube-1 - Scotland's first satellite The Scottish space industry is big - and growing. While Scotland makes up less than 9% of the UK population it accounts for 18% of jobs in the UK space industry. More than 100 private and public organisations have created almost 7,000 jobs and are contributing more than Â£130m to the Scottish economy In the last two years Glasgow has built more satellites than any other city in Europe. Read more here. ""The space race is indeed on,"" begins Tavish Scott. However Scotland must win the race against other European countries, he adds. The Lib Dem MSP criticises HIE for not adopting a fair approach to all potential sites highlighting the benefits of a site in Shetland. All areas of space activity need government support, he adds citing his amendment. He argues HIE is running down Shetland, but the evidence is to the contrary, he says, again praising the Unst site. TheShetland Space Centre,externalplans to build and operate a satellite launch site in Unst, Shetland, the UKâs most northerly island. Unst is the best location in Northern Europe, the Shetland MSP argues. Dr Ross Donaldson hopes to achieve affordable, unhackable data worldwide A Scottish laboratory has begun work on the UK's first commercial receiver for unbreakably-coded communications from space. The team at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh is aiming to develop a satellite ground station for quantum communications. It could mean that every home will one day be able to receive messages that cannot be hacked. The field of quantum communications resembles a branch of cryptography. Read more here. Mr Stewart outlines key issues regarding a spaceport: ""It is vital Scotland does not miss this important opportunity."" The inspiration this can lead to could be worth far more educationally that it will be worth economically, he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scotland builds more spacecraft than anywhere else outside of California, Mr Mountain notes. The UK has the right business environment, industrial capability and geography to succeed he insists. The Tory MSP says the UK government's strategy includes a Â£50m programme to benefit space businesses. ""The economic potential is huge."" While Sutherland spaceport is just one small step for the space sector, it could be one giant leap for the Highlands and Islands economy, Mr Mountain suggests. Regarding the concerns expressed by locals, he calls for the planning decision to be made locally. Artwork: This is what a Scottish spaceport could look like in the early 2020s Last July we reported that a remote, boggy stretch of land on the north coast of Scotland was set to become the UK's first spaceport. The A'Mhoine Peninsula in Sutherland has been chosen as the most suitable place from which to launch rockets vertically to put satellites in orbit. The UK Space Agency is giving Highlands and Islands Enterprise Â£2.5m towards the development of the facility. Tory MSP Edward Mountain welcomes the debate agreeing Scotland is in a unique position to become a leading space nation. Mr Mountain is delighted that Sutherland will lead the way in becoming the UK's first spaceport. He argues all the sites that were considered in Scotland can reap the benefits of the space industry. The Tory MSP insists there are opportunities both in vertical and horizontal take off spaceports. Â© 2025 BBC.

Para commander stands by soldiers,"This video can not be played Lt Col Wilford:  ""We thought we were under attack"" As January 1972 dawned, the month forever associated with the tragedy of Bloody Sunday, Lt Col Derek Wilford commander of the 1st Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, was one of the British Army's rising stars. He was tough, outspoken and charismatic, adored by his men whom he adored in turn. But Wilford was no ordinary Para. He was an accomplished artist and used to read Virgil's Trojan War saga, The Aeneid, in the original Latin outside his tent. In Belfast, where Wilford's battalion was based, the Paras had a fearsome reputation, used by General Frank Kitson, the controversial guru of counter-insurgency operations, as shock troops to deal with trouble whenever and wherever it arose. The battalion's Support Company, consisting of some the regiment's toughest and most battle-hardened soldiers, including veterans of Aden, became known as ""Kitson's Private Army"". According to Lord Saville, who conductedthe 12 year inquiry into Bloody Sunday, Support Company was known for ""using excessive physical violence"". What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday victim awarded thousands The victims of Bloody Sunday Following internment without trial in August 1971, Wilford's battalion, along with other Paras, was sent to deal with serious rioting in west Belfast's Ballymurphy estate, then home to Gerry Adams, where the army had swooped to arrest and intern IRA suspects. The operation ended with 10 people dead. Local people said the victims were all innocent civilians. The long delayed inquest is currently being held in Belfast. Just over five months later, Col Wilford's battalion was deployed to Londonderry to crack down on rioters, known to the army as the 'Derry Young Hooligans', who, local traders said, were ruining their business and getting ever closer to the town centre. In response, General Robert Ford, the operational head of the army in Northern Ireland, travelled to Derry to listen to the businessmen's concerns. He was given an earful. The situation was getting ever more serious with the result that General Ford wrote a chilling memorandum to his superior, General Sir Harry Tuzo. It said: ""I am coming to the conclusion that the minimum force necessary to achieve a restoration of law and order is to shoot selected ringleaders amongst the DYH (Derry Young Hooligans) after clear warnings have been issued."" Although Ford wasn't issuing a 'shoot to kill' instruction, his words do indicate the increasingly fraught climate of the time with more soldiers and police officers now being killed after internment and the allegations of ""torture"" by Army interrogators that followed in its wake. ""Kitson's Private Army"" was called in. Soldiers on the ground in Derry in January 1972 Wilford had been outraged watching television images of soldiers in Derry being forced to retreat in the face of increasingly emboldened rioters. When I interviewed him on the 20th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in 1992, he told me, ""The soldiers just stood there like Aunt Sallysâ¦ I had actually said in public, my soldiers were not going to act as Aunt Sallys - ever."" With the emphasis on the ""ever"". Wilford was a man of his word. Given the tensions of the time, there was a certain inevitability that trouble would break out before and during the march that had been called to protest against internment. Thousands took part. But no-one envisaged that 13 men would end up dead on what became known as Bloody Sunday. The soldiers said they had come under attack and were returning fire. Many too were injured. Today, 47 years after the event, Derek Wilford still maintains that his men did not act improperly. Almost a decade after the Saville Report, does he accept what the inquiry said? ""No, I don't, because I was there,"" he said. ""We were under attack and we will actually remain convinced of that actually to the end of our days."" The victims, top row (l to r): Patrick Doherty, Gerald Donaghey, John Duddy, Hugh Gilmour, Michael Kelly, Michael McDaid and Kevin McElhinney. Bottom row : Bernard McGuigan, Gerard McKinney, William McKinney, William Nash, James Wray and John Young In my 1992 interview, Wilford described the option soldiers faced when they came under fire. ""You can run away - certainly my battalion would never run away - take cover behind your shields or do what my battalion was trained to do, to move forward and seek out the enemy."" Lord Saville makes it clear that the first shots were fired by the Paras, wounding Damien Donaghey who, according to Saville, was not posing any threat of death or injury. Shortly afterwards an Official IRA gunman fired a shot in their direction, it remains unclear whether that was in response to the Paras' first shots. After Support Company invaded the nationalist Bogside enclave into which the rioters had fled, now pursued by Wilford's soldiers, a Para officer fired a warning shot. Confusion and bloody chaos then reigned. It is possible that the Paras thought they were then coming under attack. Father Edward Daly who was an eye-witness on the ground, told me he saw a gunman against a wall and told him in unecclesiastical terms to get out. In the 30 minutes following Wilford's command to ""Move! Move! Move!"", Support Company had fired 108 rounds and made 30 arrests. I walked into the Bogside the following morning when the blood was still fresh on the ground and bunches of flowers had begun to appear where 13 men, young and old, had been shot dead the afternoon before. None of them had been carrying a firearm. I walked past the rubble of the barricade in Rossville Street in the vicinity of which six young men, mostly teenagers, were killed. One of them was John Kelly's brother, Michael, 17, who had been shot dead. John Kelly's brother Michael was shot dead on Bloody Sunday John Kelly and families of other victims have fought incessantly for justice, culminating in the demand that soldiers be prosecuted for the killings. ""You can't draw a line under murder,"" said John. ""Justice has to be seen to be done, no matter how long ago it is."" Bloody Sunday has taken its own toll on Derek Wilford, debilitated by Parkinson's disease and age. Climbing the stairs, too narrow for his Zimmer frame, to his artist's studio, is a struggle. The multitude of paintings in oil and watercolour, of landscapes and portraits, are testimony to his more energetic and creative days. Now he can't even hold a paintbrush. He showed me his farewell present, a Parachute Regiment painted drum, resting on three rifle butts. But he remains steadfastly defiant, standing by his men until the end. He is appalled at the possibility of his soldiers facing prosecution. ""I don't believe they were capable of that sort of indiscriminate shooting and killing,"" he said. ""We were betrayed and bringing charges against soldiers is part of that betrayal."" Would he apologise to the families of the victims? ""I said that at the time and I've said it subsequently, he replied. ""I see no point in repeating it because whatever I say will be discounted."" I finally asked what Bloody Sunday had done to him. ""I think it destroyed my world,"" he sighed. In a far more direct way, it also destroyed the world of the families whose loved ones were killed and wounded by his soldiers.

Bloody Sunday decision reaction,"After skirmishes between youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests Bloody Sunday was the name given to Sunday 30 January 1972 after paratroopers opened fire on a civil rights march in Londonderry, killing 13 people and wounding 15. Forty-seven years later, prosecutors have announced one former soldier - Soldier F - has been charged with the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. He has also been charged with the attempted murder of four other men on the day. Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Herron said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute 16 other former soldiers and two former Official IRA members involved on the day. Here is some of the reaction to that decision: ""I'm relieved that that's happening obviously as we've been fighting for 47 years. ""But I'm very saddened for the other Bloody Sunday families who have not got justice here today and whose hearts must be broken and sore now. ""It's been a sad day, but one obviously that the Wray family are relieved [to see] in relation to our deceased brother. ""There are a lot of sad, sad and heartbroken people today."" ""We are indebted to those who served with courage and distinction to bring peace to Northern Ireland, and I have the deepest sympathy for the suffering of the families of those who were killed on Bloody Sunday and all those who lost loved ones during the Troubles. ""Everyone agrees that the current process for investigating the past in Northern Ireland needs to be reformed. That is why we need to get the institutions to investigate the past set up quickly and completed as soon as possible. ""We will set out how we intend to move forward shortly. ""As this is now an ongoing legal matter, it would be inappropriate to comment further."" ""I'm feeling devastated. ""I just feel let down by a law and a justice system that's supposed to protect people and bring anybody to book for crimes they've committed in the past - and it's just not happened. ""The most difficult thing I had to do today was to call my children and tell them that there are no prosecutions for their granda and uncle."" ""We are indebted to those soldiers who served with courage and distinction to bring peace to Northern Ireland. ""The welfare of our former service personnel is of the utmost importance and we will offer full legal and pastoral support to the individual affected by today's decision. ""This includes funding all his legal costs and providing welfare support."" ""It's very one-sided. ""No soldier should be charged. It happened 47 years ago, a line in the sand needs to be drawn and people need to move on. ""Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, veterans are being left open to prosecution while terrorists have been cleansed of their past crimes."" ""We've had a terrible disappointment. ""We have walked a long journey since our fathers and brothers were brutally slaughtered on the streets of Derry on Bloody Sunday. ""Over that passage of time all the parents of the deceased have died - we are here to take their place. ""The Bloody Sunday families are not finished yet."" ""Everyone deserves justice, including those whose loved ones were murdered by the British state."" He said it was ""disappointing"" for families who had not received news of prosecutions, adding: ""we are mindful of those families who received that news today, and believe me, there are many. ""For us here today it is important to point out that justice for one family is justice for all of us."" ""We have terrorists who are being treated better over their despicable actions. ""The very thought that one man now out of all of those involved - from politicians to generals to soldiers on the ground and of course those people who were provoking the situation on the other side - only one man is being held culpable for everything that happened pretty much. ""I suspect the real chances of a successful prosecution against this man is very low after almost half a century has passed."" ""While we as a group of families and individuals may have differing views on whether or not the soldiers who carried out the shootings should face jail, or how long they should spend in jail, we are all agreed that they should face the due process of the law. ""And they should do so in public. ""The very few British soldiers that were charged during the conflict here were named, and the same should apply to those being charged now. ""Killers should not benefit from anonymity."" ""When events which occurred on what became known as Bloody Sunday are focused upon, they are taken in isolation from what occurred in the days leading up to 30th January. ""The Saville Report ignored those events, including the murder of two RUC officers Sgt Peter Gilgun and Constable David Montgomery, gunned down by a Provisional IRA sub-machine gun in the vicinity of the march just three days beforehand. ""There is still a disproportionate focus on the small proportion of the 10% of deaths attributed to those who were attempting to serve the community in difficult and often very dangerous situations."" ""It's a victory for the families and a victory for them is a victory for us also. ""I'm a bit disappointed that just one soldier was charged. ""But I don't think the fight is over, I would hope the fight is not over, for families like ourselves [the Ballymurphy families], we are here today in solidarity with the Bloody Sunday families like they have supported us for many many years."" ""There is of course huge disappointment that only one former soldier has been charged with two counts of murder and four attempted murders. ""But even the fact that one former soldier is to face trial is a significant achievement. ""I also commend the dignity and solidarity shown by the families today in response to the decision. As they said themselves, justice for one family, is justice for them all."" ""This campaign for truth, justice and accountability has been met with prevarication, equivocation and obstruction at every level. ""In sharp contrast, the unshakeable dignity and solidarity of the families has been immense. ""I welcome the decision to prosecute Soldier F. The absence of prosecution for others is not, however, a vindication of their actions. They remain unjustified and unjustifiable."" ""An abject failure to govern and legislate, on our watch as a Conservative administration. ""When I speak of a chasm between those who serve and their political masters in this country, I mean this."" ""Every civilian who died or was injured on Bloody Sunday was an innocent victim who posed no danger to anyone. ""My thoughts are with all of their families right now. ""A decision has been made today to pursue a prosecution and it is very important that no one prejudice that process."" ""It's a very bittersweet day for our clients. I have five families who got great news today, I have 17 families who got crushing news today. ""They are very clear legal avenues that are open. ""What we do now is submit further submissions and ask for the decisions not to prosecute to be reviewed. ""If the reasons given by the Public Prosecution Service do not withstand proper legal or judicial scrutiny we then challenge by way of judicial review in the High Court."" ""What we also need to learn today is that the criminal justice system is not the place to deal with legacy. ""This is another confirmation of that which we have known, but which we have failed to grasp and which we fail to tackle. ""Every time that people end up in the judicial process it's about innocence and guilt and it's very difficult to do guilt 45 years on."" ""The PSNI looked at the evidence, passed it to the PPS and they decided - based on the evidence - to prosecute one former soldier. ""This is the law, it must be respected by all and it is now for the Courts to decide. ""I have long said nobody is above the law and nobody should be held to a greater or lesser standard than anyone else. ""My thoughts remain with the families of all the innocent victims of the Troubles."" ""In emotional terms this is not the end of it, that's certainly true. ""You would only have to be here and see the distress of some of the Bloody Sunday families. ""Legally we haven't entirely run out of road yet, politically of course, many people including myself have been pointing out that the only people being considered for charges were lower ranked soldiers."" ""I think it would be nice for everybody if we started to hear about some of the IRA terrorist cases being reopened and some of them being put on trial. ""It's very important that if we're going to have a process like this, that IRA men are also investigated and where necessary, where there is the evidence, prosecuted as well. ""It would be quite wrong simply to prosecute those who served."" ""We'll make a decision on where we go from here and take advice on what further courses of action are available to us, if any. ""There won't be any hasty decisions. ""We're absolutely delighted for the families who have achieved a degree of satisfaction with the prosecution and we'll look forward to supporting them through that and we'll see where it goes from here."" ""In this case, this man went out to serve his country a very long time ago. ""Mistakes were made, clearly, possibly by him, mistakes were made by his superiors, but they were mistakes. ""They were not acts of deliberation and I think people should bear that in mind and he shouldn't go to court for that reason."" ""In 1972 we also had Bloody Friday, but IRA murders don't count it seems when it comes to this distorted dealing with the past. ""The pursuit of soldiers while terrorists continue to go scot-free is now very much part of the rewrite of history so promoted by IRA/Sinn FÃ©in."" ""It's absolutely disgraceful. I did two emergency tours in Londonderry and south Armagh and there were procedures in place to deal with any wrongdoing."" What happened on Bloody Sunday?

The sole prosecution is seen as a ""terrible disappointment"" by some of the families of the 13 people killed. They were shot dead at a civil rights march on 30 January 1972.

Legacy issues, as they are termed, can poison the present day and they have been allowed to fester. Bloody Sunday has fed into the ongoing debate, with the government considering legislation as part of its next steps.

This is the bigger picture against the backdrop of the Bloody Sunday decisions, significant as they are in their own right. The intention to charge a former soldier has clawed at emotions not just in Derry, but among bereaved families and victims in thousands of other Troubles cases left pondering truth and justice. The case could come before a court for a preliminary hearing quite quickly, says the legal expert, Joshua Rozenberg. He expects Soldier F to be brought before a court in Northern Ireland and to be named. UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government would offer full legal support to Soldier F - including paying his legal costs and providing welfare support. ""We are indebted to those soldiers who served with courage and distinction to bring peace to Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The welfare of our former service personnel is of the utmost importance."" He said the the Ministry of Defence is working ""to drive through a new package of safeguards to ensure our armed forces are not unfairly treated."" ""And the Government will urgently reform the system for dealing with legacy issues,"" he said. ""Our serving and former personnel cannot live in constant fear of prosecution."" Following Mr Williamson's statement, lawyers acting on behalf of the family of William Nash said they had contacted the Northern Ireland attorney general accusing the defence secretary of contempt of court.

The prime minister at the time of the report's publication, David Cameron, apologised for the soldiers' conduct, saying the killings were unjustified and unjustifiable, A police investigation into Bloody Sunday followed Lord Saville's 12-year, Â£200m public inquiry.

"Kuenssberg: 'In crisis, opportunity'","In a crisis there can be opportunity. This is now a crisis - the rules that traditionally have preserved governments are out of the window. The prime minister has been defeated again. Her authority - if not all gone - is in shreds. But for Number 10 there's an opportunity too, because MPs will soon be presented with a new choice - back the PM's deal, which has already been defeated twice, or accept the chance of a delay to Brexit. This isn't the choice of a government that's in control. But the tactic is to make the best of chaos. To use nerves among Brexiteers to shove them towards accepting Theresa May's deal in the absence of another solution with no other agreed alternative - yet. MPs reject any no-deal option in two votes May: MPs 'need to face up to consequences of their decisions' Corbyn: Extending Article 50 is 'now inevitable' The prime minister is beginning another day not sure of where it will end. MPs are bristling to push their own different solutions - none of which she or Parliament as a whole, let alone the public, is ready to accept. Yet even if this pandemonium strangely leads the way to order, to a smooth departure from the European Union, there's a different question: could a functioning administration ever again exist under the present cast?

What happened on Bloody Sunday?,"Thirteen people were killed and 15 wounded on Bloody Sunday Thirteen people were shot dead and at least 15 others injured when members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in the Bogside - a predominantly Catholic part of Londonderry - on Sunday 30 January 1972. The day became known as Bloody Sunday. It is widely regarded as one of the darkest days of the Northern IrelandTroubles. About 15,000 people gathered in the Creggan area of Derry on the morning of 30 January 1972 to take part in a civil rights march. Five months earlier, in August 1971 and against a backdrop of escalating violence and increased bombings in Northern Ireland, a new law was introduced giving the authorities the power to imprison people without trial - internment. The government had decided it was the only way it could restore order. Thousands gathered in Derry on that January day for a rally organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to protest at internment. The Stormont government had banned such protests. Troops were deployed to police the march. 5 Oct 1968 - the day the Troubles began? The march began shortly after 15:00 GMT and the intended destination was the city centre. However, Army barricades blocked marchers. The majority of demonstrators were instead directed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. Many demonstrators marched towards Free Derry Corner After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00 GMT, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. Two men were shot and wounded. At 16:07 GMT, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10 GMT, soldiers began to open fire. According to Army evidence, 21 soldiers fired their weapons, discharging 108 live rounds between them. The shootings led to widespread anger in Derry and further afield. The British Embassy in Dublin was burned to the ground by an angry crowd. The day after Bloody Sunday the government announced there would be an inquiry led by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery. The victims, top row (l to r): Patrick Doherty, Gerald Donaghey, John Duddy, Hugh Gilmour, Michael Kelly, Michael McDaid and Kevin McElhinney. Bottom row : Bernard McGuigan, Gerard McKinney, William McKinney, William Nash, James Wray and John Young The Widgery Tribunal largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame, although he described the soldiers' shooting as ""bordering on the reckless"". It was derided as a whitewash by the victims' families, who spent years campaigning for a fresh public inquiry. Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that a new inquiry would be held, headed by judge Lord Saville. It was set up in 1998 and reported back in 2010, becoming the longest-running inquiry in British legal history and costing about Â£200m. The inquiry found that none of the casualties were posing a threat or doing anything that would justify their shooting. It said no warning was given to any civilians before the soldiers opened fire and that none of the soldiers fired in response to attacks by petrol bombers or stone throwers. Saville found there was ""some firing by republican paramilitaries"" but that on balance the Army fired first. Prime Minister David Cameron said the killings were ""unjustified and unjustifiable"". Derry's Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation after the Saville report was released. It took a number of years to complete and detectives thensubmitted their files to the Public Prosecution Servicetowards the end of 2016. Having weighed up 125,000 pages of material, prosecutors said on 14 March that they will prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. He had also faced charges for the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). In a statement, the PPS said after ""careful consideration"" the decision had been taken due to another recent court ruling which found evidence being relied upon in the prosecutionof Soldier A and Soldier C for the killing of Joe McCannwas inadmissible. This was due to the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by the brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims.

Soldiers await Bloody Sunday decision,"James Wray and William McKinney were among 13 people shot dead at a civil rights march A former British soldier faces murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. The sole prosecution is seen as a ""terrible disappointment"" by some of the families of the 13 people killed. They were shot dead at a civil rights march on 30 January 1972. The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Bloody Sunday decision reaction What next after Bloody Sunday charges?

On the same day as the funerals were held for 11 of the Bloody Sunday victims, the British Embassy in Dublin was burned to the ground by an angry crowd. Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. BBC News NI's Home Affairs Correspondent Julian O'Neill said it could be a ""period of months"" before Soldier F makes his first court appearance. The former paratrooper is being referred to only as Soldier F because all military witnesses were granted anonymity through the Saville Inquiry into the circumstances around the killings. The PPS said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute 16 other soldiers and two Official IRA men. James Wray's brother Liam said he was ""very saddened for the other families"" of those killed on Bloody Sunday. ""Their hearts must be broken,"" he said. ""It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved."" He added: ""There are a lot of sad and heartbroken people today."" A number of relatives of those killed walked to Derry city centre ahead of the PPS decision. William McKinney's brother Michael said it was ""disappointing"" for families who had not received news of prosecutions. Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: ""It has been a long road for the families... and today will be another extremely difficult day for many of them.

His assertion that there were ""gunmen and bombers killed"" was rejected in Lord Saville's report. The Saville Inquiry stated that there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot father-of-six Paddy Doherty, who was unarmed. Saville also found there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot an unarmed Bernard McGuigan on Bloody Sunday as he went to the aid of Patrick Doherty, waving a white handkerchief. At the Saville Inquiry, Soldier F admitted he had shot 17-year-old Michael Kelly - but he said that he had only fired at people with bombs or weapons. However, Saville concluded Mr Kelly was unarmed. The Saville Inquiry found that both William McKinney and James Wray could have been shot by Soldier F and three other soldiers. The inquiry report also stated Soldier F had changed his story over the years. Bloody Sunday gained notoriety around the world, partly due to the image of a Catholic priest waving a bloodstained handkerchief as he tried to help a victim Mr Herron said the decisions to prosecute announced on Thursday ""relate only to allegations of criminal conduct on Bloody Sunday itself"". ""Consideration will now be given to allegations of perjury in respect of those suspects reported by police,"" he said. by Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent Bloody Sunday might have happened 47 years ago, but it has cast a very long shadow, extending far beyond victims' families and those involved.

Right to Buy owners' ÃÂ£3m profit 'in weeks',"The Right-to-Buy policy has been blamed for contributing to the lack of affordable housing A total of 139 former council tenants bought their homes under Right to Buy and resold them within one month, the BBC found. Those resold homes created a Â£2.8m collective profit. Opponents of the scheme said too many people had profited from a policy that had ""much bigger social ambitions"". Supporters said Right to Buy helped people climb the housing ladder and secure their families' financial futures. The former tenants were allowed to buy their homes at prices below the market rate. However, those who sell within five years of purchasing, should have to pay back some or all of the discount they received. Repaid discounts, which are calculated on a sliding scale depending how long the purchaser kept their home, were not included in data the BBC obtained on 92,000 sales across the UK. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) said it was ""shocking to see the extent of the profit margin in black and white"". It called for Right to Buy to be suspended in England. In January it was halted in Wales, as it was in Scotland in 2016. Housing commentator Henry Pryor said: ""Far too many... simply profited from a scheme that had much bigger social ambitions."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The BBC's Shared Data Unit obtained and analysed data from HM Land Registry, the Registers of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Data for 92,000 comparable sales was published in Freedom of Information responses. The investigation found homes in Britain bought under the scheme had been sold on for Â£6.4bn in collective profit since 2000. Jane Thorp said people's experience of Right to Buy would be very different if they bought their houses and owned the freehold Jane Thorp bought her Brighton flat leasehold under Right to Buy in 1993 for Â£15,000 after she had been a tenant there for seven years. The grandmother of one said it was ""quite desirable for a council estate near the sea"". The former HR manager pays a monthly service charge to her council for repairs to her block and said she was sometimes charged ""a huge bill"" for major works such as new wall insulation. ""I think we have five non-resident landlords [who bought ex-Right to Buy homes] in this block. They're not rich people, they're just looking for a bit of income for their retirement. ""I wouldn't have been able to buy without Right to Buy. I was lucky, I still have equity. Some people are stuck there in perpetuity, because you can't downsize from a council flat."" Burglary death victim's 999 call released Stonehenge 'hub for massive parties' Mum of boy with cancer hails 'generosity' Kerry Devlin is buying the housing association home in Thrapston, Northamptonshire, where she has lived for 20 years - at a 50% discount. The care home assistant manager originally moved there as a single parent and has since married. The mother of one, aged 48, said: ""It's a way of securing our future. Otherwise [If I didn't have this discount] I would be pushed to my absolute [financial] limits."" ""It's just a shame more young people cannot go on this scheme. It would give them a huge step up because they're struggling to get on the housing ladder. ""I'm fortunate this opportunity has arisen."" Lola Hutcheson says she's among the ""hidden homeless"" because she is in the housing system seemingly with nowhere to go Lola Hutcheson is in emergency temporary accommodation in Fishponds, Bristol, after being evicted when she was not working in December. Now working as a locum for a charity to tackle rough sleeping, the 39-year-old said: ""It's quite stressful. ""We're lucky we haven't been moved more than once. ""I visit the HomeChoice website every week where they rent social homes and there are three or four each week. ""There are regularly 100 people in the queue bidding before me and I cannot see how many there are after me."" Margaret Thatcher personally handed over the first council house sold in 1980 Since October 1980, council tenants have been able to buy their homes at a discount, which now stands at a maximum of 70% - depending on the length of the tenancy - or Â£80,900 across England and Â£108,000 in London boroughs (whichever is lower). Then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it would pave the way for a ""property-owning democracy"". Some 2.6 million council homes have been sold in Great Britain since the policy came into effect. Former tenants who sold within the first 10 years of buying homes had to offer their council the chance to buy back the property first, the government highlighted. Across the UK, the devolved governments have adopted differing approaches to the policy in recent years. Between 2000 and 2018, some 53,000 homeowners made Â£5bn in profit, or Â£4.3bn in real terms. About one in 20 made a loss in real terms. The average time people kept their Right to Buy (RtB) home before selling it on was seven-and-a-half years. Twenty people bought and sold their RtB home again within one week. In England, the policy has been extended for housing association tenants to buy their homes at a discount ina few pilot areas. A final cut-off date for applications to buy under the policy across Wales expired on 26 January. Homeowners from 39,000 sales we analysed made Â£2.3bn in profit or Â£2.05bn in real terms. Some one in 50 sellers made a real terms loss. The average time someone kept their RtB home before selling it on was about five years and eight months. Seventeen people bought and sold their RtB house within one week, three of those did so on the same day - one at a Â£60,700 mark-up. The scheme was brought to an end in Scotland in 2016, a move Shelter Scotland greeted with a ""welcome obituary,external"". Northern Ireland does not record sales prices. Between 1982 and 2018, some 120,950 former social homes were sold including 500 homes with five or more bedrooms. Aconsultation on the future of House Sales Schemes,external, the equivalent of RtB in Northern Ireland, was launched in 2018. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said the scheme had ""stored up serious trouble for the future"". ""We're still building far fewer homes than we're selling off"", she said. Paul Dossett, head of local government at financial services firm Grant Thornton UK LLP, said the policy had been a ""disaster for the UK taxpayer"". The policy was ""unsustainable"" and he backed calls for councils to keep much more money from house sales, he said. Labour's housing spokesman on the London Assembly, Tom Copley AM, said he ""wouldn't begrudge anyone taking a decision in their own financial best interests"" but RtB's legacy was ""a massive transfer of wealth from the many to the few"". Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation, said it was working with ministers to develop ""safeguards to stop the loss of social housing"" by insisting on the replacement of a new affordable home for every property sold. Lord Heseltine, who wasthe Secretary of State for the Environment when the policy was introduced,external, declined to answer questions about its impact. England's Minister of State for Housing Kit Malthouse MP said the policy had helped people ""achieve their dream of home ownership"".

Woman breaks pi world record,"Emma Haruka Iwao The value of the number pi has been calculated to a new world record length of 31 trillion digits, far past the previous record of 22 trillion. Emma Haruka Iwao, a Google employee from Japan, found the new digits with the help of the company's cloud computing service. Pi is the number you get when you divide a circle's circumference by its diameter. The first digits, 3.14, are well known but the number is infinitely long. Extending the known sequence of digits in pi is very difficult because the number follows no set pattern. Pi is used in engineering, physics, supercomputing and space exploration - because its value can be used incalculations for waves,external, circles and cylinders. The pursuit of longer versions of pi is a long-standing pastime among mathematicians. And Ms Iwao said she had been fascinated by the number since she had been a child. The calculation required 170TB of data (for comparison, 200,000 music tracks take up 1TB) and took 25 virtual machines 121 days to complete. US beats China in supercomputer list The race to make the world's most powerful computer ever Coding the future:  What will the future of computing look like? The symbol for pi is also the 16th letter in the Greek alphabet ""I feel very surprised,"" Ms Iwao, who has worked at Google for the past three years, said of her achievement. ""I am still trying to adjust to the reality. The world record has been really hard."" But she still hopes to expand on her work. ""There is no end with pi, I would love to try with more digits,"" she told BBC News. It would take 332,064 years to say the 31.4 trillion digit number. Google announced the news in a blog on Pi Day (14 March - ""3.14"" in American date notation). Nasa has previously publisheda list of some of the ways in which it uses pi,external. These include: calculating the size of a parachute required to send a rover down on to the surface of Mars working out how many rectangular camera images will be needed to map the surface of a planet getting spacecraft to brake at just the right time to enter orbit around planets ""Pi is useful not only for measuring circles but it also appears in calculations for everything from the period of a pendulum to the buckling force of a beam,"" said mathematician Matt Parker. ""Modern maths, physics, engineering and technology could not function without pi."" In 2010, Nicholas Sze used Yahoo cloud computing tocalculate that the two quadrillionth digit of Pi was zero- a calculation that would have taken 500 years on a standard computer at that time. However, he did not calculate all the digits in between. 78,000 x 550? This boy knows the answer. Video, 00:00:5978,000 x 550?

Shell chief's pay doubles to ÃÂ£17mBen van Beurden's ÃÂ£17m pay is now 143 times larger than the average Shell employee in the UK.Business,"Mr van Beurden became chief executive of Shell in 2014 The chief executive of oil-company Shell saw his pay more than double last year to more than â¬20m (Â£17m). Ben van Beurden's total salary in 2017, which was approximately â¬9m, prompted a shareholder revolt. The raise comes as the company increased its annual profits by almost $10bn and is largely down to long-term incentives kicking in.

Facebook suffers most severe outage ever,"The Facebook ""family"" of apps was suffering issues, the company confirmed Facebook appears to be recovering from a more than 14-hour disruption to all of its products that left them mostly inaccessible across the world. The company's main social network, its two messaging apps and image-sharing site Instagram were all affected. Facebook has yet to offer an explanation for the outage. The last time Facebook had a disruption of this magnitude was in 2008, when the site had 150m users - compared with around 2.3bn monthly users today. The problems began yesterday afternoon, and only showed real signs of recovery this morning. They meant core platforms many people rely on every day to communicate were rendered mostly useless. ""We're aware that some people are currently having trouble accessing the Facebook family of apps,"" Facebook said in a statement, posted on Twitter. Facebook outages hit business owners ""We're working to resolve the issue as soon as possible."" Facebook's apps seemed to be recovering on Thursday morning, withInstagram announcing it was back,external. In response to rumours posted on other social networks, the company said the outages were not a result of a Distributed Denial of Service attack, known as DDoS - a type of cyber-attack that involves flooding a target service with extremely high volumes of traffic. An NBC News broadcaster reported the cause was related to ""overloaded"" databases.,external Estimates suggest the issue began around 16:00 GMT on Wednesday. While Facebook's main service appeared to load, users reported not being able to post. Those on Instagram were not able to refresh feeds or post new material. Facebook Messenger's desktop version did not load - but the mobile app appeared to allow the sending of some messages; however, users reported glitches with other kinds of content, such as images. WhatsApp, Facebook's other messaging app, had similar problems. Athird-party outage map suggested the problem was global,external- DownDetector monitors posts on other social networks for users mentioning a loss of service elsewhere. According to the site, areas of Europe and Asia are still reporting problems as of Thursday morning. Ongoing issues are likely to hit Facebook hard in the wallet. The company, which funds the majority of its business through advertising revenue, told Bloomberg that it was investigating ""the possibility of refunds for advertisers"". The issue also affected Facebook Workplace, the service used by businesses to communicate internally. Buenos Aires-based designer Rebecca Brooker told the BBC the interruption was having a significant impact on her firm's work. ""Facebook for personal use is fine - but what happens when we rely on large companies such as this to provide business services?"" she said. ""I'm trying to communicate with my team in New York. Facebook Workplace is our only channel for [communication] with the exception of email."" In the UK, an NHS paediatric consultant told the BBC how staff were upset not to be kept updated on a party being held for a beloved nurse who was retiring after 20 years. ""Being a working day most consultants could not make it,"" said Dr Nikhil Ganjoo. ""So I represented them - but was unable to share the retirement party pics with them as it happened."" The outage occurred against a political backdrop of legislators in the US and beyond considering whether large technology firms - not just Facebook - should be broken up. Elizabeth Warren, who is hoping to be the Democratic candidate in the next US presidential election,told the New York Times,external: ""We need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favour and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.""

"Cancer wait times breached for 1,126 days","Lisa Pammen waited three months for bowel cancer treatment Lisa Pammen has spent most of her working life in the NHS - first as a paramedic and then as a manager of a group of GP practices. But when she really needed the NHS, it was not there for her. For 18 months, she struggled with abdominal pains - but despite visits to the GP and hospital, her cancer was not spotted. Only after the 49-year-old ended up in accident and emergency (A&E) was she diagnosed with late-stage bowel cancer, which had by then spread to her ovaries and abdomen. It took her three months to start treatment from the original GP referral - despite the fact the NHS is meant to do this within two months. Mrs Pammen, from York, said: ""I feel let down. ""It was extremely frustrating as I felt like I was left floundering for weeks and no-one was listening to me. ""I was in intense pain and had a family history of bowel cancer and yet it felt like these things were being ignored. ""I genuinely feel that because of these long referral times all my worry and anxieties were heightened, and it's made the treatment 10 times harder to deal with."" Sadly, the problems experienced by Mrs Pammen are not unique. Latest figures from the NHS in England show only half of patients are diagnosed at an early stage, while nearly one in four patients waits longer than they should for treatment to start - the worst performance since records began, in 2009.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Sara Hiom, of Cancer Research UK, said the whole system was being undermined by a lack of staff. ""The figures show an NHS under continued strain, with many patients still waiting too long to get a diagnosis and start treatment."" Pressure has been growing for some time. The target to see patients within two months has been missed for more than three years. In fact, this target has been met in only three months out of the past 60. And during that time, 130,000 patients have waited longer than they should have for their life-saving treatment. Dominic Bell, a manager at Macmillan Cancer Support's helpline, said it was as bad as he had known. ""I've worked on the support line for the last seven years and throughout that time we've taken more and more calls from people going out of their mind with worry while they wait for a diagnosis and treatment. ""Dealing with the prospect or the reality of a cancer diagnosis can be one of the most difficult experiences people will go through in their lifetime."" Other parts of the UK are also struggling. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all expect 95% of patients to be seen in 62 days. The last time any of those nations met the target was 2012. And, of course, the problems are not just confined to cancer. The latest figures show A&E performance has also dropped to its worst level. Under 85% of A&E patients were seen within four hours during February - well below the 95% target. Patricia Marquis, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""What's worrying about all the figures is that they come at a point when we haven't yet had severe weather in England, and flu and norovirus levels are low."" A spokesman for the NHS in England accepted there were challenges but said the increases in demand had been ""significant"". He said extra money was being invested in the health service in the coming years to provide more care to more people.

"Jaguar Land Rover recalls 44,000 cars","Jaguar Land Rover is recalling 44,000 cars in the UK over carbon dioxide emissions, the car maker has said. Regulators found 10 models were emitting more of the greenhouse gas than they had been certified to emit. The car maker will contact owners to arrange repairs, a JLR spokeswoman said. JLR is facing a number of challenges at the moment, including a slump in demand for diesel cars and a sales slowdown in China. The firm said it was a voluntary recall of certain 2016-2019 MY Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles fitted with two litre diesel or petrol engines. The affected models are: Some two-litre 2016 to 2018 Land Rover Discovery and Discovery Sport cars Certain two litre Range Rover Evoque, Sport, and Velar cars Jaguar E-Pace, F-Pace, F-Type, XE and XF cars. Most models are petrol, while some are diesel. Some of the models will need physical repairs in a dealership, while some will need software updates, the spokeswoman said. ""The modifications made to affected vehicles will be made free of charge and every effort will be made to minimise inconvenience to the customer during the short time required for the work to be carried out,"" the firm added. In January the firmconfirmed it is cutting 4,500 jobs, with the substantial majority coming from its 40,000 strong UK workforce. The firm has complained about uncertainty caused by Brexit. Emissions have come under more scrutiny since Volkswagen's diesel scandal. Investors are pursuing the German car giant for about about â¬9.2bn (Â£8.2bn) in damages, claiming the companyshould have come clean soonerabout falsifying emissions data.

It added that Shell believed in reward packages ""that are externally competitive and internally proportionate, meaning the chief executive is the employee with the highest proportion of variable pay as he has the highest level of responsibility"". A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) found that the average FTSE 100 chief executive earned 167 times more than the average UK worker. Shell is one of the world's largest polluters The Anglo-Dutch giant is the most valuable company listed in Britain. Despite its ambition to halve its carbon footprint by 2050, the firm is one of the world's largest polluters, emitting 73 million tonnes on carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2017. Last year, Shell announced it would link executive pay to carbon emission targets, subject to a shareholder vote in 2020. The move followed pressure from investors, including the Church of England Pensions Board. In Thursday's report the firm said it was bringing that forward by a year and executive pay would be linked to carbon emission targets ""with immediate effect"". Mr van Beurden's pay has long been a matter of controversy. Many shareholders questioned why Shell executives were paid bonuses for 2017, the year in which a tanker run by a sub-contractor in Pakistan exploded, and killed more than 200 people. Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre think tank, said Mr van Beurden's pay packet epitomised Shell's ""flawed governance model and warped corporate culture"". ""They think that prosperity is bestowed by a small elite at the top, and everyone else should be thankful for what little they get. In fact, business success is a much more collective endeavour, and should be reflected in more equal, proportionate pay practices."" Executive pay is a hotly debated topic in the UK.

US actress free on bail over college scam,"Lori Loughlin and her two daughters Olivia Jade Gianulli (L), and Isabella Gianulli (R) US actress Lori Loughlin, of the sitcom Full House, has been released after posting $1m bail over a college cheating scam. She appeared in court on Wednesday and was granted permission to travel to British Columbia for a film project. Ms Loughlin and fellow actress Felicity Huffman are among 50 people charged in an alleged criminal enterprise to get their children into top US colleges. Yale, Stanford and Georgetown were among the universities targeted. The colleges have not been accused of any wrongdoing and are investigating the matter internally. Authorities say Ms Loughlin and her husband, designer Mossimo Giannulli, paid $500,000 in bribes to have their two daughters admitted into the University of Southern California (USC) as fake rowing-team recruits. The accused parents - many of whom are celebrities or CEOs of major companies - allegedly paid a firm up to $6.5m (Â£4.9m) to cheat on students' college entrance exams or bribe top coaches to offer fake athletic scholarships for non-athletic students. Exams whizz at centre of US cheat scandal Lori Loughlin's daughters in spotlight The extreme lengths parents go to for college admissions Ms Loughlin has been charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Magistrate Judge Steve Kim ordered her to limit her travel to the US and Canada, where she had been filming for work before she was arrested on Wednesday morning. This video can not be played Students react to cheating scam: ""This is how we got into an elite college"" Mr Giannulli faced the same charges on Tuesday and was forced to put the family's house up as collateral to pay his $1m bond. Both their daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, are currently studying at USC and were admitted as rowing-team recruits - but neither actually participates in the sport. The sisters have not been charged. Fellow celebrity Ms Huffman - who allegedly paid $15,000 to participate in an exam cheating scam - was taken into FBI custody on Tuesday as well, and made to surrender her passport in court. This video can not be played The scheme involved creating fake sporting photographs, said US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew Lelling The Academy Award nominee was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. She was released on $250,000 bail. Her husband, actor William H Macy, accompanied her to court but has not been indicted in the investigation, dubbed Operation Varsity Blues. He was allegedly recorded discussing the plot, but Ms Huffman was the one who reportedly sent the emails organising the exam scheme for her eldest daughter. The ringleader, William ""Rick"" Singer, 58, is co-operating with the authorities. William H Macy, Felicity Huffman and the couple's two daughters at a 2014 movie premiere Singer pleaded guilty on Tuesday in Boston federal court to charges including racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. Authorities say the scam earned him $25m between 2011-18 through his firm Edge College & Career Network, At his sentencing in June, Mr Singer could receive a maximum of 65 years in prison and have to pay more than $1m in fines. In all, 33 parents were charged on Tuesday as well as 13 athletics coaches and associates of Mr Singer's business. Trump 'to scrap' college racial bias policy Wealthy students tighten university grip Fake US university exposes visa scheme One student apparently gloated about the exam cheating scam. Her parents are accused of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to arrange her admittance into Georgetown by bribing the tennis coach and cheating on tests. The scandal has also rekindled scrutiny over how Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, got into Harvard. Mr Kushner's father reportedly pledged $2.5m to the Ivy league college just before he was accepted. The children of wealthy Americans often win places in elite universities after their parents make generous donations, an entirely legal state of affairs. People were photographed climbing school walls to pass on answers to Indian students in 2015 In China, 2,440 pharmacists were accused of cheatingby using earpieces in a national licensing test in 2014, according to China's state TV. Exam cheating is widespread in India. In 2015, several hundred people were arrested in connection with mass school exam cheating in the state of Bihar. A year laterstudent Ruby Rai, who'd been ranked first in state exams, was arrestedand her results cancelled after video of a college interview she'd flunked went viral. This video can not be played The vest that helps exam cheats Last year, a Singaporean tutor admitted helping six Chinese students cheatin what prosecutors said was an elaborate plot. More students are cheating in GCSE and A-level exams in England, new figures showed last year. The number caught was up a quarter on the previous year. Most were penalised for taking mobile phones into the exam.

Cancer's 'internal wiring' predicts relapse risk,"The ""internal wiring"" of breast cancer can predict which women are more likely to survive or relapse, say researchers. The study shows that breast cancer is 11 separate diseases that each has a different risk of coming back. The hope is that the findings,in the journal Nature,,externalcould identify people needing closer monitoring and reassure others at low risk of recurrence. Cancer Research UK said that the work was ""incredibly encouraging"" but was not yet ready for widespread use. The scientists, at the University of Cambridge and Stanford University, looked in incredible detail at nearly 2,000 women's breast cancers. They went far beyond considering all breast cancers as a single disease and beyond modern medicine's way of classifying the tumours. Doctors currently classify breast cancers based on whether they respond to the hormone oestrogen or targeted therapies like Herceptin. The research team analysed the genetic mutations inside the tumour to create a new way of classifying them. Breast cancer is not one disease but 11, say researchers. Previous work by the group has shown breast cancer is 11 separate diseases, each with a different cause and needing different treatment. By following women for 20 years, they are now able to show which types of breast cancer are more likely to come back. Prof Carlos Caldas tod the BBC: ""This is really biology-driven, it's the molecular wiring of your tumour. ""Once and for all we need to stop talking about breast cancer as one disease, it's a constellation of 11 diseases. ""This is a very significant step to more precision-type medicine."" It showed that triple negative breast cancers - one of the hardest types to treat - were not all one class of cancer, but two. Prof Caldas said: ""One where if women have not relapsed by five years they are probably cured, but a second subgroup are still at significant risk of later relapse."" The research could help inform women of their future risk, but may also change the way their cancers are treated. There were four subgroups of breast cancer that were both driven by oestrogen and had a ""markedly increased"" risk of recurrence. These women may benefit from a longer course of hormone therapy drugs like tamoxifen. Cancer Research UK estimated that 12,300 women a year have such types of cancer in the UK. By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News Cancers tend to be named after the place you find them: breast, colon, prostate, lung - the list goes on. But it has long been known that this is not good enough. This study shows the future of personalised medicine and tailoring treatment to the specific causes of someone's cancer. Studies are already under way looking at which treatments may work best for different subtypes of breast cancer. And other research groups are trying to get a similar insight into other forms of cancer too. New era of personalised cancer drugs However, the way the scientists analysed and sorted the cancers is still too complicated to be introduced to the NHS. It will need refining into a form that could be used as a routine way of analysing a woman's cancer. Much larger studies involving up to 12,000 women are also planned, so that researchers can be certain of their results. Prof Caldas said: ""I would not recommend it clinically yet, but we really are committed to making this available. ""We are totally committed to having an NHS test, we haven't patented any of this."" Prof Karen Vousden, Cancer Research UK's chief scientist, said: ""We're still a way off being able to offer this type of detailed molecular testing to all women and we need more research to understand how we can tailor treatments to a patient's individual tumour biology. ""But this is incredibly encouraging progress.""

Tense wait for charges decision,"This video can not be played One of the British soldiers involved in Bloody Sunday says he has no regrets I was in Londonderry as a young journalist on the day that became known as ""Bloody Sunday"" in 1972, when soldiers of the Parachute Regiment shot dead 13 innocent civilians on a civil rights march against internment without trial. The families whose loved ones were killed or wounded have waited 47 years to see if there would be prosecutions. Now their wait is almost over. The decision will be announced next week. Only a handful of officials in the Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service (PPS) know what that decision will be. The PPS insists there have been - and will be - no leaks. Lord Saville's official inquiry into the killings, that took 12 years and cost more than Â£200m, concluded that all victims were innocent and posed no threat. BBC archive: Key findings of the 2010 Saville Report BBC Archive: The victims of Bloody Sunday The paratroopers, he said, lost their self-control and fired without discipline. His unequivocal conclusion led the then prime minister, David Cameron, to deliver a historic apology in the House of Commons and to the people of Derry. What happened onBloody Sunday, he said, was ""unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong"". But to many of the grieving families, the apology, though welcomed, did not represent closure. They fought on, believing that closure would only come when the soldiers responsible for the killings faced prosecution and the consequences. John Kelly, whose brother Michael was shot dead at a barricade in Rossville Street, told me: ""Murder is murder, no matter how long ago it is. Justice has to be seen to be done."" Although he probably reflects the feelings of most nationalists in Derry and beyond, it is not a universal reaction. Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday and a 14th victim died of his injuries months later Remarkably the wife and daughter of Gerry McKinney, who was killed by a single bullet - according to his widow Ida, ""with his hands in the air"" - do not seek retribution. I first interviewed Ida, now 80, more than 25 years ago. She described putting her fingers through the bullet holes in Gerry's coat, jacket and shirt. ""I've forgiven them all now,"" she told me. ""It took me a while. It's not in me to have hatred."" Her daughter Regina agrees: ""I refuse to let it dictate my life. I don't want to live with revenge. I don't want to live with hatred."" Thirteen people died and 15 were injured on the day after soldiers opened fire. All those years ago, I also interviewed a soldier known as Sergeant O who expressed not a scintilla of regret or remorse for what he and his comrades did. ""We were under fire. We started looking for targets and started dropping them. Shooting them. The mood between the blokes was not elation but a job well done."" I expressed incredulity. A job well done - with 13 dead? ""Yes, if somebody's firing at you and you fire back and you kill him, you've stopped him killing you. Is that not a job well done?"" Bloody Sunday has hung over Sergeant O as it has hung over victims' families, although for different reasons and with different emotions. ""Sergeant O"" spoke to Peter Taylor anonymously about his role in Bloody Sunday Meeting him again as the decision on prosecutions grew ever nearer, he remained consistent with what he had told me before - with one exception. Given that Lord Saville reported several years after I conducted the initial interview, did he now accept his finding that all the 13 dead were innocent? ""Obviously my view has altered because some innocent people were killed, I think that's beyond a doubt."" I pointed out that Lord Saville had said that all the victims were innocent. ""I don't care what Lord Saville said,"" he challenged. ""He wasn't there."" I asked if in the light of the inquiry's findings, it was still his view that it was a job well done. ""Yes,"" he said. Does he feel any guilt at what happened? ""No,"" he replied and said he would do exactly the same again. Gen Sir David Richards, a Northern Ireland veteran who rose to become the head of the UK's armed forces as chief of the defence staff, understands the pressures the paratroopers were under. Gen Sir David Richards (middle) photographed as a young soldier in Northern Ireland ""Bloody Sunday was part of a war. These are warriors, soldiers who are going into a situation uncertain of what may happen next. ""You might have a split second to take a decision to protect yourself and your comrades in arms."" Does he believe soldiers should be prosecuted? ""My instinct is that they shouldn't. [It's] time to put it behind us and move on for the sake of all communities and move on like they've done so successfully in countries like South Africa."" But moving on is not an option at this stage. Whatever the decision next week, the law will take its course.

MPs to vote on delaying Brexit,"This video can not be played How MPs rejected a no-deal Brexit Theresa May will make a third attempt to get her EU withdrawal deal through Parliament in the next week.

The prime minister's warning comes ahead of a Commons vote later on whether to ask the EU for permission to delay Brexit beyond 29 March.

Latest updates: Fallout from no-deal vote Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Four Brexits and a Divorce: What do MPs want? MPs will vote on a government motion which could see a delay to the UK's departure from the EU. The UK government said there could be a short delay until 30 June, if MPs approve Mrs May's deal by 20 March - the day before the next EU summit in Brussels. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that even if the UK is given until the end of June to pass the legislation required to leave the EU, the government will try to do that earlier, if Mrs May's deal is passed next week. Alternatively, there could be a much longer delay, requiring the UK to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May, the prime minister has said, in the event her deal is not approved. However, any length of extension has to be agreed by the EU. The DUP - which twice rejected Mrs May's deal in the Commons - isholding talks with the governmentto see if a solution could be found allowing its MPs to support the PM in a future vote.

MPs also voted by 374 to 164 to reject a plan to delay the UK's departure from the EU until 22 May 2019, so that there can be what its supporters call a ""managed no-deal"" Brexit. This amendment was known as the Malthouse Compromise - after Kit Malthouse, the government minister who devised it.

Tram scheme facing 'momentous day',"An artist's impression of the tram travelling on Leith's Constitution Street Edinburgh's tram line is to be extended from the city centre to Newhaven at a cost of up to Â£207m. Supporters of the plan to lengthen the tram line by 2.8 miles (4.6km) say it is needed to match the city's population growth. But funding concerns have been raised after it was revealedthe project's costs had jumped by 25%. Works should be completed by 2022 and the extended line should be operational in the first quarter of 2023. The project was approved after a vote at the full meeting of Edinburgh City Council. It will be funded through borrowing paid back by future tram fare revenues, along with a special Â£20m dividend from the city's public bus firm Lothian Buses. The original tram project came in at twice its original budget and the mistakes made on that scheme are subject to anongoing public inquiry. The tram route will be extended to Newhaven Edinburgh City Council's transport convenor Lesley Macinnes said: ""This is a crucial decision for Edinburgh - for today's residents and for generations to come. ""Taking trams to Newhaven will allow brownfield development sites to be transformed, opening up the whole of north Edinburgh to a wealth of opportunities in terms of jobs, housing and local facilities. ""I firmly believe the tram project is in the best interests of the city's current and future residents and, as an administration, we will do everything in our power to make sure it's delivered on time and on budget."" The tram extension will be funded through borrowing paid back by future tram fare revenues It was initially estimated the tram extension would cost Â£165m but the final business case for the project now states it will be Â£207m, including a contingency fund. In the first year of operation, the council predicts 16 million passengers will use the line. Paul Tetlaw, of transport lobby group Transform Scotland, said: ""This will serve a key transport corridor and boost development in the city creating more sustainable travel patterns. ""In the UK Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester and Blackpool are all extending their systems and across the water Dublin is doing likewise. ""Edinburgh's initial tram route has been a great success, it has consistently outperformed passenger projections and there is ample evidence that it has encouraged  motorists to leave their cars behind and take the tram into the city."" Critics remain sceptical about the cost and disruption that will be caused by the tram extension through Leith. Harald Tobermann, of the Community Councils Together on Trams group, is calling for controlled parking zones along the tram route, claiming this is ""key to preventing the tram corridor from turning into Edinburgh's largest park and ride area"". He added: ""We recognise that a strong feeling exists among many people in our communities that this project is being pushed through with undue and unnecessary haste."" The council's transport and environment committee had alreadybacked the extensiondespite concerns about cost and disruption. Taking into account lessons learnt in the first phase of the tram project, construction is planned using a ""one-dig"" approach - closing each work site only once and opening them again only once all works are complete.

Right to Buy owners 'sold within weeks',"The Right-to-Buy policy has been blamed for contributing to the lack of affordable housing A total of 139 former council tenants bought their homes under Right to Buy and resold them within one month, the BBC found. Those resold homes created a Â£2.8m collective profit. Opponents of the scheme said too many people had profited from a policy that had ""much bigger social ambitions"". Supporters said Right to Buy helped people climb the housing ladder and secure their families' financial futures. The former tenants were allowed to buy their homes at prices below the market rate. However, those who sell within five years of purchasing, should have to pay back some or all of the discount they received. Repaid discounts, which are calculated on a sliding scale depending how long the purchaser kept their home, were not included in data the BBC obtained on 92,000 sales across the UK. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) said it was ""shocking to see the extent of the profit margin in black and white"". It called for Right to Buy to be suspended in England. In January it was halted in Wales, as it was in Scotland in 2016. Housing commentator Henry Pryor said: ""Far too many... simply profited from a scheme that had much bigger social ambitions."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The BBC's Shared Data Unit obtained and analysed data from HM Land Registry, the Registers of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Data for 92,000 comparable sales was published in Freedom of Information responses. The investigation found homes in Britain bought under the scheme had been sold on for Â£6.4bn in collective profit since 2000. Jane Thorp said people's experience of Right to Buy would be very different if they bought their houses and owned the freehold Jane Thorp bought her Brighton flat leasehold under Right to Buy in 1993 for Â£15,000 after she had been a tenant there for seven years. The grandmother of one said it was ""quite desirable for a council estate near the sea"". The former HR manager pays a monthly service charge to her council for repairs to her block and said she was sometimes charged ""a huge bill"" for major works such as new wall insulation. ""I think we have five non-resident landlords [who bought ex-Right to Buy homes] in this block. They're not rich people, they're just looking for a bit of income for their retirement. ""I wouldn't have been able to buy without Right to Buy. I was lucky, I still have equity. Some people are stuck there in perpetuity, because you can't downsize from a council flat."" Burglary death victim's 999 call released Stonehenge 'hub for massive parties' Mum of boy with cancer hails 'generosity' Kerry Devlin is buying the housing association home in Thrapston, Northamptonshire, where she has lived for 20 years - at a 50% discount. The care home assistant manager originally moved there as a single parent and has since married. The mother of one, aged 48, said: ""It's a way of securing our future. Otherwise [If I didn't have this discount] I would be pushed to my absolute [financial] limits."" ""It's just a shame more young people cannot go on this scheme. It would give them a huge step up because they're struggling to get on the housing ladder. ""I'm fortunate this opportunity has arisen."" Lola Hutcheson says she's among the ""hidden homeless"" because she is in the housing system seemingly with nowhere to go Lola Hutcheson is in emergency temporary accommodation in Fishponds, Bristol, after being evicted when she was not working in December. Now working as a locum for a charity to tackle rough sleeping, the 39-year-old said: ""It's quite stressful. ""We're lucky we haven't been moved more than once. ""I visit the HomeChoice website every week where they rent social homes and there are three or four each week. ""There are regularly 100 people in the queue bidding before me and I cannot see how many there are after me."" Margaret Thatcher personally handed over the first council house sold in 1980 Since October 1980, council tenants have been able to buy their homes at a discount, which now stands at a maximum of 70% - depending on the length of the tenancy - or Â£80,900 across England and Â£108,000 in London boroughs (whichever is lower). Then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it would pave the way for a ""property-owning democracy"". Some 2.6 million council homes have been sold in Great Britain since the policy came into effect. Former tenants who sold within the first 10 years of buying homes had to offer their council the chance to buy back the property first, the government highlighted. Across the UK, the devolved governments have adopted differing approaches to the policy in recent years. Between 2000 and 2018, some 53,000 homeowners made Â£5bn in profit, or Â£4.3bn in real terms. About one in 20 made a loss in real terms. The average time people kept their Right to Buy (RtB) home before selling it on was seven-and-a-half years. Twenty people bought and sold their RtB home again within one week. In England, the policy has been extended for housing association tenants to buy their homes at a discount ina few pilot areas. A final cut-off date for applications to buy under the policy across Wales expired on 26 January. Homeowners from 39,000 sales we analysed made Â£2.3bn in profit or Â£2.05bn in real terms. Some one in 50 sellers made a real terms loss. The average time someone kept their RtB home before selling it on was about five years and eight months. Seventeen people bought and sold their RtB house within one week, three of those did so on the same day - one at a Â£60,700 mark-up. The scheme was brought to an end in Scotland in 2016, a move Shelter Scotland greeted with a ""welcome obituary,external"". Northern Ireland does not record sales prices. Between 1982 and 2018, some 120,950 former social homes were sold including 500 homes with five or more bedrooms. Aconsultation on the future of House Sales Schemes,external, the equivalent of RtB in Northern Ireland, was launched in 2018. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said the scheme had ""stored up serious trouble for the future"". ""We're still building far fewer homes than we're selling off"", she said. Paul Dossett, head of local government at financial services firm Grant Thornton UK LLP, said the policy had been a ""disaster for the UK taxpayer"". The policy was ""unsustainable"" and he backed calls for councils to keep much more money from house sales, he said. Labour's housing spokesman on the London Assembly, Tom Copley AM, said he ""wouldn't begrudge anyone taking a decision in their own financial best interests"" but RtB's legacy was ""a massive transfer of wealth from the many to the few"". Kate Henderson, Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation, said it was working with ministers to develop ""safeguards to stop the loss of social housing"" by insisting on the replacement of a new affordable home for every property sold. Lord Heseltine, who wasthe Secretary of State for the Environment when the policy was introduced,external, declined to answer questions about its impact. England's Minister of State for Housing Kit Malthouse MP said the policy had helped people ""achieve their dream of home ownership"".

Netflix to use new age ratings systemThe streaming giant will use an algorithm to make sure its entire catalogue has an official rating.,"Netflix film Bird Box, starring Sandra Bullock, was rated a 15 by the BBFC Netflix is to set the official UK age ratings for its own films and shows using a new algorithm that will mean its entire catalogue has a rating. Until now, ratings such as PG, 12 and 18 have been set by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Netflix will become the first company to determine ratings that will be given the BBFC seal of approval. Netflix will manually tag things like violence and swearing and the algorithm will pick the appropriate age rating. A BBFC spokeswoman said: ""This is the first time that the BBFC have collaborated with a content provider and put together a scheme that will eventually mean that they will rate their own content.

""The content will be viewed by a person, however the classification decision will be made digitally from the tags that the viewer inputs in to the system.

The body told BBC News it would ""provide ongoing training and support to Netflix to ensure that quality standards do not slip"". It said it wants 100% of films and programmes on Netflix to have BBFC ratings and for the system to be extended to other streaming services.

"Soldiers await Bloody Sunday decisionCharges, including murder and attempted murder, are being considered against 17 Army veterans.Northern Ireland","James Wray and William McKinney were among 13 people shot dead at a civil rights march A former British soldier faces murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. The sole prosecution is seen as a ""terrible disappointment"" by some of the families of the 13 people killed. They were shot dead at a civil rights march on 30 January 1972. The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Bloody Sunday decision reaction What next after Bloody Sunday charges? What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Internment, protest and Bloody Sunday,external Bloody Sunday prosecution decision in pictures The shootings led to widespread anger in Derry and further afield. This video can not be played What was Bloody Sunday? On the same day as the funerals were held for 11 of the Bloody Sunday victims, the British Embassy in Dublin was burned to the ground by an angry crowd. Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. BBC News NI's Home Affairs Correspondent Julian O'Neill said it could be a ""period of months"" before Soldier F makes his first court appearance. The former paratrooper is being referred to only as Soldier F because all military witnesses were granted anonymity through the Saville Inquiry into the circumstances around the killings. The PPS said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute 16 other soldiers and two Official IRA men. James Wray's brother Liam said he was ""very saddened for the other families"" of those killed on Bloody Sunday. ""Their hearts must be broken,"" he said. ""It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved."" He added: ""There are a lot of sad and heartbroken people today."" A number of relatives of those killed walked to Derry city centre ahead of the PPS decision. William McKinney's brother Michael said it was ""disappointing"" for families who had not received news of prosecutions. Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: ""It has been a long road for the families... and today will be another extremely difficult day for many of them. ""We wanted to meet them personally to explain the decisions taken and to help them understand the reasons."" Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she feels ""let down by a law and a justice system that's supposed to protect people"".

This video can not be played One soldier will be prosecuted over Bloody Sunday, the PPS said Soldier F gave evidence anonymously to the Saville Inquiry in 2003 and admitted firing 13 rounds on Bloody Sunday. His assertion that there were ""gunmen and bombers killed"" was rejected in Lord Saville's report. The Saville Inquiry stated that there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot father-of-six Paddy Doherty, who was unarmed. Saville also found there was ""no doubt"" Soldier F had shot an unarmed Bernard McGuigan on Bloody Sunday as he went to the aid of Patrick Doherty, waving a white handkerchief. At the Saville Inquiry, Soldier F admitted he had shot 17-year-old Michael Kelly - but he said that he had only fired at people with bombs or weapons. However, Saville concluded Mr Kelly was unarmed. The Saville Inquiry found that both William McKinney and James Wray could have been shot by Soldier F and three other soldiers. The inquiry report also stated Soldier F had changed his story over the years. Bloody Sunday gained notoriety around the world, partly due to the image of a Catholic priest waving a bloodstained handkerchief as he tried to help a victim Mr Herron said the decisions to prosecute announced on Thursday ""relate only to allegations of criminal conduct on Bloody Sunday itself"". ""Consideration will now be given to allegations of perjury in respect of those suspects reported by police,"" he said. by Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent Bloody Sunday might have happened 47 years ago, but it has cast a very long shadow, extending far beyond victims' families and those involved. It fuelled the Troubles and, two decades after they ended, it will once again throw a searchlight on how Northern Ireland deals with its past. Legacy issues, as they are termed, can poison the present day and they have been allowed to fester. Bloody Sunday has fed into the ongoing debate, with the government considering legislation as part of its next steps. Will that involve a de facto amnesty from prosecutions in future, and whom might that cover? This is the bigger picture against the backdrop of the Bloody Sunday decisions, significant as they are in their own right. The intention to charge a former soldier has clawed at emotions not just in Derry, but among bereaved families and victims in thousands of other Troubles cases left pondering truth and justice. The case could come before a court for a preliminary hearing quite quickly, says the legal expert, Joshua Rozenberg. He expects Soldier F to be brought before a court in Northern Ireland and to be named. UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government would offer full legal support to Soldier F - including paying his legal costs and providing welfare support. ""We are indebted to those soldiers who served with courage and distinction to bring peace to Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The welfare of our former service personnel is of the utmost importance."" He said the the Ministry of Defence is working ""to drive through a new package of safeguards to ensure our armed forces are not unfairly treated."" ""And the Government will urgently reform the system for dealing with legacy issues,"" he said. ""Our serving and former personnel cannot live in constant fear of prosecution."" Following Mr Williamson's statement, lawyers acting on behalf of the family of William Nash said they had contacted the Northern Ireland attorney general accusing the defence secretary of contempt of court. A public inquiry conducted by a senior judge in 1972 was branded a whitewash by victims' families. This video can not be played Liam Wray expressed relief that a soldier was to be prosecuted for his brother's murder After decades of campaigning, a fresh inquiry was eventually ordered by then prime minister Tony Blair in 1998. Lord Saville's 5,000-page report stated none of the casualties was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury and that soldiers had lost their self-control. The prime minister at the time of the report's publication, David Cameron, apologised for the soldiers' conduct, saying the killings were unjustified and unjustifiable, A police investigation into Bloody Sunday followed Lord Saville's 12-year, Â£200m public inquiry. A file was sent to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in November 2016. In total, police reported 20 suspects to the PPS - 18 of them former soldiers, one of whom died last year. Papers before prosecutors included 668 witness statements and numerous photos, video and audio evidence. The march began shortly after 15:00 GMT on 30 January 1972, and the intended destination was the city centre. However, Army barricades blocked marchers. The majority of demonstrators were instead directed towards Free Derry Corner in the Bogside. Graffitti appeared on Free Derry Corner after the announcement on Thursday After prolonged skirmishes between groups of youths and the Army, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment moved in to make arrests. Just before 16:00, stones were thrown and soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. Two people were shot and wounded. At 16:07, paratroopers moved to arrest as many marchers as possible. At 16:10, soldiers began to open fire. According to Army evidence, 21 soldiers fired their weapons, discharging 108 live rounds between them. Tense wait for Bloody Sunday decision What happened on Bloody Sunday?

It said it wants 100% of films and programmes on Netflix to have BBFC ratings and for the system to be extended to other streaming services. The announcement comes after BBFC research found almost 80% of parents were concerned about children seeing inappropriate content online. The BBFC has also published a set of guidelines for streaming and gaming platforms to achieve ""greater and more consistent use of trusted age ratings online"". They recommend wider use of BBFC age classifications on online video and the equivalent Pan European Game Information (PEGI) symbols for games.

MPs vote to reject no-deal Brexit,"This video can not be played May: MPs 'need to face up to the consequences of their decisions' MPs will vote on Thursday on delaying Brexit after they rejected the idea of leaving the EU without a deal. In a night of high drama in the Commons, MPs surprised the government and voted by 312 to 308 to reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances. The vote is not binding - under current law the UK could still leave without a deal on 29 March. On Thursday, MPs will vote on whether to ask the EU for permission to delay the date for departure. There could be a short extension - or a much longer one - depending on whether MPs backed the prime minister's existing withdrawal deal that has been agreed with the EU by 20 March, the government says. That means Theresa May could make a third attempt to get her deal through Parliament in the next few days. As it happened: MPs vote on no-deal Brexit MPs narrowly rule out no deal Brexitcast: Something has changed In a series of votes on no-deal Brexit, the Commons first voted by a margin of four to reject no deal outright. Then, in another vote, they reinforced that decision by 321 to 278, a majority of 43. That vote was on a motion which said the UK should not leave the EU without a deal specifically on 29 March, but with the option of a no-deal Brexit at any other time. It had originally been the government's motion. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The government wanted to keep control of the Brexit process, and keep no-deal on the table, so they ordered Conservative MPs to vote against it. That tactic failed. Government ministers defied those orders and there were claims Theresa May had lost control of her party. Sarah Newton has quit the government after defying the whips Thirteen government ministers - including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Business Secretary Greg Clark, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Scottish Secretary David Mundell - defied the government whips by abstaining in the vote. Work and pensions minister Sarah Newton voted against the orders of the whips and has now resigned. Mr Mundell said he backed the PM's deal and had always made clear his opposition to a no-deal Brexit. In a crisis there can be opportunity. This is now a crisis - the rules that traditionally have preserved governments are out of the window. The prime minister has been defeated again. Her authority - if not all gone - is in shreds. But for Number 10 there's an opportunity too, because MPs will soon be presented with a new choice - back the PM's deal, which has already been defeated twice, or accept the chance of a delay to Brexit. This isn't the choice of a government that's in control. But the tactic is to make the best of chaos. Read more from Laura here. Speaking after the result of the vote was read out, Mrs May said: ""The options before us are the same as they always have been. ""The legal default in EU and UK law is that the UK will leave without a deal unless something else is agreed. The onus is now on every one of us in this House to find out what that is.""

On Thursday, MPs will be asked if they want to delay Brexit until 30 June - to allow the necessary legislation to get through Parliament. But that is only if MPs back Mrs May's deal by 20 March, the government says. If they fail to back her deal by then, then the delay could be longer, Mrs May warned MPs, and it could clash with the European Parliament elections in May. ""I do not think that would be the right outcome. But the House needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions it has taken,"" she said. MPs also voted by 374 to 164 to reject a plan to delay the UK's departure from the EU until 22 May 2019, so that there can be what its supporters call a ""managed no-deal"" Brexit. This amendment was known as the Malthouse Compromise - after Kit Malthouse, the government minister who devised it. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Parliament must now take control of the Brexit process and his party will work across the House of Commons to seek a compromise solution. A European Commission spokesperson said: ""There are only two ways to leave the EU: with or without a deal. The EU is prepared for both. ""To take no deal off the table, it is not enough to vote against no deal - you have to agree to a deal. ""We have agreed a deal with the prime minister and the EU is ready to sign it.""

Brexit: What could happen next?AudioAudioBrexitcast: Something has changedBrexit crisis presents opportunity for MayBrexit: A really simple guide,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Pound at nine-month high,"The pound has jumped to highs last seen in June 2018 after Parliament rejected a no-deal Brexit. Investors saw less risk of a disorderly exit from the European Union. MPS rejected leaving the EU without a deal in any scenario, paving the way for a vote on whether to try and delay Brexit. Business leaders welcomed the outcome of the vote in the Commons but urged the government to take action. The pound traded as high as $1.3380, levels last seen in June 2018 and up from a low of $1.3064 on Wednesday. The euro was at around 84.725 pence, its lowest since mid-2017. City of London Corporation policy chairwoman Catherine McGuinness said MPs have ""voted in the interests of businesses and households"". The move to rule out leaving the European Union without a deal is a ""victory for common sense"", she said. Ms McGuinness added: ""Crashing out of the European Union without a deal would be an unprecedented act of self-sabotage. Brexit: What could happen next? A really simple guide How could Brexit be delayed? ""But in order to stave off this costly economic own goal, Parliament now needs to act swiftly to make today's rejection of no-deal a reality by voting to extend Article 50 and give breathing room for a solution to be found."" Dr Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC), warned that a ""messy and disorderly exit"" from the EU is still a ""clear and present danger"". He added: ""The reality is that without action, businesses still face an uncontrolled exit that they neither want nor are ready for. ""Extending Article 50 is now a necessity but it's no silver bullet for businesses, many of whom fear endless uncertainty. ""A deadline that is continuously pushed back isn't a deadline, it's an invitation to cancel investment, stop hiring or move UK operations somewhere else.""

"Extra ÃÂ£100m pledged to tackle knife crimeMayor of London calls money ""a drop in the ocean compared to the huge cuts to police since 2010"".UK","Jodie Chesney was killed in a stabbing in an east London park as she played music with friends Police have been promised an extra Â£100m by the government to help them tackle a knife crime ""epidemic"" in England and Wales. The money will mainly go to the seven forces where violence is highest. But the fund - announced by Chancellor Philip Hammond in his Spring Statement - falls short of the Â£200m to Â£300m requested by police chiefs last week. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the extra money was ""a drop in the ocean"" after years of decreasing police budgets. ""Cuts have consequences and the government needs to urgently give our police the funding they desperately need,"" he said. Funding to police forces - which comes from central government and council tax - fell by 19% in real terms between 2010-11 and 2018-19, according to theNational Audit Office,external. Officer numbers have fallen by around 20,000 since 2010. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims Mr Hammond initially saidpolice forces must use their existing budgets to tackle knife crime, following requests from senior officers. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) welcomed the new money, saying it would boost the number of officers patrolling crime hotspots, increase the use of stop and search, and help to disrupt criminal gangs. The funding would also be used to fundViolence Reduction Unitsthat seek to tackle the underlying causes of violent crime. The chancellor's announcement follows a spate of fatal teenage stabbings, with two 17-year-olds killed in separate knife attacks in London and Greater Manchester earlier this month. Jodie Chesneywas killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, andYousef Ghaleb Makkiwas stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. Mr Hammond told the Commons a ""wider, cross-agency response to this epidemic"" was required. ""Action is needed now. So the prime minister and I have decided exceptionally, to make available immediately to police forces in England an additional Â£100m,"" he said. Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart The money is for one year, with a longer-term funding settlement for the police expected to form part of the Spending Review. Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: ""It's vital police have the resources they need to crack down on the rising levels of knife crime. ""I've listened and we will be giving Â£100m extra to forces, targeting the hardest hit areas. I'll continue to give police the support they need."" Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the funding as a ""political win"" for Mr Javid,external, who has previously saidpolice chiefs should be ""listened to"". The forces that will mainly benefit from the new funding are: Metropolitan Police, West Midlands Police, Greater Manchester Police, Merseyside Police, South Yorkshire Police, West Yorkshire Police and South Wales Police. While 80% of the money is new Treasury funding, 20% is from the Home Office's ""re-prioritisation"" of funds. The funding announcement comes afterthe government in December pledged Â£161m for police forces, saying it would protect police budgets in ""real terms"". It also said police and crime commissioners would be able to raise additional funds by increasing council tax. Both changes are due to come into effect in April. NPCC chief constable Sara Thornton said of the extra Â£100m being promised: ""The additional government funding announced today is very welcome. It will help police forces strengthen our immediate response to knife crime and serious violence. ""Bringing violence down is a police priority."" She said all forces across England and Wales were undertaking a week-long intensive operation to tackle knife crime, including test purchasing weapons from shops, weapons sweeps and speaking to young people about the dangers of knives. Chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, John Apter, welcomed the additional funding, but said it was ""just a short-term fix"". ""It is a sad state of affairs when the home secretary has to take a begging bowl to the Treasury in a bid to solve the crisis we find ourselves in,"" he said. ""The government must make a significant investment in the spending review to give police the long-term boost they need."" The new funding comes after the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick saidthere was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers. However, Mrs May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"".

"Extra ÃÂ£100m pledged to tackle knife crimeMayor of London calls money ""a drop in the ocean compared to the huge cuts to police since 2010"".","Jodie Chesney was killed in a stabbing in an east London park as she played music with friends Police have been promised an extra Â£100m by the government to help them tackle a knife crime ""epidemic"" in England and Wales. The money will mainly go to the seven forces where violence is highest. But the fund - announced by Chancellor Philip Hammond in his Spring Statement - falls short of the Â£200m to Â£300m requested by police chiefs last week. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the extra money was ""a drop in the ocean"" after years of decreasing police budgets. ""Cuts have consequences and the government needs to urgently give our police the funding they desperately need,"" he said. Funding to police forces - which comes from central government and council tax - fell by 19% in real terms between 2010-11 and 2018-19, according to theNational Audit Office,external. Officer numbers have fallen by around 20,000 since 2010. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims Mr Hammond initially saidpolice forces must use their existing budgets to tackle knife crime, following requests from senior officers. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) welcomed the new money, saying it would boost the number of officers patrolling crime hotspots, increase the use of stop and search, and help to disrupt criminal gangs. The funding would also be used to fundViolence Reduction Unitsthat seek to tackle the underlying causes of violent crime. The chancellor's announcement follows a spate of fatal teenage stabbings, with two 17-year-olds killed in separate knife attacks in London and Greater Manchester earlier this month. Jodie Chesneywas killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, andYousef Ghaleb Makkiwas stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. Mr Hammond told the Commons a ""wider, cross-agency response to this epidemic"" was required. ""Action is needed now. So the prime minister and I have decided exceptionally, to make available immediately to police forces in England an additional Â£100m,"" he said. Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart The money is for one year, with a longer-term funding settlement for the police expected to form part of the Spending Review. Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: ""It's vital police have the resources they need to crack down on the rising levels of knife crime. ""I've listened and we will be giving Â£100m extra to forces, targeting the hardest hit areas. I'll continue to give police the support they need."" Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the funding as a ""political win"" for Mr Javid,external, who has previously saidpolice chiefs should be ""listened to"". The forces that will mainly benefit from the new funding are: Metropolitan Police, West Midlands Police, Greater Manchester Police, Merseyside Police, South Yorkshire Police, West Yorkshire Police and South Wales Police. While 80% of the money is new Treasury funding, 20% is from the Home Office's ""re-prioritisation"" of funds. The funding announcement comes afterthe government in December pledged Â£161m for police forces, saying it would protect police budgets in ""real terms"". It also said police and crime commissioners would be able to raise additional funds by increasing council tax. Both changes are due to come into effect in April. NPCC chief constable Sara Thornton said of the extra Â£100m being promised: ""The additional government funding announced today is very welcome. It will help police forces strengthen our immediate response to knife crime and serious violence. ""Bringing violence down is a police priority."" She said all forces across England and Wales were undertaking a week-long intensive operation to tackle knife crime, including test purchasing weapons from shops, weapons sweeps and speaking to young people about the dangers of knives. Chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, John Apter, welcomed the additional funding, but said it was ""just a short-term fix"". ""It is a sad state of affairs when the home secretary has to take a begging bowl to the Treasury in a bid to solve the crisis we find ourselves in,"" he said. ""The government must make a significant investment in the spending review to give police the long-term boost they need."" The new funding comes after the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick saidthere was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers. However, Mrs May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"".
