UK ambassador to Iran arrested during protests,"Britain has condemned the arrest of the UK ambassador to Iran as a ""flagrant violation of international law"". Rob Macaire was detained for a short time on Saturday night after attending a vigil for those who died when Iran's military shot down a passenger plane. He left the vigil when it turned into a protest but was later accused of helping to organise the demonstrations. Iran said he was ""an unknown foreigner in an illegal gathering"" and summoned him to the foreign ministry on Sunday. In a statement, Iran's foreign ministry said Mr Macaire was ""reminded"" that his presence at ""illegal gatherings contravened"" the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mr Macaire was understood to have protested strongly that his detention was unjustified. Our correspondent says Mr Macaire made clear any suggestion that he was involved in demonstrations was completely untrue, and he was attending an event advertised as a vigil for the victims of Wednesday's crash -which killed 176 people, including four Britons. Iran faces watershed moment Iran admits 'unintentionally' shooting down plane What we know about the Iran plane crash Earlier, Iran's deputy foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, who denied Mr Macaire was detained, said in a tweet that he thought it ""impossible"" when police first told him that the UK ambassador had been arrested. A phone conversation confirmed Mr Macaire's identity and he was released 15 minutes later, Mr Araghchi added. Mr Macaire has denied taking part in protests and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned his arrest. He was arrested and held for three hours when he stopped at a barber shop for a haircut on his way back to the UK embassy. In a tweet,externalthe ambassador said he was attending the vigil because it was ""normal to want to pay respects"", adding that some of the victims were British. The ambassador added: ""Arresting diplomats is of course illegal, in all countries."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Protesters had taken to the streets in Iran's capital, Tehran, to vent anger at officials, calling them liars for having denied, then admitting, shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane.

Queen and Prince Harry to hold face-to-face talks,"The Queen attended a church service at Sandringham on Sunday morning The Queen has summoned senior royals to Sandringham on Monday for face-to-face talks to discuss the future roles of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Palace officials told the BBC that Prince Harry, the Duke of Cambridge and the Prince of Wales would all attend, while Meghan is expected join the discussion over the phone from Canada. The Sussexes say they plan to step back as senior members of the Royal Family. There is no suggestion a conclusion will be reached at the meeting. But BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it is hoped that the talks will produce a ""next step"" on the way to defining the couple's new relationship with the Royal Family - in line with the Queen's wish to find a solution within days. He added that there were still ""formidable obstacles"" to overcome in the talks. Your questions answered on Harry and Meghan statement Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights How could the Sussexes make money? Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge has spoken of his ""sadness"" at the broken bond with his brother,the Sunday Times reports.,external According to the paper, Prince William told a friend: ""I've put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can't do that any more; we're separate entities. This video can not be played Views from the public at Sandringham Estate: 'You can't just be a royal then decide not to be' ""All we can do, and all I can do, is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we're all singing from the same page."" Prince Charles is currently in Oman, after travelling overnight to attend the first of three days of official condolences alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson,following the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said. He will return to the UK in time to attend Monday's talks. On Sunday morning the Queen was seen smiling and waving to crowds as she was driven to church in Sandringham. Prince Charles is in Oman, where he met the country's new sultan Monday's gathering at the Queen's estate in Norfolk - being described as the ""Sandringham summit"" - will be the first time the monarch has come face-to-face with Harry since the Sussexes' announcement, which was posted on their official Instagram account. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the trickiest area will be to agree the financial position of the Sussexes, who saidin their statement on Wednesdaythey intend to ""step back"" as senior royals and work to become financially independent. The couple also said they plan to split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". There are likely to be tax implications to any decision to base themselves outside the UK for any length of time and Buckingham Palace will want ""tight protocols to prevent them cashing in on their royal status"", our correspondent added. Monday's royal summit may not be the last such gathering needed to sort things out; but enough progress has been made by palace staff and civil servants for the most senior members of the family to meet to discuss some pretty concrete proposals on the way ahead for Prince Harry and Meghan. There are still formidable obstacles - it's not at all clear how much in the way of royal duties the prince and Meghan see themselves doing. On that will hang issues such as funding and liaison between the palace and Prince Harry and Meghan's new organisation. Unpicking the current relationship is complicated - creating a new one, that lasts, will be even tougher. There's a strong desire to get this done. But equally the deal must be robust and workable. Precedent is being established here - a way of doing things that may extend in years to come to other members of the royal family. The Queen, Prince Charles, William and Harry are expected to review a range of possibilities for the Sussexes, taking into account plans outlined by the couple. If a deal is agreed in the coming days, there is a general understanding that it will take some time to implement. Meanwhile, Meghan is in Canada with her eight-month-old son Archie after flying there amid the ongoing discussions, which have involved the UK and Canadian governments. She and Prince Harry had been in Canada over Christmas, before they returned to the UK on Tuesday after a six-week break from royal duties. On Friday, the couple's official Instagram account returned to publicising their appearances. Pictures were posted showing the couple during a private visit on Tuesday to a community kitchen in north Kensington, west London, where meals were cooked for families displaced by the Grenfell Tower fire. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghanpublicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight. The couple were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. And in December it was revealed that the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services.

DUP and Sinn FÃ©in back in top jobs at Stormont,"Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP have re-entereddevolved government in Northern Irelandafter three years of deadlock. DUP leader Arlene Foster was appointed as Northern Ireland's first minister, while Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill is deputy first minister on Saturday. The two parties supporteda deal to restore Stormont's political institutions. Stormont's power-sharing coalition, led by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, collapsed in January 2017. How the parties got a done deal What's in the draft Stormont deal? Three years of political deadlock at Stormont This video can not be played Arlene Foster says parties must work for everyone The first minister comes from the largest party in the assembly and deputy first minister is from the second-largest party. The positions are known as a ""diarchy"" which means they are equal and govern together. The deputy first minister is not subordinate to the first minister, despite the title. Addressing the assembly, Mrs Foster said the politicians have ""many differences"". ""Michelle's narrative of the past 40 years could not be more different to mine,"" she said. ""I'm not sure we will ever agree on much about the past, but we can agree there was too much suffering, and that we cannot allow society to drift backwards and allow division to grow."" She added that it was ""time for Stormont to move forward"". This video can not be played Michelle O'Neill addresses the new NI Assembly Michelle O'Neill said it was her ""sincere wish that 2020 brings real change"". She also pledged to immediately resolve the pay parity row that has led toindustrial strike action among health workers. She said: ""I see no contradiction in declaring and delivering on our firm commitment to power sharing with unionism in the Stormont Assembly while also initiating a mature and inclusive debate about new political arrangements which examine Ireland's future beyond Brexit. ""Similarly, there is no contradiction in unionism working the existing constitutional arrangements while taking its rightful place in the conversation about what a new Ireland would look like. ""We can do this while maintaining our independent distinct political identities and working in the best interests of all of the people."" Both prime ministers have welcomed the restoration of devolved government at Stormont The prime minister called it a ""momentous day"". ""The parties of Northern Ireland have shown great leadership in coming together to accept this fair and balanced deal in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland,"" Boris Johnson said. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar commended Northern Ireland's political parties ""for their decision to put the people they represent first and make measured compromises to reach a deal"". ""I look forward to working with representatives in Northern Ireland as they begin working together again on behalf of all people in Northern Ireland,"" he said. Analysis by BBC News NI political reporter Jayne McCormack The first day back was always going to bring its challenges - but despite some malfunctioning microphones, events in the chamber moved at pace. The surprising move by the DUP to support a Sinn FÃ©in speaker instead of the SDLP, already has some sceptics suspecting not much has changed when it comes to how the two biggest parties operated in the last mandate. But there's no denying Parliament Buildings has a buzz about it again. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill now have to prove that they can share power and deliver on the commitments in the new Stormont deal. The SDLP, Alliance and Ulster Unionists are back in the executive too - a sign they would rather be helping take decisions, than stuck outside looking in. After the session ended, the new ministers were immediately met by their departmental officials: the task of getting down to business starts now. Reacting to the return of Stormont, former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams said the assembly provided a place to ""moderate differences, and to define common ground"". ""It doesn't have to be back on the streets, it doesn't have to be these mad radio talk programmes, it doesn't have to be who shouts and yells the loudest,"" Mr Adams told RTÃ's Week in Politics programme. All five main parties in Northern Ireland - the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance, SDLP and UUP - have joined the new executive. MLAs - members of the legislative assembly - met at Stormont on Saturday. Their first item of business at Stormont on Saturday was the election of Sinn FÃ©in's Alex Maskey as the assembly's new speaker. The DUP's Christopher Stalford; UUP's Roy Beggs and SDLP's Patsy McGlone are his three deputies. Gordon Lyons (DUP) and Declan Kearney (Sinn FÃ©in) will serve as junior ministers. Alliance leader Naomi Long accepted the position of justice minister. She said it followed conversations with Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill on Friday night. Mrs Long said she was ""honoured to have the support of all sides of the house"". With the exception of the role of justice minister, the posts are shared out using a system called D'Hondt, in which ministerial posts are allocated according to parties' representation in the assembly. The other members of the executive are: Minister for the economy: Diane Dodds (DUP) Minister for education: Peter Weir (DUP) Minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs: Edwin Poots (DUP) Minister for communities: Deirdre Hargey (Sinn FÃ©in) Minister for finance: Conor Murphy (Sinn FÃ©in) Minister for health: Robin Swann (UUP) Minister for infrastructure: Nichola Mallon (SDLP) The d'Hondt mechanism is used to appoint almost all the ministerial departments in the executive - meaning the departments are shared round the parties based on how many MLAs they have. Justice is different though - it is elected by a cross-community vote. This is because when the Northern Ireland Executive was first created in 1999 it was considered that it was not yet appropriate to devolve policing and justice powers. There was still a tense security situation and so those powers remained at Westminster. In 2010 a deal was struck to devolve justice, but the DUP did not want a Sinn FÃ©in minister to be able to hold the post. Instead it was agreed any justice minister required a cross-community vote. Robin Swann stood down as UUP leader in October due to family commitments A big surprise was the appointment of Robin Swann as health minister. It comes just three months after the UUP North Antrim MLA stepped down as party leader due to the impact the role was having on his ""role as a husband and a father"". He told the BBC that the party considered health a major priority and ""when we had the chance to take it, we did"". Mr Swann said he was going to hold the first and deputy first ministers to account and would not let them ""play party politics with health"". Relations between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had deteriorated in recent years as the two parties were diametrically opposed not only on Northern Ireland's position within the UK, but also issues such as the Irish language; same-sex marriage; abortion and how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. But unexpectedly it was a row over a green energy scheme which pushed their relationship past breaking point. TheRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) schemewas set up by DUP leader Arlene Foster when she was enterprise minister, but it ran over budget and at one point threatened to cost taxpayers Â£490m. Sinn FÃ©in demanded that Mrs Foster step aside as first minister during an inquiry into the RHI scheme and when she refused, theypulled out of government on 9 January 2017. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish language act and the petition of concern. The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. The new deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The deal would see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster-Scots commissioner. Earlier, Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge welcomed the deal as an ""historic advancement"" but added it ""falls very much short"" of promises for an Irish Language act. Other key points in the deal includethe Northern Ireland Executive settling an ongoing pay dispute with nurses and increasing policing numbers.

"Don't trash Blair or Corbyn, says Keir Starmer","Labour leadership hopeful Sir Keir Starmer has called for unity and said ""factionalism has to go"" if the party is to recover from its election defeat.

Johnson: An important first step,"Britain has condemned the arrest of the UK ambassador to Iran as a ""flagrant violation of international law"". Rob Macaire was detained for a short time on Saturday night after attending a vigil for those who died when Iran's military shot down a passenger plane. He left the vigil when it turned into a protest but was later accused of helping to organise the demonstrations. Iran said he was ""an unknown foreigner in an illegal gathering"" and summoned him to the foreign ministry on Sunday. In a statement, Iran's foreign ministry said Mr Macaire was ""reminded"" that his presence at ""illegal gatherings contravened"" the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mr Macaire was understood to have protested strongly that his detention was unjustified. Our correspondent says Mr Macaire made clear any suggestion that he was involved in demonstrations was completely untrue, and he was attending an event advertised as a vigil for the victims of Wednesday's crash -which killed 176 people, including four Britons. Iran faces watershed moment Iran admits 'unintentionally' shooting down plane What we know about the Iran plane crash Earlier, Iran's deputy foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, who denied Mr Macaire was detained, said in a tweet that he thought it ""impossible"" when police first told him that the UK ambassador had been arrested. A phone conversation confirmed Mr Macaire's identity and he was released 15 minutes later, Mr Araghchi added. Mr Macaire has denied taking part in protests and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned his arrest. He was arrested and held for three hours when he stopped at a barber shop for a haircut on his way back to the UK embassy. In a tweet,externalthe ambassador said he was attending the vigil because it was ""normal to want to pay respects"", adding that some of the victims were British. The ambassador added: ""Arresting diplomats is of course illegal, in all countries."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned Mr Macaire's arrest in a joint statement following a phone call on Sunday, in which they discussed their ""shared interests in ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon"". And Security Minister Brandon Lewis said on Sunday that the UK ambassador's arrest was ""totally unacceptable"" and a breach of the 1961 Vienna Convention. ""Iran does need to step back from that kind of activity and play a proper part in working with partners to de-escalate,"" Mr Lewis told Sky's Sophy Ridge. Under the convention, diplomats cannot be detained. The Foreign Office is to demand a full explanation. In a statement issued on Saturday night Mr Raab added: ""The arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law. ""The Iranian government is at a cross-roads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to deescalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards."" The Iranian Etemad newspaper shared a picture of the ambassador on Twitter after the Tasnim news agency reported his arrest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Protesters had taken to the streets in Iran's capital, Tehran, to vent anger at officials, calling them liars for having denied, then admitting, shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane. Iran had initially denied responsibility for the plane crash, but on Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani admitted Iranian military had ""unintentionally"" shot down the passenger plane after mistaking it for a cruise missile when it turned towards a sensitive military site. President Rouhani said the missile strike was an ""unforgivable mistake"". The crash came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Mr Johnson said Iran's admission was an ""important first step"" and called for an investigation into the ""tragic accident"". And writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Raab said,externalit was time for Tehran ""to come to the negotiating table to resolve all of Iran's issues of international concern."" He said Iran ""must stop pursuing a nuclear weapon, end its support for terrorism, and release the foreign nationals and dual nationals it cruelly holds"". This video can not be played Footage appears to show missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the shooting down of the passenger plane by Iran was ""an appalling act, and part of a whole pattern of appalling acts all across the region"". The Queen has also sent a message of condolence to the Governor-General of Canada - where the majority of the passengers on the flight were headed. Out of the 176 victims on board the Kyiv-bound flight, 138 had listed Canada as their eventual destination. The Queen said she and the Duke of Edinburgh were ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"". The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall added their condolences, saying they were ""utterly horrified"" by the disaster.

"Harry Dunn extradition bid 'inappropriate', says US","Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The United States has criticised the UK's request to extradite an American accused of killing motorcyclist Harry Dunn, calling it ""highly inappropriate"". Mr Dunn, 19, died after being hit by a car allegedly driven by suspect Anne Sacoolas, who left the country for the US claiming diplomatic immunity. The Home Officesubmitted a request on Fridayto extradite her to the UK. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said she will ""100% be coming back"". ""I have no doubt in my mind, the only thing I can't tell you is when,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""This campaign won't stop until Anne Sacoolas is back in the UK facing the justice system. There is no celebration and until she is back, we won't rest. ""This lady is accused of taking Harry's life, then fleeing the country. No-one is above the law in modern society. You don't get to move to a country, break a law in that country and then leave."" Mr Seiger said that under the circumstances, the family was ""really pleased"" the UK authorities had taken the ""huge step towards justice"", but if the Trump administration was to ignore or reject the request, it would be re-presented should another administration come into power. This video can not be played Radd Seiger: Anne Sacoolas will ""100% be coming back...the only thing I can't tell you is when'' The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Is extraditing Anne Sacoolas a realistic prospect? Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 The crash happened outside RAF Croughton, where Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas. The 42-year-old left the UK shortly after the crash on 27 August and returned to the US, prompting a justice campaign by the teenager's parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn. Mrs Sacoolas was charged in December by the Crown Prosecution Service with causing death by dangerous driving and the Home Office submitted its extradition request to the US Department of Justice. A spokeswoman for the US State Department said: ""It is the position of the United States government that a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an abuse. ""The use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent.""

Taiwan's Tsai wins second presidential term,"Tsai Ing-wen has told China to abandon its threat of force Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has secured a second term after sweeping to victory in an election dominated by the island's relationship with China. Ms Tsai secured just over 57% of the ballot - a record 8.2m votes - well ahead of her rival Han Kuo-yu. Ms Tsai opposes closer ties with China, with Mr Han suggesting they would bring economic benefits. In her victory speech, Ms Tsai told China to abandon its threat to take back the island by force. Ms Tsai told a news conference: ""Taiwan is showing the world how much we cherish our free democratic way of life and how much we cherish our nation."" China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. It says Taiwan must eventually be reunited with China, by force if necessary. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Taiwan loses another ally as Kiribati cuts ties How Taiwanâs Tsai stayed one step ahead Ms Tsai said China should now drop that threat. ""Peace means that China must abandon threats of force against Taiwan,"" she said in the capital Taipei. ""I also hope that the Beijing authorities understand that democratic Taiwan, and our democratically elected government, will not concede to threats and intimidation."" Eight million votes is an extraordinary tally for a Taiwanese President seeking a second term. The record-breaking win has delivered a landslide mandate to Ms Tsai, and a major snub to Beijing. It was the emergence of Taiwan's relationship with China as the central issue in this campaign that allowed her to revive her flagging fortunes. And in her victory there is a certain political irony. Beijing's rigid, authoritarian vision of a Greater China, united on its terms, has been wholeheartedly rejected in the one place actually given the opportunity to vote on the concept. And had the Communist Party not turned up the pressure on Taiwan, had its approach to the crisis in Hong Kong been subtler, the path to victory for a candidate it wanted so much to thwart may have been much less certain. After the result was announced I asked Tsai Ing-wen whether she had the Chinese President Xi Jinping to thank for her victory. She smiled. The US hailed President Tsai's victory as a demonstration of Taiwan's ""robust democratic system"". ""Under her leadership we hope Taiwan will continue to serve as a shining example for countries that strive for democracy, prosperity and a better path for their people,"" the US State Department said. Mr Han, the Kuomintang party candidate, had earlier admitted defeat as the results became clear. ""I have called President Tsai to congratulate her. She has a new mandate for the next four years,"" he told a crowd in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Han Kuo-yo had favoured closer ties with China Ahead of the vote, Ms Tsai was leading in the polls as voters watched the way in which Beijing handled pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Her stance was popular with those who fear Taiwan being overtaken by mainland China. In the final count she secured 1.3m more votes than in her 2016 victory. President Tsai insists Taiwan's future should be decided by its 23 million people. Voters were also choosing the next members of the Taiwanese legislature, where Ms Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has had a majority. Supporters of Han Kuo-yu were devastated by the result Those who backed Tsai Ing-wen, however, were jubilant For practical purposes, Taiwan is an independent state - it has its own elected government, constitution and military. But China refuses to have diplomatic relations with any country that recognises Taiwan as a sovereign nation. All but a handful of countries have picked Beijing, butmost maintain an ambiguous relationship with Taiwanthrough trade. The US is also legally bound to supply Taiwan with the means to defend itself. This video can not be played China and its influence is a key issue in Taiwan's election Ms Tsai wants to ""maintain the existing mechanisms"", according toher website,external- meaning she does not want to compromise Taiwan's de facto independence. In a speech on the Hong Kong protests in June,external, she said ""anyone who tries to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy, or use them as political bargaining chips, will fail"". She had also rejected Taiwan ever operating under the ""one country, two systems"" political system used in Hong Kong since it returned to China in 1997 - calling it ""not viable"". Speaking to the BBC this week, she said Taiwan should ""learn a lesson"" from Hong Kong: ""If we don't insist [on maintaining Taiwan's independence], we'll be losing everything we have now."" Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female president Taiwan profile Mr Han and his party the Kuomintang (KMT) favour closer ties with China - which they say will bring economic growth - but do not seek unification. The KMT once ruled China, before fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 after losing to the communist forces in the civil war. Mr Han made a high-profile visit to Hong Kong and China in March, and has reportedly said a formal declaration of Taiwanese independence would be ""scarier than syphilis"". This video can not be played Three couples and a wedding to celebrate Taiwan marriage equality Although the economy has grown during Ms Tsai's presidency, exports have fallen and wage growth is sluggish. Saturday's presidential election was also the first since Taiwan became the first place in Asia tolegalise same-sex marriage. Themove was rejectedin a series of referendums, but parliament passed a special law in order to comply with an earlier court ruling. Ms Tsai said it was ""a big step towards true equality"".

"'We're devastated, Mothercare was our family'","Mothercare sales advisers Karen (L) and Sue (R) have worked in the Romford store for years ""We're devastated. It's not just a job, it's a family."" Karen and Sue have known each other since they were nine years old, and will work their final shifts at Mothercare's Romford store this weekend. All of the baby goods retailer's 79 UK shops will be shut by Sunday, with thousands of jobs lost across the countryafter the firm called in administrators last November. Like many struggling retailers, Mothercare found itself squeezed by the big UK supermarkets, fast fashion brands and the internet. Having worked part-time at the Romford shop for 19 and 27 years respectively, Karen and Sue have seen customer numbers decreasing. ""You don't see regular customers anymore, you see bargain hunters. As soon as it's reduced, it's gone,"" says Karen. On Friday, customers queued outside before the doors of the Romford store opened. They made their way around heavily-discounted goods from clothes, carry cots and high chairs to office equipment such as staplers, hole punches and even the store's shelving units. Karen decided to avoid working the final day in the shop on Saturday. ""It's just too much,"" says Sue, wearing a specially-made T-shirt by the Romford staff. On the back, it reads: ""We are family"". For now, the staff try to keep their spirits up, playing Coldplay over the loudspeakers and lighting up sectioned-off, empty parts of the store with disco lights. Mothercare workers won't be the only ones affected by store closures in early 2020, as tough trading conditions for retailers continue. Fifteen Links of London shops will also close their doors by Sunday,affecting up to 350 jobs. Department store chain Debenhams will have closed 22 of its shops by the end of January,resulting in 660 jobs being lost. Department store chains such as Debenhams have been struggling A further 28 Debenhams stores are due to close within the next five years, as the ailing chain tries to secure its future. It comes as part of a rescue plan introduced after its previous owners had saddled it with a huge amount of debt, while it was tied into long leases for its large properties. The number of job losses in retail overall is also increasing. Figures from the Centre for Retail Research suggest that a total of 143,128 job losses,externalin the sector were announced in 2019. That's an increase of more than 25,000 from the previous year. Previous research by the British Retail Consortium also warnedthat there would be up to 900,000 fewer jobs in retail over the next decade. Hardly a week goes by without an announcement about a fresh wave of store closures. A net 1,234 stores shut on Britain's top 500 High Streets in the first half of 2019,according to research by PwC and the Local Data Company,external. That is up from 1,123 in the same period the previous year and the highest since the survey began in 2010. The data looks at retail chains with more than five outlets. Fashion stores saw the largest number of closures. Womenswear retailers were among those to have fallen on hard times in 2019,including chains such as BonmarchÃ©which has entered administration and is to close 30 stores. As firms issue updates after the crucial Christmas trading period, further closures could be announced. In the last few years, things have become a lot harder for traditional retailers. Companies have had to deal with rising costs such as increasing wages, rents and business rates.Research by Retail Economics suggests,externalthat operating costs have been increasing at a faster rate than sales for many shops. Richard Lim, its chief executive, said: ""Because the National Living Wage has risen at such pace, retailers are focusing on whether or not they can reduce labour costs by using things like automated checkouts. He added: ""That leaves fewer workers in retail, but those that are, are paid better wages."" At the same time, retailers are trying to adapt to changing shopping habits. One in every Â£5 is now spent online. ""At the heart of it, those that are doing well are the ones that have a distinct proposition"", says Mr Lim, citing Primark and supermarkets Aldi and Lidl as firms that are thriving. In Mothercare's Romford store, Karen says she's ""well aware"" customers doing more shopping online might have contributed to the company's problems. While the future might see further shops closing down, for some workers it's hard to think much further ahead. ""I'm not rushing to find another job, because I can't imagine working with another group of people like this,"" says Karen. ""On Monday morning, that's when the reality will hit.""

Five prison officers injured in attack by inmate,"The attack happened at HMP Bristol on Friday afternoon Five prison officers have been injured in an attack by an inmate. The attack happened at HMP Bristol on Friday at 14:00 GMT and all five officers ""received hospital treatment"", a Prison Service spokeswoman said. Sarah Rigby, from the Prison Officers Association (POA), said the prisoner had been transferred from a high-security jail. The Prison Service said it was investing in staff safety by issuing bodycams and pepper spray. Ms Rigby said the inmate ""should never have been moved out of the high-security establishment"". She said those injured had left hospital and were recovering at home and added: ""Staff at HMP Bristol have not yet been issued with PAVA [pepper spray] and rigid bar handcuffs and it is possible that the PAVA particularly could have protected staff better during this incident. ""The POA again wishes to reiterate that the employer must issue this protective equipment at the earliest opportunity to offer better protections for the staff carrying out their duties in a dangerous, hostile environment."" An Avon and Somerset Police spokeswoman said they were investigating an assault. She said the prison officers were ""taken to hospital for treatment to injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening"" and added: ""A suspect was detained by prison staff and is due to be questioned by police officers.""

Taiwan's Tsai wins second presidential termPresident Tsai Ing-wen sweeps to victory in what is seen as a rebuke to China's growing influence.Asia,"Tsai Ing-wen has told China to abandon its threat of force Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has secured a second term after sweeping to victory in an election dominated by the island's relationship with China. Ms Tsai secured just over 57% of the ballot - a record 8.2m votes - well ahead of her rival Han Kuo-yu. Ms Tsai opposes closer ties with China, with Mr Han suggesting they would bring economic benefits. In her victory speech, Ms Tsai told China to abandon its threat to take back the island by force. Ms Tsai told a news conference: ""Taiwan is showing the world how much we cherish our free democratic way of life and how much we cherish our nation."" China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. It says Taiwan must eventually be reunited with China, by force if necessary. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Taiwan loses another ally as Kiribati cuts ties How Taiwanâs Tsai stayed one step ahead Ms Tsai said China should now drop that threat. ""Peace means that China must abandon threats of force against Taiwan,"" she said in the capital Taipei. ""I also hope that the Beijing authorities understand that democratic Taiwan, and our democratically elected government, will not concede to threats and intimidation."" Eight million votes is an extraordinary tally for a Taiwanese President seeking a second term. The record-breaking win has delivered a landslide mandate to Ms Tsai, and a major snub to Beijing. It was the emergence of Taiwan's relationship with China as the central issue in this campaign that allowed her to revive her flagging fortunes. And in her victory there is a certain political irony. Beijing's rigid, authoritarian vision of a Greater China, united on its terms, has been wholeheartedly rejected in the one place actually given the opportunity to vote on the concept. And had the Communist Party not turned up the pressure on Taiwan, had its approach to the crisis in Hong Kong been subtler, the path to victory for a candidate it wanted so much to thwart may have been much less certain. After the result was announced I asked Tsai Ing-wen whether she had the Chinese President Xi Jinping to thank for her victory. She smiled. The US hailed President Tsai's victory as a demonstration of Taiwan's ""robust democratic system"". ""Under her leadership we hope Taiwan will continue to serve as a shining example for countries that strive for democracy, prosperity and a better path for their people,"" the US State Department said. Mr Han, the Kuomintang party candidate, had earlier admitted defeat as the results became clear. ""I have called President Tsai to congratulate her. She has a new mandate for the next four years,"" he told a crowd in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Han Kuo-yo had favoured closer ties with China Ahead of the vote, Ms Tsai was leading in the polls as voters watched the way in which Beijing handled pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Her stance was popular with those who fear Taiwan being overtaken by mainland China. In the final count she secured 1.3m more votes than in her 2016 victory. President Tsai insists Taiwan's future should be decided by its 23 million people. Voters were also choosing the next members of the Taiwanese legislature, where Ms Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has had a majority. Supporters of Han Kuo-yu were devastated by the result Those who backed Tsai Ing-wen, however, were jubilant For practical purposes, Taiwan is an independent state - it has its own elected government, constitution and military. But China refuses to have diplomatic relations with any country that recognises Taiwan as a sovereign nation. All but a handful of countries have picked Beijing, butmost maintain an ambiguous relationship with Taiwanthrough trade. The US is also legally bound to supply Taiwan with the means to defend itself. This video can not be played China and its influence is a key issue in Taiwan's election Ms Tsai wants to ""maintain the existing mechanisms"", according toher website,external- meaning she does not want to compromise Taiwan's de facto independence. In a speech on the Hong Kong protests in June,external, she said ""anyone who tries to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy, or use them as political bargaining chips, will fail"". She had also rejected Taiwan ever operating under the ""one country, two systems"" political system used in Hong Kong since it returned to China in 1997 - calling it ""not viable"". Speaking to the BBC this week, she said Taiwan should ""learn a lesson"" from Hong Kong: ""If we don't insist [on maintaining Taiwan's independence], we'll be losing everything we have now."" Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female president Taiwan profile Mr Han and his party the Kuomintang (KMT) favour closer ties with China - which they say will bring economic growth - but do not seek unification. The KMT once ruled China, before fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 after losing to the communist forces in the civil war. Mr Han made a high-profile visit to Hong Kong and China in March, and has reportedly said a formal declaration of Taiwanese independence would be ""scarier than syphilis"". This video can not be played Three couples and a wedding to celebrate Taiwan marriage equality Although the economy has grown during Ms Tsai's presidency, exports have fallen and wage growth is sluggish. Saturday's presidential election was also the first since Taiwan became the first place in Asia tolegalise same-sex marriage. Themove was rejectedin a series of referendums, but parliament passed a special law in order to comply with an earlier court ruling. Ms Tsai said it was ""a big step towards true equality"".

Call for whip to be removed from new Tory MP,"Jamie Wallis took the Bridgend seat in December for the Tories after 32 years of Labour dominance A candidate in the Labour leadership contest wants Boris Johnson to kick one of his new Welsh MPs out of the Conservative party in Parliament. Jess Phillips has started a petition calling on the prime minister to withdraw the whip from the Tory MP for Bridgend, Jamie Wallis. He was the director of several firms which have been the subject of hundreds of complaints to Bridgend trading standards. Mr Wallis has been asked to comment. On Saturday the Conservative Party said it could not make a comment at this time. Hewon Bridgend for the Toriesfrom Labour in last month's election. It has emerged that one of the companies, Quickie Divorce Ltd, which trades under the title clean-break.co.uk, advertised on its website a separate business called Sugar-Daddy.net. What is removing the whip? This business offered people introductions to wealthy individuals, saying: ""We can introduce you to your very own sugar daddy and solve your money worries. ""Whether you're a boy, girl, straight or gay, there's a sugar daddy for you."" Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, has now launched a petition calling on the prime minister to withdraw the whip from Mr Wallis. Her petition says: ""Let's be clear: sugar daddy is a euphemism for something deeply ugly: exploitation of women by powerful men. ""The Tories should feel ashamed sitting alongside Jamie Wallis. The only way to show they don't condone this kind of behaviour is to remove the whip."" Jess Phillips: ""Let's be clear: sugar daddy is a euphemism for something deeply ugly Labour's Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi backed Ms Phillips' call to remove the whip from Mr Wallis Ms Phillips, a well known women's rights campaigner, is one of the Labour MPs hoping to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party. Labour's Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi backed Ms Phillips' call to remove the whip from Mr Wallis. She said she was ""really concerned"" about Mr Wallis and added that ""his track record is very dubious"". ""I'm concerned the Conservatives are not doing a simple Google search to have a look to see what their candidates are like,"" she said. ""Jamie Wallis has been known to the Tory party, he has stood as a candidate in Ogmore previously and I think people like him should not be members of parliament."" Mr Wallis resigned his directorships of a number of companies including Quickie Divorce Ltd, a short time after December's general election. According to Companies House, he remains a person with significant control of the company, owning voting rights of 75% or more. Mr Wallis and the Conservative Party have been approached for a response. Mr Wallis toldBuzzFeed,external: ""Online queries indicate the sugar-daddy.net website was registered in 2004 and ceased to be operational in 2010. ""The site appears to have been owned and operated by a company named SD Billing Services Limited. For the avoidance of any doubt, I have never had a financial interest, nor been a director of SD Billing services Limited and cannot comment on its operational activities."" Mr Wallis has also rejected the information provided about complaints to Bridgend trading standards relating to the companies where he was director. He has rejected them as ""nonsense"" and says his former businesses are considering legal action against the local authority.

"Harry Dunn extradition bid 'inappropriate', says USThe US State Department says it would be an ""abuse"" to send suspect Anne Sacoolas back to the UK.Northampton","Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The United States has criticised the UK's request to extradite an American accused of killing motorcyclist Harry Dunn, calling it ""highly inappropriate"". Mr Dunn, 19, died after being hit by a car allegedly driven by suspect Anne Sacoolas, who left the country for the US claiming diplomatic immunity. The Home Officesubmitted a request on Fridayto extradite her to the UK. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said she will ""100% be coming back"". ""I have no doubt in my mind, the only thing I can't tell you is when,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""This campaign won't stop until Anne Sacoolas is back in the UK facing the justice system. There is no celebration and until she is back, we won't rest. ""This lady is accused of taking Harry's life, then fleeing the country. No-one is above the law in modern society. You don't get to move to a country, break a law in that country and then leave."" Mr Seiger said that under the circumstances, the family was ""really pleased"" the UK authorities had taken the ""huge step towards justice"", but if the Trump administration was to ignore or reject the request, it would be re-presented should another administration come into power. This video can not be played Radd Seiger: Anne Sacoolas will ""100% be coming back...the only thing I can't tell you is when'' The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Is extraditing Anne Sacoolas a realistic prospect? Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 The crash happened outside RAF Croughton, where Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas. The 42-year-old left the UK shortly after the crash on 27 August and returned to the US, prompting a justice campaign by the teenager's parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn. Mrs Sacoolas was charged in December by the Crown Prosecution Service with causing death by dangerous driving and the Home Office submitted its extradition request to the US Department of Justice. A spokeswoman for the US State Department said: ""It is the position of the United States government that a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an abuse. ""The use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent."" Charlotte Charles told reporters the charging decision was a ""huge step"" Harry Dunn death extradition request made to US Harry Dunn's friends protest outside RAF base US woman to be charged over Harry Dunn crash death Foreign & Commonwealth Office Tributes paid to 'unique' woman, 49, found dead in River Nene near Northampton â as family questions 'non-suspicious' ruling 10 more motorists sentenced in court after drink drive crackdown in Northamptonshire over Christmas Tickets now on sale for Sing For Cransley!

Iran admission an 'important first step' - PMBoris Johnson calls for repatriation of victims and an independent international investigation.UK,"Britain has condemned the arrest of the UK ambassador to Iran as a ""flagrant violation of international law"". Rob Macaire was detained for a short time on Saturday night after attending a vigil for those who died when Iran's military shot down a passenger plane. He left the vigil when it turned into a protest but was later accused of helping to organise the demonstrations. Iran said he was ""an unknown foreigner in an illegal gathering"" and summoned him to the foreign ministry on Sunday. In a statement, Iran's foreign ministry said Mr Macaire was ""reminded"" that his presence at ""illegal gatherings contravened"" the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mr Macaire was understood to have protested strongly that his detention was unjustified. Our correspondent says Mr Macaire made clear any suggestion that he was involved in demonstrations was completely untrue, and he was attending an event advertised as a vigil for the victims of Wednesday's crash -which killed 176 people, including four Britons. Iran faces watershed moment Iran admits 'unintentionally' shooting down plane What we know about the Iran plane crash Earlier, Iran's deputy foreign minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, who denied Mr Macaire was detained, said in a tweet that he thought it ""impossible"" when police first told him that the UK ambassador had been arrested. A phone conversation confirmed Mr Macaire's identity and he was released 15 minutes later, Mr Araghchi added. Mr Macaire has denied taking part in protests and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned his arrest. He was arrested and held for three hours when he stopped at a barber shop for a haircut on his way back to the UK embassy. In a tweet,externalthe ambassador said he was attending the vigil because it was ""normal to want to pay respects"", adding that some of the victims were British. The ambassador added: ""Arresting diplomats is of course illegal, in all countries."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned Mr Macaire's arrest in a joint statement following a phone call on Sunday, in which they discussed their ""shared interests in ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon"". And Security Minister Brandon Lewis said on Sunday that the UK ambassador's arrest was ""totally unacceptable"" and a breach of the 1961 Vienna Convention. ""Iran does need to step back from that kind of activity and play a proper part in working with partners to de-escalate,"" Mr Lewis told Sky's Sophy Ridge. Under the convention, diplomats cannot be detained. The Foreign Office is to demand a full explanation. In a statement issued on Saturday night Mr Raab added: ""The arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law. ""The Iranian government is at a cross-roads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to deescalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards.""

Protesters had taken to the streets in Iran's capital, Tehran, to vent anger at officials, calling them liars for having denied, then admitting, shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane. Iran had initially denied responsibility for the plane crash, but on Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani admitted Iranian military had ""unintentionally"" shot down the passenger plane after mistaking it for a cruise missile when it turned towards a sensitive military site. President Rouhani said the missile strike was an ""unforgivable mistake"". The crash came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Mr Johnson said Iran's admission was an ""important first step"" and called for an investigation into the ""tragic accident"". And writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Raab said,externalit was time for Tehran ""to come to the negotiating table to resolve all of Iran's issues of international concern."" He said Iran ""must stop pursuing a nuclear weapon, end its support for terrorism, and release the foreign nationals and dual nationals it cruelly holds"". This video can not be played Footage appears to show missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the shooting down of the passenger plane by Iran was ""an appalling act, and part of a whole pattern of appalling acts all across the region"". The Queen has also sent a message of condolence to the Governor-General of Canada - where the majority of the passengers on the flight were headed. Out of the 176 victims on board the Kyiv-bound flight, 138 had listed Canada as their eventual destination. The Queen said she and the Duke of Edinburgh were ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"". The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall added their condolences, saying they were ""utterly horrified"" by the disaster. Britons Mohammed Reza Kadkhoda Zadeh, Sam Zokaei and Saeed Tahmasebi were all on board Four Britons were on board the Ukrainian passenger plane. Three have been namedas Mohammed Reza Kadkhoda Zadeh, who owned a dry cleaners in West Sussex, BP engineer Sam Zokaei from Twickenham, and PhD student and engineer Saeed Tahmasebi, who lived in Dartford.

DUP and Sinn FÃ©in back in top jobs at StormontArlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill appointed first and deputy first ministers of Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland,"Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP have re-entereddevolved government in Northern Irelandafter three years of deadlock. DUP leader Arlene Foster was appointed as Northern Ireland's first minister, while Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill is deputy first minister on Saturday. The two parties supporteda deal to restore Stormont's political institutions. Stormont's power-sharing coalition, led by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, collapsed in January 2017. How the parties got a done deal What's in the draft Stormont deal? Three years of political deadlock at Stormont This video can not be played Arlene Foster says parties must work for everyone The first minister comes from the largest party in the assembly and deputy first minister is from the second-largest party. The positions are known as a ""diarchy"" which means they are equal and govern together. The deputy first minister is not subordinate to the first minister, despite the title. Addressing the assembly, Mrs Foster said the politicians have ""many differences"". ""Michelle's narrative of the past 40 years could not be more different to mine,"" she said. ""I'm not sure we will ever agree on much about the past, but we can agree there was too much suffering, and that we cannot allow society to drift backwards and allow division to grow."" She added that it was ""time for Stormont to move forward"". This video can not be played Michelle O'Neill addresses the new NI Assembly Michelle O'Neill said it was her ""sincere wish that 2020 brings real change"". She also pledged to immediately resolve the pay parity row that has led toindustrial strike action among health workers. She said: ""I see no contradiction in declaring and delivering on our firm commitment to power sharing with unionism in the Stormont Assembly while also initiating a mature and inclusive debate about new political arrangements which examine Ireland's future beyond Brexit. ""Similarly, there is no contradiction in unionism working the existing constitutional arrangements while taking its rightful place in the conversation about what a new Ireland would look like. ""We can do this while maintaining our independent distinct political identities and working in the best interests of all of the people."" Both prime ministers have welcomed the restoration of devolved government at Stormont The prime minister called it a ""momentous day"". ""The parties of Northern Ireland have shown great leadership in coming together to accept this fair and balanced deal in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland,"" Boris Johnson said. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar commended Northern Ireland's political parties ""for their decision to put the people they represent first and make measured compromises to reach a deal"". ""I look forward to working with representatives in Northern Ireland as they begin working together again on behalf of all people in Northern Ireland,"" he said. Analysis by BBC News NI political reporter Jayne McCormack The first day back was always going to bring its challenges - but despite some malfunctioning microphones, events in the chamber moved at pace. The surprising move by the DUP to support a Sinn FÃ©in speaker instead of the SDLP, already has some sceptics suspecting not much has changed when it comes to how the two biggest parties operated in the last mandate. But there's no denying Parliament Buildings has a buzz about it again. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill now have to prove that they can share power and deliver on the commitments in the new Stormont deal. The SDLP, Alliance and Ulster Unionists are back in the executive too - a sign they would rather be helping take decisions, than stuck outside looking in. After the session ended, the new ministers were immediately met by their departmental officials: the task of getting down to business starts now. Reacting to the return of Stormont, former Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams said the assembly provided a place to ""moderate differences, and to define common ground"". ""It doesn't have to be back on the streets, it doesn't have to be these mad radio talk programmes, it doesn't have to be who shouts and yells the loudest,"" Mr Adams told RTÃ's Week in Politics programme. All five main parties in Northern Ireland - the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance, SDLP and UUP - have joined the new executive. MLAs - members of the legislative assembly - met at Stormont on Saturday. Their first item of business at Stormont on Saturday was the election of Sinn FÃ©in's Alex Maskey as the assembly's new speaker. The DUP's Christopher Stalford; UUP's Roy Beggs and SDLP's Patsy McGlone are his three deputies. Gordon Lyons (DUP) and Declan Kearney (Sinn FÃ©in) will serve as junior ministers. Alliance leader Naomi Long accepted the position of justice minister. She said it followed conversations with Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill on Friday night. Mrs Long said she was ""honoured to have the support of all sides of the house"". With the exception of the role of justice minister, the posts are shared out using a system called D'Hondt, in which ministerial posts are allocated according to parties' representation in the assembly. The other members of the executive are: Minister for the economy: Diane Dodds (DUP) Minister for education: Peter Weir (DUP) Minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs: Edwin Poots (DUP) Minister for communities: Deirdre Hargey (Sinn FÃ©in) Minister for finance: Conor Murphy (Sinn FÃ©in) Minister for health: Robin Swann (UUP) Minister for infrastructure: Nichola Mallon (SDLP) The d'Hondt mechanism is used to appoint almost all the ministerial departments in the executive - meaning the departments are shared round the parties based on how many MLAs they have. Justice is different though - it is elected by a cross-community vote. This is because when the Northern Ireland Executive was first created in 1999 it was considered that it was not yet appropriate to devolve policing and justice powers. There was still a tense security situation and so those powers remained at Westminster. In 2010 a deal was struck to devolve justice, but the DUP did not want a Sinn FÃ©in minister to be able to hold the post. Instead it was agreed any justice minister required a cross-community vote. Robin Swann stood down as UUP leader in October due to family commitments A big surprise was the appointment of Robin Swann as health minister. It comes just three months after the UUP North Antrim MLA stepped down as party leader due to the impact the role was having on his ""role as a husband and a father"". He told the BBC that the party considered health a major priority and ""when we had the chance to take it, we did"". Mr Swann said he was going to hold the first and deputy first ministers to account and would not let them ""play party politics with health"". Relations between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had deteriorated in recent years as the two parties were diametrically opposed not only on Northern Ireland's position within the UK, but also issues such as the Irish language; same-sex marriage; abortion and how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. But unexpectedly it was a row over a green energy scheme which pushed their relationship past breaking point. TheRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) schemewas set up by DUP leader Arlene Foster when she was enterprise minister, but it ran over budget and at one point threatened to cost taxpayers Â£490m. Sinn FÃ©in demanded that Mrs Foster step aside as first minister during an inquiry into the RHI scheme and when she refused, theypulled out of government on 9 January 2017. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish language act and the petition of concern. The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. The new deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The deal would see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster-Scots commissioner. Earlier, Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge welcomed the deal as an ""historic advancement"" but added it ""falls very much short"" of promises for an Irish Language act. Other key points in the deal includethe Northern Ireland Executive settling an ongoing pay dispute with nurses and increasing policing numbers.

Surprising revelations in this tiny Turner show âââââ,"Apparently, the great British romantic painter JMW Turner (1775-1851) once said if he could have his life again he would have been an architect: a statement that is as good an argument as any I've heard against reincarnation. That's not to say London's finest landscape artist couldn't have become a decent architect from a technical point of view. He knew his way around a set of plans having been apprenticed to an architect in his early teens, and would regularly include grand buildings in his paintings. But design is only a small part of the art of architecture. The real work is done in wooing and cajoling clients, compromising to accommodate their wishes, and working within a budget that is typically about as fit for purpose as an honest thief. The famously irascible, opinionated, singular genius that was the barber's son from Covent Garden would have fallen out with more customers than the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have with family members. The chances of him running a successful architectural practice would have been zero, added to which we wouldn't have his extraordinary art to enjoy. There is one place, though, where, for the first time since 1826, we can have a glimpse into a world where Turner the would-be architect and Turner the supreme painter of light and atmosphere, coexist. It involves a trip to suburban Twickenham in south-west London to visit a small but perfectly formed Georgian house that Turner himself designed between 1807-13 (with a little help from his friend, the renowned architect, Sir John Soane). The great landscape artist designed this small villa, Sandycombe Lodge, near the Thames at Twickenham between 1807-13 William Daniell's etching of JMW Turner when he was 25 years old, is at the artist's house Sandycombe Lodge is his one and only realised building - or three-dimensional artwork as those wishing to elevate its status might say - and as such gives us two insights. Firstly, Turner's architectural tastes were as conservative as his paintings were radical. And secondly, he was, at heart, a modest man. It is a bijou property on what was a sizeable plot, which the 32-year-old Turner bought to build his bolthole from the hurly burly of central London life. He was already a very successful artist with a pad in Harley Street to which he had attached his own commercial art gallery. He liked the idea of owning a des-res in what the poet James Thomson described as ""the matchless vale of the Thames"" - the riverside area seen from Richmond Hill taking in Kew, Twickenham, Isleworth and Richmond. It was the Cotswolds of the day, the trendy place where the rich and famous would ""weekend"" and fill their palatial houses with glamorous guests. Turner being Turner and a contrary sort of fellow, went tiny where others - such as his old Royal Academy president Sir Joshua Reynolds - went very large. Turner wasn't interested in impressing anybody, he was interested in the light of the Thames, a river to which he had spent his life living in close proximity. He'd invite a few mates to stay (including, somewhat surprisingly, the Duc d'OrlÃ©ans, later Louis Philippe, King of France), take them fishing, ask them to join his ""Pic-nic-Academical Club"", and discuss poetry. Turner designed the villa so he could see the river from this bedroom window There is no evidence he painted with oils there, but he certainly sketched and probably went out on his specially made boat-cum-studio to paint in watercolours. What is without doubt is his lifelong artistic relationship with the River Thames, an important motif most famously evident in his magnificent masterpiece Rain, Steam and Speed (1844). It is, along with The Fighting Temeraire (1839), a painting that cements Turner as one of the most popular artists in the UK and beyond. They are both late works but you can see their origins in some earlier oil sketches he produced while living in Isleworth, which have been borrowed from the Tate Gallery and are now presented in a pocket-sized exhibition at Sandycombe Lodge. Turner's Rain, Steam, and Speed, 1844, isn't in the show (along with The Fighting Temeraire), but you can see how they were influenced by the early sketches The Fighting Temeraire, 1839 (not in the show), shows the final journey of this important warship, as it's towed along the Thames to Rotherhithe, where it was to be scrapped It is the first time since the artist sold his Twickenham home nearly 200 years ago that any of his original paintings have hung on its walls. They are displayed in an upstairs guest bedroom, which is not very big, but then nor are the sketches. There are five paintings in total, all on mahogany, one more warped than a 12 inch vinyl left out in the sun. They are described as ""experimental, private works"", which is code for not first-rate. No matter, they are fascinating to see. The largest, Walton Reach (1805), hangs over the fireplace. It is the least good of those on show, with a vertical clump of black/grey cloud hovering like a spaceship in the middle of the sky. Walton Reach, 1805, is one of the five rarely shown oil sketches that the Tate has loaned to Turner's House for this exhibition Constable would have laughed himself silly at his great rival's ham-fisted attempt to paint a meteorological effect. But then his eyes would have glanced to the left of the painting and seen Turner bang in form as river morphs into trees that lead to a heavenly pink sky obscuring a sun behind. There's a lovely, quickly painted, sketch The Thames near Windsor (1807), which CÃ©zanne would have admired for its palette and abstracted simplicity. Another, On the Thames (1807), also has a proto-Impressionist feel as Turner captures light effects in real time. The Thames near Windsor c.1807 On the Thames c.1807, like the other four works, was selected by Turner's House for depicting scenes close to the artist's house near the river The two stand-out sketches are Sunset on the River (1805), which is beautiful, and Windsor Castle from the River (1807), which benefits from having been primed with white paint giving it a lustre and luminosity the others don't share. Both are clearly a foretaste of what is to come in Turner's later years. Sunset on the River is an obvious precursor to Turner's Fighting Temeraire with the sun going down behind thin orange clouds, evoking the romantic nostalgia that makes his later masterpiece such a mesmerising artwork. Windsor Castle from the River points towards Rain, Steam and Speed: a ghostly structure barely visible in the background, partially hidden behind the atmospheric effects of Thames water merging into hazy cloud. Bathed in light, Turner's Sunset on the River, 1805, is a forerunner of his Fighting Temeraire Windsor Castle from the River, 1807 The sketches are not masterpieces, nobody is going to pay millions of pounds to own them or view them (Â£8 entry to the house and exhibition), but they are well worth seeing: on their own terms and also as a way of understanding how Turner worked and developed as an artist. That they are in the house he designed for himself is an added bonus: there's a lot to be said for quiet modesty in this overwrought, over-excited century. It was an escape for Turner then. It can be an escape for you now.

"'We're devastated, Mothercare was our family'Hundreds of British shops will shut for the final time this weekend, including the final Mothercare stores.","Mothercare sales advisers Karen (L) and Sue (R) have worked in the Romford store for years ""We're devastated. It's not just a job, it's a family."" Karen and Sue have known each other since they were nine years old, and will work their final shifts at Mothercare's Romford store this weekend. All of the baby goods retailer's 79 UK shops will be shut by Sunday, with thousands of jobs lost across the countryafter the firm called in administrators last November. Like many struggling retailers, Mothercare found itself squeezed by the big UK supermarkets, fast fashion brands and the internet. Having worked part-time at the Romford shop for 19 and 27 years respectively, Karen and Sue have seen customer numbers decreasing. ""You don't see regular customers anymore, you see bargain hunters. As soon as it's reduced, it's gone,"" says Karen. On Friday, customers queued outside before the doors of the Romford store opened. They made their way around heavily-discounted goods from clothes, carry cots and high chairs to office equipment such as staplers, hole punches and even the store's shelving units. Karen decided to avoid working the final day in the shop on Saturday. ""It's just too much,"" says Sue, wearing a specially-made T-shirt by the Romford staff. On the back, it reads: ""We are family"". For now, the staff try to keep their spirits up, playing Coldplay over the loudspeakers and lighting up sectioned-off, empty parts of the store with disco lights. Mothercare workers won't be the only ones affected by store closures in early 2020, as tough trading conditions for retailers continue. Fifteen Links of London shops will also close their doors by Sunday,affecting up to 350 jobs. Department store chain Debenhams will have closed 22 of its shops by the end of January,resulting in 660 jobs being lost. Department store chains such as Debenhams have been struggling A further 28 Debenhams stores are due to close within the next five years, as the ailing chain tries to secure its future. It comes as part of a rescue plan introduced after its previous owners had saddled it with a huge amount of debt, while it was tied into long leases for its large properties. The number of job losses in retail overall is also increasing. Figures from the Centre for Retail Research suggest that a total of 143,128 job losses,externalin the sector were announced in 2019. That's an increase of more than 25,000 from the previous year. Previous research by the British Retail Consortium also warnedthat there would be up to 900,000 fewer jobs in retail over the next decade. Hardly a week goes by without an announcement about a fresh wave of store closures. A net 1,234 stores shut on Britain's top 500 High Streets in the first half of 2019,according to research by PwC and the Local Data Company,external. That is up from 1,123 in the same period the previous year and the highest since the survey began in 2010. The data looks at retail chains with more than five outlets. Fashion stores saw the largest number of closures. Womenswear retailers were among those to have fallen on hard times in 2019,including chains such as BonmarchÃ©which has entered administration and is to close 30 stores. As firms issue updates after the crucial Christmas trading period, further closures could be announced. In the last few years, things have become a lot harder for traditional retailers. Companies have had to deal with rising costs such as increasing wages, rents and business rates.Research by Retail Economics suggests,externalthat operating costs have been increasing at a faster rate than sales for many shops. Richard Lim, its chief executive, said: ""Because the National Living Wage has risen at such pace, retailers are focusing on whether or not they can reduce labour costs by using things like automated checkouts. He added: ""That leaves fewer workers in retail, but those that are, are paid better wages."" At the same time, retailers are trying to adapt to changing shopping habits. One in every Â£5 is now spent online.

Surprising revelations in this tiny Turner show âââââAn exhibition of little-known JMW Turner works has opened at the house he built near the Thames.,"Apparently, the great British romantic painter JMW Turner (1775-1851) once said if he could have his life again he would have been an architect: a statement that is as good an argument as any I've heard against reincarnation. That's not to say London's finest landscape artist couldn't have become a decent architect from a technical point of view. He knew his way around a set of plans having been apprenticed to an architect in his early teens, and would regularly include grand buildings in his paintings. But design is only a small part of the art of architecture. The real work is done in wooing and cajoling clients, compromising to accommodate their wishes, and working within a budget that is typically about as fit for purpose as an honest thief. The famously irascible, opinionated, singular genius that was the barber's son from Covent Garden would have fallen out with more customers than the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have with family members. The chances of him running a successful architectural practice would have been zero, added to which we wouldn't have his extraordinary art to enjoy. There is one place, though, where, for the first time since 1826, we can have a glimpse into a world where Turner the would-be architect and Turner the supreme painter of light and atmosphere, coexist. It involves a trip to suburban Twickenham in south-west London to visit a small but perfectly formed Georgian house that Turner himself designed between 1807-13 (with a little help from his friend, the renowned architect, Sir John Soane). The great landscape artist designed this small villa, Sandycombe Lodge, near the Thames at Twickenham between 1807-13 William Daniell's etching of JMW Turner when he was 25 years old, is at the artist's house Sandycombe Lodge is his one and only realised building - or three-dimensional artwork as those wishing to elevate its status might say - and as such gives us two insights. Firstly, Turner's architectural tastes were as conservative as his paintings were radical. And secondly, he was, at heart, a modest man. It is a bijou property on what was a sizeable plot, which the 32-year-old Turner bought to build his bolthole from the hurly burly of central London life. He was already a very successful artist with a pad in Harley Street to which he had attached his own commercial art gallery. He liked the idea of owning a des-res in what the poet James Thomson described as ""the matchless vale of the Thames"" - the riverside area seen from Richmond Hill taking in Kew, Twickenham, Isleworth and Richmond. It was the Cotswolds of the day, the trendy place where the rich and famous would ""weekend"" and fill their palatial houses with glamorous guests. Turner being Turner and a contrary sort of fellow, went tiny where others - such as his old Royal Academy president Sir Joshua Reynolds - went very large. Turner wasn't interested in impressing anybody, he was interested in the light of the Thames, a river to which he had spent his life living in close proximity. He'd invite a few mates to stay (including, somewhat surprisingly, the Duc d'OrlÃ©ans, later Louis Philippe, King of France), take them fishing, ask them to join his ""Pic-nic-Academical Club"", and discuss poetry. Turner designed the villa so he could see the river from this bedroom window There is no evidence he painted with oils there, but he certainly sketched and probably went out on his specially made boat-cum-studio to paint in watercolours. What is without doubt is his lifelong artistic relationship with the River Thames, an important motif most famously evident in his magnificent masterpiece Rain, Steam and Speed (1844). It is, along with The Fighting Temeraire (1839), a painting that cements Turner as one of the most popular artists in the UK and beyond. They are both late works but you can see their origins in some earlier oil sketches he produced while living in Isleworth, which have been borrowed from the Tate Gallery and are now presented in a pocket-sized exhibition at Sandycombe Lodge. Turner's Rain, Steam, and Speed, 1844, isn't in the show (along with The Fighting Temeraire), but you can see how they were influenced by the early sketches The Fighting Temeraire, 1839 (not in the show), shows the final journey of this important warship, as it's towed along the Thames to Rotherhithe, where it was to be scrapped It is the first time since the artist sold his Twickenham home nearly 200 years ago that any of his original paintings have hung on its walls. They are displayed in an upstairs guest bedroom, which is not very big, but then nor are the sketches. There are five paintings in total, all on mahogany, one more warped than a 12 inch vinyl left out in the sun. They are described as ""experimental, private works"", which is code for not first-rate. No matter, they are fascinating to see. The largest, Walton Reach (1805), hangs over the fireplace. It is the least good of those on show, with a vertical clump of black/grey cloud hovering like a spaceship in the middle of the sky. Walton Reach, 1805, is one of the five rarely shown oil sketches that the Tate has loaned to Turner's House for this exhibition Constable would have laughed himself silly at his great rival's ham-fisted attempt to paint a meteorological effect. But then his eyes would have glanced to the left of the painting and seen Turner bang in form as river morphs into trees that lead to a heavenly pink sky obscuring a sun behind. There's a lovely, quickly painted, sketch The Thames near Windsor (1807), which CÃ©zanne would have admired for its palette and abstracted simplicity. Another, On the Thames (1807), also has a proto-Impressionist feel as Turner captures light effects in real time. The Thames near Windsor c.1807 On the Thames c.1807, like the other four works, was selected by Turner's House for depicting scenes close to the artist's house near the river The two stand-out sketches are Sunset on the River (1805), which is beautiful, and Windsor Castle from the River (1807), which benefits from having been primed with white paint giving it a lustre and luminosity the others don't share. Both are clearly a foretaste of what is to come in Turner's later years. Sunset on the River is an obvious precursor to Turner's Fighting Temeraire with the sun going down behind thin orange clouds, evoking the romantic nostalgia that makes his later masterpiece such a mesmerising artwork. Windsor Castle from the River points towards Rain, Steam and Speed: a ghostly structure barely visible in the background, partially hidden behind the atmospheric effects of Thames water merging into hazy cloud. Bathed in light, Turner's Sunset on the River, 1805, is a forerunner of his Fighting Temeraire Windsor Castle from the River, 1807 The sketches are not masterpieces, nobody is going to pay millions of pounds to own them or view them (Â£8 entry to the house and exhibition), but they are well worth seeing: on their own terms and also as a way of understanding how Turner worked and developed as an artist. That they are in the house he designed for himself is an added bonus: there's a lot to be said for quiet modesty in this overwrought, over-excited century. It was an escape for Turner then. It can be an escape for you now.

Five prison officers injured in attack by inmateAll five prison officers were taken to hospital after being attacked at HMP Bristol.,"The attack happened at HMP Bristol on Friday afternoon Five prison officers have been injured in an attack by an inmate. The attack happened at HMP Bristol on Friday at 14:00 GMT and all five officers ""received hospital treatment"", a Prison Service spokeswoman said. Sarah Rigby, from the Prison Officers Association (POA), said the prisoner had been transferred from a high-security jail. The Prison Service said it was investing in staff safety by issuing bodycams and pepper spray. Ms Rigby said the inmate ""should never have been moved out of the high-security establishment"". She said those injured had left hospital and were recovering at home and added: ""Staff at HMP Bristol have not yet been issued with PAVA [pepper spray] and rigid bar handcuffs and it is possible that the PAVA particularly could have protected staff better during this incident. ""The POA again wishes to reiterate that the employer must issue this protective equipment at the earliest opportunity to offer better protections for the staff carrying out their duties in a dangerous, hostile environment."" An Avon and Somerset Police spokeswoman said they were investigating an assault. She said the prison officers were ""taken to hospital for treatment to injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening"" and added: ""A suspect was detained by prison staff and is due to be questioned by police officers."" HMP Bristol has about 520 adult male prisoners and a limited number of young offenders, both convicted and on remand from local courts.

Taiwan's Tsai wins second presidential termPresident Tsai Ing-wen sweeps to victory in an election dominated by relations with mainland China.Asia,"Tsai Ing-wen has told China to abandon its threat of force Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has secured a second term after sweeping to victory in an election dominated by the island's relationship with China. Ms Tsai secured just over 57% of the ballot - a record 8.2m votes - well ahead of her rival Han Kuo-yu. Ms Tsai opposes closer ties with China, with Mr Han suggesting they would bring economic benefits. In her victory speech, Ms Tsai told China to abandon its threat to take back the island by force. Ms Tsai told a news conference: ""Taiwan is showing the world how much we cherish our free democratic way of life and how much we cherish our nation."" China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. It says Taiwan must eventually be reunited with China, by force if necessary. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Taiwan loses another ally as Kiribati cuts ties How Taiwanâs Tsai stayed one step ahead Ms Tsai said China should now drop that threat. ""Peace means that China must abandon threats of force against Taiwan,"" she said in the capital Taipei. ""I also hope that the Beijing authorities understand that democratic Taiwan, and our democratically elected government, will not concede to threats and intimidation."" Eight million votes is an extraordinary tally for a Taiwanese President seeking a second term. The record-breaking win has delivered a landslide mandate to Ms Tsai, and a major snub to Beijing. It was the emergence of Taiwan's relationship with China as the central issue in this campaign that allowed her to revive her flagging fortunes. And in her victory there is a certain political irony. Beijing's rigid, authoritarian vision of a Greater China, united on its terms, has been wholeheartedly rejected in the one place actually given the opportunity to vote on the concept. And had the Communist Party not turned up the pressure on Taiwan, had its approach to the crisis in Hong Kong been subtler, the path to victory for a candidate it wanted so much to thwart may have been much less certain. After the result was announced I asked Tsai Ing-wen whether she had the Chinese President Xi Jinping to thank for her victory. She smiled. The US hailed President Tsai's victory as a demonstration of Taiwan's ""robust democratic system"". ""Under her leadership we hope Taiwan will continue to serve as a shining example for countries that strive for democracy, prosperity and a better path for their people,"" the US State Department said. Mr Han, the Kuomintang party candidate, had earlier admitted defeat as the results became clear. ""I have called President Tsai to congratulate her. She has a new mandate for the next four years,"" he told a crowd in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Han Kuo-yo had favoured closer ties with China Ahead of the vote, Ms Tsai was leading in the polls as voters watched the way in which Beijing handled pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Her stance was popular with those who fear Taiwan being overtaken by mainland China. In the final count she secured 1.3m more votes than in her 2016 victory. President Tsai insists Taiwan's future should be decided by its 23 million people. Voters were also choosing the next members of the Taiwanese legislature, where Ms Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has had a majority. Supporters of Han Kuo-yu were devastated by the result Those who backed Tsai Ing-wen, however, were jubilant For practical purposes, Taiwan is an independent state - it has its own elected government, constitution and military. But China refuses to have diplomatic relations with any country that recognises Taiwan as a sovereign nation. All but a handful of countries have picked Beijing, butmost maintain an ambiguous relationship with Taiwanthrough trade. The US is also legally bound to supply Taiwan with the means to defend itself. This video can not be played China and its influence is a key issue in Taiwan's election Ms Tsai wants to ""maintain the existing mechanisms"", according toher website,external- meaning she does not want to compromise Taiwan's de facto independence. In a speech on the Hong Kong protests in June,external, she said ""anyone who tries to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy, or use them as political bargaining chips, will fail"". She had also rejected Taiwan ever operating under the ""one country, two systems"" political system used in Hong Kong since it returned to China in 1997 - calling it ""not viable"". Speaking to the BBC this week, she said Taiwan should ""learn a lesson"" from Hong Kong: ""If we don't insist [on maintaining Taiwan's independence], we'll be losing everything we have now."" Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female president Taiwan profile Mr Han and his party the Kuomintang (KMT) favour closer ties with China - which they say will bring economic growth - but do not seek unification. The KMT once ruled China, before fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 after losing to the communist forces in the civil war. Mr Han made a high-profile visit to Hong Kong and China in March, and has reportedly said a formal declaration of Taiwanese independence would be ""scarier than syphilis"". This video can not be played Three couples and a wedding to celebrate Taiwan marriage equality Although the economy has grown during Ms Tsai's presidency, exports have fallen and wage growth is sluggish. Saturday's presidential election was also the first since Taiwan became the first place in Asia tolegalise same-sex marriage.

Harry Dunn death extradition bid 'inappropriate',"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The United States has criticised the UK's request to extradite an American accused of killing motorcyclist Harry Dunn, calling it ""highly inappropriate"". Mr Dunn, 19, died after being hit by a car allegedly driven by suspect Anne Sacoolas, who left the country for the US claiming diplomatic immunity. The Home Officesubmitted a request on Fridayto extradite her to the UK. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said she will ""100% be coming back"". ""I have no doubt in my mind, the only thing I can't tell you is when,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""This campaign won't stop until Anne Sacoolas is back in the UK facing the justice system. There is no celebration and until she is back, we won't rest. ""This lady is accused of taking Harry's life, then fleeing the country. No-one is above the law in modern society. You don't get to move to a country, break a law in that country and then leave."" Mr Seiger said that under the circumstances, the family was ""really pleased"" the UK authorities had taken the ""huge step towards justice"", but if the Trump administration was to ignore or reject the request, it would be re-presented should another administration come into power. This video can not be played Radd Seiger: Anne Sacoolas will ""100% be coming back...the only thing I can't tell you is when'' The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Is extraditing Anne Sacoolas a realistic prospect? Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 The crash happened outside RAF Croughton, where Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas. The 42-year-old left the UK shortly after the crash on 27 August and returned to the US, prompting a justice campaign by the teenager's parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn. Mrs Sacoolas was charged in December by the Crown Prosecution Service with causing death by dangerous driving and the Home Office submitted its extradition request to the US Department of Justice. A spokeswoman for the US State Department said: ""It is the position of the United States government that a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an abuse. ""The use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent."" Charlotte Charles told reporters the charging decision was a ""huge step"" Harry Dunn death extradition request made to US Harry Dunn's friends protest outside RAF base US woman to be charged over Harry Dunn crash death Foreign & Commonwealth Office Tributes paid to 'unique' woman, 49, found dead in River Nene near Northampton â as family questions 'non-suspicious' ruling 10 more motorists sentenced in court after drink drive crackdown in Northamptonshire over Christmas Tickets now on sale for Sing For Cransley!

The d'Hondt mechanism is used to appoint almost all the ministerial departments in the executive - meaning the departments are shared round the parties based on how many MLAs they have. Justice is different though - it is elected by a cross-community vote. This is because when the Northern Ireland Executive was first created in 1999 it was considered that it was not yet appropriate to devolve policing and justice powers. There was still a tense security situation and so those powers remained at Westminster.  Naomi Long is the new justice minister In 2010 a deal was struck to devolve justice, but the DUP did not want a Sinn FÃ©in minister to be able to hold the post. Instead it was agreed any justice minister required a cross-community vote. With all the ministerial posts filled, Speaker Alex Maskey thanks the members and adjourns the assembly for the day. It's been quite a day.  This video can not be played Naomi Long elected NI justice minister Here are the new minsters: The DUP's Diane Dodds as Minister for the Economy.

Ms Armstrong says Mrs Long will make an effective justice minister and bring a wealth of experience to the executive.  Kellie Armstrong of Alliance nominates her party leader Paul Givan of the the DUP and Conor Murphy of Sinn FÃ©in both express their support for Mrs Long's nomination. Nichola Mallon of the SDLP says she wishes Mrs Long well, but she hopes that in future the post is not elected by a cross-community vote but appointed in the same way as other executive posts. Mr Murphy also made this point. The TUV's Jim Allister makes a point of order. He asks the newly-appointed speaker, Alex Maskey, if he would like to apologise to the assembly and withdraw a statement he made in 2018 ""when [he] referred to Northern Ireland as that putrid little statelet"".

Waller-Bridge auctions outfit for bushfires fund,"Waller-Bridge wore the outfit to the 77th Golden Globe Awards in Beverley Hills, California Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge has put her Golden Globes outfit up for auction on eBay to raise money for the Australian bushfire crisis. The 34-year-old wore the gold tuxedo from Australian designers Ralph & Russo at the awards ceremony, where she won two accolades for her TV comedy-drama. With a starting bid of 77,000 Australian dollars (Â£41,000), the auction is set to end on 20 January. Waller-Bridge is one of a number of celebrities to support the aid effort. Formula 1 world championLewis Hamilton said he will donate more than Â£380,000, while cricket legendShane Warne has raised A$1m (Â£528,514) for the bushfire appealafter his ""baggy green"" Australia cap was sold at auction. Leonardo DiCaprio's environmental group has donated 3 million US dollars (Â£2.3m) towards the relief effort, while Sir Elton John, actor Chris Hemsworth and Pink have also donated. Waller-Bridge's custom made tuxedo is closest to a UK size 12, according to the listing. She has also signed the label of the lace and silk trouser suit. Fleabag cast members Brett Gelman, Sian Clifford, Waller-Bridge and Andrew Scott pose with their Golden Globe for Best Television Series In a video shared on the official Fleabag Twitter account, the writer and actress showed fans where celebrities had touched the outfit, including Tom Hanks when he shook her hand, Sir Elton John giving her a hug and the shoulder where Olivia Colman ""rested her cheek"". ""Most significantly perhaps, if you are a Fleabag fan, this suit is completely covered head to toe in Andrew Scott hugs,"" she added. Money raised will be donated to the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief & Recovery Fund, WIRES Wildlife Rescue Emergency Fund and Wildlife Victoria.

"Harry and Meghan talks 'progressing well'The Sussexes hope talks over their future can be concluded ""sooner rather than later"", reports say.","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex hope talks over their future roles in the Royal Family can be concluded ""sooner rather than later"", a source has told PA news agency.

The family spent Christmas there, before returning to the UK on Tuesday after a six-week break from royal duties.

The Royal Family was said to be ""hurt"" at the couple's announcement about their plans to step back as senior royals. Palace sources have told BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond that Prince Harry and Meghan did not consult any other royal about making their personal statement. There had been talks within the Royal Family about the Sussexes' future - but they were at an early stage, he said. In their announcementon Wednesday evening, Prince Harry and Meghan revealed they intend ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially independent"". They plan to split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"".

How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life Former royal press secretary Dickie Arbiter said attempting to be ""half in and half out"" of the Royal Family had been tried before 30 years ago by the Earl and Countess of Wessex and ""it didn't work"". The pair both experienced difficulties pursuing careers in the private sector and are now full-time ""working royals"". ""You're either a royal or you're not a royal - you can't have one leg in one camp and another leg in another camp,"" Mr Arbiter said, adding that Prince Harry had a number of senior roles which could not be done in a ""half-hearted way"".

Last October, Prince Harry and Meghanpublicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight.

Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights,"This video can not be played What would Canadians think about welcoming the royal couple? Since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their intention to step back as ""senior"" royals and live part-time in North America, Canada has been aflutter. Will the royal couple make the great North their home? Where will they live? What will they do? While we do not know where they intend to settle, it was confirmed to the BBC's royal correspondent that Meghan had left for Canada. She and the prince had been in the UK to make their announcement, following a six-week Christmas holiday in greater Victoria, on Vancouver Island. Our correspondent said Buckingham Palace was ""blindsided"" by the couple's statement. Here's why we shouldn't be surprised by their interest in Canada. Meghan returns to Canada as Queen seeks solution Harry and Meghan step back: What we know so far Where do they get their money? The pair were spotted hiking in the woods outside of Victoria over the holidays, according to Canadian media. Musician David Foster, who is originally from the area, told the Daily Mail that he helped arrange for them to stayon the secluded estate of a friend.,externalHis wife Katherine McPhee went to secondary school with Meghan in Los Angeles.

Since then, international media has flocked to the city amid speculation that the couple may decide to settle there semi-permanently. ""There's media from across the country and around the world, and from your country from across the pond that are already looking to set up shop here,"" Scott Fee, the news director at local CHEK-TV, told BBC Breakfast. ""So the tabloids are en route if not already here."" A deluge of press is probably precisely not what the royal couple was hoping for. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghan publicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight, and they hinted at it in their recent announcement regarding their decision to live part-time in North America. ""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter,"" read their statement, which was posted on the couple's official Instagram on 8 January. Meghan has had close ties to Canada for many years, although she is an American citizen by birth and her mother lives in California. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry share a joke She lived in Toronto for six years while filming the television series Suits. During their courtship, Prince Harry visited her in her Seaton Village home, and she joined him at the 2017 Invictus Games, which were held in the city. Her ties to Toronto did not sever when she moved across the pond. The Mulroneys, Meghan Markle and her life among Toronto 'royalty' One of her closest friends, Jessica Mulroney, lives in Toronto with her husband, Ben Mulroney, the son of a former prime minister. Their three young children were even a part of Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding party. It has been speculated, but not confirmed, that baby Archie stayed with the Mulroney clan this week while Meghan and the prince flew to the UK. By and large, what Canada can offer the royal couple is a degree of privacy and informality that they are not afforded in the UK. Although Canadian media has certainly taken a keen interest in their exploits here, Canada just doesn't have the same tabloid culture or paparazzi as Britain or the US. The country also has a lot more secluded spots where they could, if they wanted to, hide away from the flash of bulbs. Don't think creepy log cabin in the woods - think luxurious estates on pristine lakes surrounded by pine trees, located on dirt roads that would make it difficult for caravans of photographers to follow their trail. It is telling that there was not a single paparazzi photograph of the couple during the six weeks they were on Vancouver Island. Allow Twitter content?

They certainly wouldn't be the first royal to make Canada their home. Prince Andrew, Prince Harry's paternal uncle who has come under scrutiny since the arrest and suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, spent six months on exchange at Lakefield College School, and maintained close ties with the school's community after leaving. Princess Patricia of Connaught, the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, lived in Canada with her parents when her father, Prince Arthur, was appointed the governor general. There, she was greatly beloved and her portrait was even used on the one-dollar banknote issued in 1917. Indeed, prior to 1952, all of Canada's governors-general were part of the British aristocracy, which has led some to speculate that Prince Harry could carry on the tradition. How they want to do their own thing In 2018, writing for the National Post, Tristan Hopper suggested that the Duke of Sussex should consider taking on the role. It's appointed by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister, to be her representative in the Canada. ""One of the chief pitfalls of the job of governor general is that it takes smart, ambitious Canadians and essentially imprisons them in a palace with strict instructions to do what they're told,"" he wrote. ""Prince Harry had lived his whole life in an unreal bubble of security and privilege where even the slightest partisan nod could yield a week's worth of Daily Mail headlines. If there's anyone who knows how to be clothed in immense power that they never, ever use, it's the House of Windsor."" This week, a poll conducted for the Postmedia newspaper chain by Dart and Maru/Blue Voice Canada also suggested that 60% of Canadians would approve if he were to become governor general. One thing the royal couple might need to consider is immigration laws. Canada is part of the Commonwealth and Prince Harry's grandmother the Queen is the head of state so although he will see her face on the currency, he's not a citizen. As a Briton, the prince is entitled to spend up to six months a year as a visitor in Canada - anything longer than that and he would have to apply for a visa. As an American citizen, the same rules apply for his wife. The couple have come under fire in the UK after the BBC revealed the palace was not informed of their decision to step down from most of their royal duties, and to seek to become financially independent. World's media split on royal move Writing in the Daily Mail, Piers Morgan said the couple wants to ""keep all the trappings of royal life without any of the hard, boring bits, and the right to cash in on their status however they choose"". But Canadian media has taken a decidedly more friendly tone. In the Globe and Mail, Anne Donahue expressed glee that the couple might be moving to Canada, and called their decision to step away from the royal circusa ""fairy-tale ending"",external. ""Meghan and Harry's choice to step back has sparked the type of change in which everybody wins. They've begun to help dismantle an institution that often seems a historical relic. And they're very publicly choosing to stop putting up with the nonsense, on their own dime and in their own way - a power move."" Not everyone is thrilled. On Friday, the Monarchist League of Canada cautioned Prince Harry and Meghan that ""any public support for their desire to occupy a new, hybrid role combining their royal status with more personal freedom could disappear quickly were there to develop a feeling that, even inadvertently, they had in some way showed disrespect to The Queen, whose style is self-effacing and whose watchword is duty."" But by and large, Canadians are pretty chuffed at the idea - and they're willing to sweeten the pot if it will help convince them to stay.

That promotion led to considerable backlash of its own. Some of the company's franchises have come under fire over staff wages, and for how they treat homeless patrons, and many took to Twitter to tell Tim Hortons their money should be going to the community, not the Sussexes. ""Wow, talk about tone-deaf. Sort out paying your workers a living wage before you start giving freebies to the rich,"" tweeted Erin Carson DeWolfe.

How might Harry and Meghan make money?,"Meghan and Harry have a global appeal, but how could they make money? The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have agreed to stop using their HRH titles as part of their plans to withdraw from royal duties and ""work to become financially independent"". BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said royals were usually excluded from doing paid work, but by setting aside their titles the couple had gained more freedom. ""Of course once you lose the title then you are no longer royal and special, and it may be that your brand is much less attractive to potential partners,"" he said. Your questions: Is Harry still sixth in line to the throne? Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? Jonny Dymond: How they want to do their own thing Public relations consultant Mark Borkowski said even without their titles, the couple are ""powerful A-listers in their own right, so they're going to attract a lot of attention"". Prince Harry and Meghan plan to split their time between the UK and North America - and their global reach could open up a wealth of opportunities. But how might they earn their financial independence and fund their charitable causes? An application to trademark the Sussex Royal brand was lodged by the couple in June last year, covering items such as books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising and campaigning. It raised the possibility of Prince Harry and Meghan launching their own lines of products, from beauty to clothing. But the agreement with the Queen has cast doubt on that idea. A brand incorporating the word ""royal"" may not be compatible with their agreement to step back from royal duties, while upholding ""the values of Her Majesty"". Journalist and royal style commentator Elizabeth Holmes says criticism for exploiting the royal connection is a risk in any commercial venture, adding: ""That's why I think they'll be careful about it."" Meghan is a royal patron of Smart Works and helped style women during a visit to the charity last year Even if they have to go back to the drawing board with the Sussex Royal name, Ms Holmes says: ""Any brand on the planet would want to work with them."" Whether it's a designer handbag orArchie's hand-knitted bobble hat, whenever the Sussexes are pictured with a product, sales go through the roof. We probably shouldn't expect the couple's 10.5 million Instagram followers to be suddenly bombarded with sponsored content and product placement though, Ms Holmes says. Brands hoping for boost from Meghanâs maternity style Why the fashion industry loves Meghan Markle While the royal couple have a huge platform, it pales in comparison to the likes of Kylie Jenner, who has more than 150 million Instagram followers. The reality TV star,who topped last year's Instagram rich list, is estimated to earn around $1.2m (Â£960,000) for a single sponsored post. Could Meghan and Harry follow that trend? Ms Holmes says: ""I don't think that's necessarily an appropriate thing for a member of the Royal Family."" The duke and duchess have said they plan to launch a charitable organisation to achieve ""progressive change"" through ""local and global community action"". Ms Holmes suggests any commercial partnerships would be tied to the couple's charitable causes, perhaps with a secondary opportunity to raise personal income. For example, Meghan is the patron ofa charity that provides free clothing and interview training to unemployed womenand has launched her own clothing line for the organisation. Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights Could royal couple's move make media intrusion worse? While the couple may be legally allowed to draw a salary from their charity, that is not the approach taken by some of their likely inspirations. Harry and Meghan said they ""researched the incredible work of many well-known and lesser-known foundations"" in drawing up their plans. Organisations such as the Clinton Foundation, the Obama Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have been suggested as potential models. But the Clintons say they draw no income or expenses from their charity, the Obamas are not listed among their foundation's highest-paid officers, and Mr and Mrs Gates famously use their organisation to give away wealth rather than to receive it. With Meghan first finding fame as an actress in the US television drama Suits, it is perhaps no surprise that some of the couple's first opportunities have come from the entertainment world. Harry has alreadyteamed up with US media mogul Oprah Winfrey on a series addressing mental health for Apple TV, which is due for broadcast in 2020. And when the duke and duchess announced their intention to ""step back"", it was revealed that Meghan has already signed a voiceover deal with Disney in return for a donation to an elephant conservation charity. Oprah Winfrey was a guest at the duke and duchess' wedding Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos has already expressed an interest in working with the couple. ""Who wouldn't be interested? Yes, sure,"" he said. That could represent a chance to follow in the steps of the Obamas, who signed a deal with the streaming video company to producedocumentaries and drama series about social and political issues. A similar deal could give the duke and duchess an opportunity to highlight causes close to their hearts. For Meghan, these include equality and women's rights, while Harry has been vocal in campaigning on mental health and military veterans' welfare. While the couple have spoken about their struggles with the intense media interest in their lives, the idea of revealing more about themselves in their own words might be more appealing - and lucrative. The 2017 book deal signed by Barack and Michelle Obamawas believed to be worth more than $60m (Â£48m). It's also an area Meghan has previously shown an interest in.In her introduction to last year's September issue of Vogue,external, which she guest edited, Meghan wrote of her ""love of writing"". Before she married Harry, she also ran a lifestyle blog, The Tig,where she shared beauty, fashion and travel tips. Michelle Obama's memoir sold more than 10 million copies in its first five months Natalie Jerome, a literary agent at Aevitas, says the couple have ""enormous power and reach"" and any book deal would be extremely lucrative. ""People have compared them to the Obamas and I think there's potentially some merit in that,"" she says. Meghan is an aspirational figure for many women of colour and young people, she adds. ""We're in a period now where we're talking increasingly about diversity within publishing and there's a real push to reach wider audiences,"" she says. ""If she were to publish a book in her own right and reach out to young people on the ground by doing talks and going to schools like Michelle Obama did, I think the book would be hugely successful."" Another potential avenue for the pair to explore could be after-dinner speeches and events. Jeremy Lee, director at speaking agency JLA, says if they maintained a positive profile the couple could earn six-figure sums for each appearance. He predicts demand would be higher in US, where Mr Lee says the pair could earn up to $500,000 (Â£380,000) per engagement. However, he says companies in the UK would be more sensitive to reputational risk if public opinion turned against the couple. Mr Lee predicts UK companies would only be willing to take the royals as speakers at an event linked to one of their campaigning interests, in return for a donation to their charitable foundation - rather than a fee - in the region of Â£100,000. But in the US, there would be interest from ""anybody that wants to show off and has got the budget"", he says.

Texas to reject new refugees under Trump order,"Greg Abbott said Texas had done ""more than its share"" for the refugee resettlement programme The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has said the state will not accept new refugees under the US government's resettlement programme. The decision means Texas will become the first state known to do so. Last year US President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing states to opt out of the programme. On Friday, Mr Abbott said Texas had done ""more than its share in assisting the refugee resettlement process"". Refugee agencies have criticised the move, with one calling it ""deeply disappointing"". US slashes refugee limit to all-time low of 18,000 Trump suspends US refugee programme Texas has large refugee populations in several of its major cities. In the 2018 fiscal year, Texas took in 1,697 refugees - more than any other state, but a large drop from 4,768 in the previous fiscal year. Justifying his decision in a letter to the US State Department, Mr Abbott argued that the state should be focused on ""those who are already here, including refugees, migrants, and the homeless - indeed, all Texans"". On that basis, Mr Abbott said he ""cannot consent to initial refugee resettlement"" in 2020, but added that the decision ""does not deny any refugee access"" to the US. Refugees who are already settled in other states, Mr Abbott said, will be allowed to move to Texas if they choose. However, resettlement agencies say they would not have access to federal resettlement benefits, such as housing. This video can not be played The Africans risking death in the jungle trying to reach the US In September last year,President Trump announced that states must actively consent to any resettlement of refugees,externalafter June 2020. So far, the governors of more than 40 other states have said they will opt in to the government programme. Why are more people fleeing home than ever before? The Africans risking death to reach the US Families caught in Trump's refugee clampdown Mr Trump has made reducing immigration a key aim of his administration. The president has slashed the number of refugees allowed into the country for the 2020 fiscal year to 18,000 - a record low. The Trump administration has taken a touch stance against immigration and refugees About 30,000 refugees were resettled in the US during the previous fiscal year. The previous lowest admissions figure was in 2002, after the 9/11 attacks, when about 27,000 refugees were allowed into the US. Since taking office in 2017, Mr Trump has sought to reduce the number of immigrants and refugees coming to the country. A controversial travel ban on mostly Muslim countries is one policy he has pursued to do so. The travel ban affects nationals from seven countries, five of which are majority Muslim: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. The other two are North Korea and Venezuela. Trump's executive order: Who does travel ban affect? The Associated Press reports that the Trump administration will seek to expand the travel ban,externalto additional countries, despite being repeatedly thwarted by legal challenges.

Analysis: How Harry and Meghan want to do their own thing,"This video can not be played Five things Harry and Meghan did differently There is the personal statement, in which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex explain their thinking behindstepping back from royal life. There is the beautifully produced website where the couple go into more detail about how they think the future will pan out. And beyond that there are questions, questions, questions and more questions. It doesn't take long for some pretty obvious contradictions to emerge.Three times in their statementthe couple say how much they look forward to serving the Queen. But the Queen was not given a chance to see their plans, let alone agree to them. The couple write on their website that they want to keep some royal duties (and presumably the royal titles that go along with those). But they also make clear, in some detail, that they are not prepared to go along with the agreed way that the media reports on royal activities. Ten questions answered as the Sussexes 'step back' Royals 'hurt' over Sussexes' announcement How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? Harry and Meghan seek to establish a separate organisation that will at times work with the palace, but they appear not to have spoken to anyone there about how this will work. They seek financial independence through earning a professional income. But nowhere do they acknowledge the risk of being accused of monetizing the royal brand. They want to establish a separate court that runs on their rules; but they believe they can remain members of the British monarchy, an organisation with a firmly fixed set of its own rules. The talk in some quarters is that the Sussexes' hand was forcedby the impressive scoop of the Sun newspaper,externalon Wednesday. If that's the case - and the couple's media strategy is certainly unconventional - it goes some way to explaining why there are many more questions than there are answers. But how did they get here? Those who have always had it in for Meghan put it down to her. But that's a long way from the truth. Harry's royal path has always been hard. There was the long shadow of his mother's early death, the media spotlight on his youthful mistakes and the extraordinary interest that his relationships and then his marriage sparked. Unlike his older brother Prince William, Harry has never grown used to media, and still visibly bridles at the cameras and the questions. And he is obviously - visibly - bored by the ceremonial side of the job. In short, he has long wanted out. And together with the woman he loves he now thinks he has found a way. But the manner of his leaving - their leaving - is breathtaking. Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight 'Freedom' or 'petulance'? World's media split on royal move In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together The palace rarely speaks at all about how members of the Royal Family feel about things. But a source told the BBC within hours of the announcement that senior members of the family were ""hurt"" - both the content of the statement and the way it was released, has cut very deep. And it will set off alarm bells about how the court of Harry and Meghan might operate in the future. If they release a statement of such import in the manner that they have when they are still under the umbrellas of the palace how will they act when they are thousands of miles away and far from the eyes of staff and family? The palace today is busy trying to work out how this new role might work. But they are well aware of the challenge and complexity, in particular over the issue of money. The truth is, it may not be possible to marry the palace's need for a degree of control with the duke and duchess' desire to do their own thing. A deeper and more formal split between the couple and the family may yet emerge.

Your questions: Is Harry still sixth in line to the throne?,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's decision to ""step back"" as senior members of the Royal Family has generated interest across the world. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are said to have ""blindsided"" Buckingham Palace with the announcement, which the couple said came after ""many months of reflection"". They saidthey intended to become financially independent while continuing to supportthe Queen. But what does it mean for their future? Will the duke still be in the line of succession? And what if the couple split up?BBC royal correspondent Sarah Campbellanswers readers' questions. Succession to the throne in the UK is not only due to birth, but also legislation. It would take an Act of Parliament to remove a person from the line of succession. Downing Street has so far said that questions on the duke and duchess's announcement are ""for the royal household"". The Royal Family tree and line of succession It is worth noting that, as the Cambridge family expands, Prince Harry will keep moving down the line of succession. Archie has no title - that was his parents' decision when he was born. He is simply Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. There is no suggestion the duke and duchess wish to renounce their titles. In full: Sussexes' statement and palace response Harry and Meghan step back: What will happen next? In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together He remains a member of the Royal Family - stepping back from duties does not change that. Moreover, what the couple plan to do has not been tried before, so there is no precedent to guide us. This rule applies to some applicants for British citizenship. We were told that Meghan was not going to be fast-tracked to get citizenship and it will take the same length of time for her as for anyone else. We are not aware she is a dual citizen as yet (as in, that she has a British passport). Buckingham Palace did not respond when asked whether the duchess's citizenship application would be affected by the announcement. Meghan has talked about the fact that, even though she was already in the public eye, she wasnot prepared for the huge press interestwhich came with marrying into the Royal Family. We simply do not know how much support the duke and duchess have been given, so it is difficult to say whether they should have been given more. The next Invictus Games is to be held this year in The Hague. The Invictus Games Foundation - with Prince Harry as patron - was established to preside over the games and, as it is a separate entity, it will continue regardless of what happens with Prince Harry's status within the Royal Family. It will remain one of his key commitments. 'Freedom' or 'petulance'? World's media split on royal move How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight Prince Edward and his wife the Countess of Wessex are now both working members of the Royal Family with a busy schedule of engagements. But they both experienced difficulties when pursuing careers in the private sector: Sophie worked for a PR firm that was caught in a sting by a national newspaper and she was recorded making comments about members of the Royal Family; Edward had little success as a television producer. They both gave up their careers and are now full-time ""working royals"" paid for using income from the Duchy of Lancaster, the Queen's private income. Wallis Simpson was an American divorcee like Meghan Markle. In 1936, it was considered the public would never accept a divorcee as Queen. Edward VIII - the Queen's uncle - had to choose between the throne and Wallis Simpson. He chose her, thereby relieving himself of his position and all royal duties. Prince Harry and Meghan have said they wish to ""step back"" as senior royals suggesting they do intend to carry out some duties on behalf of the Queen. This is their choice as opposed to a course of action they have no option but to follow. But - it is early days and it is really not clear yet how their part-royal, part-private roles will pan out. On their website, the couple say they will continue to use Frogmore Cottage - their home on the Windsor estate - with the permission of its owner, the Queen. They say the cottage will be their ""official residence as they continue to support the monarchy, and so that their family will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom"". They add that the refurbishment of the cottage was planned well before they decided to move in and their decision to live there saved money when compared with the refurbishment of another property at Kensington Palace. On their website, Harry and Meghan say they will no longer receive funding through the Sovereign Grant, ""thereby making them members of the Royal Family with financial independence"". However, the couple say the grant only provides 5% of their income and it is unclear whether they will give up their other sources of funding. Explained: Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? The couple will continue to be given a security detail paid for by the taxpayer-funded Metropolitan Police, which does not disclose the costs involved. The couple's intention to travel back and forth from North America would likely add to this cost, but it is possible they will pay towards this - although it will be a large bill. This comes after Harry and Meghanclaimed on their new website,externalthat 95% of funding for their office comes through income from Prince Charles' estate - the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy estate belongs to all heirs to the throne and has existed since Edward III created it for his son and heir, Prince Edward (famously known as the Black Prince), in 1337. According to a charter, the Prince of Wales, as the Duke of Cornwall, receives income each year generated from assets on the estate - which includes large parts of Cornwall, Dorset and Herefordshire - but he does not benefit from the proceeds or profit on the sale of any assets,according to the Duchy's website.,external This means that the territory - and income - of the Duchy will pass to Prince William, as heir, and on to his son Prince George when he becomes the heir. Therefore the estate itself is not owned by any one member of the Royal Family, nor is it owned by the government. Harry and Meghan's wedding in May 2018 attracted some 100,000 well-wishers to Windsor as well as a global TV audience of hundreds of millions. At the time, the Berkshire police commissioner Anthony Stansfeldsuggested the costof securing the duke and duchess' wedding was ""between Â£2m and Â£4m"". Another recent comparison would be the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which cost the Metropolitan Police Â£6.35m - though it took place in London and was a larger event. The Metropolitan Police - which is responsible for securing the Royal Family - does not reveal the cost of day-to-day security or policing, so these costs are not known. Reports of previous estimates have suggested the cost of securing all senior royals costs the Met Police around Â£50m a year. Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?

Harry Dunn death extradition request made to US,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The Home Office has requested the extradition of a US woman to be charged with causing the death by dangerous driving of motorcyclist Harry Dunn. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire in August which led to the suspect, Anne Sacoolas, leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. Extradition proceedings were started in December. The Home Office said the matter was ""now a decision for the US authorities"". The US State Department said an extradition request would be ""highly inappropriate"" and insisted that Ms Sacoolas' status at the time of the crash meant she had diplomatic immunity. A spokeswoman said they expressed their deepest sympathies and offered condolences to the Dunn family for their loss, and would continue to ""look at options for moving forward"". ""It is the position of the United States government that a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an abuse,"" she said. ""The use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent."" Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas. The crash happened outside RAF Croughton where Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. The 42-year-old left the UK and returned to her native US, claiming diplomatic immunity. A Home Office spokesman said:  ""Following the Crown Prosecution Service's charging decision, the Home Office has sent an extradition request to the United States for Anne Sacoolas on charges of causing death by dangerous driving. This is now a decision for the US authorities."" When the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced extradition proceedings, US officials said it was not ""a helpful development"" and Mrs Sacoolas' lawyer said she would not return to the UK. Lawyer Amy Jefress said: ""Anne will not return voluntarily to the UK to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident."" The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Reacting to the extradition request on behalf of Harry Dunn's family, spokesman Radd Seiger said: ""Anne Sacoolas will come back. She has to come back. There is no other way forward. ""So, whether they put up a fight and whether they actually refuse it, we will only know in time and the parents are determined to just take this a step at a time. It's being handled by the officials now, by the lawyers, and we're not going to get ahead of ourselves."" ""No-one, whether diplomat or otherwise, is above the law,"" he added. He said in the circumstances, considering all the family had been through, the family was pleased with the extradition request and felt it was a ""huge step towards achieving justice for Harry"". Charlotte Charles told reporters the charging decision was a ""huge step"" In December, Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the family was ""relieved"" Mrs Sacoolas had ""finally"" been charged. ""We made that promise to him the night we lost him to seek justice thinking it was going to be really easy,"" she said. ""We had no idea it was going to be so hard and it would take so long."" The family's constituency MP, cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom, has since written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking him to meet Mr Dunn's parents to hear their concerns. Harry Dunn's friends protest outside RAF base Harry Dunn's father meets home secretary US woman to be charged over Harry Dunn crash death Dunn family begin Foreign Office legal proceedings Raab heckled as Dunn family left out of hustings Dunn's family 'disgusted' with Raab over costs Bikers take to the road in memory of Harry Dunn Harry Dunn's parents' claims 'without foundation' Harry Dunn parents raise ambulance 'concerns' Harry Dunn crash suspect interviewed by police Dunn family to take Foreign Office to court Government knew Harry Dunn suspect would leave UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office Tributes paid to 'unique' woman, 49, found dead in River Nene near Northampton â as family questions 'non-suspicious' ruling 10 more motorists sentenced in court after drink drive crackdown in Northamptonshire over Christmas Tickets now on sale for Sing For Cransley!

The pair were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. The Sussexes' new charity is expected to be global, linked to Africa and the US, rather than domestic - and will have a commitment to female empowerment. It was revealed in December the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services.

This video can not be played What would Canadians think about welcoming the royal couple? In stepping back as senior royals, Harry and Meghanhave announced they will no longer receive funding from the Sovereign Grant.,external The Sovereign Grant is public money - Â£82m in 2018-19 - which pays for the cost of official royal duties, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. The couple said the Sovereign Grant paid for 5% of their official office from 2019, with the remaining 95% being funded by Prince Charles through his income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The couple are classified as ""internationally protected people"", which means they must have armed security provided by the Metropolitan Police. They will retain Frogmore cottage, the Grade-2 listed property in Windsorthat cost taxpayers Â£2.4m to renovate, as their official residence so they have a ""place to call home"" in the UK. Reaction to the couple's announcement from royal commentators has been mixed, with numerous questions over what their future royal roles will entail. Bryony Gordon, a Daily Telegraph journalist who knows and has interviewed the couple, suggested their decision could be linked to their mental health, after becoming a ""punching bag"" for a ""misogynistic and racist"" nation. This video can not be played Meghan spoke to ITV as part of a documentary last year Graham Smith, a spokesman for Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said Harry and Meghan's decision ""raises questions about the monarchy's future"" and will prompt taxpayers to ask how the couple's extra security and overseas lifestyle will be funded. ""This really is wanting to have your cake and eat it,"" he said. ""They have said they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won't stop taking public money until they find other sources of income."" Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said ""we must continue to celebrate and support"" the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK, adding that it has an ""important role in public service"". However, Labour leadership candidate Clive Lewissaid he believes there should be a referendum on the future of the Royal Family,adding: ""A lot of people would like to see the monarchy scaled down.""

And he is obviously - visibly - bored by the ceremonial side of the job. In short, he has long wanted out. And together with the woman he loves he now thinks he has found a way. But the manner of his leaving - their leaving - is breathtaking. Read more from Jonny. The pair were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. The Sussexes' new charity is expected to be global, linked to Africa and the US, rather than domestic - and will have a commitment to female empowerment. It was revealed in December the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services. Sentebale, the charity co-founded by Prince Harry, issued a statement saying that, as its patron, he has been a ""passionate advocate"" for its work, adding: ""We know that support will continue.""

In stepping back as senior royals, Harry and Meghanhave announced they will no longer receive funding from the Sovereign Grant.,external The Sovereign Grant is public money - Â£82m in 2018-19 - which pays for the cost of official royal duties, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. The couple said the Sovereign Grant paid for 5% of their official office from 2019, with the remaining 95% being funded by Prince Charles through his income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The couple are classified as ""internationally protected people"", which means they must have armed security provided by the Metropolitan Police. They will retain Frogmore cottage, the Grade-2 listed property in Windsorthat cost taxpayers Â£2.4m to renovate, as their official residence so they have a ""place to call home"" in the UK. Reaction to the couple's announcement from royal commentators has been mixed, with numerous questions over what their future royal roles will entail. Bryony Gordon, a Daily Telegraph journalist who knows and has interviewed the couple, suggested their decision could be linked to their mental health, after becoming a ""punching bag"" for a ""misogynistic and racist"" nation. This video can not be played Meghan spoke to ITV as part of a documentary last year Graham Smith, a spokesman for Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said Harry and Meghan's decision ""raises questions about the monarchy's future"" and will prompt taxpayers to ask how the couple's extra security and overseas lifestyle will be funded. ""This really is wanting to have your cake and eat it,"" he said. ""They have said they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won't stop taking public money until they find other sources of income."" Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said ""we must continue to celebrate and support"" the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK, adding that it has an ""important role in public service"". However, Labour leadership candidate Clive Lewissaid he believes there should be a referendum on the future of the Royal Family,adding: ""A lot of people would like to see the monarchy scaled down."" A happy memory of Canada? The moment in 1991 when Prince Harry and his brother were reunited with their mother in Toronto during an official visit In October last year, Meghanbegan legal actionagainst the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The paper stands by its story. At the time, Prince Harry said: ""Though we have continued to put on a brave face... I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been."" And in an ITV documentary last year, Meghan, who was born in the US, described motherhood as a ""struggle"" due to intense interest from newspapers. On Wednesday the royal couple also announced they would also be adopting a ""revised media approach"" from the spring. It will see them,external""engage with grassroots media organisations and young, up-and-coming journalists"". The National Union of Journalists criticised the plans, saying the move appears to try and ""prevent the media from functioning and compromising the ability of journalists to do their jobs, which is completely unacceptable"".

Taiwan's Tsai in race for second presidential term,"Han Kuo-yo favours closer ties with China Polls have closed in Taiwan's presidential election, whose outcome will shape the island's relationship with China. Tsai Ing-wen, running for a second term, favours the status quo, and does not want closer ties with Beijing. Meanwhile, her main rival, Han Kuo-yu, promises to ease tensions with China. Ahead of the vote, Ms Tsai was leading in the polls - which some observers attribute to her support for the protests in Hong Kong. Her stance is popular with those who fear Taiwan being overtaken by mainland China. Beijing says the island must be unified with the mainland one day. President Tsai insists Taiwan's future should be decided by its 23 million people. Tsai Ing-wen waves to supporters after voting in the capital, Taipei Voters were also choosing the next members of the Taiwanese legislature, where Ms Tsai's party has had a majority. About 19 million people were registered to vote in Saturday's election. Polling stations closed at 16:00  (08:00 GMT) and results are expected before the end of the day. For practical purposes, Taiwan is an independent state - it has its own elected government, constitution and military. But China has claimed sovereignty over it since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. It says Taiwan must eventually be reunited with China, by force if necessary. China refuses to have diplomatic relations with any country that recognises Taiwan as a sovereign nation. All but a handful of countries have picked Beijing, butmost maintain an ambiguous relationship with Taiwanthrough trade. The US is also legally bound to supply Taiwan with the means to defend itself.

In a speech on the Hong Kong protests in June,she said,external""anyone who tries to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy, or use them as political bargaining chips, will fail"". She had also rejected Taiwan ever operating under the ""one country, two systems"" political system used in Hong Kong since it returned to China in 1997 - calling it ""not viable"". Speaking to the BBC this week, she said Taiwan should ""learn a lesson"" from Hong Kong: ""If we don't insist [on maintaining Taiwan's independence], we'll be losing everything we have now."" Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female president Taiwan profile Mr Han and his party the Kuomintang (KMT) favour closer ties with China - which they say will bring economic growth - but do not seek unification. The KMT once ruled China, before fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 after losing to the communist forces in the civil war. Mr Han made a high-profile visit to Hong Kong and China in March, and has reportedly said a formal declaration of Taiwanese independence would be ""scarier then syphilis"". A third candidate, James Soong, is running for his minor People First Party. This video can not be played Three couples and a wedding to celebrate Taiwan marriage equality Although the economy has grown during Ms Tsai's presidency, exports have fallen and wage growth is sluggish. Saturday is also the first presidential election since Taiwan became the first place in Asia tolegalise same-sex marriage. Themove was rejectedin a series of referendums, but parliament passed a special law in order to comply with an earlier court ruling. Ms Tsai said it was ""a big step towards true equality"". In 1993, Mr Han - seen here at a recent rally - punched the future Taiwanese president in parliament Ms Tsai, 63, was a law professor before entering politics. She studied at Cornell in the US and the London School of Economics, as well as in Taiwan. She is accused of being elitist, but her stance on same-sex marriage, language rights and other issues have won her support among younger voters. Mr Han, 62 and currently mayor of Kaohsiung, is seen as more down-to-earth, and has projected a plain-talking everyman image. He has embraced nicknames, including ""bald guy"", and a recent talk-show appearance saw the host apologise for poking fun at him. ""Continue, everyone is happy,"" he replied.

Northern Ireland parties agree power-sharing deal,"This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald (left) addressed reporters at Stormont Sinn FÃ©in have said they will re-enter devolved government in Northern Ireland after three years of deadlock. TheDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) had earlier also given its support to a draft dealto restore Stormont's political institutions. The British and Irish governments publishedthe draft proposals,externalon Thursday, after nine months of talks. Stormont's power-sharing coalition, led by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, collapsed in January 2017 over a green energy row. How the parties got a done deal What's in the draft Stormont deal? Three years of political deadlock at Stormont Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed the agreement, tweeting it was a ""great step forwards for the people of Northern Ireland"". There will be a meeting of the Northern Ireland Assembly on Saturday afternoon when the parties are expected to elect a speaker of the assembly and appoint executive ministers. The proceedings will be streamed live on theBBC News NI websitefrom 13:00 GMT, there will also be coverage on BBC Two NI from 15:30 GMT. Allow Twitter content?

Until three years ago, Northern Ireland was jointly governed by its largest unionist party, the DUP, and its largest nationalist party, Sinn FÃ©in. They shared power in political institutions set up under the1998 Good Friday Agreement, a deal which brought peace to Northern Ireland after 30 years of violence known as the Troubles. Under the principles of power-sharing, Stormont's government cannot function unless it is comprised of a coalition of both unionists and nationalists. Relations between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had deteriorated in recent years as the two parties were diametrically opposed not only on Northern Ireland's position within the UK, but also issues such as the Irish language; same-sex marriage; abortion and how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. But unexpectedly it was a row over a green energy scheme which pushed their relationship past breaking point. TheRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) schemewas set up by DUP leader Arlene Foster when she was enterprise minister, but it ran over budget and at one point threatened to cost taxpayers Â£490m. Sinn FÃ©in demanded that Mrs Foster step aside as first minister during an inquiry into the RHI scheme and when she refused, theypulled out of government on 9 January 2017. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish language act and the petition of concern. The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. The call for an Irish language act has been a key sticking point The draft deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The proposed deal would see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster-Scots commissioner. Earlier, Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge welcomed the draft deal as ""historic advancement but added it ""falls very much short"" of promises for an Irish Language act. Other key points in the deal includethe Northern Ireland Executive settling an ongoing pay dispute with nurses and increasing policing numbers. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald told a Stormont press conference on Friday that her party will nominate ministers to an executive. She said Sinn FÃ©in was up for a return to ""genuine power sharing"". TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy PM) Simon Coveney and NI Secretary Julian Smith published the deal on Thursday night DUP leader Arlene Foster described the proposals as a ""fair and balanced deal"". ""I know there will be challenges in the deal, not least we need to make sure we have the finances to be able to deal with all of the issues in Northern Ireland that are present at the moment, particularly in and around the health sector."" This video can not be played 'It's a fair and balanced deal' The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood confirmed on Friday that his party will return to Stormont when the assembly is recalled. The Alliance Party also confirmed on Friday night it would support the deal. The Ulster Unionist Party are meeting on Saturday morning to decide. TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney, who helped broker the deal, said: ""History is being made today."" He added: ""We now have confirmation from the two largest parties in Northern Ireland that they both are committed to re-entering an executive and establishing a functioning Stormont assembly again. The leaders of Ireland's main churches welcomed the agreement, saying it offered ""new hope"" and a ""new start"" for Northern Ireland's political institutions. In a joint statement, the leaders of the Church of Ireland, Methodist Church in Ireland, Roman Catholic Church, Presbyterian Church in Ireland and the Irish Council of Churches said the government's proposals ""offer an opportunity to build a peaceful and just society"". However, theOrange Order earlier said it has ""very serious concerns"" about the dealand could not support the proposal to appoint an Irish language commissioner.

Victim: 'She was full of dreams',"This video can not be played ""She was full of dreams and now they're gone"": Vigil held for Iran plane crash victims in Toronto In the aftermath of the deadly Ukraine Flight PS752 crash, Canadians are left to mourn not just the loss of life but the bright futures snatched away, write Jessica Murphy and Robin Levinson-King. In a small room inside a student housing complex at the University of Toronto, more than a hundred people gathered to mourn, pray and share stories of the loved ones they lost in Ukraine Flight PS752. The space, which is typically used as a student common area, had been transformed into a kind of funeral parlour, decorated with candles, white bouquets and photos of the victims. Most of the service was in Persian, and tea and sweets were served. Like many being held across the country, the vigil on Wednesday evening was an impromptu event, quickly put together in the hours after the plane went down earlier that morning. Many were still in shock from the news, less than 24 hours old. ""She was full of dreams, and now they're gone,"" Elnaz Morshedi told the BBC between sobs. Her friend, University of Toronto student Zeynab Asadi Lari, was killed in the crash. Ms Morshedi says Ms Lari, who was studying health sciences, had wanted to volunteer with Doctors Without Borders next semester. ""She was studying all the time, but she wanted to live, she wanted to have fun, to fall in love. And she doesn't have time for this anymore."" Ms Lari's brother, Mohammad Asadi Lari, also died in the crash. He was the co-founder of STEM fellowship, a youth-run charity that helps students in the maths and sciences. ""They were the best of us,"" Ms Morshedi says. All 176 people on board the flight were killed when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Iran. Sixty-three of them were Canadian nationals, but many more called Canada their home, at least temporarily. They lived in cities like Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton. Many were students or professors, working on important research in their fields. US sanctions have made it increasingly difficult to travel between Iran and Canada, and the Ukraine International Airlines flight from Tehran to Kiev and then to Toronto is popular because it is one of the most affordable options for the journey, said Younes Zangiabadi with the Iranian Canadian Congress. Some 63 Canadians were on the Tehran to Kiev flight, en route to Toronto The deaths have cast a pall over university campuses across the country. ""You look at the odds of such a thing happening to you,"" said Seyed Hossein Mortazavi with disbelief, ""but I suppose that's fate."" ""They definitely didn't expect this. None of us did. But I think it's just a burden the whole community has to carry."" Who are the victims of Iran plane crash? Canada is home to a large Iranian diaspora, with some 210,000 citizens of Iranian descent, according to the federal census. But Mr Mortazavi said that on campuses the community feels small. ""Nearly anybody in our community knows someone on that plane, through friends, through family,"" he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the crash a ""heartbreaking tragedy"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to ensure the cause of the crash was found. ""Canadians have questions and they deserve answers,"" he told media in Ottawa on Wednesday evening. Mr Trudeau said Canada would work closely with its partners to ensure the crash is thoroughly investigated - and would be requesting the presence of Canadian officials in Tehran to assist families seeking consular assistance, as well as to participate in any investigation into the cause of the incident. To those who lost family members and loved ones, he said ""your loss is indescribable"". Tehran won't give Boeing or US black boxes ""This is a heartbreaking tragedy. While no words will erase your pain, we want you to know that an entire country is with you, we share your grief."" It was truly a national tragedy, leaving families and loved ones in mourning across the country. And each story was a tragedy in itself. In Vancouver, Ardalan Ebnoddin Hamidi, Niloofar Razzaghi, and their teenage son Kamyar were on the flight, confirmed family friend Kei Esmaeilpour, with the Civic Association of Iranian-Canadians. Mr Esmaeilpour said the family were in Iran for a short vacation, and that his friend Ardalan had expressed concerns to him before leaving about the security situation there, but eventually decided to go on the trip. He said people who knew the family were asking how something like this could have happened. Two separate couples were killed on the way back from their weddings in Iran. Siavash Ghafouri-Azar and his wife Sara Mamani Engineer Siavash Ghafouri-Azar was returning home with his new wife, Sara Mamani, when the plane crashed. The couple had just bought their first home near the Canadian city of Montreal, and were looking forward to throwing a house-warming party, said his former thesis supervisor Ali Dolatabadi, an engineering professor at Concordia University. ""It is a great loss,"" Mr Dolatabadi told the BBC. ""He was very intelligent, a gentleman. He had a kind and a gentle soul."" The couple had met a few years earlier at Concordia and both went on to work at top engineering firms in Montreal. They had decided to get married in Iran because they wanted to celebrate with family, Mr Dolatabadi said. Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand with their two daughters Newlyweds Arash Pourzarabi, 26, and Pouneh Gourji, 25, were graduate students in computer science at the University of Alberta and were also returning to Canada from their wedding. The crash also claimed the lives of two young girls, Daria and Dorina Mousavi, aged 14 and 9, along with their parents, Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand, who taught at the University of Alberta. Payman Parseyman, an Iranian-Canadian from Edmonton, said the community was devastated as they learned that many from the city's Iranian diaspora, as well as foreign Iranian students who had been studying there, had been on flight PS752. ""It's mostly been shock, disbelief,"" he told the BBC. Canadians across the country mourned lost family members and loved ones He said many Iranian-Canadians were already glued to their televisions or the internet watching for news about the ballistic missile strikes launched by Iran on air bases housing US forces in Iraq late on Tuesday evening, and ended up watching early reports on the plane crash in real time. Aftermath of Ukrainian passenger plane crash in Iran People were quick to begin connecting via the Telegram messaging app, seeking information and finding ways to support the families and loved ones of those killed. Canada has not had diplomatic representation in Iran since 2012, when it closed its embassy in Tehran and expelled Iranian diplomats from Ottawa. Officials said a number of allies, including France, Italy, and Australia, have offered Canada assistance on the ground in Iran. ""We've been having such a split as a community these past few months,"" says Mr Mortazavi, who attended the vigil at the University of Toronto. ""I hope this acts as a turning point for all of us, so that people start reflecting about each other, about the friendships.""

What does the law say about Soleimani's assassination?,"President Trump said Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks on American diplomats US President Donald Trump ordered the drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in Iraq but what are the legal grounds for this course of action? The US said: ""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans."" So, what are the key issues when considering its legality, according to international law? The relevant law in the UN Charter allows for a state to act in self-defence ""if an armed attack occurs"". But this definition tends to be interpreted by governments, say legal experts. ""In the Soleimani case, the US is claiming it acted in self-defence to prevent imminent attacks, a category of action which, if in fact true, is generally seen as being permissible under the UN Charter,"" says Dapo Akande, professor of public international law at Oxford University and co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict (ELAC). But Agnes Callamard, UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings. has tweeted about the strike saying ""this test is unlikely to be met"". Allow Twitter content?

A2010 UN report on ""targeted killings"",externalsaid there was a weighty body of scholarship that viewed the self-defence argument as having the right to use force ""against a real and imminent threat when the necessity of that self-defence is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation."" Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Will his killing spark war and more of your questions Iran's response options for Soleimani's death Does Trump have a strategy? Theinitial US Department of Defense statement,externalomitted the word ""imminent"" and said the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attacks and that Iran's top military leader Soleimani was ""actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region"". In later statements, US officials including President Trump said Soleimani had been plotting ""imminent attacks"". Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic Party candidate for the US presidency, said: ""The administration cannot keep its story straight."" The legality of the strike under international law may well depend on the US providing evidence of those future attacks, according to Mr Akande. The US government has not yet shared details publicly, but the administration has said intelligence has been shared with key figures in the US Congress. Asked by a journalist on 7 January for more details about imminent threats, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notedthe incidents leading up to the strike, but did not provide any evidence of impending attacks. There are other justifications it has used in the past, according to Dr Ralph Wilde, an expert in public international law at University College London. ""Since 9/11 the US has taken a view that self-defence can be justified to prevent more longer-term attacks. When the attack is being planned, but is not imminent. The Obama administration used this argument to justify drone strikes."" Obama defends 'just' drones war This video can not be played Mourners packed the streets in Tehran - and Iran's supreme leader wept as he led prayers The other issue is whether the US had consent from Iraq to carry out the strike there. Iraqi MPs reacted angrily and passed a non-binding resolution calling for US troops to leave the country. The Iraqi government has called it a ""brazen violation of Iraq's sovereignty"". US forces had been invited into Iraq to fight the Islamic State group and to train Iraqi forces. The US might argue this invitation constituted some form of consent, giving them a right to protect their interests and personnel inside Iraq. But Mr Akande argues that, in practice, the terms of the agreement to host US forces would not stretch to carrying out an attack like this. Persepolis is one of Iran's most famous cultural sites On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted, warning the US would target sites that were ""important to Iran and the Iranian culture"" if American assets were hit. The Iran Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif said an attack on a cultural site would amount to a war crime. Trump's threat ""shows callous disregard for the global rule of law"", said Andrea Prasow of Human Rights Watch. The US government insisted it would behave lawfully. Allow Twitter content?

But an attack on a cultural site would violate several international treaties. The 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property safeguarded cultural sites in the wake of the destruction of cultural heritage sites during World War Two, and was signed by the US. In 2017, the UN passed a resolution in response to the Islamic State attacks which condemned ""the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artefacts"". The US was among the harshest critics of the IS destruction of historic site of Palmyra in Syria in 2015, as well as the Taliban's demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan in 2001. In 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted someone for the destruction of cultural heritage for the first time, after an extremist linked to Al-Qaeda destroyed religious artefacts in Mali. The US is not part of the ICC but it is a signatory of other agreements to protect cultural property and any attack would represent a significant reversal.
