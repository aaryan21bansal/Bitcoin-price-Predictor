Peru more than doubles Covid deaths after review,"The rise is in line with so-called excess deaths figures Peru has more than doubled its Covid death toll following a review,making it the country with the world's highest death rate per capita,external, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The official death toll is now more than 180,000, up from 69,342, in a country of about 33 million people. Prime Minister Violeta Bermudez said the number was increased on the advice of Peruvian and international experts. This was in line with so-called excess deaths figures. Excess deaths are a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years. ""We think it is our duty to make public this updated information,"" Ms Bermudez said. Brazil variant drives South America Covid surge Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The news, released on Monday, came just six days before Peru is set to hold a presidential run-off election between leftist Pedro Castillo and right-wing candidate Keiko Fujimori. Peru has been one of the worst-hit countries in Latin America, resulting in an overstretched healthcare system and a lack of oxygen tanks. It has registered 1.9 million infections in total. Some of the reasons for it being so badly hit include an absence of fridges in people's homes - forcing many households to make frequent trips to markets to shop for food rather than stocking up - and overcrowding in homes and public places. Vaccinations have been slow in Peru, as in many parts of South America The president of the Peruvian Medical Federation, Godofredo Talavera, said the increased toll was not a surprise. ""We believe this occurs because our health system does not have the necessary conditions to care for patients. ""There has been no government support with oxygen, with intensive care beds. We do not have enough vaccines at the moment. The first line of care has not been reactivated. All this makes us the first country in the world in mortality,"" he said. But experts say Peru has also had problems with its testing regime, as it lacks the resources to carry out widespread molecular tests, the most reliable type. In the early days of the pandemic, Peru bought millions of cheap tests from China, most of which were designed to detect virus antibodies, not active cases, the Associated Press reported. Some of these tests have been found by independent analysis to be sub-standard, the agency said. The criteria for recording Covid deaths has now been broadened beyond people who tested positive for the virus to include ""probable"" cases - those with ""an epidemiological link to a confirmed case"" or who present ""a clinical picture compatible with the disease"". The official number of Covid deaths now stands at 180,764, a huge increase on the previous official figure of 69,342. That makes more than 500 Covid deaths per 100,000 people, overtaking Hungary with 300 per 100,000. In comparison, neighbouring Colombia, with a larger population than Peru, has registered 88,282 deaths. Brazil has one of the world's highest death tolls with more than 460,000, but in a country of more than 211 million. Peruvians had long suspected they weren't getting the true picture of the country's dire coronavirus situation from the government. The revised figure for Covid-19 related deaths shows they were right to be doubtful. In fact, the government has admitted the real number is more than twice the previous figure. A government working group of experts, formed to analyse Peru's data, published the revised figures after establishing broader criteria by which deaths from coronavirus were recorded. Now that the narrower definition has been abandoned, the country's per capita death toll is in fact much higher than Brazil's. Such a figure coincides more closely to the anecdotal evidence coming from hospitals and intensive care units across the country and with the images of cemeteries struggling to find space for the high number of burials each day. Meanwhile, the process of vaccination has been slow and beset with difficulties across most of South America.

China allows three children in major policy shift,"It comes after a once-in-a-decade census showed that China's population grew at its slowest pace in decades China has announced that it will allow couples to have up to three children, after census data showed a steep decline in birth rates. China scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit which has failed to lead to a sustained upsurge in births. The cost of raising children in cities has deterred many Chinese couples. The latest move was approved by President Xi Jinping at a meeting of top Communist Party officials. It will come with ""supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country's population structure, fulfilling the country's strategy of actively coping with an ageing population and maintaining the advantage, endowment of human resources"", according to Xinhua news agency. But human rights organisation Amnesty International said the policy, like its predecessors, was still a violation of sexual and reproductive rights. ""Governments have no business regulating how many children people have. Rather than 'optimising' its birth policy, China should instead respect people's life choices and end any invasive and punitive controls over people's family planning decisions,"" said the group's China team head, Joshua Rosenzweig. Why don't Chinese women want more babies? The Chinese family in five charts Also, some experts were sceptical of the impact. ""If relaxing the birth policy was effective, the current two-child policy should have proven to be effective too,"" Hao Zhou, a senior economist at Commerzbank, told Reuters news agency. ""But who wants to have three kids? Young people could have two kids at most. The fundamental issue is living costs are too high and life pressures are too huge."" On a rainy, bleak day in Beijing I was out buying a coffee when the news broke. People started looking down at their phones as they beeped and whirred with the headline flashing across their screens - China to allow couples to have three children. This is big news in a country which didn't start suddenly producing more babies when the one-child policy eased off to two. In fact, many are asking how a three-child policy might mean more children when the two-child version didn't and why birth restrictions have remained here at all given the demographic trend. Very good questions. One thought is that, among those prepared to have two children, at least some parents will have three. However, I have interviewed many young Chinese couples about this subject and it is hard to find those who want bigger families these days. Generations of Chinese people have lived without siblings and are used to small families - affluence has meant less need for multiple children to become family-supporting workers, and young professionals say they'd rather give one child more advantages than spread their income among several kids. The census, released this month, showed that around 12 million babies were born last year - a significant decrease from the 18 million in 2016, and the lowest number of births recorded since the 1960s. The census was conducted in late 2020 - some seven million census takers had gone door to door to collect information from households. Given the sheer number of people surveyed, it is considered the most comprehensive resource on China's population, which is important for future planning. It was widely expected after the census data results were released that China would relax its family policy rules. By Kerry Allen, China Media Analyst China's leading media are giving a lot of fanfare to the ""three-child policy"". Newspaper People's Daily, broadcaster CCTV and news agency Xinhua are all posting happy cartoon images of children today on their social media pages and saying that the new policy has ""arrived"". It is already the top talking point on popular social network Sina Weibo - posts mentioning the new policy have already racked up tens of thousands of views, and hundreds of thousands of comments. More than 180,000 users have commented on Xinhua's upbeat post, and the ones with the most likes do not look upon the policy kindly. ""There are too many big pressures in life at the moment,"" one user says, ""Young people are not willing to have kids."" Many talk about modern day ""workplace dilemmas"" for people leaving on maternity/paternity leave and there not being even ""the most basic reproductive benefits"". And with a shrinking labour market, young Chinese people today accept that they have to work longer hours. Overtime and overwork are endemic. More women meanwhile are choosing to pursue further education and employment, rather than settle down early to start a family. The government's move in 2016 to allow couples to have two children failed to reverse the country's falling birth rate despite a two-year increase immediately afterwards. Yue Su, principal economist from The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: ""While the second-child policy had a positive impact on the birth rate, it proved short-term in nature."" China's population trends have over the years been largely shaped by the one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to slow population growth. Families that violated the rules faced fines, loss of employment and sometimes forced abortions. The one-child policy also led to a severe gender imbalance in the country. The traditional preference for male children led to large numbers of girls being abandoned or placed in orphanages, or cases of sex-selective abortions or even female infanticide. ""This poses problems for the marriage market, especially for men with less socioeconomic resources,"" Dr Mu Zheng, from the National University of Singapore's sociology department, said. Ahead of China's latest census, experts had speculated that birth restrictions might be lifted entirely - though it appears as though China is treading cautiously. But others said that such a move could potentially lead to ""other problems"" - pointing out the huge disparity between city dwellers and rural people. As much as women living in expensive cities such as Beijing and Shanghai may wish to delay or avoid childbirth, those in the countryside are likely to still follow tradition and want large families, they say. ""If we free up policy, people in the countryside could be more willing to give birth than those in the cities, and there could be other problems,"" a policy insider had earlier told Reuters, noting that it could lead to poverty and employment pressures among rural families. Experts had warned that any impact on China's population, such as a decline, could have a vast effect on other parts of the world. Dr Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said: ""China's economy has grown very quickly, and many industries in the world rely on China. The scope of the impact of a population decline would be very wide."" This video can not be played Do China's 'one child generation' want more children? Why don't Chinese women want more babies?

Suspected tiger killer held after 20-year hunt,"Few Bengal tigers remain in the wild A man suspected of killing 70 endangered tigers has been arrested in Bangladesh after a 20-year search. Habib Talukder - known as Tiger Habib - was finally caught following a tip off, after three previous arrest warrants had been issued for him, police said. He has operated in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, on the border between India and Bangladesh. The area is home to the world's largest population of Bengal tigers. Only a few thousand remain in the wild. Black market traders buy their pelts, bones and even flesh for sale around the globe.

"UK set for stronger post-Covid recovery, says OECD","The UK economy's recovery from the pandemic is set to be stronger than previously thought, a leading international agency has suggested. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says the UK is likely to grow 7.2% in 2021, up from its March projection of 5.1%. The OECD raised its forecast for global growth to 5.8%, compared with the 4.2% it predicted in December. However, it warned that growth would not be shared evenly. The UK's growth is set to be the fastest among the large rich countries, the OECD says. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak attributed the strength of the forecast to the success of the UK's vaccine rollout and the government's Plan for Jobs. However, he cautioned that with debt at nearly 100% of GDP, there was a need to ""ensure public finances remain on a sure footing"". Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The OECD said prospects for the world economy had brightened, with activity returning to pre-pandemic levels. However, they remained short of what had previously been expected by the end of 2022. The OECD praised stimulus measures and swift vaccine rollouts in richer countries for boosting growth, but said the slow jab distribution in many developing countries threatened to blight their economic progress. It said the recovery would remain uneven and vulnerable to fresh setbacks as long as a large proportion of the world's population were not vaccinated. Global growth will be led by a strong upturn in the US, where GDP is forecast to reach 6.9% this year, before easing to 3.6% in 2022, the OECD added. Output in China has also caught up, but emerging-market economies, including India, may continue to have large shortfalls in GDP. The strong forecast this year for the UK reflects the key role that vaccination plays in supporting economic recovery. It is the fastest growth among the large rich countries - and within the wider G20, it's behind only India and China. But that also reflects the UK rebounding from a downturn that was one of the deepest. The OECD report gives a flavour of how countries are performing over the course of the health crisis by setting out how long it expects them to take to get back to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity (GDP) per capita. For the UK, it's the middle of next year, along with Italy and Canada. That's a few months ahead of France and Spain but behind the US, Japan and Germany. It's also behind several emerging economies, including China, which was the first to regain the lost ground. OECD Secretary-General Angel GurrÃ­a said there was an urgent need to ""step up the production and equitable distribution of vaccines"". ""Effective vaccination programmes in many countries has meant today's economic outlook is more promising than at any time since the start of this devastating pandemic,"" he said. ""But for millions around the world, getting a jab still remains a distant prospect. We urgently need to step up the production and equitable distribution of vaccines."" OECD chief economist Laurence Boone urged stronger international co-operation between nations to help provide poorer countries with resources to vaccinate their populations. Income support for people and businesses should continue, but as restrictions ease, these should be ""better targeted"" where they are needed most, including through retraining and job placement. The OECD said support also needed to focus on ""viable businesses to encourage a move away from debt into equity, and to create jobs and invest in digitalisation"". Public debt has risen in most economies as a result of the pandemic, but current low interest rates have made servicing the debt manageable. In the UK, while GDP is predicted to return to pre-pandemic levels next year, the OECD warns that increased border costs following Brexit will hit foreign trade. Unemployment is also expected to peak at the end of 2021, with a predicted rise to 6.1% when the furlough scheme ends. It will reach an average of 5.4% in 2021, above 2020 levels of 4.5% and 2019 levels of 3.8%. The OECD recommends the UK government should maintain support measures until economic recovery is under way, focusing on businesses and sectors with the best growth prospects. The report also says a closer trade relationship with the EU would improve the economic outlook in the medium term. Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

The OECD recommends the UK government should maintain support measures until economic recovery is under way, focusing on businesses and sectors with the best growth prospects. The report also says a closer trade relationship with the EU would improve the economic outlook in the medium term. Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

Privacy group targets website 'cookie terror',"A privacy group has lodged hundreds of complaints against what it calls ""cookie banner terror"" online. Noyb, headed by well-known Austrian privacy advocate Max Schrems, is targeting companies which it says deliberately make it hard to opt-out of tracking cookies. ""By law, users must be given a clear yes/no option,"" the group said. Marketing groups have blamed the EU's strict privacy rules for creating the problem. Cookies are used for all sorts of purposes, but one of their major uses is for third-party advertising tracking - which is why ads for a product you may have searched for ""follows"" you from website to website. After the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was implemented in 2018, websites began to display very prominent pop-up forms, andsome American sites withdrew serviceto EU users. That also applied to the UK,  and was carried over into UK law post-Brexit. But many websites force users to revoke consent for dozens of marketing partners individually - a process that can take several minutes. Others highlight the ""accept all"" in a green colour or make it more prominent. Noyb - an acronym for ""none of your business"" - says that kind of form is designed to make it ""extremely complicated to click anything but the 'accept' button"". To combat this, the group has created an automated system, which it says can find violations and auto-generate a complaint under GDPR. It claims ""most banners do not comply with the requirements of the GDPR"". Fines can be up to â¬20m (Â£17.5m) or 4% of a company's global revenue, whichever is higher. Of the 500 pages in its first batch of complaints, 81% had no ""reject"" option on the first page, but rather hidden in a sub-page, it said. Another 73% used ""deceptive colours and contrasts"" to lead users into clicking ""accept"", and 90% provided no easy way to withdraw consent, it said. Google fined Â£91m over ad-tracking cookies Tech Tent: The end of ad tracking? Noyb says it is first issuing draft complaints to 10,000 of the most-visited websites across Europe, along with instructions on how to change settings. But it says that if firms do not comply within a month, it will file full formal complaints with enforcement authorities. ""If successful, users should see simple and clear 'yes or no' options on more and more websites in the upcoming months,"" the group said. Mr Schrems, the chair of the group, is a well-respected privacy advocate who has lodged successful legal challenges in the past. In July last year, he successfully had an agreement that governed the transfer of EU citizen's data to the United Statesstruck down by Europe's highest court. Mr Schrems said this latest campaign was designed to combat ""a whole industry of consultants and designers"" making ""crazy click labyrinths"". ""Frustrating people into clicking 'okay' is a clear violation of the GDPR's principles,"" he said, accusing firms of trying ""to make privacy a hassle for users."" This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? ""They often deliberately make the designs of privacy settings a nightmare, but at the same time blame the GDPR for it. ""This narrative is repeated on hundreds of pages, so users start to think that these crazy banners are required by law."" The legal basis for cookie consent is complicated, involving an older set of rules called the ePrivacy Directive as well as the more recent GDPR, and a range of national data protection authorities which enforce the rules. Data protection and privacy expert Pat Walshe said that the way the advertising industry had approached the rules had ""led to confusion at best"". ""In my humble opinion, a lack of regulatory enforcement has emboldened the ad industry and in part led to the current state of the 'data vampire' infested web and app experiences,"" he said. ""In light of the lack of regulatory enforcement the Noyb action is welcome. If regulators won't uphold and enforce the law then organisations like Noyb play an even more important role than ever."" Cookies themselves have also come under fire in recent years, with many calling for them to be replaced by another system. Google, for example,has begun a process of phasing out the support for third-party cookiesin its popular Chrome web browser, citing privacy concerns. Google promises to drop personalised ad tracking Google fined Â£91m over ad-tracking cookies Cookies crumbling as Google phases them out Tech Tent: The end of ad tracking?

Holiday let firms 'blown away' by surge in demand,"Many holiday accommodation providers have no available dates for the summer Holiday let firms in Wales are predicting a bumper summer, with one saying they have been ""blown away"" by demand. Greg Stevenson of Under the Thatch said some of its 60 properties would take a normal year's earnings in a few months. North Wales Holiday Cottages also has many properties booked until October. Meanwhile, lack of availability in other hotspots would mean more bookings in Powys and Ceredigion, said Mid Wales Tourism's chairman. Following the end of the first lockdown in 2020, self-cateringoccupancy rates in Wales reached 90% in August,external- with industry bosses confident that figure could be topped this year. Can I go on a foreign holiday from Wales? Holiday homes in Wales reopen after lockdown ""These are green shoots and we continue to work with the sector as we relax the restrictions in a phased and gradual way,"" a Welsh government spokesman said. Overall, the number of people renting self-contained accommodation in Wales between January and September rose from 60% in 2018 to 62% in 2019, but fell to 52% in 2020. This was partly because nobody could travel in April, May and June because of lockdown. However, when restrictions were lifted, figures reached a three-year high - in August 2020, occupancy was at 90% (compared to 88% in August 2019) and in September, the figure was 82% (compared to 68% in 2019). With Wales now at Covid alert level two, six people from six different households are allowed to visit pubs, cafes and restaurants together. However, people are still not allowed to have visitors from another household inside their home, unless they have formed a ""bubble"" with them. Visitors to Wales' tourist spots could easily beat numbers from pre-Covid days this summer Holiday let firms 'blown away' by surge in demand Mr Stevenson is confident things will follow a similar pattern this year. Of Under the Thatch's 82 holiday lets, three quarters are in Wales and he said: ""After a tough winter, we've been blown away by demand for summer 2021, with most properties having total annual sales that now more than make up for the losses of closure during lockdown."" The company specialises in authentic renovations and he believes he could fill another 50 in July and August. Hope for tourism after 'devastating' Covid impact People in Wales asked not to travel abroad Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Prices are up across the industry for the peak season, and he added: ""When cancellations come in, breaks resell at higher prices - which goes some way to recovering the losses of the last year. ""Most of our properties are owned by families that live within a 30-minute drive of their rental, and I'm pleased that so many Welsh families can benefit from the resurgence in interest in Welsh accommodation this summer."" With fewer opportunities to travel abroad, people are booking trips to Welsh locations, such as Gower The firm also rents in other European countries, and part of the boom in the Welsh market could be down to a reluctance to book abroad because of issues such as quarantine, Covid testing and the UK government's traffic light system, Mr Stevenson said. ""We've noticed unprecedented demand for Ireland, mostly, it has to be said, from Irish clients this year,"" he said. ""But there is noticeable nervousness around booking the places in Spain, France and Portugal, etc."" Wales was closed to tourists for some of the key months of 2020 North Wales Holiday Cottages, which helps rent hundreds of properties, has seen an upsurge in demand over the past month, with it also having little availability left in July and August. Director Barbara Griffiths said March and April had seen ""much lower levels"" of bookings as only people from Wales could travel. But she added: ""Since mid-April we have more or less reached expected, normal occupancy. ""Going forward, bookings are quite a lot above normal levels. ""In recent years, people have booked much later for their summer holidays but this year they are booking much earlier."" Many properties are fully booked until winter, however, Ms Griffiths said about two-thirds have some availability in September. Tourists have returned to Llandudno in the past couple of months following lockdown There are also signs things are picking up for a company that brings tourists into the UK - after a tough year for Shropshire-based Janet Redler Travel. Her business has made just Â£4,000 in the past 15 months, with redundancies and two staff on furlough. However, its first tour to Wales since Covid, of 30, arrives on 12 July. Ms Redler said it had been ""quite difficult"" to put some aspects of the trip together after they had taken the booking in February, and some elements were still outstanding as businesses did not want to commit and then cancel if restrictions changed. Is lack of availability in usual hotspots driving holidaymakers to discover new areas of Wales? ""This group that we have coming in July will be travelling in a 'bubble of six', they will sit at meal times together, visit attractions on the coach and they will also have received two vaccinations,"" she said. ""Most of our clients are extremely well-travelled and are desperate to travel again."" There has been a cancellation, though, from a group from Sweden who had a special interest in gardens. Despite this, Ms Redler believed 2022 would be ""extremely busy"" because of pent-up demand when quarantine restrictions should have ended. Mid Wales Tourism chairman Rowland Rees-Evans believed people were ""desperate to get out"", adding: ""It's been 14 months of life none of us were expecting, and we are getting back to some normality."" He is also a director at Penrhos Park, near Aberystwyth, and thought the demand was helping people to discover new areas. ""If they couldn't get in Pembrokeshire or north Wales, they are looking to go somewhere else,"" Mr Rees-Evans added. ""Mid Wales as a region is becoming more recognised.""

Peru more than doubles Covid death toll,"The rise is in line with so-called excess deaths figures Peru has more than doubled its Covid death toll following a review,making it the country with the world's highest death rate per capita,external, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The official death toll is now more than 180,000, up from 69,342, in a country of about 33 million people. Prime Minister Violeta Bermudez said the number was increased on the advice of Peruvian and international experts. This was in line with so-called excess deaths figures. Excess deaths are a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years. ""We think it is our duty to make public this updated information,"" Ms Bermudez said. Brazil variant drives South America Covid surge Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The news, released on Monday, came just six days before Peru is set to hold a presidential run-off election between leftist Pedro Castillo and right-wing candidate Keiko Fujimori. Peru has been one of the worst-hit countries in Latin America, resulting in an overstretched healthcare system and a lack of oxygen tanks. It has registered 1.9 million infections in total. Some of the reasons for it being so badly hit include an absence of fridges in people's homes - forcing many households to make frequent trips to markets to shop for food rather than stocking up - and overcrowding in homes and public places. Vaccinations have been slow in Peru, as in many parts of South America The president of the Peruvian Medical Federation, Godofredo Talavera, said the increased toll was not a surprise. ""We believe this occurs because our health system does not have the necessary conditions to care for patients. ""There has been no government support with oxygen, with intensive care beds. We do not have enough vaccines at the moment. The first line of care has not been reactivated. All this makes us the first country in the world in mortality,"" he said. But experts say Peru has also had problems with its testing regime, as it lacks the resources to carry out widespread molecular tests, the most reliable type. In the early days of the pandemic, Peru bought millions of cheap tests from China, most of which were designed to detect virus antibodies, not active cases, the Associated Press reported. Some of these tests have been found by independent analysis to be sub-standard, the agency said. The criteria for recording Covid deaths has now been broadened beyond people who tested positive for the virus to include ""probable"" cases - those with ""an epidemiological link to a confirmed case"" or who present ""a clinical picture compatible with the disease"". The official number of Covid deaths now stands at 180,764, a huge increase on the previous official figure of 69,342. That makes more than 500 Covid deaths per 100,000 people, overtaking Hungary with 300 per 100,000. In comparison, neighbouring Colombia, with a larger population than Peru, has registered 88,282 deaths. Brazil has one of the world's highest death tolls with more than 460,000, but in a country of more than 211 million. Peruvians had long suspected they weren't getting the true picture of the country's dire coronavirus situation from the government. The revised figure for Covid-19 related deaths shows they were right to be doubtful. In fact, the government has admitted the real number is more than twice the previous figure. A government working group of experts, formed to analyse Peru's data, published the revised figures after establishing broader criteria by which deaths from coronavirus were recorded. Now that the narrower definition has been abandoned, the country's per capita death toll is in fact much higher than Brazil's. Such a figure coincides more closely to the anecdotal evidence coming from hospitals and intensive care units across the country and with the images of cemeteries struggling to find space for the high number of burials each day. Meanwhile, the process of vaccination has been slow and beset with difficulties across most of South America.

Extremely rare animal carvings found in Scotland,"A deer head and antlers can be seen in this image Prehistoric animal carvings thought to be thousands of years old have been found for the first time in Scotland. Historic Environment Scotland (HES) said the carvings - thought to be between 4,000 and 5,000 years old - were discovered inside Dunchraigaig Cairn in Kilmartin Glen, Argyll. They are thought to date to the Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, and include images of deer. Hamish Fenton, who has an archaeology background, found them by chance. Kilmartin Glen is viewed as one of the most important concentration of Neolithic and Bronze Age remains in mainland Scotland. Valuable as sources of meat, hides, and with bones and antlers used for a variety of tools, HES said deer would have been very important to local communities at the time. Dr Tertia Barnett said it was an extremely rare discovery Dr Tertia Barnett, principal investigator for Scotland's Rock Art Project at HES, said: ""It was previously thought that prehistoric animal carvings of this date didn't exist in Scotland, although they are known in parts of Europe. ""So it is very exciting that they have now been discovered here for the first time in the historic Kilmartin Glen. ""This extremely rare discovery completely changes the assumption that prehistoric rock art in Britain was mainly geometric and non-figurative."" Dr Barnett said there were a few other prehistoric carvings of deer in the UK, but the only others created in the Early Bronze Age were ""very schematic"". ""It is remarkable that these carvings in Dunchraigaig Cairn show such great anatomical detail and there is no doubt about which animal species they represent."" Mr Fenton said he had been passing the cairn at dusk when he noticed the burial chamber in the side of the cairn and decided to slide inside with a torch. Dr Joana Valdez-Tullett, a research assistant on Scotland's Rock Art Project, looks at the carvings ""As I shone the torch around, I noticed a pattern on the underside of the roof slab which didn't appear to be natural markings in the rock.,"" he said. ""As I shone the light around further, I could see that I was looking at a deer stag upside down, and as I continued looking around, more animals appeared on the rock."" He said the discovery had been completely unexpected. ""To me, discoveries like this are the real treasure of archaeology, helping to reshape our understanding of the past,"" he added. The cairn is currently closed while HES carries out further evaluation and puts measures in place to protect the carvings.

Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Ella Wills, Hamish Mackay, Paul Gribben, Victoria Bisset, and Claire Heald. Do join us again tomorrow. Italy reported 82 Covid-related deaths today, an almost 100% increase from 44 deaths reported on Sunday. However the number of new infections fell to 1,820, down from 2,949 yesterday, the health ministry said. Meanwhile in France, where lockdown measures are easing and the vaccination campaign is speeding up, the number of people in intensive care units with Covid is continuing to fall. There are now 2,945 people in ICUs. At one point in mid-April there were more than 6,000 people in their care. However, France's health ministry has also reported 126 new Covid deaths in hospitals today - an increase from the last three days, including over the weekend, where the hospital Covid death toll was below 100. Hungary's planned vaccine factory, which was first announced in December, will produce China's Sinopharm vaccine. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto made the announcement today, after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Hungary is the only EU country to vaccinate people with Sinopharm, and also with Russia's Sputnik V. Neither vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the EU. About 55 billion forints ($193m; Â£136m) has been earmarked for the plant's construction, which the government says will make Hungary self-sufficient in vaccine production from the end of 2022. The government also says the country has vaccinated more than half of its population, and more than a third have received two doses. India experienced its worst recession since independence in 1947 as a result of the pandemic. The country's economy contracted 7.3% in 2020-21, according to official data released today - and although it saw slight growth of 1.6% between January and March this year, there are fears a debilitating second wave of the virus has made the economic situation worse. About 230 million people in India fell into poverty because of the pandemic last year, according to a study by Azim Premji University in Bangalore. It defines poverty as living on less than 375 rupees ($5; Â£3.50) a day. Many were already struggling when the second wave of the virus hit earlier this year. In April alone Covid led to 7.3 million people losing their jobs, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy. More than 160,000 people have died in the past eight weeks, and hospitals across the country have become overwhelmed with Covid patients. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth We reported earlier that a scientist advising the government haswarned England's planned easing of lockdown on 21 June might need to be delayed. Now, Labour has said ""ministerial incompetence"" is the ""biggest threat"" to plans for exiting lockdown. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says: ""The decision to continue easing restrictions on 21 June must be taken based on  data to keep people safe and prevent overwhelming the NHS. ""The single biggest threat to that is ministerial incompetence. ""Today ministers remain engulfed and distracted by internal rows and blame-shifting at just the moment we need a laser-like focus on this [Indian] variant."" A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted in England will be reached on 14 June. Earlier, Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the government had to take things ""one step at a time"". ""We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before,"" he said. ""It will only be by then that we will see the impact of the latest easement we made on 17 May."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Southern Guangdong has become the latest Covid-19 hotspot in China. In the last 24 hours, 20 new cases have been confirmed in the province; 64 people are currently being treated in hospital. Cases span four populous cities: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan and Maoming. As a result, parts of the province have gone into lockdown. In Guangzhou, flights have largely been cancelled in and out of the cityâs international airport, and travellers on all forms of transport must show a negative Covid test within 72 hours if they wish to leave the area. Chinaâs official broadcaster, CCTV, is today calling on social media users to âcheer Guangdong onâ. It tells locals to âmake a vaccination appointment ASAP, wear a mask when you travel, and fight the epidemicâ. China is the world leader in terms of the number of vaccine doses administered; there have now beenmore than 639.17 million vaccine doses administered nationally.,external However, China has a population of 1.4 billion; strict lockdowns are common as soon as a single symptomatic Covid-19 case is identified to prevent cases from quickly spreading. The WHO is facing calls for significant reform after members jointly agreed it needed to be stronger and more independent if future pandemics are to be avoided. At the annual World Health Assembly, the UN agency's 194 member states agreed, in a 14-page resolution, to ""strengthen WHO's capacity to rapidly and appropriately assess disease outbreaks"". They also called for a total overhaul of the global alarm system. Countries and institutions were woefully unprepared for the pandemic when it hit last year, according to three independent panels that reported to the assembly. One of the reports also found that the WHO had been too slow in declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It raised this alarm on 30 January 2020. Members are now creating working groups in order to put together concrete proposals, which they will present at next year's assembly. More than 600,000 Covid vaccine doses have been administered across the UK during the past 24 hours,official data shows.,external Of those, 183,526 were first doses and 418,848 were second doses. Across the UK, 39,259,168 people have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, while 25,332,851 people are now fully vaccinated. The UK has today reportedone further death within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.,external The single death, which was in Scotland, takes the UK total by that measure to 127,782 since the start of the pandemic. There have also been another 3,383 positive Covid cases reported over the past 24 hours We reported earlier that Twickenham rugby stadium has been turned into a vaccination walk-in centre. It's part of an effort to suppress the spread of cases of the Covid variant first identified in India in nearby Hounslow The NHS has now confirmed that, for the rest of the day, anyone aged over 18 can turn up to to the stadium and receive a vaccine. The rollout is happening at the ground until 20:00 BST this evening. For people living in the UK, foreign holidays are back, but organising a trip isn't straightforward. England'straffic light listclasses destinations as green, amber or red. Similar rules apply inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. There's no quarantine when you return from a green country. However, you must pay for Covid tests before and after you travel andcomplete a passenger locator form,external. If you're thinking of booking a holiday abroad and are confused about the rules,you can read this BBC guide to the current situation. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Cases remain
high in Taiwan even though the island has been in near lockdown since 20 May. In the last 24
hours, Taiwan has confirmed278 new cases, and 15 new deaths,external. This is striking, given that on 20 May, Taiwanâs total death toll was 15. There
have now been124 total deaths,external,
with the youngest being36-years-old,external. A level 3
Covid-19 alert is in place across the island until 14 June. There are four
Covid-19 alert responses. Level 3 means all but essential businesses are
closed, and mask-wearing is mandatory. A level 4 response would be a full
lockdown. Over the
weekend, one of Taiwanâs hardest hit areas, Taipei, conducted a simulation for
a level 4 lockdownto help people prepare for potential further restrictions,external. However, the
Taipei Times says âthere is evidence that the situation has stabilised over the
past three daysâ. Taiwan News
says the R numberhas dropped to 1.02,external. However, this latest outbreak meant that
the R hit a peak of 15 in mid-May. In the early
stages of the pandemic, Taiwan was seen as something of a success story; swift
lockdowns and strict quarantines meant there were fewer than 800 cases by the
end of 2020. Taiwan has a
population of 23.8 million. Palau, a remote island nation in the Pacific, has reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus. The island has a population of just 21,000, and has so far managed to avoid the virus by closing its borders early in the pandemic - despite its economy, which relies on tourism, taking a big hit. The health ministry says a traveller who arrived in Palau earlier this month was found to have the virus, even though they tested negative several times - once before going to the island, and twice more during a two-week quarantine. ""Further tests revealed that this is a historical - past infection - case of Covid-19 and it is not infectious,"" the ministry said in a statement today, adding that they believe the person had the virus in January this year. They refused to release any details about the person or where they're from, but said that they've been placed in isolation as a precaution. Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has announced a new 40 billion ringgit ($9.7bn; Â£6.8bn) stimulus package. Cases of Covid are rising sharply in Malaysia, and the country is entering a ""total lockdown"" tomorrow - though some factories are being allowed to keep operating at a reduced capacity. More than 1,200 deaths were reported this month, compared to 471 in the whole of last year. On Saturday, the country reported 9,020 new cases - its highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. The number of daily new Covid cases in Malaysia has also soared past India's on a per capita basis. A father says his family's stay in a quarantine hotel was their ""worst-ever experience"" after his wife and baby son were left needing hospital treatment. Abby Pansegrauw, 34, and her son, one, fell ill as a result of food they ate while at the hotel, doctors believe. Her husband, Etienne, describes staying at the Novotel London Heathrow Airport in April as like being in a prison. The hotel says it is ""unlikely"" it caused the food poisoning and it is ""disappointed"" to hear their views. The family of five, which splits its time between London and Swindon, Wiltshire, paid Â£2,400 for their 10-day stay at the hotel after paying Â£2,000 for their flights back to the UK from South Africa's Eastern Cape. You can read more about their experience here. As we've been reporting throughout the day, the government is facing calls to delay the end of social distancing measures,currently scheduled to take place in England on 21 June. But Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality, has told the BBC that any delay would be ""devastating"" for the sector and has called on the government to extend financial support for businesses if they cannot fully reopen on 21 June. ""It would be devastating for many of our members and catastrophic for those not able to open at all (such as) nightclubs and music venues and for those with restricted opening, so wedding venues and indoor leisure,"" she says. These businesses in particular are ""hemorrhaging cash"" and a delay would ""push them closer to the cliff edge of business failure"", she adds. Some government business support schemes, including grants and business rate relief, are due to be cut back in July. ""If there is any delay it's imperative to extend the business support schemes to protect the millions in the sector that are at risk,"" Nicholls says. She adds that many hospitality venues are currently operating at 60% capacity due to social distancing rules which means most businesses are not turning a profit.

And almost a third (30.8%) of all patients who definitely or probably caught coronavirus while in hospital for other reasons died within a month. NHS Scotland figures show 1,137 patients who were definitely infected while on a ward died in the subsequent 28 days, in addition to 524 deaths linked to ""probable"" cases of hospital-acquired coronavirus. Of all the patients who were diagnosed with Covid after being admitted to hospital - regardless of where the person was infected - 4,089 (26.9%) died within 28 days. The mortality data, published by Public Health Scotland, covers the period from 7 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. During that time, there were at least 3,725 definite cases of hospital infection where a patient tests positive 15 days or more after being admitted, and 1,671 probable cases where a positive test is recorded between eight and 14 days after admission.

China allows three children in major policy shiftThe change comes after a move to a two-child limit failed to stop a decline in birth rates.China,"It comes after a once-in-a-decade census showed that China's population grew at its slowest pace in decades China has announced that it will allow couples to have up to three children, after census data showed a steep decline in birth rates. China scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit which has failed to lead to a sustained upsurge in births. The cost of raising children in cities has deterred many Chinese couples. The latest move was approved by President Xi Jinping at a meeting of top Communist Party officials. It will come with ""supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country's population structure, fulfilling the country's strategy of actively coping with an ageing population and maintaining the advantage, endowment of human resources"", according to Xinhua news agency. But human rights organisation Amnesty International said the policy, like its predecessors, was still a violation of sexual and reproductive rights. ""Governments have no business regulating how many children people have. Rather than 'optimising' its birth policy, China should instead respect people's life choices and end any invasive and punitive controls over people's family planning decisions,"" said the group's China team head, Joshua Rosenzweig. Why don't Chinese women want more babies? The Chinese family in five charts Also, some experts were sceptical of the impact. ""If relaxing the birth policy was effective, the current two-child policy should have proven to be effective too,"" Hao Zhou, a senior economist at Commerzbank, told Reuters news agency. ""But who wants to have three kids? Young people could have two kids at most. The fundamental issue is living costs are too high and life pressures are too huge."" On a rainy, bleak day in Beijing I was out buying a coffee when the news broke. People started looking down at their phones as they beeped and whirred with the headline flashing across their screens - China to allow couples to have three children. This is big news in a country which didn't start suddenly producing more babies when the one-child policy eased off to two. In fact, many are asking how a three-child policy might mean more children when the two-child version didn't and why birth restrictions have remained here at all given the demographic trend. Very good questions. One thought is that, among those prepared to have two children, at least some parents will have three. However, I have interviewed many young Chinese couples about this subject and it is hard to find those who want bigger families these days. Generations of Chinese people have lived without siblings and are used to small families - affluence has meant less need for multiple children to become family-supporting workers, and young professionals say they'd rather give one child more advantages than spread their income among several kids. The census, released this month, showed that around 12 million babies were born last year - a significant decrease from the 18 million in 2016, and the lowest number of births recorded since the 1960s. The census was conducted in late 2020 - some seven million census takers had gone door to door to collect information from households. Given the sheer number of people surveyed, it is considered the most comprehensive resource on China's population, which is important for future planning. It was widely expected after the census data results were released that China would relax its family policy rules. By Kerry Allen, China Media Analyst China's leading media are giving a lot of fanfare to the ""three-child policy"". Newspaper People's Daily, broadcaster CCTV and news agency Xinhua are all posting happy cartoon images of children today on their social media pages and saying that the new policy has ""arrived"". It is already the top talking point on popular social network Sina Weibo - posts mentioning the new policy have already racked up tens of thousands of views, and hundreds of thousands of comments. More than 180,000 users have commented on Xinhua's upbeat post, and the ones with the most likes do not look upon the policy kindly. ""There are too many big pressures in life at the moment,"" one user says, ""Young people are not willing to have kids."" Many talk about modern day ""workplace dilemmas"" for people leaving on maternity/paternity leave and there not being even ""the most basic reproductive benefits"". And with a shrinking labour market, young Chinese people today accept that they have to work longer hours. Overtime and overwork are endemic. More women meanwhile are choosing to pursue further education and employment, rather than settle down early to start a family. The government's move in 2016 to allow couples to have two children failed to reverse the country's falling birth rate despite a two-year increase immediately afterwards. Yue Su, principal economist from The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: ""While the second-child policy had a positive impact on the birth rate, it proved short-term in nature."" China's population trends have over the years been largely shaped by the one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to slow population growth. Families that violated the rules faced fines, loss of employment and sometimes forced abortions. The one-child policy also led to a severe gender imbalance in the country. The traditional preference for male children led to large numbers of girls being abandoned or placed in orphanages, or cases of sex-selective abortions or even female infanticide. ""This poses problems for the marriage market, especially for men with less socioeconomic resources,"" Dr Mu Zheng, from the National University of Singapore's sociology department, said. Ahead of China's latest census, experts had speculated that birth restrictions might be lifted entirely - though it appears as though China is treading cautiously. But others said that such a move could potentially lead to ""other problems"" - pointing out the huge disparity between city dwellers and rural people. As much as women living in expensive cities such as Beijing and Shanghai may wish to delay or avoid childbirth, those in the countryside are likely to still follow tradition and want large families, they say. ""If we free up policy, people in the countryside could be more willing to give birth than those in the cities, and there could be other problems,"" a policy insider had earlier told Reuters, noting that it could lead to poverty and employment pressures among rural families. Experts had warned that any impact on China's population, such as a decline, could have a vast effect on other parts of the world. Dr Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said: ""China's economy has grown very quickly, and many industries in the world rely on China. The scope of the impact of a population decline would be very wide."" This video can not be played Do China's 'one child generation' want more children? Why don't Chinese women want more babies?

LiveLiveDelay lockdown easing by a few weeks - scientist3 minutes ago,"A scientist advising the government says lockdown relaxations planned for 21 June in England should be delayed by a ""few weeks"" Professor Ravi Gupta says there are early signs the UK is in a new wave of Covid-19 and more intelligence should be gathered Minister George Eustice says the government wants to monitor the data further before making a final decision The UK records one death within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test; and 3,383 positive cases The global economy looks like it will recover more strongly than thought, the OECD says, forecasting 7.2% growth for the UK in 2021 Around a million households fear losing their homes as England's coronavirus eviction ban comes to an end on Monday, a charity says Vietnam suspends incoming flights to its capital Hanoi from Tuesday and mass tests risk groups in Ho Chi Minh City amid a new outbreak France bans all non-essential travel from the UK from Monday, to try to stop the spread of the variant first identified in India Edited by Claire Heald Here's a summary of the day's top stories.  Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Ella Wills, Hamish Mackay, Paul Gribben, Victoria Bisset, and Claire Heald. Do join us again tomorrow. Italy reported 82 Covid-related deaths today, an almost 100% increase from 44 deaths reported on Sunday. However the number of new infections fell to 1,820, down from 2,949 yesterday, the health ministry said. Meanwhile in France, where lockdown measures are easing and the vaccination campaign is speeding up, the number of people in intensive care units with Covid is continuing to fall. There are now 2,945 people in ICUs. At one point in mid-April there were more than 6,000 people in their care. However, France's health ministry has also reported 126 new Covid deaths in hospitals today - an increase from the last three days, including over the weekend, where the hospital Covid death toll was below 100. Hungary's planned vaccine factory, which was first announced in December, will produce China's Sinopharm vaccine. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto made the announcement today, after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Hungary is the only EU country to vaccinate people with Sinopharm, and also with Russia's Sputnik V. Neither vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the EU. About 55 billion forints ($193m; Â£136m) has been earmarked for the plant's construction, which the government says will make Hungary self-sufficient in vaccine production from the end of 2022. The government also says the country has vaccinated more than half of its population, and more than a third have received two doses. India experienced its worst recession since independence in 1947 as a result of the pandemic. The country's economy contracted 7.3% in 2020-21, according to official data released today - and although it saw slight growth of 1.6% between January and March this year, there are fears a debilitating second wave of the virus has made the economic situation worse. About 230 million people in India fell into poverty because of the pandemic last year, according to a study by Azim Premji University in Bangalore. It defines poverty as living on less than 375 rupees ($5; Â£3.50) a day. Many were already struggling when the second wave of the virus hit earlier this year. In April alone Covid led to 7.3 million people losing their jobs, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy. More than 160,000 people have died in the past eight weeks, and hospitals across the country have become overwhelmed with Covid patients. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth We reported earlier that a scientist advising the government haswarned England's planned easing of lockdown on 21 June might need to be delayed. Now, Labour has said ""ministerial incompetence"" is the ""biggest threat"" to plans for exiting lockdown. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says: ""The decision to continue easing restrictions on 21 June must be taken based on  data to keep people safe and prevent overwhelming the NHS. ""The single biggest threat to that is ministerial incompetence. ""Today ministers remain engulfed and distracted by internal rows and blame-shifting at just the moment we need a laser-like focus on this [Indian] variant."" A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted in England will be reached on 14 June. Earlier, Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the government had to take things ""one step at a time"". ""We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before,"" he said. ""It will only be by then that we will see the impact of the latest easement we made on 17 May."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Southern Guangdong has become the latest Covid-19 hotspot in China. In the last 24 hours, 20 new cases have been confirmed in the province; 64 people are currently being treated in hospital. Cases span four populous cities: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan and Maoming. As a result, parts of the province have gone into lockdown. In Guangzhou, flights have largely been cancelled in and out of the cityâs international airport, and travellers on all forms of transport must show a negative Covid test within 72 hours if they wish to leave the area. Chinaâs official broadcaster, CCTV, is today calling on social media users to âcheer Guangdong onâ. It tells locals to âmake a vaccination appointment ASAP, wear a mask when you travel, and fight the epidemicâ. China is the world leader in terms of the number of vaccine doses administered; there have now beenmore than 639.17 million vaccine doses administered nationally.,external However, China has a population of 1.4 billion; strict lockdowns are common as soon as a single symptomatic Covid-19 case is identified to prevent cases from quickly spreading. The WHO is facing calls for significant reform after members jointly agreed it needed to be stronger and more independent if future pandemics are to be avoided. At the annual World Health Assembly, the UN agency's 194 member states agreed, in a 14-page resolution, to ""strengthen WHO's capacity to rapidly and appropriately assess disease outbreaks"". They also called for a total overhaul of the global alarm system. Countries and institutions were woefully unprepared for the pandemic when it hit last year, according to three independent panels that reported to the assembly. One of the reports also found that the WHO had been too slow in declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It raised this alarm on 30 January 2020. Members are now creating working groups in order to put together concrete proposals, which they will present at next year's assembly. More than 600,000 Covid vaccine doses have been administered across the UK during the past 24 hours,official data shows.,external Of those, 183,526 were first doses and 418,848 were second doses. Across the UK, 39,259,168 people have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, while 25,332,851 people are now fully vaccinated. The UK has today reportedone further death within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.,external The single death, which was in Scotland, takes the UK total by that measure to 127,782 since the start of the pandemic. There have also been another 3,383 positive Covid cases reported over the past 24 hours We reported earlier that Twickenham rugby stadium has been turned into a vaccination walk-in centre. It's part of an effort to suppress the spread of cases of the Covid variant first identified in India in nearby Hounslow The NHS has now confirmed that, for the rest of the day, anyone aged over 18 can turn up to to the stadium and receive a vaccine. The rollout is happening at the ground until 20:00 BST this evening. For people living in the UK, foreign holidays are back, but organising a trip isn't straightforward. England'straffic light listclasses destinations as green, amber or red. Similar rules apply inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. There's no quarantine when you return from a green country. However, you must pay for Covid tests before and after you travel andcomplete a passenger locator form,external.

high in Taiwan even though the island has been in near lockdown since 20 May. In the last 24
hours, Taiwan has confirmed278 new cases, and 15 new deaths,external. This is striking, given that on 20 May, Taiwanâs total death toll was 15. There
have now been124 total deaths,external,
with the youngest being36-years-old,external. A level 3
Covid-19 alert is in place across the island until 14 June. There are four
Covid-19 alert responses. Level 3 means all but essential businesses are
closed, and mask-wearing is mandatory. A level 4 response would be a full
lockdown. Over the
weekend, one of Taiwanâs hardest hit areas, Taipei, conducted a simulation for
a level 4 lockdownto help people prepare for potential further restrictions,external. However, the
Taipei Times says âthere is evidence that the situation has stabilised over the
past three daysâ. Taiwan News
says the R numberhas dropped to 1.02,external. However, this latest outbreak meant that
the R hit a peak of 15 in mid-May. In the early
stages of the pandemic, Taiwan was seen as something of a success story; swift
lockdowns and strict quarantines meant there were fewer than 800 cases by the

"UK set for stronger post-Covid recovery, says OECDThe UK economy's post-pandemic performance will outpace other large rich nations, a new forecast says.","The UK economy's recovery from the pandemic is set to be stronger than previously thought, a leading international agency has suggested. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says the UK is likely to grow 7.2% in 2021, up from its March projection of 5.1%. The OECD raised its forecast for global growth to 5.8%, compared with the 4.2% it predicted in December. However, it warned that growth would not be shared evenly. The UK's growth is set to be the fastest among the large rich countries, the OECD says. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak attributed the strength of the forecast to the success of the UK's vaccine rollout and the government's Plan for Jobs. However, he cautioned that with debt at nearly 100% of GDP, there was a need to ""ensure public finances remain on a sure footing"". Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The OECD said prospects for the world economy had brightened, with activity returning to pre-pandemic levels. However, they remained short of what had previously been expected by the end of 2022. The OECD praised stimulus measures and swift vaccine rollouts in richer countries for boosting growth, but said the slow jab distribution in many developing countries threatened to blight their economic progress. It said the recovery would remain uneven and vulnerable to fresh setbacks as long as a large proportion of the world's population were not vaccinated. Global growth will be led by a strong upturn in the US, where GDP is forecast to reach 6.9% this year, before easing to 3.6% in 2022, the OECD added. Output in China has also caught up, but emerging-market economies, including India, may continue to have large shortfalls in GDP. The strong forecast this year for the UK reflects the key role that vaccination plays in supporting economic recovery. It is the fastest growth among the large rich countries - and within the wider G20, it's behind only India and China. But that also reflects the UK rebounding from a downturn that was one of the deepest. The OECD report gives a flavour of how countries are performing over the course of the health crisis by setting out how long it expects them to take to get back to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity (GDP) per capita. For the UK, it's the middle of next year, along with Italy and Canada. That's a few months ahead of France and Spain but behind the US, Japan and Germany. It's also behind several emerging economies, including China, which was the first to regain the lost ground. OECD Secretary-General Angel GurrÃ­a said there was an urgent need to ""step up the production and equitable distribution of vaccines"". ""Effective vaccination programmes in many countries has meant today's economic outlook is more promising than at any time since the start of this devastating pandemic,"" he said. ""But for millions around the world, getting a jab still remains a distant prospect. We urgently need to step up the production and equitable distribution of vaccines."" OECD chief economist Laurence Boone urged stronger international co-operation between nations to help provide poorer countries with resources to vaccinate their populations. Income support for people and businesses should continue, but as restrictions ease, these should be ""better targeted"" where they are needed most, including through retraining and job placement. The OECD said support also needed to focus on ""viable businesses to encourage a move away from debt into equity, and to create jobs and invest in digitalisation"". Public debt has risen in most economies as a result of the pandemic, but current low interest rates have made servicing the debt manageable. In the UK, while GDP is predicted to return to pre-pandemic levels next year, the OECD warns that increased border costs following Brexit will hit foreign trade. Unemployment is also expected to peak at the end of 2021, with a predicted rise to 6.1% when the furlough scheme ends.

Your guide to holiday hotspots,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country.

Children aged 11 years old or younger do not need to present a negative test result to travel to France, although a ""sworn statement"" must be completed for them. Face masks are required in all enclosed public spaces. You also need to wear a mask in some outdoor public spaces, such as queues, markets, or stadiums.

LiveLiveDelay lockdown easing by a few weeks - scientistLess than a minute ago,"A scientist advising the government says lockdown relaxations planned for 21 June in England should be delayed by a ""few weeks"" Professor Ravi Gupta says there are early signs the UK is in a new wave of Covid-19 and more intelligence should be gathered Minister George Eustice says the government wants to monitor the data further before making a final decision The UK records one death within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test; and 3,383 positive cases The global economy looks like it will recover more strongly than thought, the OECD says, forecasting 7.2% growth for the UK in 2021 Around a million households fear losing their homes as England's coronavirus eviction ban comes to an end on Monday, a charity says Vietnam suspends incoming flights to its capital Hanoi from Tuesday and mass tests risk groups in Ho Chi Minh City amid a new outbreak France bans all non-essential travel from the UK from Monday, to try to stop the spread of the variant first identified in India Edited by Claire Heald Here's a summary of the day's top stories.  Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Updates were brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Ella Wills, Hamish Mackay, Paul Gribben, Victoria Bisset, and Claire Heald. Do join us again tomorrow. Italy reported 82 Covid-related deaths today, an almost 100% increase from 44 deaths reported on Sunday. However the number of new infections fell to 1,820, down from 2,949 yesterday, the health ministry said. Meanwhile in France, where lockdown measures are easing and the vaccination campaign is speeding up, the number of people in intensive care units with Covid is continuing to fall. There are now 2,945 people in ICUs. At one point in mid-April there were more than 6,000 people in their care. However, France's health ministry has also reported 126 new Covid deaths in hospitals today - an increase from the last three days, including over the weekend, where the hospital Covid death toll was below 100. Hungary's planned vaccine factory, which was first announced in December, will produce China's Sinopharm vaccine. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto made the announcement today, after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Hungary is the only EU country to vaccinate people with Sinopharm, and also with Russia's Sputnik V. Neither vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the EU. About 55 billion forints ($193m; Â£136m) has been earmarked for the plant's construction, which the government says will make Hungary self-sufficient in vaccine production from the end of 2022. The government also says the country has vaccinated more than half of its population, and more than a third have received two doses. India experienced its worst recession since independence in 1947 as a result of the pandemic. The country's economy contracted 7.3% in 2020-21, according to official data released today - and although it saw slight growth of 1.6% between January and March this year, there are fears a debilitating second wave of the virus has made the economic situation worse. About 230 million people in India fell into poverty because of the pandemic last year, according to a study by Azim Premji University in Bangalore. It defines poverty as living on less than 375 rupees ($5; Â£3.50) a day. Many were already struggling when the second wave of the virus hit earlier this year. In April alone Covid led to 7.3 million people losing their jobs, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy. More than 160,000 people have died in the past eight weeks, and hospitals across the country have become overwhelmed with Covid patients. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth We reported earlier that a scientist advising the government haswarned England's planned easing of lockdown on 21 June might need to be delayed. Now, Labour has said ""ministerial incompetence"" is the ""biggest threat"" to plans for exiting lockdown. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says: ""The decision to continue easing restrictions on 21 June must be taken based on  data to keep people safe and prevent overwhelming the NHS. ""The single biggest threat to that is ministerial incompetence. ""Today ministers remain engulfed and distracted by internal rows and blame-shifting at just the moment we need a laser-like focus on this [Indian] variant."" A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted in England will be reached on 14 June. Earlier, Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the government had to take things ""one step at a time"". ""We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before,"" he said. ""It will only be by then that we will see the impact of the latest easement we made on 17 May."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Southern Guangdong has become the latest Covid-19 hotspot in China. In the last 24 hours, 20 new cases have been confirmed in the province; 64 people are currently being treated in hospital. Cases span four populous cities: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan and Maoming. As a result, parts of the province have gone into lockdown. In Guangzhou, flights have largely been cancelled in and out of the cityâs international airport, and travellers on all forms of transport must show a negative Covid test within 72 hours if they wish to leave the area. Chinaâs official broadcaster, CCTV, is today calling on social media users to âcheer Guangdong onâ. It tells locals to âmake a vaccination appointment ASAP, wear a mask when you travel, and fight the epidemicâ. China is the world leader in terms of the number of vaccine doses administered; there have now beenmore than 639.17 million vaccine doses administered nationally.,external However, China has a population of 1.4 billion; strict lockdowns are common as soon as a single symptomatic Covid-19 case is identified to prevent cases from quickly spreading. The WHO is facing calls for significant reform after members jointly agreed it needed to be stronger and more independent if future pandemics are to be avoided. At the annual World Health Assembly, the UN agency's 194 member states agreed, in a 14-page resolution, to ""strengthen WHO's capacity to rapidly and appropriately assess disease outbreaks"". They also called for a total overhaul of the global alarm system. Countries and institutions were woefully unprepared for the pandemic when it hit last year, according to three independent panels that reported to the assembly. One of the reports also found that the WHO had been too slow in declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It raised this alarm on 30 January 2020. Members are now creating working groups in order to put together concrete proposals, which they will present at next year's assembly. More than 600,000 Covid vaccine doses have been administered across the UK during the past 24 hours,official data shows.,external Of those, 183,526 were first doses and 418,848 were second doses. Across the UK, 39,259,168 people have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, while 25,332,851 people are now fully vaccinated. The UK has today reportedone further death within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.,external The single death, which was in Scotland, takes the UK total by that measure to 127,782 since the start of the pandemic. There have also been another 3,383 positive Covid cases reported over the past 24 hours We reported earlier that Twickenham rugby stadium has been turned into a vaccination walk-in centre. It's part of an effort to suppress the spread of cases of the Covid variant first identified in India in nearby Hounslow The NHS has now confirmed that, for the rest of the day, anyone aged over 18 can turn up to to the stadium and receive a vaccine. The rollout is happening at the ground until 20:00 BST this evening. For people living in the UK, foreign holidays are back, but organising a trip isn't straightforward. England'straffic light listclasses destinations as green, amber or red. Similar rules apply inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. There's no quarantine when you return from a green country. However, you must pay for Covid tests before and after you travel andcomplete a passenger locator form,external. If you're thinking of booking a holiday abroad and are confused about the rules,you can read this BBC guide to the current situation. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Cases remain
high in Taiwan even though the island has been in near lockdown since 20 May. In the last 24
hours, Taiwan has confirmed278 new cases, and 15 new deaths,external. This is striking, given that on 20 May, Taiwanâs total death toll was 15. There
have now been124 total deaths,external,
with the youngest being36-years-old,external. A level 3
Covid-19 alert is in place across the island until 14 June. There are four
Covid-19 alert responses. Level 3 means all but essential businesses are
closed, and mask-wearing is mandatory. A level 4 response would be a full
lockdown. Over the
weekend, one of Taiwanâs hardest hit areas, Taipei, conducted a simulation for
a level 4 lockdownto help people prepare for potential further restrictions,external. However, the
Taipei Times says âthere is evidence that the situation has stabilised over the
past three daysâ. Taiwan News
says the R numberhas dropped to 1.02,external. However, this latest outbreak meant that
the R hit a peak of 15 in mid-May. In the early
stages of the pandemic, Taiwan was seen as something of a success story; swift
lockdowns and strict quarantines meant there were fewer than 800 cases by the
end of 2020. Taiwan has a
population of 23.8 million. Palau, a remote island nation in the Pacific, has reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus. The island has a population of just 21,000, and has so far managed to avoid the virus by closing its borders early in the pandemic - despite its economy, which relies on tourism, taking a big hit. The health ministry says a traveller who arrived in Palau earlier this month was found to have the virus, even though they tested negative several times - once before going to the island, and twice more during a two-week quarantine. ""Further tests revealed that this is a historical - past infection - case of Covid-19 and it is not infectious,"" the ministry said in a statement today, adding that they believe the person had the virus in January this year. They refused to release any details about the person or where they're from, but said that they've been placed in isolation as a precaution. Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has announced a new 40 billion ringgit ($9.7bn; Â£6.8bn) stimulus package. Cases of Covid are rising sharply in Malaysia, and the country is entering a ""total lockdown"" tomorrow - though some factories are being allowed to keep operating at a reduced capacity. More than 1,200 deaths were reported this month, compared to 471 in the whole of last year. On Saturday, the country reported 9,020 new cases - its highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. The number of daily new Covid cases in Malaysia has also soared past India's on a per capita basis. A father says his family's stay in a quarantine hotel was their ""worst-ever experience"" after his wife and baby son were left needing hospital treatment. Abby Pansegrauw, 34, and her son, one, fell ill as a result of food they ate while at the hotel, doctors believe. Her husband, Etienne, describes staying at the Novotel London Heathrow Airport in April as like being in a prison. The hotel says it is ""unlikely"" it caused the food poisoning and it is ""disappointed"" to hear their views. The family of five, which splits its time between London and Swindon, Wiltshire, paid Â£2,400 for their 10-day stay at the hotel after paying Â£2,000 for their flights back to the UK from South Africa's Eastern Cape.

As we've been reporting throughout the day, the government is facing calls to delay the end of social distancing measures,currently scheduled to take place in England on 21 June. But Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality, has told the BBC that any delay would be ""devastating"" for the sector and has called on the government to extend financial support for businesses if they cannot fully reopen on 21 June. ""It would be devastating for many of our members and catastrophic for those not able to open at all (such as) nightclubs and music venues and for those with restricted opening, so wedding venues and indoor leisure,"" she says. These businesses in particular are ""hemorrhaging cash"" and a delay would ""push them closer to the cliff edge of business failure"", she adds. Some government business support schemes, including grants and business rate relief, are due to be cut back in July. ""If there is any delay it's imperative to extend the business support schemes to protect the millions in the sector that are at risk,"" Nicholls says. She adds that many hospitality venues are currently operating at 60% capacity due to social distancing rules which means most businesses are not turning a profit.

And almost a third (30.8%) of all patients who definitely or probably caught coronavirus while in hospital for other reasons died within a month. NHS Scotland figures show 1,137 patients who were definitely infected while on a ward died in the subsequent 28 days, in addition to 524 deaths linked to ""probable"" cases of hospital-acquired coronavirus. Of all the patients who were diagnosed with Covid after being admitted to hospital - regardless of where the person was infected - 4,089 (26.9%) died within 28 days. The mortality data, published by Public Health Scotland, covers the period from 7 March 2020 to 31 March 2021. During that time, there were at least 3,725 definite cases of hospital infection where a patient tests positive 15 days or more after being admitted, and 1,671 probable cases where a positive test is recorded between eight and 14 days after admission.

Warning UK could be entering early stages of third waveA scientist advising the government says there has been exponential growth in the number of new cases.,"Twickenham Stadium has been turned into a vaccine walk-in centre for a day, including over-18s from the afternoon onwards There are signs the UK is in the early stages of a third wave of coronavirus infections, a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, said although new cases were ""relatively low"" the Indian variant had fuelled ""exponential growth"". He said ending Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be postponed. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government could not rule out a delay to the planned lockdown easing. But business leaders have warned of the harmful impact of any change to the proposed dates. On Monday, the UK reported more than 3,000 new Covid infections for a sixth day in a row. Prior to this, the UK had not surpassed that number since 12 April. No deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in England, Wales or Northern Ireland - but one death was reported in Scotland. 'Very few' Covid hospital patients had two jabs Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? When can I get the vaccine? Prof Gupta told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was already in a third wave of infections and at least three quarters of cases were the variant identified in India. He said: ""Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment - all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave."" However, he said the number of people who had been vaccinated in the UK meant this wave would probably take longer to emerge than previous ones. ""There may be a false sense of security for some time, and that's our concern."" The final stage of the government's roadmap for lifting lockdownwould remove all limitson how many people you can meet - either indoors or outdoors. But Prof Gupta - a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) - said ending restrictions in June should be delayed ""by a few weeks whilst we gather more intelligence"". Meanwhile, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the British Medical Association, said the UK was at a ""pivotal moment"" in its battle against the virus, and called on ministers to ""act with maximum caution when considering whether to go ahead with lifting restrictions"" on 21 June. ""A premature ending of all legal restrictions which then resulted in a surge of infections would undermine our health service's efforts to tackle the biggest level of backlog of care it has ever faced,"" he said. ""It would also add further demands on staff who are exhausted, both mentally and physically."" In March,almost five million patients were waiting for surgery- the highest number since modern records began. More than 436,000 were waiting more than a year, NHS England figures show - compared with just 1,600 before the Covid crisis. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said it would be ""devastating"" for the sector if they were not able to fully reopen in June, with many hospitality venues currently operating at 60% capacity because of social distancing rules. She said some businesses were ""haemorrhaging cash"" and a delay would ""push them closer to the cliff edge of business failure"". Greg Parmley, chief executive of live music trade association Live, said the whole sector - from festivals to small venues - was ""completely geared up"" for a return from 21 June after being closed for more than a year. He said the government's series of trial events had shown ""music events can be held safely, with almost no Covid impact, so there is no reason to keep us closed any longer"". Mr Eustice told the BBC the government had to take things ""one step at a time"". ""We can't rule anything out. We know this has been a difficult pandemic, a dynamic situation. We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before. ""It will only be by then that we will see the impact of the latest easement we made on 17 May."" The timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK.The Scottish governmenthopes to lift more restrictions on 7 June, whilein Walesthere is due to be a review on 3 June.In Northern Irelandsome measures were relaxed on 24 May - the next review is due on 10 June.

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The Indian variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is thought to spread more quickly than the Kent variant, which was responsible for the surge in cases in the UK over the winter. In some areas of England - including in Bolton, Blackburn, and Sefton in north-west England and Bedford, Chelmsford and Canterbury in the South East - the Indian variant is causing the majority of infections. People queued up outside London's Twickenham rugby stadium for a Covid vaccine In England, people aged over 30 are currently able to book to get the vaccine. Twickenham Stadium in south-west London has been turned into a vaccine walk-in centre for locals for the day, in a drive to try to boost vaccinations.

Do join us again tomorrow. Italy reported 82 Covid-related deaths today, an almost 100% increase from 44 deaths reported on Sunday. However the number of new infections fell to 1,820, down from 2,949 yesterday, the health ministry said. Meanwhile in France, where lockdown measures are easing and the vaccination campaign is speeding up, the number of people in intensive care units with Covid is continuing to fall. There are now 2,945 people in ICUs. At one point in mid-April there were more than 6,000 people in their care. However, France's health ministry has also reported 126 new Covid deaths in hospitals today - an increase from the last three days, including over the weekend, where the hospital Covid death toll was below 100. Hungary's planned vaccine factory, which was first announced in December, will produce China's Sinopharm vaccine. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto made the announcement today, after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Hungary is the only EU country to vaccinate people with Sinopharm, and also with Russia's Sputnik V. Neither vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the EU. About 55 billion forints ($193m; Â£136m) has been earmarked for the plant's construction, which the government says will make Hungary self-sufficient in vaccine production from the end of 2022. The government also says the country has vaccinated more than half of its population, and more than a third have received two doses. India experienced its worst recession since independence in 1947 as a result of the pandemic. The country's economy contracted 7.3% in 2020-21, according to official data released today - and although it saw slight growth of 1.6% between January and March this year, there are fears a debilitating second wave of the virus has made the economic situation worse. About 230 million people in India fell into poverty because of the pandemic last year, according to a study by Azim Premji University in Bangalore. It defines poverty as living on less than 375 rupees ($5; Â£3.50) a day. Many were already struggling when the second wave of the virus hit earlier this year. In April alone Covid led to 7.3 million people losing their jobs, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy. More than 160,000 people have died in the past eight weeks, and hospitals across the country have become overwhelmed with Covid patients. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth We reported earlier that a scientist advising the government haswarned England's planned easing of lockdown on 21 June might need to be delayed. Now, Labour has said ""ministerial incompetence"" is the ""biggest threat"" to plans for exiting lockdown. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says: ""The decision to continue easing restrictions on 21 June must be taken based on  data to keep people safe and prevent overwhelming the NHS. ""The single biggest threat to that is ministerial incompetence. ""Today ministers remain engulfed and distracted by internal rows and blame-shifting at just the moment we need a laser-like focus on this [Indian] variant."" A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted in England will be reached on 14 June. Earlier, Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the government had to take things ""one step at a time"". ""We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before,"" he said. ""It will only be by then that we will see the impact of the latest easement we made on 17 May."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Southern Guangdong has become the latest Covid-19 hotspot in China. In the last 24 hours, 20 new cases have been confirmed in the province; 64 people are currently being treated in hospital. Cases span four populous cities: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan and Maoming. As a result, parts of the province have gone into lockdown. In Guangzhou, flights have largely been cancelled in and out of the cityâs international airport, and travellers on all forms of transport must show a negative Covid test within 72 hours if they wish to leave the area. Chinaâs official broadcaster, CCTV, is today calling on social media users to âcheer Guangdong onâ. It tells locals to âmake a vaccination appointment ASAP, wear a mask when you travel, and fight the epidemicâ. China is the world leader in terms of the number of vaccine doses administered; there have now beenmore than 639.17 million vaccine doses administered nationally.,external However, China has a population of 1.4 billion; strict lockdowns are common as soon as a single symptomatic Covid-19 case is identified to prevent cases from quickly spreading. The WHO is facing calls for significant reform after members jointly agreed it needed to be stronger and more independent if future pandemics are to be avoided. At the annual World Health Assembly, the UN agency's 194 member states agreed, in a 14-page resolution, to ""strengthen WHO's capacity to rapidly and appropriately assess disease outbreaks"". They also called for a total overhaul of the global alarm system. Countries and institutions were woefully unprepared for the pandemic when it hit last year, according to three independent panels that reported to the assembly. One of the reports also found that the WHO had been too slow in declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It raised this alarm on 30 January 2020. Members are now creating working groups in order to put together concrete proposals, which they will present at next year's assembly. More than 600,000 Covid vaccine doses have been administered across the UK during the past 24 hours,official data shows.,external Of those, 183,526 were first doses and 418,848 were second doses. Across the UK, 39,259,168 people have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, while 25,332,851 people are now fully vaccinated. The UK has today reportedone further death within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.,external The single death, which was in Scotland, takes the UK total by that measure to 127,782 since the start of the pandemic. There have also been another 3,383 positive Covid cases reported over the past 24 hours We reported earlier that Twickenham rugby stadium has been turned into a vaccination walk-in centre. It's part of an effort to suppress the spread of cases of the Covid variant first identified in India in nearby Hounslow The NHS has now confirmed that, for the rest of the day, anyone aged over 18 can turn up to to the stadium and receive a vaccine. The rollout is happening at the ground until 20:00 BST this evening. For people living in the UK, foreign holidays are back, but organising a trip isn't straightforward. England'straffic light listclasses destinations as green, amber or red. Similar rules apply inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. There's no quarantine when you return from a green country. However, you must pay for Covid tests before and after you travel andcomplete a passenger locator form,external.

high in Taiwan even though the island has been in near lockdown since 20 May. In the last 24
hours, Taiwan has confirmed278 new cases, and 15 new deaths,external. This is striking, given that on 20 May, Taiwanâs total death toll was 15. There
have now been124 total deaths,external,
with the youngest being36-years-old,external. A level 3
Covid-19 alert is in place across the island until 14 June. There are four
Covid-19 alert responses. Level 3 means all but essential businesses are
closed, and mask-wearing is mandatory. A level 4 response would be a full
lockdown. Over the
weekend, one of Taiwanâs hardest hit areas, Taipei, conducted a simulation for
a level 4 lockdownto help people prepare for potential further restrictions,external. However, the
Taipei Times says âthere is evidence that the situation has stabilised over the
past three daysâ. Taiwan News
says the R numberhas dropped to 1.02,external. However, this latest outbreak meant that
the R hit a peak of 15 in mid-May. In the early
stages of the pandemic, Taiwan was seen as something of a success story; swift
lockdowns and strict quarantines meant there were fewer than 800 cases by the
end of 2020. Taiwan has a
population of 23.8 million. Palau, a remote island nation in the Pacific, has reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus. The island has a population of just 21,000, and has so far managed to avoid the virus by closing its borders early in the pandemic - despite its economy, which relies on tourism, taking a big hit. The health ministry says a traveller who arrived in Palau earlier this month was found to have the virus, even though they tested negative several times - once before going to the island, and twice more during a two-week quarantine. ""Further tests revealed that this is a historical - past infection - case of Covid-19 and it is not infectious,"" the ministry said in a statement today, adding that they believe the person had the virus in January this year. They refused to release any details about the person or where they're from, but said that they've been placed in isolation as a precaution. Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has announced a new 40 billion ringgit ($9.7bn; Â£6.8bn) stimulus package. Cases of Covid are rising sharply in Malaysia, and the country is entering a ""total lockdown"" tomorrow - though some factories are being allowed to keep operating at a reduced capacity. More than 1,200 deaths were reported this month, compared to 471 in the whole of last year. On Saturday, the country reported 9,020 new cases - its highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. The number of daily new Covid cases in Malaysia has also soared past India's on a per capita basis.

China allows couples to have three children,"It comes after a once-in-a-decade census showed that China's population grew at its slowest pace in decades China has announced that it will allow couples to have up to three children, after census data showed a steep decline in birth rates. China scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit which has failed to lead to a sustained upsurge in births. The cost of raising children in cities has deterred many Chinese couples. The latest move was approved by President Xi Jinping at a meeting of top Communist Party officials. It will come with ""supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country's population structure, fulfilling the country's strategy of actively coping with an ageing population and maintaining the advantage, endowment of human resources"", according to Xinhua news agency. But human rights organisation Amnesty International said the policy, like its predecessors, was still a violation of sexual and reproductive rights. ""Governments have no business regulating how many children people have. Rather than 'optimising' its birth policy, China should instead respect people's life choices and end any invasive and punitive controls over people's family planning decisions,"" said the group's China team head, Joshua Rosenzweig. Why don't Chinese women want more babies? The Chinese family in five charts Also, some experts were sceptical of the impact. ""If relaxing the birth policy was effective, the current two-child policy should have proven to be effective too,"" Hao Zhou, a senior economist at Commerzbank, told Reuters news agency. ""But who wants to have three kids? Young people could have two kids at most. The fundamental issue is living costs are too high and life pressures are too huge."" On a rainy, bleak day in Beijing I was out buying a coffee when the news broke. People started looking down at their phones as they beeped and whirred with the headline flashing across their screens - China to allow couples to have three children. This is big news in a country which didn't start suddenly producing more babies when the one-child policy eased off to two. In fact, many are asking how a three-child policy might mean more children when the two-child version didn't and why birth restrictions have remained here at all given the demographic trend. Very good questions. One thought is that, among those prepared to have two children, at least some parents will have three. However, I have interviewed many young Chinese couples about this subject and it is hard to find those who want bigger families these days. Generations of Chinese people have lived without siblings and are used to small families - affluence has meant less need for multiple children to become family-supporting workers, and young professionals say they'd rather give one child more advantages than spread their income among several kids. The census, released this month, showed that around 12 million babies were born last year - a significant decrease from the 18 million in 2016, and the lowest number of births recorded since the 1960s. The census was conducted in late 2020 - some seven million census takers had gone door to door to collect information from households. Given the sheer number of people surveyed, it is considered the most comprehensive resource on China's population, which is important for future planning. It was widely expected after the census data results were released that China would relax its family policy rules. By Kerry Allen, China Media Analyst China's leading media are giving a lot of fanfare to the ""three-child policy"". Newspaper People's Daily, broadcaster CCTV and news agency Xinhua are all posting happy cartoon images of children today on their social media pages and saying that the new policy has ""arrived"". It is already the top talking point on popular social network Sina Weibo - posts mentioning the new policy have already racked up tens of thousands of views, and hundreds of thousands of comments. More than 180,000 users have commented on Xinhua's upbeat post, and the ones with the most likes do not look upon the policy kindly. ""There are too many big pressures in life at the moment,"" one user says, ""Young people are not willing to have kids."" Many talk about modern day ""workplace dilemmas"" for people leaving on maternity/paternity leave and there not being even ""the most basic reproductive benefits"". And with a shrinking labour market, young Chinese people today accept that they have to work longer hours. Overtime and overwork are endemic. More women meanwhile are choosing to pursue further education and employment, rather than settle down early to start a family. The government's move in 2016 to allow couples to have two children failed to reverse the country's falling birth rate despite a two-year increase immediately afterwards. Yue Su, principal economist from The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: ""While the second-child policy had a positive impact on the birth rate, it proved short-term in nature."" China's population trends have over the years been largely shaped by the one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to slow population growth. Families that violated the rules faced fines, loss of employment and sometimes forced abortions. The one-child policy also led to a severe gender imbalance in the country. The traditional preference for male children led to large numbers of girls being abandoned or placed in orphanages, or cases of sex-selective abortions or even female infanticide. ""This poses problems for the marriage market, especially for men with less socioeconomic resources,"" Dr Mu Zheng, from the National University of Singapore's sociology department, said. Ahead of China's latest census, experts had speculated that birth restrictions might be lifted entirely - though it appears as though China is treading cautiously. But others said that such a move could potentially lead to ""other problems"" - pointing out the huge disparity between city dwellers and rural people. As much as women living in expensive cities such as Beijing and Shanghai may wish to delay or avoid childbirth, those in the countryside are likely to still follow tradition and want large families, they say. ""If we free up policy, people in the countryside could be more willing to give birth than those in the cities, and there could be other problems,"" a policy insider had earlier told Reuters, noting that it could lead to poverty and employment pressures among rural families. Experts had warned that any impact on China's population, such as a decline, could have a vast effect on other parts of the world. Dr Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said: ""China's economy has grown very quickly, and many industries in the world rely on China.

'Extremely rare' animal carvings found in Scotland,"A deer head and antlers can be seen in this image Prehistoric animal carvings thought to be thousands of years old have been found for the first time in Scotland. Historic Environment Scotland (HES) said the carvings - thought to be between 4,000 and 5,000 years old - were discovered inside Dunchraigaig Cairn in Kilmartin Glen, Argyll. They are thought to date to the Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, and include images of deer. Hamish Fenton, who has an archaeology background, found them by chance. Kilmartin Glen is viewed as one of the most important concentration of Neolithic and Bronze Age remains in mainland Scotland. Valuable as sources of meat, hides, and with bones and antlers used for a variety of tools, HES said deer would have been very important to local communities at the time. Dr Tertia Barnett said it was an extremely rare discovery Dr Tertia Barnett, principal investigator for Scotland's Rock Art Project at HES, said: ""It was previously thought that prehistoric animal carvings of this date didn't exist in Scotland, although they are known in parts of Europe. ""So it is very exciting that they have now been discovered here for the first time in the historic Kilmartin Glen. ""This extremely rare discovery completely changes the assumption that prehistoric rock art in Britain was mainly geometric and non-figurative."" Dr Barnett said there were a few other prehistoric carvings of deer in the UK, but the only others created in the Early Bronze Age were ""very schematic"". ""It is remarkable that these carvings in Dunchraigaig Cairn show such great anatomical detail and there is no doubt about which animal species they represent."" Mr Fenton said he had been passing the cairn at dusk when he noticed the burial chamber in the side of the cairn and decided to slide inside with a torch. Dr Joana Valdez-Tullett, a research assistant on Scotland's Rock Art Project, looks at the carvings ""As I shone the torch around, I noticed a pattern on the underside of the roof slab which didn't appear to be natural markings in the rock.,"" he said. ""As I shone the light around further, I could see that I was looking at a deer stag upside down, and as I continued looking around, more animals appeared on the rock."" He said the discovery had been completely unexpected. ""To me, discoveries like this are the real treasure of archaeology, helping to reshape our understanding of the past,"" he added. The cairn is currently closed while HES carries out further evaluation and puts measures in place to protect the carvings.

Denmark accused of helping US spy on Merkel,"Angela Merkel was allegedly targeted by US intelligence Denmark's secret service helped the US spy on European politicians including German Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2012 to 2014, Danish media say. The Defence Intelligence Service (FE) collaborated with the US National Security Agency (NSA) to gather information, according to  Danish public service broadcaster DR. Intelligence was allegedly collected on other officials from Germany, France, Sweden and Norway. Similar allegations emerged in 2013. Then, secrets leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden alleged tapping of the German chancellor's phone by the NSA. When those allegations were made, the White House gave no outright denial but said Mrs Merkel's phone was not being bugged at the time and would not be in future. Germany is a close ally of the US. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and a spokesperson for Angela Merkel have said they were not aware of Danish involvement until the DR report, which was shared with other European media over the weekend. Leaks that exposed US spy programme Profile: Who is Edward Snowden? The NSA is said to have accessed text messages and the phone conversations,externalof a number of prominent individuals by tapping into Danish internet cables in co-operation with the FE. The alleged set-up, said in the report to have been codenamed ""Operation Dunhammer"", allowed the NSA to obtain data using the telephone numbers of politicians as search parameters, according to DR. DR interviewed nine sources, all of whom are said to have had access to classified information held by the FE. Along with Mrs Merkel, then-German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the opposition leader at the time, Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck, are also said to have been targeted. ""Politically I view this as a scandal,"" Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck told German media. Denmark's Defence Minister Trine Bramsen, who had reportedly been earlier informed of the espionage, told DR that ""systematic wiretapping of close allies is unacceptable"". Other European politicians have condemned the reports. Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told public broadcaster NRK: ""It's unacceptable if countries which have close allied co-operation feel the need to spy on one another."" France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France Info radio the allegations were ""extremely serious"". Neither the FE nor the NSA have yet commented on the latest reports. Following the new report, Mr Snowden accused US President Joe Biden of being ""deeply involved in this scandal the first time around"". Mr Biden was US vice-president at the time the reported surveillance took place. ""There should be an explicit requirement for full public disclosure,externalnot only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well,"" he tweeted. In 2013, Mr Snowden - a former contractor for the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) - leaked to the media details of extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence. The US then charged him with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Mr Snowden found refuge in Russia. Prior to the evidence he exposed, top US intelligence officials had publicly insisted that the NSA had never knowingly collected data from private phone records.

Netanyahu warns coalition is danger to Israel,"This video can not be played Naftali Bennett and Benjamin Netanyahu traded barbs during their televised appearances on Sunday Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that a proposed unity government aimed at replacing him would be a danger to the country's security. He urged fellow right-wingers not to back a deal after ultra-nationalist Naftali Bennett said he would form a coalition with a centrist party. Mr Netanyahu's opponents have until Wednesday to form a government. If they are successful, it would bring to an end the rule of the country's longest-serving prime minister. Mr Netanyahu, who faces serious corruption charges and could go to jail, fell short of a decisive majority at a general election in March. It was the country's fourth inconclusive vote in two years - and again he failed to secure coalition allies. But his opponents may only be able to form a minority government, propped up by Arab members of parliament. Who is Naftali Bennett, Israel's likely PM? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM On Monday, the centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid warned that ""many obstacles"" remained before a unity government could be formed. ""We'll have to overcome them together,"" he told journalists. ""That's our first test - to see if we can find smart compromises in the coming days to achieve the greater goal."" Tensions remain following the recent Gaza conflict, which also triggered inter-communal clashes in Israeli cities between Jews and Arabs. Some Arab politicians could be reluctant to back a government led by Mr Bennett, who is a staunch supporter of Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - land Palestinians want for a future state. ""Don't form a left-wing government - such a government is a danger to Israel's security and future,"" 71-year-old Mr Netanyahu, who has dominated Israeli politics for a generation, said on Sunday. Naming left-wing leaders who, he hinted, could weaken Israel's security cabinet, he asked: ""What impact will that have on Israel's deterrent capability? How will we look to our enemies? What will they say in Iran and Gaza?"" Mr Netanyahu accused Mr Bennett of ""misleading the public"" and of carrying out ""the fraud of the century"" - a reference to the Yamina party leader's previous public promises not to join forces with Mr Lapid. Centrist party leader Yair Lapid (L) is reportedly close to reaching a deal with the ultra-nationalist leader Naftali Bennett Mr Bennett, 49, earlier announced in a televised address that his party would join talks to form a unity government. ""Mr Netanyahu is no longer trying to form a right-wing government because he knows full well that there isn't one. He is seeking to take the whole national camp, and the whole country, with him on his personal last stand,"" Mr Bennett said. ""I will do everything to form a national unity government with my friend Yair Lapid."" Before the announcement, Israeli media reported that under the proposed terms of the deal, Mr Bennett would replace Mr Netanyahu as prime minister and later give way to Mr Lapid, 57, in a rotation agreement. The arrangement has not been officially confirmed. The proposed coalition would bring together factions from the right, the left and the centre of Israeli politics. While the parties have little in common politically, they are united in their desire to see Mr Netanyahu's time in office come to an end. Mr Lapid, a former finance minister, was given until 2 June to form a new coalition government after Mr Netanyahu failed to do so. His Yesh Atid party came second to Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud at the last election. After an evening of high political drama on Sunday, Israel is much closer to a new coalition that will unseat its long-time prime minister. But Benjamin Netanyahu should not be written off. He was quick to respond to the latest announcement with his own appeal to right-wing members of Naftali Bennett's Yamina party - and those of Gideon Saar's New Hope - not to join the agreement. He taunted them by asking ""Who will take care of settlements?"" and suggested the proposed unity government would offer a weak security cabinet that would be unable to stand up to Israel's rival, Iran. If he chips away just a couple of members of parliament with these attacks, then the prospective government could tumble. And even if this coalition does get sworn in, it will be a fragile one - bringing together parties from across the political spectrum with stark ideological differences. To stay in power, it will be forced to kick many sensitive issues into the long grass. On Saturday night, Mr Netanyahu's Likud party made an offer to Mr Bennett and the leader of another potential coalition party to share the premiership in a three-way split. His offer was rejected but the prime minister repeated the same option on Sunday. Under Israel's electoral system of proportional representation, it is difficult for a single party to gain enough seats to form a government outright. Smaller parties are usually needed to make up the numbers needed for a coalition. Mr Lapid was initially given a 28-day mandate to form a government but this was interrupted by the recent 11-day conflict in Gaza. One of his potential coalition partners, the Arab Islamist Raam party, broke off talks because of the violence.

Warning UK could be entering early stages of third wave,"Twickenham Stadium has been turned into a vaccine walk-in centre for a day, including over-18s from the afternoon onwards There are signs the UK is in the early stages of a third wave of coronavirus infections, a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, said although new cases were ""relatively low"" the Indian variant had fuelled ""exponential growth"". He said ending Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be postponed. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government could not rule out a delay to the planned lockdown easing. But business leaders have warned of the harmful impact of any change to the proposed dates. On Monday, the UK reported more than 3,000 new Covid infections for a sixth day in a row. Prior to this, the UK had not surpassed that number since 12 April. No deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in England, Wales or Northern Ireland - but one death was reported in Scotland. 'Very few' Covid hospital patients had two jabs Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? When can I get the vaccine? Prof Gupta told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was already in a third wave of infections and at least three quarters of cases were the variant identified in India. He said: ""Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment - all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave."" However, he said the number of people who had been vaccinated in the UK meant this wave would probably take longer to emerge than previous ones. ""There may be a false sense of security for some time, and that's our concern."" The final stage of the government's roadmap for lifting lockdownwould remove all limitson how many people you can meet - either indoors or outdoors. But Prof Gupta - a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) - said ending restrictions in June should be delayed ""by a few weeks whilst we gather more intelligence"". Meanwhile, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the British Medical Association, said the UK was at a ""pivotal moment"" in its battle against the virus, and called on ministers to ""act with maximum caution when considering whether to go ahead with lifting restrictions"" on 21 June. ""A premature ending of all legal restrictions which then resulted in a surge of infections would undermine our health service's efforts to tackle the biggest level of backlog of care it has ever faced,"" he said. ""It would also add further demands on staff who are exhausted, both mentally and physically."" In March,almost five million patients were waiting for surgery- the highest number since modern records began. More than 436,000 were waiting more than a year, NHS England figures show - compared with just 1,600 before the Covid crisis. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said it would be ""devastating"" for the sector if they were not able to fully reopen in June, with many hospitality venues currently operating at 60% capacity because of social distancing rules. She said some businesses were ""haemorrhaging cash"" and a delay would ""push them closer to the cliff edge of business failure"". Greg Parmley, chief executive of live music trade association Live, said the whole sector - from festivals to small venues - was ""completely geared up"" for a return from 21 June after being closed for more than a year. He said the government's series of trial events had shown ""music events can be held safely, with almost no Covid impact, so there is no reason to keep us closed any longer"". Mr Eustice told the BBC the government had to take things ""one step at a time"". ""We can't rule anything out. We know this has been a difficult pandemic, a dynamic situation. We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before. ""It will only be by then that we will see the impact of the latest easement we made on 17 May."" The timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK.The Scottish governmenthopes to lift more restrictions on 7 June, whilein Walesthere is due to be a review on 3 June.In Northern Irelandsome measures were relaxed on 24 May - the next review is due on 10 June. A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted in England will be reached on 14 June. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The Indian variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is thought to spread more quickly than the Kent variant, which was responsible for the surge in cases in the UK over the winter. In some areas of England - including in Bolton, Blackburn, and Sefton in north-west England and Bedford, Chelmsford and Canterbury in the South East - the Indian variant is causing the majority of infections. People queued up outside London's Twickenham rugby stadium for a Covid vaccine In England, people aged over 30 are currently able to book to get the vaccine. Twickenham Stadium in south-west London has been turned into a vaccine walk-in centre for locals for the day, in a drive to try to boost vaccinations. Organisers announced in the afternoon that they would be offering vaccines to anyone aged over 18 until the end of the day.

"A million fear eviction as ban ends, charity says","As England's coronavirus eviction ban comes to an end on Monday, around a million households fear losing their homes, a charity says. About 400,000 renters have had eviction notices or been told to expect them, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says. One renter in arrears told the BBC his landlord has ""the power to just flick their finger and get me out"". But a landlord said she had struggled to pay her mortgage while her tenant was not paying rent. The government said it was balancing the needs of landlords to use the courts with support for tenants by continuing to require extended notice periods. During the pandemic, bailiffs were asked not to carry out evictions if anyone living in the property had Covid-19 symptoms or was self-isolating. Eviction notice periods were extended to six months as an emergency measure during the pandemic - but will drop to four months from 1 June. Before the pandemic, notice periods were usually two months in England. Renter eviction ban to end on 31 May 'Fix the broken rental system' Joseph Rowntree Foundation economist Rachelle Earwaker said many renters in low income work such as catering or taxi driving had lost their livelihoods in the pandemic and ending the eviction ban risks ""a two-tier recovery"". ""We're really worried that there will be a wave of homelessness coming through,"" said Ms Earwaker. The charity commissioned YouGov to question more than 10,000 adults, a quarter of them renters, in England, Wales and Scotland, early in May. The findings suggest that, compared with homeowners, renters are more than three times as likely to be behind with rent or bills (6% vs 19%). They were also twice as likely to worry about: meeting their housing costs (10% vs 20%) and losing their homes within three months (5% vs 11%) Black and minority ethnic households, those on lower incomes and those with children had the highest levels of concern, the research suggests. Rudolf Bozart has had a year to forget - the media company he worked for went bust, he found a job as a carer but was made redundant. So now he delivers takeaways. The bills have mounted - energy, council tax and rent - and the 26-year-old owes the landlord Â£3,400 in arrears. The pandemic has cost Rudolf Bozart two jobs and he now owes his landlord Â£3,400 ""It is stressful and it's affecting my health and it gives a lot of sleepless nights,"" he says. ""I just don't know when I'm going to wake up to the dreadful message, saying that this is your notice because of the rent arrears. ""So far the ban on eviction was my safety net for me not ending up on the streets."" Candy Richards has been trying evict a tenant she says stopped paying his rent in October 2019, well before the pandemic. Despite being in work he now owes her more than Â£10,000 and the eviction ban means she's ""been powerless to do anything to get my property back."" Candy Richards has been trying to evict a tenant who has not paid any rent since October 2019 ""It didn't do anything to support tenants who were in genuine arrears, but what it did do was safeguard tenants who had just decided to stop paying rent or who were committing anti-social behaviour, because there was no distinction between those tenants who couldn't pay and those tenants who wouldn't pay."" She is struggling to pay mortgages on the rental property and on the home she shares with her son. ""This situation has really put me off wanting to rent the property out again in the future."" Alicia Kennedy, director of Generation Rent, an organisation representing private renters, described the government's decision to end the ban as ""reckless"". ""If the government doesn't intervene, thousands of homeless families could be turning to their council for help,"" she said. ""We can't build back better without financial support for the renters who have been hit hardest."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that 45% of private landlords own just one property and are highly vulnerable to rent arrears. It said there was financial support to help people pay their living expenses, including the furlough scheme and the Â£20-a-week Universal Credit uplift, which have both been extended until the end of September. Housing Minister Christopher Pincher said: ""As Covid restrictions are eased in line with the roadmap out of lockdown, we will ensure tenants continue to be supported with longer notice periods, while also balancing the need for landlords to access justice."" Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said expecting landlords and tenants to ""muddle through"" was a failed strategy. ""The government needs to develop a financial package which ensures that benefits cover the rents of those in receipt of them,"" he said. A tenant hardship loan scheme, similar to those inWalesandScotland,external, could be the answer, he suggests.

Primary schools urged to tackle gender stereotypes,"Tackling gender stereotypes could help prevent violence, the letter suggests Calling girls ""sweetie"" or boys ""mate"" in primary school perpetuates gender stereotypes, campaigners say. In a letter to the education secretary in England, various groups are calling on the government to address the language and ideas used in schools. Stereotypes limit children's aspirations and create inequalities that help fuel gender-based violence, they say. The government says challenging stereotypes is in its guidance. The letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is signed by various groups including Girlguiding UK, the Fawcett Society and the National Education Union. It says the curriculum, books and language used in schools reinforce ideas of how girls and boys should look and behave. It suggests schools should ""actively challenge gender stereotypes"" from an early age before they become ingrained. Gender stereotypes in adverts banned Fathers of girls 'less prone to sexism' NSPCC abuse helpline 'takes hundreds of calls' ""Evidence shows us that gender stereotyping is everywhere and it causes serious, long-lasting harm,"" according to Felicia Willow, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality. ""These stereotypes are deeply embedded, they last a lifetime and we know they are one of the reasons we see violence against women and girls,"" she said. The debate about a culture of sexual abuse in schools has escalated in recent months after the website Everyone's Invited, set up to allow survivors of sexual abuse to share their experiences, attracted more than 16,000 posts. Some were from children as young as nine. The letter calls for schools to be a key part of the response and urges the government to ensure more specialist resources and training are made available to nurseries and primary schools. It suggests this could lead to an improvement in other areas such as encouraging more girls to study science, technology and maths, helping to improve boys' reading skills and increasing children's well-being. Lifting Limits, one of the signatories to the letter, is a charity that works with primary schools, enabling teachers and pupils to learn how to spot and challenge stereotypes. Its chief executive, Caren Gestetner, says without sexist intent, language can often perpetuate ideas about what it means to be ""normal"" as a girl or boy. She says examples include addressing boys as mate or girls as sweetie or using phrases such as, ""We need a strong man to open that"", or, ""Make sure you ask Mummy to sign the form"". Teacher Megan Quinn, who works at Gospel Oak Primary School in north London, said the whole school started ""questioning things together, looking and thinking like gender detectives"". Pupils spotted examples in books and noticed that the actions in a French lesson, which were being used to teach masculine and feminine articles like ""le"" or ""la"", were based on gender stereotypes. Staff also examined the curriculum and decided to add more female scientists and composers while a lesson about dance looked at male dancers. The letter also calls on the government to ensure a new compulsory Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) curriculum, introduced last autumn, is fully rolled out in England. It focuses on relationships in primary schools and sex and relationships in secondary schools. Due to the pandemic, schools were allowed to delay the lessons until the summer term. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: ""Schools should be places where all pupils feel safe and are protected from harm."" ""Important issues such as personal privacy, consent and challenging stereotypes about gender are part of our guidance to ensure more young people have a better understanding of how to behave towards their peers, including online."" Ofsted is also undertaking a review into safeguarding measures in schools and colleges in England which will be published shortly.

Top bankers exempt from quarantine in Hong Kong,"Hong Kong is home to some of the world's biggest banks Hong Kong is offering top bankers exemptions from strict virus quarantine measures, said the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Senior executives who are fully vaccinated can apply to be exempted from a mandatory 21-day quarantine. It comes after authorities had previously warned that slow vaccination uptake could hurt the city's position as a global financial centre. Hong Kong has some of the world's strictest quarantine restrictions. Hong Kong could end up throwing away unused jabs A maximum of two senior executives from each of the financial services companies that are licensed by SFC and two of their overseas affiliates can apply for the waiver,according to the announcement,external. Five days before their trip, those applying for quarantine exemption have to provide the SFC with a copy of their passport photo page or identity card, an itinerary of their visit and proof that they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The SFC is the official body that issues licences allowing firms including investment banks, securities brokerages and asset managers to operate in Hong Kong. Anyone granted the exemption is allowed to attend only activities listed in the itinerary supplied to authorities and has to self-isolate otherwise. Anyone found breaking the rules would lose that exemption and be sent to a quarantine centre for three weeks. Those convicted of breaking the rules would also face six months in prison and a HK$5,000 ($644, Â£454) fine. Vaccine uptake has been slow in Hong Kong Government officials are currently among those who do not have to go through compulsory quarantine. Separately last week, Hong Kong warned that it could have to throw away vast stores of coronavirus vaccines because of people's reluctance to be injected. Less than 20% of people have had a jab, even though Hong Kong has more than enough doses for the whole population. The low take-up rate has been blamed on a relatively small number of infections and distrust of the government. Hong Kong's government is keen to reinvigorate the city's economy, after the pandemic and years of political tensions helped push the city into its worst ever recession. Earlier this month, official figures showed that Hong Kong's economy had finally emerged from a year and a half of contractions, but concerns remain that the recovery is uneven.

Denmark helped US spy on Europe officials - report,"Angela Merkel was allegedly targeted by US intelligence Denmark's secret service helped the US spy on European politicians including German Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2012 to 2014, Danish media say. The Defence Intelligence Service (FE) collaborated with the US National Security Agency (NSA) to gather information, according to  Danish public service broadcaster DR. Intelligence was allegedly collected on other officials from Germany, France, Sweden and Norway. Similar allegations emerged in 2013. Then, secrets leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden alleged tapping of the German chancellor's phone by the NSA. When those allegations were made, the White House gave no outright denial but said Mrs Merkel's phone was not being bugged at the time and would not be in future. Germany is a close ally of the US. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and a spokesperson for Angela Merkel have said they were not aware of Danish involvement until the DR report, which was shared with other European media over the weekend. Leaks that exposed US spy programme Profile: Who is Edward Snowden? The NSA is said to have accessed text messages and the phone conversations,externalof a number of prominent individuals by tapping into Danish internet cables in co-operation with the FE. The alleged set-up, said in the report to have been codenamed ""Operation Dunhammer"", allowed the NSA to obtain data using the telephone numbers of politicians as search parameters, according to DR. DR interviewed nine sources, all of whom are said to have had access to classified information held by the FE. Along with Mrs Merkel, then-German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the opposition leader at the time, Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck, are also said to have been targeted. ""Politically I view this as a scandal,"" Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck told German media. Denmark's Defence Minister Trine Bramsen, who had reportedly been earlier informed of the espionage, told DR that ""systematic wiretapping of close allies is unacceptable"". Other European politicians have condemned the reports. Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told public broadcaster NRK: ""It's unacceptable if countries which have close allied co-operation feel the need to spy on one another."" France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France Info radio the allegations were ""extremely serious"". Neither the FE nor the NSA have yet commented on the latest reports. Following the new report, Mr Snowden accused US President Joe Biden of being ""deeply involved in this scandal the first time around"". Mr Biden was US vice-president at the time the reported surveillance took place. ""There should be an explicit requirement for full public disclosure,externalnot only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well,"" he tweeted. In 2013, Mr Snowden - a former contractor for the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) - leaked to the media details of extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence. The US then charged him with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Mr Snowden found refuge in Russia. Prior to the evidence he exposed, top US intelligence officials had publicly insisted that the NSA had never knowingly collected data from private phone records.

Warning UK could be entering early stages of third waveProf Ravi Gupta says there has been exponential growth in the number of new coronavirus cases.UK,"Twickenham Stadium has been turned into a vaccine walk-in centre for a day, including over-18s from the afternoon onwards There are signs the UK is in the early stages of a third wave of coronavirus infections, a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, said although new cases were ""relatively low"" the Indian variant had fuelled ""exponential growth"". He said ending Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be postponed. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government could not rule out a delay to the planned lockdown easing. But business leaders have warned of the harmful impact of any change to the proposed dates. On Monday, the UK reported more than 3,000 new Covid infections for a sixth day in a row. Prior to this, the UK had not surpassed that number since 12 April. No deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in England, Wales or Northern Ireland - but one death was reported in Scotland. 'Very few' Covid hospital patients had two jabs Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? When can I get the vaccine? Prof Gupta told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was already in a third wave of infections and at least three quarters of cases were the variant identified in India. He said: ""Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment - all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave."" However, he said the number of people who had been vaccinated in the UK meant this wave would probably take longer to emerge than previous ones. ""There may be a false sense of security for some time, and that's our concern."" The final stage of the government's roadmap for lifting lockdownwould remove all limitson how many people you can meet - either indoors or outdoors. But Prof Gupta - a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) - said ending restrictions in June should be delayed ""by a few weeks whilst we gather more intelligence"". Meanwhile, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the British Medical Association, said the UK was at a ""pivotal moment"" in its battle against the virus, and called on ministers to ""act with maximum caution when considering whether to go ahead with lifting restrictions"" on 21 June. ""A premature ending of all legal restrictions which then resulted in a surge of infections would undermine our health service's efforts to tackle the biggest level of backlog of care it has ever faced,"" he said. ""It would also add further demands on staff who are exhausted, both mentally and physically."" In March,almost five million patients were waiting for surgery- the highest number since modern records began. More than 436,000 were waiting more than a year, NHS England figures show - compared with just 1,600 before the Covid crisis. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said it would be ""devastating"" for the sector if they were not able to fully reopen in June, with many hospitality venues currently operating at 60% capacity because of social distancing rules. She said some businesses were ""haemorrhaging cash"" and a delay would ""push them closer to the cliff edge of business failure"". Greg Parmley, chief executive of live music trade association Live, said the whole sector - from festivals to small venues - was ""completely geared up"" for a return from 21 June after being closed for more than a year. He said the government's series of trial events had shown ""music events can be held safely, with almost no Covid impact, so there is no reason to keep us closed any longer"". Mr Eustice told the BBC the government had to take things ""one step at a time"". ""We can't rule anything out. We know this has been a difficult pandemic, a dynamic situation. We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before. ""It will only be by then that we will see the impact of the latest easement we made on 17 May."" The timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK.The Scottish governmenthopes to lift more restrictions on 7 June, whilein Walesthere is due to be a review on 3 June.In Northern Irelandsome measures were relaxed on 24 May - the next review is due on 10 June. A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted in England will be reached on 14 June. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The Indian variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is thought to spread more quickly than the Kent variant, which was responsible for the surge in cases in the UK over the winter. In some areas of England - including in Bolton, Blackburn, and Sefton in north-west England and Bedford, Chelmsford and Canterbury in the South East - the Indian variant is causing the majority of infections. People queued up outside London's Twickenham rugby stadium for a Covid vaccine In England, people aged over 30 are currently able to book to get the vaccine. Twickenham Stadium in south-west London has been turned into a vaccine walk-in centre for locals for the day, in a drive to try to boost vaccinations. Organisers announced in the afternoon that they would be offering vaccines to anyone aged over 18 until the end of the day.

"PM marries Carrie Symonds at Westminster CathedralBoris Johnson returns to work a day after the wedding, as the newlyweds delay their honeymoon.","Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds in the garden of 10 Downing Street after their wedding Prime Minister Boris Johnson has married his fiancee Carrie Symonds in a secretly-planned wedding at Westminster Cathedral. The marriage took place in a ""small ceremony"" on Saturday afternoon, a Downing Street spokesman said. The spokesman added that the couple would celebrate again with family and friends next summer, with their honeymoon also delayed until then. The prime minister has already returned to work. He is the first PM to get married while in office in nearly 200 years. The Mail on Sunday reported,externalthat 30 guests were invited to the ceremony at short notice - the maximum number of attendees allowed under Covid restrictions in England. A small number of church officials were involved in preparations for the Catholic ceremony, which was officiated by Father Daniel Humphreys, it said. Although Mr Johnson, 56, has been married twice before, the Roman Catholic Church can allow divorcees to remarry if the previous marriages were outside the Roman Catholic Church. Boris Johnson likes to avoid talking about his private life - he's declined to answer questions on the topic for the past few years. It can't have been easy to keep yesterday's wedding - between a former journalist and someone who works in public relations - under wraps. But it seems to have taken almost everyone in Westminster by surprise. Such was the desire to keep it quiet, Downing Street only officially confirmed it had happened on Sunday morning - the day after the wedding. Christopher Lamb, Rome correspondent for Catholic magazine The Tablet, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There will be a feeling that, why are some people who are divorced allowed to be married in the church and others not? ""And I think that's where the Church, I think, can look at its current rules and see how it can become more welcoming. It has been welcoming to Boris Johnson, why not to others?"" Who is Carrie Symonds? Father Mark Drew, assistant priest at St Joseph's Church in Penketh, Warrington, said he has previously had to tell Catholic couples going through a divorce they are not able to remarry in the Church. ""It looks to them - rightly or wrongly - as if the Church is applying double standards and I do fear that this decision does make the Church look bad."" Just one official photograph has been released - the day after the wedding - showing the couple in the garden at 10 Downing Street in the hours following the ceremony. However, Conservative MP James Cleverly shared a different photograph of the newlyweds enjoying their garden reception in the Saturday sunshine, with decorations and a table of refreshments visible in the background. At this stage in the day's proceedings, Mrs Johnson is seen barefoot and her husband has dispensed with his jacket and tie. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Downing Street did not reveal any details of who was invited and whether any of Mr Johnson's Cabinet colleagues were among the guests. Several politicians have congratulated the couple, including Home Secretary Priti Patel, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi and Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey. Ms Patel wrote on Twitter: ""Many Congratulations to Mr & Mrs Johnson @BorisJohnson and @CarrieSymonds. Wishing you both much love and happiness."" Musicians were pictured leaving No 10 on Saturday night. People carrying musical instruments were seen leaving Downing Street on Saturday evening Members of the public were asked to leave Westminster Cathedral just after 13:30 BST,the Sun reported.,external The new Mrs Johnson - who has confirmed she will take her husband's surname -  wore a white dress to exchange vows with the prime minister. Her wedding dress was designed by Athens-based Christos Costarellos, who studied at the London College of Fashion anddescribes his work,externalas being ""inspired by the spirit of ancient Greek philosophy"". The last prime minister to get married while in office was Robert Banks Jenkinson in 1822. Mrs Johnson used to work in the Conservative Party press office, which she joined in 2010, and two years later she worked on Mr Johnson's successful campaign to be re-elected as mayor in London. She became the party's head of communications before leaving in 2018 to work in public relations for marine conservation organisation Oceana. Mrs Johnson then became head of communications for conservation group the Aspinall Foundation in January. The couple were first romantically linked by the media in early 2019.  In February 2020, theyrevealed that they were engagedand that she was pregnant. Their son, Wilfred,was born last April. Mr Johnson and his previous wife, Marina Wheeler,announced in 2018that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage. He was previously married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen.

UK in early stages of third Covid wave - scientistProf Ravi Gupta says there has been exponential growth in the number of new coronavirus cases.UK,"Twickenham Stadium has been turned into a vaccine walk-in centre for a day, including over-18s from the afternoon onwards There are signs the UK is in the early stages of a third wave of coronavirus infections, a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, said although new cases were ""relatively low"" the Indian variant had fuelled ""exponential growth"". He said ending Covid restrictions in England on 21 June should be postponed. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government could not rule out a delay to the planned lockdown easing. But business leaders have warned of the harmful impact of any change to the proposed dates. On Monday, the UK reported more than 3,000 new Covid infections for a sixth day in a row. Prior to this, the UK had not surpassed that number since 12 April. No deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in England, Wales or Northern Ireland - but one death was reported in Scotland. 'Very few' Covid hospital patients had two jabs Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? When can I get the vaccine? Prof Gupta told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was already in a third wave of infections and at least three quarters of cases were the variant identified in India. He said: ""Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment - all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave."" However, he said the number of people who had been vaccinated in the UK meant this wave would probably take longer to emerge than previous ones. ""There may be a false sense of security for some time, and that's our concern."" The final stage of the government's roadmap for lifting lockdownwould remove all limitson how many people you can meet - either indoors or outdoors. But Prof Gupta - a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) - said ending restrictions in June should be delayed ""by a few weeks whilst we gather more intelligence"". Meanwhile, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the British Medical Association, said the UK was at a ""pivotal moment"" in its battle against the virus, and called on ministers to ""act with maximum caution when considering whether to go ahead with lifting restrictions"" on 21 June. ""A premature ending of all legal restrictions which then resulted in a surge of infections would undermine our health service's efforts to tackle the biggest level of backlog of care it has ever faced,"" he said. ""It would also add further demands on staff who are exhausted, both mentally and physically."" In March,almost five million patients were waiting for surgery- the highest number since modern records began. More than 436,000 were waiting more than a year, NHS England figures show - compared with just 1,600 before the Covid crisis. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said it would be ""devastating"" for the sector if they were not able to fully reopen in June, with many hospitality venues currently operating at 60% capacity because of social distancing rules. She said some businesses were ""haemorrhaging cash"" and a delay would ""push them closer to the cliff edge of business failure"". Greg Parmley, chief executive of live music trade association Live, said the whole sector - from festivals to small venues - was ""completely geared up"" for a return from 21 June after being closed for more than a year. He said the government's series of trial events had shown ""music events can be held safely, with almost no Covid impact, so there is no reason to keep us closed any longer"". Mr Eustice told the BBC the government had to take things ""one step at a time"". ""We can't rule anything out. We know this has been a difficult pandemic, a dynamic situation. We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before. ""It will only be by then that we will see the impact of the latest easement we made on 17 May.""

Thousands fear losing homes as eviction ban ends,"As England's coronavirus eviction ban comes to an end on Monday, around a million households fear losing their homes, a charity says. About 400,000 renters have had eviction notices or been told to expect them, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says. One renter in arrears told the BBC his landlord has ""the power to just flick their finger and get me out"". But a landlord said she had struggled to pay her mortgage while her tenant was not paying rent. The government said it was balancing the needs of landlords to use the courts with support for tenants by continuing to require extended notice periods. During the pandemic, bailiffs were asked not to carry out evictions if anyone living in the property had Covid-19 symptoms or was self-isolating. Eviction notice periods were extended to six months as an emergency measure during the pandemic - but will drop to four months from 1 June. Before the pandemic, notice periods were usually two months in England. Renter eviction ban to end on 31 May 'Fix the broken rental system' Joseph Rowntree Foundation economist Rachelle Earwaker said many renters in low income work such as catering or taxi driving had lost their livelihoods in the pandemic and ending the eviction ban risks ""a two-tier recovery"". ""We're really worried that there will be a wave of homelessness coming through,"" said Ms Earwaker. The charity commissioned YouGov to question more than 10,000 adults, a quarter of them renters, in England, Wales and Scotland, early in May. The findings suggest that, compared with homeowners, renters are more than three times as likely to be behind with rent or bills (6% vs 19%). They were also twice as likely to worry about: meeting their housing costs (10% vs 20%) and losing their homes within three months (5% vs 11%) Black and minority ethnic households, those on lower incomes and those with children had the highest levels of concern, the research suggests. Rudolf Bozart has had a year to forget - the media company he worked for went bust, he found a job as a carer but was made redundant. So now he delivers takeaways. The bills have mounted - energy, council tax and rent - and the 26-year-old owes the landlord Â£3,400 in arrears. The pandemic has cost Rudolf Bozart two jobs and he now owes his landlord Â£3,400 ""It is stressful and it's affecting my health and it gives a lot of sleepless nights,"" he says. ""I just don't know when I'm going to wake up to the dreadful message, saying that this is your notice because of the rent arrears. ""So far the ban on eviction was my safety net for me not ending up on the streets."" Candy Richards has been trying evict a tenant she says stopped paying his rent in October 2019, well before the pandemic. Despite being in work he now owes her more than Â£10,000 and the eviction ban means she's ""been powerless to do anything to get my property back."" Candy Richards has been trying to evict a tenant who has not paid any rent since October 2019 ""It didn't do anything to support tenants who were in genuine arrears, but what it did do was safeguard tenants who had just decided to stop paying rent or who were committing anti-social behaviour, because there was no distinction between those tenants who couldn't pay and those tenants who wouldn't pay."" She is struggling to pay mortgages on the rental property and on the home she shares with her son. ""This situation has really put me off wanting to rent the property out again in the future."" Alicia Kennedy, director of Generation Rent, an organisation representing private renters, described the government's decision to end the ban as ""reckless"". ""If the government doesn't intervene, thousands of homeless families could be turning to their council for help,"" she said. ""We can't build back better without financial support for the renters who have been hit hardest."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that 45% of private landlords own just one property and are highly vulnerable to rent arrears. It said there was financial support to help people pay their living expenses, including the furlough scheme and the Â£20-a-week Universal Credit uplift, which have both been extended until the end of September. Housing Minister Christopher Pincher said: ""As Covid restrictions are eased in line with the roadmap out of lockdown, we will ensure tenants continue to be supported with longer notice periods, while also balancing the need for landlords to access justice."" Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said expecting landlords and tenants to ""muddle through"" was a failed strategy. ""The government needs to develop a financial package which ensures that benefits cover the rents of those in receipt of them,"" he said. A tenant hardship loan scheme, similar to those inWalesandScotland,external, could be the answer, he suggests.

Key Israeli party backs deal to oust Netanyahu,"This video can not be played Naftali Bennett and Benjamin Netanyahu traded barbs during their televised appearances on Sunday A key Israeli opposition party has backed a unity government that would bring to an end to Benjamin Netanyahu's time as the country's longest serving prime minister. The ultra-nationalist leader Naftali Bennett said his party would join talks to form a governing coalition with centrist party leader Yair Lapid. Mr Lapid has until Wednesday to announce the result of his efforts. Mr Netanyahu, meanwhile, said the proposed deal would ""weaken Israel"". The prime minister, who is on trial for fraud, fell short of a decisive majority at a general election in March. It was the country's fourth inconclusive vote in two years - and again Mr Netanyahu failed to secure coalition allies. Mr Bennett, 49, who leads the Yamina party, made his announcement in a televised address. ""Mr Netanyahu is no longer trying to form a right-wing government because he knows full well that there isn't one. He is seeking to take the whole national camp, and the whole country, with him on his personal last stand,"" he said. ""I will do everything to form a national unity government with my friend Yair Lapid."" Israel election hopes and fears play out in crater town Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Before the announcement, Israeli media reported that under the proposed terms of the deal, Mr Bennett would replace Mr Netanyahu, 71, as prime minister and later give way to Mr Lapid, 57, in a rotation agreement. The arrangement has not been officially confirmed. The proposed coalition would bring together factions from the right, the left and the centre of Israeli politics. While the parties have little in common politically, they are united in their desire to see Mr Netanyahu's time in office come to an end. Speaking shortly after Mr Bennett's announcement, the prime minister accused Mr Bennett of carrying out ""the fraud of the century"" - a reference to the Yamina leader's previous public promises not to join forces with Lapid. Mr Netanyahu said Mr Bennett's approach would be ""a danger for the security of Israel"". He did not elaborate. Centrist party leader Yair Lapid (L) is reportedly close to reaching a deal with the ultra-nationalist leader Naftali Bennett Mr Lapid, a former finance minister, was given until 2 June to form a new coalition government after Mr Netanyahu failed to do so. His Yesh Atid party came second to Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud at the last election. Mr Bennett's party holds a crucial six seats in the 120-member parliament that would help give the proposed opposition coalition a clear majority. After an evening of high political drama, Israel is much closer to a new coalition that will unseat its long-time prime minister. But Benjamin Netanyahu should not be written off. He was quick to respond to the latest announcement with his own appeal to right-wing members of Naftali Bennett's Yamina party - and those of Gideon Saar's New Hope - to not join the agreement. He taunted them by asking: ""Who will take care of settlements?"" and suggested the proposed unity government would offer a weak security cabinet that would be unable to stand up to Israel's rival, Iran. If he chips away just a couple of members of parliament with these attacks, then the prospective government could tumble. And even if this coalition does get sworn in, it will be a fragile one - bringing together parties from across the political spectrum with stark ideological differences. To stay in power, it will be forced to kick many sensitive issues into the long grass. On Saturday night, Mr Netanyahu's Likud party made an offer to Mr Bennett and the leader of another potential coalition party to share the premiership in a three-way split. However, his offer was rejected. But the prime minister repeated the same option on Sunday. Under Israel's electoral system of proportional representation, it is difficult for a single party to gain enough seats to form a government outright. Smaller parties are usually needed to make up the numbers needed for a coalition. Mr Lapid was initially given a 28-day mandate to form a government, but this was interrupted by the recent 11-day conflict in Gaza. One of his potential coalition partners, the Arab Islamist Raam party, broke off talks because of the violence. There were also clashes in Israeli cities between mixed Arab and Jewish populations.
