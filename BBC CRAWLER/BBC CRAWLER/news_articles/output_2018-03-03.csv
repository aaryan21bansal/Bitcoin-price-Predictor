Javier Montojo Salazar was travelling on board the ship as a member of a scientific team. It is not clear why he fell, the Spanish navy says. It happened near a Spanish research base on an island off the Antarctic Peninsula. His body was discovered after a six-hour search. It is now being taken to the Argentine port of Ushuaia. From there, it will be repatriated to Spain. The frigate captain was on board the Hesperides when he disappeared not far from the Juan Carlos I Spanish base on Livingston Island.

Turkish air strike 'kills 36 in Afrin',"This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains At least 36 pro-Syrian government troops have been killed by a Turkish air strike in the region of Afrin, a monitoring group says. The strike targeted a camp at Kafr Jina in the northern Syrian region, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. The pro-government troops entered Afrin two weeks ago to back Kurdish forces. They are fighting a Turkish military offensive that was launched to clear Kurdish groups from Afrin. Turkey considers the Kurdish militiamen there terrorists. The Syrian government has denounced the offensive as a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty and, according to state media, forces were sent in to support the Kurds. Why is Turkey targeting Kurdish forces? How Afrin became a prize worth a war The air strike followed one of the bloodiest days for Turkish troops since they began the offensive in January. Eight Turkish soldiers were killed and another 13 were injured on Thursday in fighting in Afrin. Five ""heroic comrades fell as martyrs and seven were wounded"", an initial statement from Turkey's military said. A second statement announced three more soldiers had been killed and six more wounded. No official details of the clashes were given but the private Dogan news agency said Kurdish fighters used tunnels to ambush Turkish special forces in the Keltepe district. A Turkish helicopter sent in to rescue the wounded was hit and had to turn back, the report added. Thousands of civilians in Afrin have fled their homes since Turkey's offensive began. The Turkish government says the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia is an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in south-eastern Turkey for three decades. The YPG denies any direct organisational links to the PKK. Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Neither side has released much information about fatalities, making the death toll in Afrin difficult to gauge. The UK-based SOHR says more than 141 civilians have died but Turkey denies this, saying only combatants are targeted. Last month,Amnesty International said indiscriminate shelling had killed scores of civilians in Afrin. Analysis by Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor When pro-government militia forces edged into Afrin last month, it wasn't clear what their strategic purpose would be. Videos showed a small group of militiamen being welcomed to Afrin city by Kurds there as their saviours. But it didn't seem likely that they would play much more than a symbolic role, allowing the Syrian government to vaunt a new territorial initiative but at no major risk. In fact, it seemed that it might be a way of de-escalating the latest conflict in Syria after Turkey launched its operation against Kurdish fighters there. A deal to allow the Syrian government to take over much of the control of the area might suit many of the parties involved. It might even be a less bad option for Turkey, allowing it to turn down the intensity of its offensive. But if the reports are true that pro-government forces have been badly hit by Turkish airstrikes, that would appear to undercut this interpretation, raising the prospect of yet another new flashpoint in Syria.

Trump threatens tax on EU cars,"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' US President Donald Trump has stepped up his war of words over trade tariffs, threatening to ""apply a tax"" on imports of cars from the European Union. Mr Trump said other countries had taken advantage of the US for years because of its ""very stupid"" trade deals. The trade wrangle began on Thursday when Mr Trump vowed to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. That brought a stiff response from trading partners and criticism from the IMF and WTO. EU trade chiefs have reportedly been considering slapping 25% tariffson around $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) of imports from the US, following Mr Trump's proposal of a 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% on aluminium. They would target iconic US exports including Levi's jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and Bourbon whisky, European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said. Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? In a tweet on Saturday, the president said: ""If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the US. ""They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!"" A second tweet decried the ""$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies"". Mr Trump added: ""Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!"" The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the â¬192bn (Â£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%). Germany is responsible for just over half of the EU's car exports, so new US tariffs would hurt the car industry there. But German carmakers also build hundreds of thousands of cars in the US every year - providing many US jobs that German officials say Mr Trump overlooks. A number have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider. A VW dealership in California. Mr Trump says there is a ""big trade imbalance"" Senator Orrin Hatch said: ""I'm very surprised, he's had very bad advice from somebody down there. The people who are going to have to pay these tariffs are going to be the American citizens."" Senator Ben Sasse said: ""Kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families - and will prompt retaliation."" And industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern, saying the benefits from the recent cuts in corporation tax ""could all be for naught"". But Mr Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stood firmly behind the plans, saying the president was ""fed up with the continued over-capacity, he's fed up with the subsidisation of exports to us"". It chimes with his ""America First"" policy and the narrative that the US is getting a raw deal in its trade relations with other countries. Mr Trump tweeted on Friday that the US was ""losing billions of dollars"" and would find a trade war ""easy to win"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The president is using a clause in international trade rules which allows for tariffs for national security reasons. But his move has not come totally out of the blue. The commerce department recommended tariffs in February after conducting a review under rarely invoked national security regulations contained in a 1962 trade law. Mr Trump had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines in January. The IMF said others could follow the US leader's precedent by claiming tough trade restrictions were needed to defend national security. Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed the tariffs as ""absolutely unacceptable"". He told reporters in Ontario he was ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"". It is one of several countries, including Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade World Trade Organization Director General Roberto Azevedo said: ""A trade war is in no-one's interests."" But Mr Trump tweeted, ""Trade wars are good."" Analysis by Theo Leggett, business correspondent If trade wars really were good and easy to win, the World Trade Organization probably wouldn't exist. Most countries believe that negotiations are best carried out and disputes settled through a rules-based system. Introducing trade barriers on a tit-for-tat basis has the potential to harm companies on both sides. But that's unlikely to bother Mr Trump. His campaign rhetoric drew heavily on the perceived threat to traditional US industries from foreign interlopers acting unfairly. He's simply continuing in that vein. And it's unlikely to register much with the steelworkers of Pennsylvania and Indiana. Concerned about their jobs and the future, many will welcome Mr Trump's comments.

Residents make huge scarf to wrap round homeResidents at the care home in Carmarthen are knitting the scarf to raise money for a mobile sensory unit.1han hour agoSouth West Wales,"Plas-y-Dderwen residents hope to make a scarf measuring 1190ft in total. Residents at a care home in Carmarthen have been knitting a giant scarf - long enough to wrap around their home. They are knitting the scarf to raise money for a mobile sensory unit that will be used by residents with dementia. The scarf is hoped to wrap around the Plas-y-Dderwen bungalow, which measures 363m (1,190ft). Once finished, it will be made into blankets to give to residents and charities. Plas-y-Dderwen activity co-ordinator said Janet Williams: ""It was an activity to get the residents talking really. ""We've learnt so much about our residents doing this; we learnt that one resident used to write a column for the Dairy Farmer, and one man, whose daughter also joins in, used to knit string vests for the Army."" She added: ""One lady, who normally stays in her room, has joined in with the group, and now comes to knit even when the group isn't on."" Once the scarf is finished, the housekeeper will sew pieces together to make blankets, with some going to the residents and other blankets being donated to Save the Children and Oxfam.

McDonnell warns of councils cash crisisThe shadow chancellor wants to see far more support for local authorities in the Spring Statement.2h2 hours agoUK Politics,"John McDonnell has urged the government to ensure that the Spring Statement offers help to local councils that are struggling financially. Mr McDonnell said: ""Tories are bizarrely saying they will pass up an opportunity this month to act."" He warned that councils in England are facing bankruptcy due to what he called the government's ""failed policy of austerity"". Chancellor Philip Hammond will deliver the Spring Statement on 13 March. A recent surveysuggested that 80% of England councils feared for their finances. In his speech in Southampton on Saturday, Mr McDonnell highlighted reported comments by Surrey County Council leader David Hodges - a Conservative - who said the authority faced ""the most difficult financial crisis in our history"". Mr Hodges also reportedly urged the government not to ""stand idly by while Rome burns"". Surrey County Council spans the chancellor's constituency of Runnymede & Weybridge. John McDonnell said: ""If his own Tory council leader doesn't trust his main economic policy, why should anyone else in the country?"" Mr McDonnell accused the government of trying to play down the Spring Statement by refusing to publish ""any major documents"" and moving the statement from its usual slot. A Treasury spokesman outlined the plans tothe Financial Times,externalfor the statement which, unlike most recent Budgets and Autumn statements, is being delivered on a Tuesday rather than taking the high profile slot straight after Prime Minister's Questions on a Wednesday. A spokesman for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""As part of our local government finance settlement we are delivering a real terms increase in resources to councils over the next two years, more freedom and fairness, and greater certainty to plan and secure value for money.""

French woman fined for walking wrong wayA â¬60 fine to a pregnant Paris metro user for misusing a one-way system sparks social media anger.5h5 hours ago,"Paris metro operator RATP stood by the fine Social media has reacted with outrage after a pregnant Frenchwoman was fined â¬60 (Â£54; $74) for walking the wrong way at a Paris metro station. The ticket was issued when she tried to shorten her journey by walking counter to a one-way system at Concorde. Paris metro operator RATP said the system was needed to control flow and prevent ""incidents"". The woman's partner posted a picture of the fine on social media, saying ""Bravo for this racket.""

His post led to a number of other metro users complaining that they had been targeted the same day. One, Lucile, told Le Figaro,externalshe thought the signs were there simply to make sure people did not get lost in the corridors. ""I was the only person in the corridor when they stopped me. It's unacceptable. We pay â¬75 a month for a service that doesn't always work, with seedy corridors and trains."" RATP said issuing tickets for the offence was ""infrequent"" and that it was up to individual inspectors. ""Certain corridors can only be used in one direction in order to facilitate flows and especially to avoid incidents,"" it said. Michel Babut, of the passenger group FNAUT, said the ticket was a ""total aberration"" and the rule needed a complete overhaul. One Twitter user pointed out that the fine was more than for not having a ticket, adding ""words fail me"". Another suggested that instead of fining people for walking the wrong way, they should be fined for standing on the left of escalators.

She told fans she had been given ""enough morphine to knock the Navy out but still in pain"". In her message, she added: ""Note to self: cheap plastic sledges are for sitting in and gently trundling down primary slopes NOT a substitute for a stand up snowboard."" Parish was kept warm with a foil blanket while paramedics treated her Doctors are due to operate on her on Saturday and place a pin through her shin, Parish said.

"Trump threatens tax on EU carsThe US president steps up the war of words on trade, condemning the ""big trade imbalance"".13m14 minutes agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' US President Donald Trump has stepped up his war of words over trade tariffs, threatening to ""apply a tax"" on imports of cars from the European Union. Mr Trump said other countries had taken advantage of the US for years because of its ""very stupid"" trade deals. The trade wrangle began on Thursday when Mr Trump vowed to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. That brought a stiff response from trading partners and criticism from the IMF and WTO. EU trade chiefs have reportedly been considering slapping 25% tariffson around $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) of imports from the US, following Mr Trump's proposal of a 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% on aluminium. They would target iconic US exports including Levi's jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and Bourbon whisky, European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said. Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? In a tweet on Saturday, the president said: ""If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the US. ""They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!"" A second tweet decried the ""$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies"". Mr Trump added: ""Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!"" The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the â¬192bn (Â£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%). Germany is responsible for just over half of the EU's car exports, so new US tariffs would hurt the car industry there. But German carmakers also build hundreds of thousands of cars in the US every year - providing many US jobs that German officials say Mr Trump overlooks. A number have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider. A VW dealership in California. Mr Trump says there is a ""big trade imbalance"" Senator Orrin Hatch said: ""I'm very surprised, he's had very bad advice from somebody down there. The people who are going to have to pay these tariffs are going to be the American citizens."" Senator Ben Sasse said: ""Kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families - and will prompt retaliation."" And industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern, saying the benefits from the recent cuts in corporation tax ""could all be for naught"". But Mr Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stood firmly behind the plans, saying the president was ""fed up with the continued over-capacity, he's fed up with the subsidisation of exports to us"". It chimes with his ""America First"" policy and the narrative that the US is getting a raw deal in its trade relations with other countries. Mr Trump tweeted on Friday that the US was ""losing billions of dollars"" and would find a trade war ""easy to win"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The president is using a clause in international trade rules which allows for tariffs for national security reasons. But his move has not come totally out of the blue. The commerce department recommended tariffs in February after conducting a review under rarely invoked national security regulations contained in a 1962 trade law. Mr Trump had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines in January. The IMF said others could follow the US leader's precedent by claiming tough trade restrictions were needed to defend national security. Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed the tariffs as ""absolutely unacceptable"". He told reporters in Ontario he was ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"". It is one of several countries, including Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade World Trade Organization Director General Roberto Azevedo said: ""A trade war is in no-one's interests."" But Mr Trump tweeted, ""Trade wars are good."" Analysis by Theo Leggett, business correspondent If trade wars really were good and easy to win, the World Trade Organization probably wouldn't exist. Most countries believe that negotiations are best carried out and disputes settled through a rules-based system. Introducing trade barriers on a tit-for-tat basis has the potential to harm companies on both sides. But that's unlikely to bother Mr Trump. His campaign rhetoric drew heavily on the perceived threat to traditional US industries from foreign interlopers acting unfairly. He's simply continuing in that vein. And it's unlikely to register much with the steelworkers of Pennsylvania and Indiana. Concerned about their jobs and the future, many will welcome Mr Trump's comments.

Prostate test 'breakthrough' in NHS trial,"A state-of-the-art MRI scan could reduce a man's prostate cancer diagnosis by weeks The NHS plans to cut prostate cancer diagnosis times from six weeks to a matter of days, NHS England has said. Typically a test for men with prostate cancer requires an MRI scan and a biopsy where a dozen samples are taken, requiring multiple hospital visits. But a ""one-stop"" service will be trialled in three west London hospitals which hopes to complete all the necessary tests in one day. NHS England CEO Simon Stevens said the programme was ""world-leading"". A type of MRI scan, known as an mpMRI, provides higher quality imagery and provides up to 40% of patients with a a same day diagnosis. For people who need a biopsy, ultrasound images with 3D MRI scans are used to target areas for taking tissue samples. The NHS claims the technique virtually eliminates the threat of sepsis. The technique is being trialled at Charing Cross Hospital, Epsom Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, where about 5,000 men will be tested over the next two years. Imperial College London chairman of urology Professor Hashim Ahmed said: ""Fast access to high-quality prostate MRI allows many men to avoid invasive biopsies as well as allowing precision biopsy in those men requiring it to find high risk tumours much earlier."" ""What we are hoping to do is show the NHS that this can be done, that it can be done cost-effectively and that we can improve the outcomes for men in a much better way than we were doing."" Mr Stevens said: ""This is an encouraging breakthrough in prostate cancer diagnosis that is genuinely world-leading. ""While still early days, the potential benefit to men with suspected cancer is significant."" Consultant radiologist Dr Anthony Chambers said that although he wished the researchers well he had reservations as to whether carrying out the mpMRI and biopsy on the same day was the right way forward. He said this could lead to an over-investigation of men who have a common infection called prostatitis rather than prostate cancer.

Spanish navy captain dies in Antarctica,"Javier Montojo Salazar was on board the Hesperides as a member of a scientific team A Spanish naval captain has died after apparently falling overboard from an ocean research ship in Antarctica. Javier Montojo Salazar was travelling on board the ship as a member of a scientific team. It is not clear why he fell, the Spanish navy says. It happened near a Spanish research base on an island off the Antarctic Peninsula. His body was discovered after a six-hour search. It is now being taken to the Argentine port of Ushuaia. From there, it will be repatriated to Spain. The frigate captain was on board the Hesperides when he disappeared not far from the Juan Carlos I Spanish base on Livingston Island.

Not time to nitpick on Brexit - Rees-Mogg,"This video can not be played Theresa May's full Brexit speech where she said: ""We chose to leave, we have a responsibility to help find a solution"" Brexiteers will have some concerns with Theresa May's latest Brexit speech but ""now is not the time to nitpick"", Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has said. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalthe prominent Eurosceptic praised the prime minister and urged the EU to respond with ""wisdom and not aggression"". On Friday, Mrs May warned ""no-one will get everything they want"" from talks. EU officials are now scrutinising Mrs May's speech ahead of a fresh round of negotiations next week. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, told the BBC's Today programme the prime minister had shown in her speech it was possible to have ""frictionless trade"" with the European Union while leaving the single market and the customs union. Reality Check: What were the key lines in the speech? Laura Kuenssberg analysis: Were the facts hard enough? In full: May's big Brexit speech Analysis: May gets down to business on Brexit UK's transition offer to EU nationals Speaking at London's Mansion House, Mrs May set out the UK's hopes for a future EU economic partnership, calling for ""pragmatic common sense"" in negotiations. Single market access would be ""less than it is now"", she said, and the UK would have to pay into some EU agencies. But she said she would not threaten to walk out of talks and in a message to the EU added: ""Let's get on with it."" She said all sides of the argument had to now face ""hard facts"". Mr Rees-Mogg praised her ""good speech"", saying it delivered on the government's promise to take the UK out of the customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice. ""There are inevitably a few small points that will concern Leave campaigners but we must all recognise that everyone will have to give up something to get a deal, so now is not the time to nitpick,"" he wrote. Mrs May's address was also cautiously welcomed by pro-European Conservatives. Writing in the same paper, Tory Remainer Nicky Morgan said her speech was a ""welcome dose of realism"". ""The EU can't say they don't know what the UK wants anymore,"" she added. Mr Hunt told the BBC Mrs May had successfully brought Leavers and Remainers together. She had explained in the speech, he said, how there would be ""pragmatic alignment of our regulations"" that would be of the same high standards as in European countries, but on a voluntary basis. Parliament would have the final say and the UK could always choose to have less market access. He said he was certain the negotiations would ""go to the wire"". Speaking on BBC's Newsnight the vice-president of the European Parliament, the Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, said the speech showed the realities of Brexit ""were dawning"" in the UK. She said some of Mrs May's proposals amounted to the UK wanting ""to be part of the European Union""Not time to nitpick on Brexit - Rees-Moggin all but name. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said he feared the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market have not been fully recognised by Mrs May's government. ""Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short,"" he said. In her speech, Mrs May said she was confident remaining differences over a draft EU legal agreement could be resolved, allowing trade talks to get under way. She said life would be different for the UK outside the EU's single market: ""In certain ways, our access to each other's markets will be less than it is now."" The UK could not expect to ""enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations"" of membership. Another ""hard fact"" would be the UK would still continue to be affected by EU law and some decisions of the European Court of Justice - such as the ECJ rules on whether EU agreements are legal. However, she stressed the ""jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must end"". The UK may choose to remain ""in step"" with EU regulations in areas like state aid and competition, in order to get ""good access"" to markets, she said. The hard fact for the EU was that the UK would want its own bespoke trade deal, not an ""off-the-shelf model"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said ""the real test will be whether this speech was enough to convince critics that Mrs May's ambition for Brexit is credible and achievable without alienating her own MPs"".

Is #meToo changing Hollywood?,"Female writers and directors are suddenly in hot demand in Hollywood. But will the change last? Since the downfall of powerful producer Harvey Weinstein, stories of sexual harassment, assault and widespread abuses of power have rocked industries around the US and the world. But none has been more shaken than the entertainment industry. The accounts of sleaze in Hollywood and an insidious ""casting couch"" culture have resulted in the entertainment industry taking a closer look at itself. Some calling for change say the solution to Hollywood's sexism is simple - hire more women crew members, writers and directors. ""The root of the harassment issue is actually inequality in employment,"" says Leah Meyerhoff, the founder of Film Fatales, a support group for female directors. ""Clearly when the majority of people in power are these able-bodied straight white men, a side effect is sexual harassment on set and in the world."" Of the top 100 grossing films of 2017, women represented 8% of directors; 10% of writers; 2% of cinematographers; 24% of producers and 14% of editors, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University. Directors talk about what's changing in Hollywood over brunch Could the Times Up and #MeToo movement result in a more diverse workplace in Hollywood? Many women here feel like the doors are opening. Agents and studios are scrambling to get behind female-driven projects. ""Every studio in town is desperate for women writers,"" a writer friend says while dropping off her son at school, adding that she's dusting off her old, rejected scripts. In an industry where female writers have used masculine-sounding pseudonyms to get their material read, suddenly ""Written by Alex"" has become ""Written by Alexandra"". And this year's pilot season includes what's believed to be a record number of women directors - out of 41 broadcast drama pilot directors, 14 are women. Multiple, female-driven shows are being piloted at all of the US broadcasters, including a reboot of Cagney & Lacey and the return of the fictional investigative journalist Murphy Brown. The horror of Weinstein's casting couch Bollywood's troubled relationship with women Hollywood women launch anti-abuse campaign Only a handful of the pilots will make it onto TV - but the networks and advertisers will have many shows to choose from. At a Sunday brunch in Hollywood hosted by Film Fatales, a group of women filmmakers said their optimism was tempered with scepticism that things are really changing. Doors may be opening, but will projects be ""green-lit"" and funded across the industry? ""Whether that has shifted - whether women are being hired more I'm not sure,"" says Meyerhoff. Many of the female directors at the brunch were just back from the prestigious Sundance Film Festival in Utah. This year was hailed as a great year for women at the festival, with 37% of feature films there directed by women. But it was also a quiet year for sales and distribution deals. Many of the movies celebrated at the festival may not be coming to a theatre near you any time soon. Producer Jane Zheng, director Cathy Yan, and producer Clarissa Zhang (l-r) after accepting a Special Jury Award for their film Dead Pigs at Sundance While many men are supportive of women fighting for better roles in Hollywood in front of and behind the camera, others are scared of what the movement means for their careers. One white, male director (over drinks and off the record) told me that Hollywood TV shows are so desperate to employ women that they're getting the hairdressers to direct. ""It's never been a worse time to be a white guy in Hollywood,"" he said. When pressed for specifics, the director who told me the rumour couldn't identify a single TV show or other project where the hairdresser had been yanked from the hair and makeup trailer to the directors' chair. But it's a rumour - albeit an outrageous one - typical now in Hollywood. And women in the industry say most men around them don't fear being exposed for past crimes, but they do fear what a balanced workplace would do for their creative process. This video can not be played How #OscarsSoWhite changed my life ""The men are afraid if we hire more women they won't be able to make raunchy jokes,"" says one writer. She works on a network sitcom where eight of the 10 writers are men, even though the show was created by a woman and is about a woman. She says the women also tell raunchy jokes in the writers' room. ""It's ludicrous,"" to suggest female writers stifle creativity, she says. Moonlight writer on 'envelopegate' and this year's Oscars The real-life Three Billboards stunts How Hollywood fails women on screen Actresses speaking out against the sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood say women here are experiencing a watershed moment. But as the awards season comes to a close with the Oscars, there's a risk that Hollywood's conversation and momentum will change. Dame Helen Mirren told the BBC that when she started her acting career, ""99.9%"" of the people on set were men. ""Now it's 75% male."" But Dame Helen says the culture is changing. ""We've still got a long way to go but there is definitely a change coming without question,"" she said on the red carpet of the Movies for Grownups Awards. ""We're all culpable,"" she added. ""They are cultural attitudes... and for so long we've been told 'it's nature'. They're not nature. It's culture and culture can change."" ""There is definitely a change coming without question,"" says Dame Helen Mirren Some big names are putting money behind longer-term solutions. Director Ava DuVernay and producer Dan Lin have started an internship programme with the city of Los Angeles to increase opportunities for people traditionally excluded from the entertainment industry. ""When 'Oscars So White' and 'Time's Up' put a spotlight on inequality in Hollywood, they captured the frustrations of people shut out of opportunity in what the world knows as LA's signature industry,"" said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announcing the creation of the Evolve Entertainment Fund. The fund, Garcetti says, is aimed at giving people ""in under-served communities a new opportunity to chase their dreams in Hollywood"" whether they want to be an award-winning director or are looking for one of the behind-the-scenes jobs which he calls ""the bedrock of this city's middle class"". And Nina Tassler, the former head of CBS Entertainment, has teamed up with producer Denise Di Novi to form PatMa Productions - with a plan to tell diverse stories for film and TV. ""We recognise that diverse voices from diverse backgrounds make innovative storytelling, which is good for business,"" Tassler said. ""It's a critical time.""

US investment giant pressures gun firms,"This video can not be played ""Those 17 people aren't going to be there"" - Florida student reflects on first day back in class The world's biggest investment management firm is stepping up pressure on companies that make and sell guns after the Florida school shooting. BlackRock Inc is considering offering investors the chance not to invest in gun firms, and is asking those firms how they monitor safe use of weapons. The US corporation said the Florida shooting on 14 February, in which 17 people died, required a response. It is the largest shareholder in two of the biggest US gun manufacturers. ""As it has for many people,the recent tragedy in Florida has driven home for BlackRock the terrible toll from gun violence in America,"",externalthe corporation said on its website. ""We believe that this event requires response and action from a wide range of entities across both the public and private sectors."" Four key dates that shaped the US gun debate Six radical ways to stop US school shootings America's gun culture in 10 charts It is the world's largest fund manager. BlackRock manages more than Â£4 trillion ($5 trillion) worth of investments and pension funds worldwide and is often consulted by governments. The company is the largest shareholder in leading gun makers Sturm, Ruger & Co and American Outdoor Brands (formerly Smith & Wesson). BlackRock is also a large shareholder in firms such as Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods which sell guns. But these shares represent a tiny fraction of its total assets. This video can not be played US students walk out to demand firearms control Yes. On top of a protest movement started by Florida shooting survivors, a growing number of companies have cut ties with America's main gun lobby, the National Rifle Association (NRA). These include: United and Delta airlinesand rental giantsHertz and Enterprise, which have stopped offering discounts to NRA members The family-ownedFirst National Bank of Omahasaid it would not renew NRA-branded credit cards, citing ""customer feedback"" Insurance firmChubbsaid it had stopped underwriting an NRA-branded insurance policy three months ago InsurerMetLifeInc also cut ties Two major retailers have also announced new restrictions on gun sales. Dick's Sporting Goods, which has more than 600 shops, said it would no longer sell assault-style rifles, and backed ""common sense gun reform"". American Outdoor Brands, meanwhile, reported a 33% year-on-year decline in quarterly sales on Thursday. Why the NRA wields so much power Where US protests might go from here US students say 'Never Again' Walmart said it was raising the minimum age for anyone buying guns or ammunition to 21 years. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump stunned lawmakers from both parties by accusing them of being ""petrified"" of the NRA during a meeting at the White House. But the following day he described a meeting with a top NRA lobbyist as ""great"". This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida Since the 14 February attack on the Florida school the NRA has become a target of a heated campaign for tougher gun laws. But it has not shown any sign of bending to the pressure. Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the group, told ABC News that ""the NRA doesn't back any ban"" on guns. She said the massacres like that in Florida were not caused by the NRA. The group defended itself on Twitter, saying people upset about the shooting should focus on lapses by law enforcement. NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre has said ""opportunists"" are using the Florida tragedy to expand gun control and abolish US gun rights. On 14 February, 17 people were killed and many more were injured when a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Police say Nikolas Cruz, an expelled former student, was carrying an AR-15 rifle, which he had bought legally, and several magazines of ammunition when he began the attack. He is being held in police custody.

Spanish navy captain dies in AntarcticaJavier Montojo Salazar was travelling on board the ship as a member of a scientific team.6m7 minutes agoLatin America & Caribbean,"Javier Montojo Salazar was on board the Hesperides as a member of a scientific team A Spanish naval captain has died after apparently falling overboard from an ocean research ship in Antarctica. Javier Montojo Salazar was travelling on board the ship as a member of a scientific team. It is not clear why he fell, the Spanish navy says. It happened near a Spanish research base on an island off the Antarctic Peninsula. His body was discovered after a six-hour search. It is now being taken to the Argentine port of Ushuaia. From there, it will be repatriated to Spain. The frigate captain was on board the Hesperides when he disappeared not far from the Juan Carlos I Spanish base on Livingston Island. Hesperides is used to conduct research into marine biodiversity and travels to the region regularly to provide supplies to Spanish bases there, reports say.

Sad face: Emoji Movie 'worst of 2017',"The Razzies called The Emoji Movie characters ""obnoxious"" The Emoji Movie, an animated film starring James Corden and Patrick Stewart, has swept the board at Hollywood's Razzie awards, which highlight the year's worst films. It was given four Golden Raspberry titles, including worst picture, director and screenplay. In a statement, Razzies organisers branded the film a ""talking poop opus"". Tom Cruise was named worst actor for his performance in the reboot of The Mummy. The film was poorly reviewed by critics, who described it as ""empty headed"" and ""one-note"". ""Cruise should have played the Mummy - that way his face would be swathed in bandages and his fans wouldn't have to see him sweat so hard,"" Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone.

French woman fined for walking wrong way,"Paris metro operator RATP stood by the fine Social media has reacted with outrage after a pregnant Frenchwoman was fined â¬60 (Â£54; $74) for walking the wrong way at a Paris metro station. The ticket was issued when she tried to shorten her journey by walking counter to a one-way system at Concorde. Paris metro operator RATP said the system was needed to control flow and prevent ""incidents"". The woman's partner posted a picture of the fine on social media, saying ""Bravo for this racket.""

His post led to a number of other metro users complaining that they had been targeted the same day. One, Lucile, told Le Figaro,externalshe thought the signs were there simply to make sure people did not get lost in the corridors. ""I was the only person in the corridor when they stopped me. It's unacceptable. We pay â¬75 a month for a service that doesn't always work, with seedy corridors and trains."" RATP said issuing tickets for the offence was ""infrequent"" and that it was up to individual inspectors. ""Certain corridors can only be used in one direction in order to facilitate flows and especially to avoid incidents,"" it said. Michel Babut, of the passenger group FNAUT, said the ticket was a ""total aberration"" and the rule needed a complete overhaul. One Twitter user pointed out that the fine was more than for not having a ticket, adding ""words fail me"". Another suggested that instead of fining people for walking the wrong way, they should be fined for standing on the left of escalators.

Oscars fashion: 30 years of outfits,"As the Oscars mark 90 years of film celebration in 2018, we look back at the changing styles of guests over the last 30 years of red carpet appearances.

I almost rejected Churchill role - Oldman,"This video can not be played Gary Oldman is up for the best actor Oscar Gary Oldman considered turning down the role of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour - because he's been played so well by so many other actors. The British actor is expected to lift the best actor Oscar on Sunday in LA, but said the war-time prime minister was an intimidating character to play. He said he was drawn to the film as it showed Churchill ""wasn't a curmudgeon"" but was ""energetic and funny"". ""We think of him as an old man... who was born in a bad mood,"" said Oldman. Speaking at a Hollywood event to celebrate the British nominees of the 90th Academy Awards, he told the BBC on Friday it was ""a privilege and an honour"" to play Churchill - despite the hours in hair and make up, including having his head shaved every morning. It all felt worthwhile because Churchill was ""such great company and I loved getting into work and being him"", he explained. Oldman joins the likes of Robert Hardy, Albert Finney and Brian Cox who have previously played Churchill. He said: ""It wasn't an immediate yes. Because he's been played so successfully... you wonder what you can add to the gallery."" So what was it that did make him sign on the dotted line? ""It was the story and it was a very microscopic look at a defining moment in our history and also obviously his premiership,"" Oldman said at the event, also attended by musician Jonny Greenwood and costume designer Jacqueline Durran. ""But it was the discovery I made was going to the footage, when I was just looking at him and listening to him. It was the dynamism, the energy of the man. ""We've got an idea in our heads of who he is, and that might be contaminated by other people who have portrayed him in different parts of his life, so it was a revelation to see someone who was very light on his feet, not quite as rotund as I imagined him. ""So that was a key in to show a side of him that was dynamic and energetic and funny - he wasn't a curmudgeon. We think of him as an old man with a cigar who was born in a bad mood. And I think he was far from that."" Oldman explained that he tried to imagine Churchill as a child to help him capture his character. ""Even if I'm playing a villain, you have to find a redeeming characteristic. I always look for the boy, the little boy in there. There was, from what I could see, even reading his speeches, there was a vulnerability, a cherubic sweetness to him. ""He could be grumpy, if you weren't living up to his standards I'm sure he had a sharp tongue. But there was a big heart there."" Oldman doesn't have long to wait to find out if he has beaten fellow nominees Timothee Chalamet, Daniel Day-Lewis, Daniel Kaluuya and Denzel Washington to lift the Oscar. He says whatever happens, he enjoyed the ride. ""I considered it a great honour and a privilege to play him,"" he said. ""I'm feeling very good about it. Sunday will be - these things will be what they will be. ""They'll either call your name or they won't. The ride has been enjoyable and to be recognised for playing Winston is a pride in itself. ""I'm enjoying it now. It's a moment in the Sun. There are highs and lows in your career - it's a high, you enjoy it, and then someone else is there next year.""

Prostate test 'breakthrough' in NHS trialDiagnosis times for the condition could be reduced from six weeks to a matter of days.1h41 minutes agoHealth,"A state-of-the-art MRI scan could reduce a man's prostate cancer diagnosis by weeks The NHS plans to cut prostate cancer diagnosis times from six weeks to a matter of days, NHS England has said. Typically a test for men with prostate cancer requires an MRI scan and a biopsy where a dozen samples are taken, requiring multiple hospital visits. But a ""one-stop"" service will be trialled in three west London hospitals which hopes to complete all the necessary tests in one day. NHS England CEO Simon Stevens said the programme was ""world-leading"". A type of MRI scan, known as an mpMRI, provides higher quality imagery and provides up to 40% of patients with a a same day diagnosis. For people who need a biopsy, ultrasound images with 3D MRI scans are used to target areas for taking tissue samples. The NHS claims the technique virtually eliminates the threat of sepsis. The technique is being trialled at Charing Cross Hospital, Epsom Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, where about 5,000 men will be tested over the next two years. Imperial College London chairman of urology Professor Hashim Ahmed said: ""Fast access to high-quality prostate MRI allows many men to avoid invasive biopsies as well as allowing precision biopsy in those men requiring it to find high risk tumours much earlier."" ""What we are hoping to do is show the NHS that this can be done, that it can be done cost-effectively and that we can improve the outcomes for men in a much better way than we were doing."" Mr Stevens said: ""This is an encouraging breakthrough in prostate cancer diagnosis that is genuinely world-leading. ""While still early days, the potential benefit to men with suspected cancer is significant."" Consultant radiologist Dr Anthony Chambers said that although he wished the researchers well he had reservations as to whether carrying out the mpMRI and biopsy on the same day was the right way forward. He said this could lead to an over-investigation of men who have a common infection called prostatitis rather than prostate cancer.

Lady Bird 'most overrated' Oscars film by critics,"Critics adored Lady Bird, starring Saoirse Ronan and Beanie Feldstein Lady Bird is the film that's been most overrated by critics out of all of this year's Oscar nominees, a BBC study has suggested. The drama had stellar reviews from film critics, but audiences have been a bit less generous. The difference between fan and critic score is larger than for any other 2018 Oscar-nominated feature film. At the other end of the scale, The Greatest Showman was the movie that fans loved more than critics. The study compared ratings from Metacritic, which gives each film a score based on critics' reviews, with those on IMDB, which allows filmgoers to post their own ratings. For Lady Bird, which is nominated for five Oscars including best picture, Metacritic rates it 94 out of 100. IMDB gave it 7.7 out of 10, based on 57,130 user ratings. Using the same scale as the critic score, 7.7 becomes 77 - a difference of 17 points. No other film nominated for an Oscar this year has a bigger gap between critic and audience opinion. So who's right? ""Well, it doesn't matter what critics say about a film if it doesn't make money,"" says Emma Jones, film critic and editor of Electra Media. It's ""not very surprising"" that Greta Gerwig's coming-of-age film is better loved by critics, she adds. ""She's always been a very independent film-maker, with an incredibly dry sense of humour, which isn't always to everyone's taste. But it is very much to critics' taste."" One other film was received as warmly by critics as Lady Bird - Christopher Nolan's World War Two blockbuster Dunkirk also has a Metascore of 94. But fans preferred it to Lady Bird overall, rating it 8.0 on IMDB. Hugh Jackman won audiences over - but critics disagree But neither audience nor critic ratings are everything. Box office takings are also a measure of a film's popularity. ""Everything that a critic says or a fan says on these review sites is completely subjective,"" Jones says. Meanwhile, The Greatest Showman, the musical starring Hugh Jackman as PT Barnum, is up for just one Oscar, for best original song. It has a Metascore of 48, but fans have given it an 8.0 rating on IMDB - higher than Lady Bird. Greta Gerwig on Lady Bird's perfect score Oscars 2018: Who could the winners be? All you need to know about this year's best picture nominees However, Lady Bird director Greta Gerwig needn't get too worried - being ""overrated"" by critics isn't necessarily a bad thing for its chances of a best picture statuette on Sunday. Overall, best picture winners usually appeal more to critics than audiences. Looking at all Oscar nominees since 2000, best picture winners have an average rating gap of six points in favour of critics. All but three best film winners in the last 18 years have been preferred by critics. The three that got a higher rating from fans are Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind and Crash.

Melon listeria kills three in Australia,"A third person has died in Australia after eating melon contaminated with listeria bacteria. Fifteen elderly people have now been infected in the outbreak, which is being linked to a melon-grower in the state of New South Wales. The first two fatalities were from New South Wales, and the third victim was in the state of Victoria. The elderly, pregnant, and infants are being warned to avoid melon which has already been sliced. The 15 diagnosed with the infection had all consumed rockmelon, also known as cantaloupe, before falling ill. ""People vulnerable to listeriosis should discard any rockmelon purchased before 1 March,"" Vicky Sheppeard, the director of communicable diseases for the New South Wales Health authority, said. The contamination has been traced to a farm near the city of Griffith in New South Wales. Rockmelons have been withdrawn from supermarket shelves across Australia following the outbreak, which began in January. It can be caught from food containing listeria bacteria, or close contact with farm animals Cases usually involve unpasteurised milk or dairy products, such as camembert and brie Pre-packed foods, including sandwiches and patÃ©, can also contain listeria Symptoms include high temperature, flu-like symptoms, vomiting and diarrhoea Most people infected display no symptoms, but elderly and very young people are vulnerable Source: NHS Death toll rises in most destructive wildfire Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Frenchwoman fined for walking wrong wayA â¬60 fine to a pregnant Paris metro user for misusing a one-way system sparks social media anger.8m8 minutes ago,"Paris metro operator RATP stood by the fine Social media has reacted with outrage after a pregnant Frenchwoman was fined â¬60 (Â£54; $74) for walking the wrong way at a Paris metro station. The ticket was issued when she tried to shorten her journey by walking counter to a one-way system at Concorde. Paris metro operator RATP said the system was needed to control flow and prevent ""incidents"". The woman's partner posted a picture of the fine on social media, saying ""Bravo for this racket.""

His post led to a number of other metro users complaining that they had been targeted the same day. One, Lucile, told Le Figaro,externalshe thought the signs were there simply to make sure people did not get lost in the corridors. ""I was the only person in the corridor when they stopped me. It's unacceptable. We pay â¬75 a month for a service that doesn't always work, with seedy corridors and trains."" RATP said issuing tickets for the offence was ""infrequent"" and that it was up to individual inspectors. ""Certain corridors can only be used in one direction in order to facilitate flows and especially to avoid incidents,"" it said. Michel Babut, of the passenger group FNAUT, said the ticket was a ""total aberration"" and the rule needed a complete overhaul. One Twitter user pointed out that the fine was more than for not having a ticket, adding ""words fail me"". Another suggested that instead of fining people for walking the wrong way, they should be fined for standing on the left of escalators.

IMF warns Trump tariff would hurt US,"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has joined criticism of Donald Trump's plan to impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% on aluminium. The body warned that such a move would hurt the US as well as other countries. It said others could follow the US president's precedent by claiming tough trade restrictions were needed to defend national security. Canada, the largest supplier of steel to the US, said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. It is one of several countries that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week. Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? EU trade chiefs are reportedly considering slapping 25% tariffson around $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) of imports from the US. World Trade Organization Director General Roberto Azevedo said: ""A trade war is in no one's interests."" But the rhetoric ramped up as Mr Trump tweeted, ""Trade wars are good."" By Theo Leggett, business correspondent If trade wars really were good and easy to win, the World Trade Organisation probably wouldn't exist. Most countries believe that negotiations are best carried out and disputes settled through a rules-based system. Introducing trade barriers on a tit-for-tat basis has the potential to harm companies on both sides. But that's unlikely to bother Mr Trump. His campaign rhetoric drew heavily on the perceived threat to traditional US industries from foreign interlopers acting unfairly. He's simply continuing in that vein. And it's unlikely to register much with the steelworkers of Pennsylvania and Indiana. Concerned about their jobs and the future, many will welcome Mr Trump's comments. Howhas the Trump administration responded? This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? Mr Trump tweeted on Friday morning that the US was ""losing billions of dollars on trade"" and would find a trade war ""easy to win"". Allow Twitter content?

Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and ultimately raise prices for consumers. But US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross used a can of Campbell's Soup to defend the tariffs on Friday morning as ""no big deal"". He told CNBC the duties would have a negligible effect on the price of a tin, amounting to less than a cent. ""Who in the world is going to be too bothered?"" he asked. Canada, Mexico, China, Japan and Brazil also say they are considering retaliatory steps. The prime minister of Canada - which exports more steel to the US than any other country - slammed the tariffs as ""absolutely unacceptable"". Justin Trudeau told reporters in Ontario he was ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"". This video can not be played Pascal Lamy, ex-head of the World Trade Organisation, says US consumers will pay if tariffs go ahead A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said: ""If all countries followed the example of the United States, [it] will undoubtedly result in a serious impact on the international trade order."" Kosei Shindo, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said that the move would ""create a negative chain reaction affecting not only steel but also other products considered to have national security implications"". Many US companies also expressed alarm, including beer brewers, which use aluminium for canned beverages. Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, the world's largest beer maker, warned that Mr Trump's plan was ""going to put jobs at risk and would be against the US consumer"". What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade Mr Trump has lamented the decline of the US steel industry, which since 2000 has seen production drop from 112m tons to 86.5m tons in 2016. The number of employees working in the sector has fallen over the same period from 135,000 to 83,600. But experts say far more Americans work in industries that depend on steel products than are employed in steel plants. Steel mills in 2015 employed about 140,000 Americans, according to census data. But 6.5 million Americans work for manufacturers who make things using steel. US slaps tariffs on Chinese aluminium What could China do in a US trade war? What will Trump's 'America First' policy do?

Lawsuit over Canyon crash newlywed's death,"Jonathan Udall was on honeymoon with Ellie Milward The parents of a tourist who died after a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon are suing the tour operator and the aircraft manufacturer. Jonathan Udall, 31, from Brighton, was on honeymoon in the United States with his wife, Eleanor Udall, nee Milward. Both died from burns after the crash on 10 February, which killed three others. Lawyers for Philip and Marlene Udall, of Southampton, said Papillon and Airbus Helicopters negligently failed to install a crash-resistant fuel tank. The parents' lawsuit said their son could have survived and would not have sustained ""severe and catastrophic burns"" if the Airbus EC130 B4 had been fitted with such a system. The accident happened at the West Rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona Their lawyer Gary Robb said: ""Mr and Mrs Udall deeply grieve for the loss of their son but their primary motivation now is to prevent anyone else from having to suffer the deadly burn injuries as their son did."" He said the fuel system could have allowed their son to walk away ""injury-free"". After the crash, Papillon announced it would fit 40 of the crash-resistant tanks to its fleet, but Mr Robb said it was ""too little, too late"".

Review: Civilisations on BBC Two âââââ,"You know how it is with cooking, or painting or sculpting - the art is in knowing when to stop. Great artists of the kitchen or the studio appreciate there is a very fine line between making one more tiny adjustment that takes their creation from excellent to sublime, or conversely, risks turning it into a messy failure. The same applies to TV. By adding a single pluralising letter to the classic BBC art history series Civilisation (1969), the programme makers of Civilisations opened up the tantalising possibility of producing a new TV series that didn't simply match its singular predecessor, but was much better. Kenneth Clark being filmed for his landmark Civilisation series You can see the sense in the idea. Instead of an old-fashioned, patriarchal, white, western, male view of human cultures and creativity, why not make a show that acknowledges there are different civilisations and different views, which can be put across by different presenters? (In this case, three TV-ready, scarf-wearing academics: Mary Beard, David Olusoga and Simon Schama.) Great. In theory. But in practice, well... It turns out adding that extra ""s"" has gone and over-egged the pudding. For all its faults (partial, dogmatic, occasionally dismissive), the Kenneth Clark written and presented originals had a clarity, structure, and coherent argument that made them fascinating to watch and easy to follow. In contrast, from the programmes I have seen, Civilisations is more confused and confusing than a drunk driver negotiating Spaghetti Junction in the rush hour. This video can not be played Simon Schama travels to the civilisations of Petra. Like Simon Schama's gyrating hands, which often seem to be enjoying their own private silent disco, large chunks of the individually authored films are all over the place. The series starts with Schama - who has ""always felt at home in the past"" - showing us library footage of an Islamic State wrecking crew in Mosul destroying ancient art and artefacts. He tells us the grisly story of how they brutally murdered the 82-year-old Syrian scholar Khaled al-Asaad for withholding information from them as to the whereabouts of the antiquities under his curatorial care in Palmyra. ""The record of human history brims over with the rage to destroy,"" the historian tells us with his passion dial turned up all the way to 11 (it rarely dips below 10). Simon Schama outside Itimad-ud-Daulah's Tomb in Agra, Uttar Pradesh There is no mention made of similarly barbaric acts that have taken place over millennia - on occasion perpetrated by a civilisation much closer to home - or an explanation as to the cultural rationale behind the actions of those wielding the sledgehammers in this instance. No time for nuance, I suppose, the show must go on, so we can ""see the world and our place in it in a different light"". Next comes the elevator pitch for the whole series delivered by our presenter with movie trailer-type hyperbole: ""We are the art-making animal and this is what we've made!"" Music swells, titles roll, and we're off - back to the beginning and the caves of South Africa, where we are shown a 77,000-year-old block of red ochre with the ""oldest deliberately decorative [human] marks ever discovered"". This is ""the beginning of culture"", Schama tells us, but he doesn't dwell. Moments later we're travelling through time and space like Doctor Who in a sci-fi remake of Treasure Hunt, touching down around 40,000 years later in northern Spain to visit El Castillo Cave. Hand Stencils found in the Cave of El Castillo in Spain Here, both the programme and the presenter start to settle down and enjoy what they've brought us to see: cave paintings and hand stencils. Apparently similar images have been found ""as far apart as Indonesia and Patagonia"", which is interesting. But then frustrating as no explanation is forthcoming to enlighten us as to why that might be. We are told: ""These hand stencils do what nearly all art that would follow would aspire to. Firstly, they want to be seen by others. And then they want to endure beyond the life of the maker."" Really? Was that actually the motivation behind our stencil-making ancestor? Was he or she honestly most concerned with artistic ego and posterity? Were the painted hands even intended as art? Could they not have been a functional way-finding device or a ritualistic mark or part of a magical spell? As we know from his previous docs, Schama's on-screen charisma and infectious enthusiasm make him very good televisual company. But his warmth and energy cannot conceal the problems with this first episode and the series in general, which is the absence of an intellectual argument with a discernible through line. These are patchwork programmes with rambling narratives that promise much but deliver little in way of fresh insight or surprising connections. Co-presenter Mary Beard at the Colossi of Memnon in Luxor, Egypt Mary Beard's episode, How Do We Look, is particularly disappointing because the premise is so enticing, as is the prospect of one of our foremost thinkers on matters cultural giving us a new perspective. Sadly, other than a couple of memorable TV moments when Beard encounters an ancient statue for the first time, we are offered little to excite our imaginations. We don't get the alluded-to update on Clark's Eurocentric views or on John Berger's Walter Benjamin-inspired Ways of Seeing series. There is no substantial new polemic with which to wrestle. Instead we are served a tepid dish of the blindingly obvious (art isn't just about the created object but also about how we perceive it), and the downright silly (an ancient story about a young man who supposedly ejaculated on a nude sculpture of Aphrodite thousands of years ago, which Beard describes with great theatricality as rape - ""don't forget Aphrodite [the stone statue] never consented""). Aphrodite of Menophantos, Praxiteles, (4th Century BCE), Palazzo Massimo alle Terme, Rome David Olusoga is altogether more measured and less mannered than his fellow presenters. His two films - one exploring the meeting of cultures between the 15th and 18th Centuries, the other looking at the enlightenment and industrialisation - benefit from his inquisitive nature and relaxed style. If the scripts in the series are far from being literary masterpieces, the camerawork is of the highest quality throughout - although there are too many stylised shots of out-of-focus presenters with their backs to us. But when trained on art and artefacts, the new technology and techniques at the 21st Century TV director's disposal provide us with plenty of delicious visual treats (the images from Simon Schama's trip to Petra are stunning). Ultimately though, Civilisations feels like a series made by committee: a terrific-sounding idea on paper that I suspect was a lot harder to realise in practice. The result is a well-intentioned, well-funded series that has top TV talent in all departments but which ended up being less than the sum of its parts. A case of too many cooks, maybe?

Ladbrokes threatens cut to sponsorshipThe bookmaker says proposed limits on in-store gaming machines could mean it gives less to support events.9h9 hours agoBusiness,"A large part of Ladbrokes' sports funding goes to horseracing The UK's biggest bookmaker, Ladbrokes Coral, says it will have to cut the Â£8m it spends each year on sponsoring sports events if new rules reduce the maximum stake on gaming machines. The government is currently deciding whether to cut maximum stakes on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals from Â£100 to as little as Â£2 to fight problem gambling. More than half of Ladbrokes' betting shop revenue comes via the machines. Ladbrokes says such a dramatic drop in income means cuts are made elsewhere. Almost Â£3.5m of the company's sports sponsorship is dedicated to horseracing. This includes the Ladbrokes Winter Carnival (a two day meeting at Newbury), the Coral Scottish and Welsh Grand Nationals, the Coral Cup (Wednesday at Cheltenham), the Coral Eclipse (one of the biggest flat races of the year) and the Coral Sprint at York. It also sponsors the Rugby Football League Challenge Cup and the Scottish Professional Football League as well as snooker and darts. Ladbrokes' sponsorship of the Rugby League's Ladbrokes Challenge Cup means it gets prominent promotion, including having its ribbons on the trophy Ladbrokes said: ""A severe stake cut has many implications not least on jobs, the Treasury and the sports we support. ""Sports sponsorship is a two-way street, yes we get exposure but it also helps sports finance their entire structures right down to grass-roots funding."" The company suggested that horse racing was less vulnerable to potential sponsorship cuts than other sports. It said: ""Horse racing is in the bookie DNA and some sponsorships and partnerships go back many years and have a history and association that make them very valuable and high on the list to continue."" William Hill also says that its Â£1m sponsorship of horse racing could be ""at risk"" if the stake on FOBTs was set too low. The possibility of losing sponsorship is yet another headache for horse racing, which fears that anything that hurts high street bookmakers could reduce its funding. Racing Post editor Bruce Millington said: ""No-one likes the fact that the horseracing industry is a hostage to a whole load of high octane fruit machines but there's little question that a Â£2 limit would have significant implications."" Sponsorship is just one of the ways the sport is funded by bookmakers. Horse racing bets and media screening rights also raise money for the sport A 10% levy on horse racing bets contributes about Â£50m, which is managed and distributed by the Horserace Levy Betting Board as prize money, to improve and support racecourses and invest in equine veterinary science. This used to come from bets placed in shops, but last year it was expanded to include online and offshore revenue.  As a result, it is expected to double this year and the impact of any potential shop closures on it is disputed. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said gambling was one of many ways in which sports obtain fundraising. ""We are clear that FOBT stakes will be cut to ensure we have a safe and sustainable industry where vulnerable people are protected,"" it said in a statement. The department said a final decision on maximum bets will be made ""in due course"". A much larger loss of money for horse racing is likely come in the area of media rights. Each betting shop pays about Â£30,000 a year to the industry to screen their races.  If curbing FOBTs leads to a reduction in the number of shops, as the bookmakers say, then that would mean there would be fewer screens and therefore fewer buyers for the events. The chief executive of the largest race course group in the UK, Arena Racing Company, Martin Cruddace, estimates that a Â£2 maximum stake could lead to a minimum Â£50m impact on racing. ""The effect on prize money and the economic ecosystem of the industry would be pretty catastrophic,"" he said. ""It would be a sad irony that the great work of the industry and government in extending the levy to online operators last year could be undone (and more) at a stroke.""

'I'd rather watch the Oscars in my pyjamas',"This video can not be played Mark Hamill as 'pub quiz Jedi' He's going to the Oscars for the first time in four decades - but Star Wars' Mark Hamill says he'd rather be watching the ceremony in his pyjamas. Hamill - Luke Skywalker in the films - last attended in 1978 when Star Wars: A New Hope was up for best picture. Speaking at the Oscar Wilde Awards, where he was being honoured, he said it was ""much more fun"" to watch from home. Hamill, presenting an Oscar on Sunday, said he hopes the ceremony is ""fun and light-hearted"". He was speaking at the so-called Irish Oscars, where he was one of the honorees, along with Dunkirk actor Barry Keoghan, Home Alone and Schitt's Creek star Catherine O'Hara and Ray Donovan actress Paula Malcomson. On the green grass carpet (instead of a red one), he said he'd enjoyed all those years of ""watching it in my pyjamas, saying 'look at her hair!'."" ""Now I have to put on a tuxedo and be part of it because I'm presenting,"" he told the BBC. ""Believe me, as big an honour as it is, to be part of it, it's much more fun to be watching it at home."" In what could be a politically-charged year for the Oscars, Hamill hopes the ceremony gives people a chance to have fun. ""I hope it's fun and light-hearted, you know?,"" he said. ""Sometimes it's shaded by causes and politics but I think it's a good time for everyone to just relax and enjoy themselves. I know that's what I'll do. ""What happens when you present is you go backstage early - and I don't come back to my seat. I just hang out backstage, eat all the free food and just stay away from my seat - there's always the seat-filler. Usually they're much more handsome than I am, so it's a win-win."" Hamill will be presenting best animated short at the Hollywood ceremony. He joked: ""They didn't pick animated short because I'm too short to be a Stormtrooper did they? Oh, they're so cruel."" Paula Malcomson, Catherine O""Hara also attended the Oscar Wilde Awards His final Star Wars film, The Last Jedi, is nominated for four awards at Sunday's 90th Academy Awards, including best original score. Hamill said of the nominations: ""It's nice but that's not why you do it - you do it for the passion and that's why you should do it, not because you think it's going to win lots of awards."" As for saying goodbye to the character of Luke Skywalker, he said: ""I refuse to believe that he's gone. My theory is he just teleported to somewhere else and left his robe behind. He teleported to a nudist colony, that's what I'm hoping."" The Oscar Wildes are hosted by JJ Abrams, who produced The Force Awakens and is writing, producing and directing the as-year-unnamed Star Wars: Episode IX. The awards are organised by the US-Ireland alliance to celebrate Irish contributions to the industry. Abrams introduced Hamill at the ceremony, held at his Bad Robot production company in Santa Monica, saying he was ""a joy to work with"". They filmed Hamill's scenes for the film in Ireland, with the actor saying it had been a multimillion pound boost for Irish tourism and that he liked the fact people made pilgrimages to see where it was shot. Colin Farrell, who co-stars with Keoghan in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, praised the young actor for his recent work including Dunkirk, saying he was the ""heart and soul"" of the film. Keoghan had made it on the last flight out of Ireland before the snowstorm hit. Other guests included Andy Serkis, Aisling Bea and Patsy Palmer.

Executive held over dam activist's murder,"Berta Caceres was shot dead at her home in March 2016 Police in Honduras have arrested an energy company executive on suspicion of masterminding the murder of a renowned environmental activist. Berta Caceres was shot dead inside her home exactly two years ago, on the night of 2 March 2016. She had led protests against a dam project. The arrested man, Roberto David Castillo, is executive president of Desa, the firm that was building the dam. Desa has insisted he is innocent. The company blamed ""international pressure and smear campaigns of various NGOs [non-governmental organisations]"" for the development. Mr Castillo is reportedly a former military intelligence officer. Roberto Castillo was arrested at an airport in Honduras Eight other people have already been tried over the killing, including members of the armed forces and other Desa staff. Ms Caceres' family have long maintained she was murdered for economic reasons. They say she suffered months of threats from police, politicians and construction companies. Murdered Honduras activist is buried Arrests over Honduras campaigner murder What is Honduras like? In November 2017,a 92-page report by international experts concluded that energy company executives and state agents had conspired to kill the activist. The murder raised outrage internationally, with Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio tweeting that Ms Caceres' work should be honoured. She is remembered for peacefully defending the rights of Honduran indigenous communities and in 2015 won the Goldman Prize, one of the most prestigious awards for environmentalism. The judges said she had ""rallied the indigenous Lenca people of Honduras and waged a grassroots campaign that successfully pressured the world's largest dam builder to pull out of the Agua Zarca Dam"". The dam would have flooded large areas of land and cut off the supply of water, food and medicine for hundreds of Lenca people. News of Mr Castillo's arrest broke amid protests demanding justice for Ms Caceres, who was a mother of four. She is one of over 100 land activists murdered in Honduras in the last decade.

In Ukraine, all schools and higher education institutions were told to close in an effort to save gas, after its Russian supplier refused to deliver more fuel. Energy giant Gazprom said it was severing its contracts with Ukraine after a Stockholm court ruled against it in a long-running legal battle. In Poland, most of the victims were rough sleepers. The deaths are partially attributed to a combination of the severe cold and alcohol consumption by homeless people, who drink hoping to warm up, the BBC's Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton reports. When the night time temperature is -15C (5F), as it has been all week in the Polish capital, this is a deadly combination, our correspondent adds.

Spending 14 hours stuck on a train,"This video can not be played Passenger Robert Luther described how everyone was pretty cold and miserable Passengers were stuck for up to 14 hours when at least three trains ground to a halt as freezing conditions hit lines in the New Forest in Hampshire. But what is it like to be one of the unlucky few, spending the night in a cold carriage full of strangers with no way out? Robert Luther was among about 100 passengers on a five-carriage train which left London Waterloo bound for Weymouth early on Thursday evening. The electric train ground to a halt near New Milton, Hampshire, due to ice on the conductor rail. With the line blocked, other services backed up. The situation was ""unbelievable"", he said. ""A chap had a packet of biscuits - people shared what they've got. ""It's fortunate people had winter clothing - it looked like we were going on ski trip. We haven't had fresh water or heating since 8-9pm. ""The toilet pans were full up and we couldn't get off the train either. ""It shouldn't happen in this day and age, it's not as if we've got three-foot of snow on the tracks."" They were eventually rescued at about 08:00 GMT on Friday. Passengers posted pictures on social media showing their frustrations Phillip Brown, who was travelling home from London on a 17:05 South Western Railway service said: ""It prevents you from sleeping when you get that cold, so it was a case of walking up and down to get some temperature back and keep warm. ""People were taking it in their stride, but I felt sorry for the guard and the driver. They weren't getting any information."" Phillip Brown was given a free bottle of water when he eventually arrived at Bournemouth station after 14 hours on the train Harold Hanna, from Barton on Sea, was stuck with 50 other passengers on the line between Sway and New Milton. He said that, despite the chilly conditions, he had made some new friends as the ""Dunkirk spirit"" flourished among his fellow passengers. Others posted pictures on social media showing them trying to bed down for the night. Passengers tried to bed down for the night Martin Hemmingway was stuck on a CrossCountry train and had an altogether different experience. ""CrossCountry were brilliant,"" he said. We were fed and watered and warm through the night, I've nothing but praise for them. The staff were wonderful."" A 'rescue train' picked up stranded passengers South Western Railway issued a statement earlier apologising to passengers. It said: ""Passengers will be taken to Bournemouth station where we have staff waiting to give them hot food and drinks."" The firm said it ""sincerely apologised"" to the stranded passengers and organised a train to rescue them. The company said it would be closing down its service by 20:00 GMT on Friday and urged people not to attempt to travel.

Near-miss bus driver was 'lucky',"This video can not be played Near miss bus driver Charmaine Laurie: ""It looked worse on the video"" Bus driver Charmaine Laurie said her training kicked in as she swerved to avoid a car on the wrong side of the road during the treacherous weather conditions in Edinburgh. Footage of the near-miss was caught on the dashcam of a van and went viral on social media. The back wheels of Ms Laurie's double-decker bus skidded on the snow as she tried to avoid smashing into the mini. She said she had very little time to react to the incident. Charmaine did not know the incident had been recorded Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Laurie said visibility had been ""very poor"" at the time. ""It was just as I came up over the hill,"" she recalled. ""I just saw through the snow the car u-turn in front of me so I didn't have much time to react. ""I just tried to brake but my back end started to slide out. ""So I had to take my foot off the brake and just try and glide through the space that was there."" Footage of the incident was filmed on a dashcam by van driver Gareth Smith in the Fairmilehead area of the city on Wednesday. This video can not be played Car has near-miss with bus in Edinburgh His van was on the correct side of the road but faced being hit by the bus as Ms Laurie swerved around the mini. Ms Laurie said the gap between the vehicles was very tight, adding: ""There was a van on the other side of the road so there was very little space. ""A lot of it is just instinct but we are trained to be aware of these situations... so that's why I didn't brake heavily."" Ms Laurie had been carrying about 20 passengers on the bus in the south of Edinburgh. She said there was very little reaction from most of the passengers. ""There was one lady getting off the bus who asked how I was,"" she said. ""I said 'yeah I got a fright but I'm OK' and she was like 'well done'."" She did not know Mr Smith had recorded the incident and was shocked when her husband later told her that he had seen the footage on Facebook.

Not time to nitpick on Brexit - Rees Mogg,"This video can not be played Theresa May's full Brexit speech where she said: ""We chose to leave, we have a responsibility to help find a solution"" Brexiteers will have some concerns with Theresa May's latest Brexit speech but ""now is not the time to nitpick"", Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has said. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalthe prominent Eurosceptic praised the prime minister and urged the EU to respond with ""wisdom and not aggression"". On Friday, Mrs May warned ""no-one will get everything they want"" from talks. EU officials are now scrutinising Mrs May's speech ahead of a fresh round of negotiations next week. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, told the BBC's Today programme the prime minister had shown in her speech it was possible to have ""frictionless trade"" with the European Union while leaving the single market and the customs union. Reality Check: What were the key lines in the speech? Laura Kuenssberg analysis: Were the facts hard enough? In full: May's big Brexit speech Analysis: May gets down to business on Brexit UK's transition offer to EU nationals Speaking at London's Mansion House, Mrs May set out the UK's hopes for a future EU economic partnership, calling for ""pragmatic common sense"" in negotiations. Single market access would be ""less than it is now"", she said, and the UK would have to pay into some EU agencies. But she said she would not threaten to walk out of talks and in a message to the EU added: ""Let's get on with it."" She said all sides of the argument had to now face ""hard facts"". Mr Rees-Mogg praised her ""good speech"", saying it delivered on the government's promise to take the UK out of the customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice. ""There are inevitably a few small points that will concern Leave campaigners but we must all recognise that everyone will have to give up something to get a deal, so now is not the time to nitpick,"" he wrote. Mrs May's address was also cautiously welcomed by pro-European Conservatives. Writing in the same paper, Tory Remainer Nicky Morgan said her speech was a ""welcome dose of realism"". ""The EU can't say they don't know what the UK wants anymore,"" she added. Mr Hunt told the BBC Mrs May had successfully brought Leavers and Remainers together. She had explained in the speech, he said, how there would be ""pragmatic alignment of our regulations"" that would be of the same high standards as in European countries, but on a voluntary basis. Parliament would have the final say and the UK could always choose to have less market access. He said he was certain the negotiations would ""go to the wire"". Speaking on BBC's Newsnight the vice-president of the European Parliament, the Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, said the speech showed the realities of Brexit ""were dawning"" in the UK. She said some of Mrs May's proposals amounted to the UK wanting ""to be part of the European Union""Not time to nitpick on Brexit - Rees-Moggin all but name. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said he feared the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market have not been fully recognised by Mrs May's government. ""Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short,"" he said. In her speech, Mrs May said she was confident remaining differences over a draft EU legal agreement could be resolved, allowing trade talks to get under way. She said life would be different for the UK outside the EU's single market: ""In certain ways, our access to each other's markets will be less than it is now."" The UK could not expect to ""enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations"" of membership. Another ""hard fact"" would be the UK would still continue to be affected by EU law and some decisions of the European Court of Justice - such as the ECJ rules on whether EU agreements are legal. However, she stressed the ""jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must end"". The UK may choose to remain ""in step"" with EU regulations in areas like state aid and competition, in order to get ""good access"" to markets, she said. The hard fact for the EU was that the UK would want its own bespoke trade deal, not an ""off-the-shelf model"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said ""the real test will be whether this speech was enough to convince critics that Mrs May's ambition for Brexit is credible and achievable without alienating her own MPs"".

Analysis: Were facts hard enough?,"Yes, it was a long speech. Yes, the prime minister added a layer of detail to her Brexit plans. Yes, there were nuggets in there about how the negotiations might proceed, including, without much fanfare, what seemed to be a statement that the EU commission would help to find a solution the Irish border question, one of the most vexed of all. Yes, it did not provide encyclopaedic levels of information about exactly what the UK would propose. Yes, there were holes, only a few paragraphs on the biggest bit of the UK economy, services. Yes, there are still fundamental contradictions in the UK position. And yes, the Tory infighting of recent weeks that's simmered down today will return at the next moment of decision. One senior Tory told me we might have given up on cake and eating it, ''but we're now asking for half the cake''. And there was nothing today that suddenly revealed a real change in the government's thinking. That gives her critics cause for concern, and EU sources are emollient, rather than immediately won over. But the message that Theresa May wanted, and arguably needed to get across, was way beyond any of the detailed arguments that lead the Tory party, the EU, or both, down a cul-de-sac. This was not intended to be the final word. What the prime minister endeavoured to do instead was to say to the EU, let's do a deal. It won't be easy, I'm confessing to my party and the public that I won't get everything they want, but I get it, and now, after everything that's happened, let's talk. It is legitimate of course to ask why it has taken so long for the prime minister to put that forward. Well, the EU didn't want to talk about trade initially, wanting to sort out the cash first of all. And there have always been internal suspicions of her aims in the Tory party that have made moving forward extremely fraught. Her survival has been contingent. But some of this comes down to the prime minister, fond of asking for more and more briefing, more and more alternatives and discussion in committees, who is reluctant to do anything in a hurry. In the coming days much will be written along the lines of ''what took her so long''? The hope in No 10 is that the EU will welcome her newly pragmatic admission that we can't, after all that cake, really have it all. And importantly, after a fevered bout of internal jockeying, Theresa May today has been willing to tell both wings of her party they will have to compromise. Adding some detail to her approach she more firmly than before told Brexiteers they can't dictate all the terms. And there was a message to Conservative Remainers too that she won't back down on her central intentions to leave the single market and customs union. And for today, it seems enough. Both sides in the Tory tug-of-war have welcomed her carefully phrased lines. But accepting warnings of coming compromises is not the same as swallowing them when they happen. If, and likely when, the European Union pushes back her proposal, Theresa May's 'hard facts' will become harder choices for the Conservative Party. But today, she was a leader in an almost impossible political position straining to show what might just work. Politics is about principle, yes, but first and foremost what is possible. No 10 hopes that today, the prime minister will have shown the EU that is something she understands.

What's it like to spend 14 hours stuck on a train?,"This video can not be played Passenger Robert Luther described how everyone was pretty cold and miserable Passengers were stuck for up to 14 hours when at least three trains ground to a halt as freezing conditions hit lines in the New Forest in Hampshire. But what is it like to be one of the unlucky few, spending the night in a cold carriage full of strangers with no way out? Robert Luther was among about 100 passengers on a five-carriage train which left London Waterloo bound for Weymouth early on Thursday evening. The electric train ground to a halt near New Milton, Hampshire, due to ice on the conductor rail. With the line blocked, other services backed up. The situation was ""unbelievable"", he said. ""A chap had a packet of biscuits - people shared what they've got. ""It's fortunate people had winter clothing - it looked like we were going on ski trip. We haven't had fresh water or heating since 8-9pm. ""The toilet pans were full up and we couldn't get off the train either. ""It shouldn't happen in this day and age, it's not as if we've got three-foot of snow on the tracks."" They were eventually rescued at about 08:00 GMT on Friday. Passengers posted pictures on social media showing their frustrations Phillip Brown, who was travelling home from London on a 17:05 South Western Railway service said: ""It prevents you from sleeping when you get that cold, so it was a case of walking up and down to get some temperature back and keep warm. ""People were taking it in their stride, but I felt sorry for the guard and the driver. They weren't getting any information."" Phillip Brown was given a free bottle of water when he eventually arrived at Bournemouth station after 14 hours on the train Harold Hanna, from Barton on Sea, was stuck with 50 other passengers on the line between Sway and New Milton. He said that, despite the chilly conditions, he had made some new friends as the ""Dunkirk spirit"" flourished among his fellow passengers. Others posted pictures on social media showing them trying to bed down for the night. Passengers tried to bed down for the night Martin Hemmingway was stuck on a CrossCountry train and had an altogether different experience. ""CrossCountry were brilliant,"" he said. We were fed and watered and warm through the night, I've nothing but praise for them. The staff were wonderful."" A 'rescue train' picked up stranded passengers South Western Railway issued a statement earlier apologising to passengers. It said: ""Passengers will be taken to Bournemouth station where we have staff waiting to give them hot food and drinks."" The firm said it ""sincerely apologised"" to the stranded passengers and organised a train to rescue them. The company said it would be closing down its service by 20:00 GMT on Friday and urged people not to attempt to travel.

But after a week of widespread chaos, the mood in Waterloo station on Friday at rush hour is almost jubilant. The weekend is around the corner and many of the thousands here will be granted a temporary reprieve from doing daily battle with the railways. The biggest gripe amongst passengers is that there has been precious little information of last minute changes to schedules. Most are understanding of the extraordinary challenges track and train operators are facing. Station staff are out in force and briefing passengers when they can.

'Hard facts' for both Brexit sides - May,"This video can not be played Theresa May's full Brexit speech where she said: ""We chose to leave, we have a responsibility to help find a solution"" Theresa May has warned that ""no-one will get everything they want"" out of Brexit negotiations but she is confident a deal can be done. Setting out UK hopes for a future EU economic partnership, Mrs May warned both sides had to accept ""hard facts"". Single market access would be ""less than it is now"" and the UK would have to pay into some EU agencies. But she would not threaten to walk out of talks and in a message to the EU said: ""Let's get on with it."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but it wants a transition period lasting around two years after to smooth the way for business. Reality Check: What were the key lines in the speech?

She said life would be different for the UK outside the EU's single market: ""In certain ways, our access to each other's markets will be less than it is now."" The UK could not expect to ""enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations"" of membership. Another ""hard fact"" would be that the UK would still continue to be affected by EU law and some decisions of the European Court of Justice - such as the ECJ rules on whether EU agreements are legal - but she stressed that the ""jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must end"". The UK may choose to remain ""in step"" with EU regulations in areas like state aid and competition, in order to get ""good access"" to markets, she said. The hard fact for the EU was that the UK would want its own bespoke trade deal, not an ""off-the-shelf model"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said ""the real test will be whether this speech was enough to convince critics that Mrs May's ambition for Brexit is credible and achievable without alienating her own MPs"". The speech contained a lot of detail on the kind of trading relationship Mrs May wants with the EU after Brexit. Banks located in the City of London will lose the right to trade across EU without country-by-country approval, so-called passporting. A new system will be brought in to allow ""the same regulatory outcomes over time"" Associate membership of EU medicines, chemical and aviation agencies, accepting their rules and making ""appropriate"" financial contributions Parliament would reserve the right to pass its own regulations in these areas but in the knowledge it could threaten co-operation with those bodies Continued participation in EU science, education and cultural programmes, close relationship with Euratom UK to explore continued participation in EU's internal energy market while protecting single energy market on the island of Ireland Independent arbitration mechanism for trade disputes to replace role currently played the European Court of Justice Fairer deal for UK fishermen based on reciprocal access to waters and shared stocks management Mutual recognition of broadcasting rules to allow UK channels to continue to be seen in Europe Ensure continuity of rail, maritime and aviation services and of hauliers' access to European markets Keeping UK regulatory standards ""as high as the EU's"" to ensure smooth trade and while UK law may not be ""identical"" to EU law ""it should achieve the same outcomes"" This video can not be played Corbyn: Speech offered ""no clarity and no real sense of priorities"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After 20 wasted months, Theresa May has once again failed to bring real clarity to the negotiations - and worryingly, she admitted that her approach will reduce our access to European markets. ""She read out a long list of problems but failed to provide solutions, particularly on the urgent question of preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland."" Attacking Mrs May's suggestion the UK could stick closely to EU state aid rules, he added:  ""Theresa May's only clear priority today seemed to be to tie the UK permanently to EU rules which are used to drive privatisation and block support for British industry."" By BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming A European civil servant said to me recently that Brexit was a fascinating intellectual exercise in rebuilding the existing elements of the UK/EU relationship but with Britain out of the club. Is that the same thing the prime minister proposed today, with the UK retaining associate membership of many of the EU's agencies, choosing to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice where needed, trading freely and maintaining broadly similar economic and social models? One geeky-sounding proposal in particular demonstrates how ambitious - and potentially tricky - this could be. Mrs May said she wanted a bespoke deal for sharing data that went beyond the EU's usual tool of judging third countries' laws to be of equivalent status to Europe's. Yesterday Michel Barnier rejected this idea in advance. The EU chief negotiator tweeted some lukewarm praise today (lukewarm will be more than enough for Downing Street). But the EU's formal reaction will come next week the European Council President Donald Tusk publishes his first draft of guidelines for the phase of Brexit talks where all of this will be tackled. The prime minister called for a free trade agreement covering most sectors of the economy, going further than the deal signed between Canada and the EU but stopping short of Norway which is a member of the European Economic Area. ""We need to strike a new balance. but we will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway,"" she said. She again said a hard Irish border or a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would be ""unacceptable"" and said it was for the UK and EU to ""work together"" on a solution. She suggested this could be either a customs partnership, where the UK ""mirrors"" EU requirements on goods from around the world, or a streamlined customs arrangement, using technology and ""trusted trader"" schemes to do away with the need for customs checks. Amid criticism from the EU that the UK was attempting to ""cherry-pick"" the best parts of the bloc's rules, she said: ""The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. ""If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The speech got a positive reaction from Brexit-backing cabinet ministers, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeting: ""We will remain extremely close to our EU friends and partners - but able to innovate, to set our own agenda, to make our own laws and to do ambitious free trade deals around the world."" But pro-European Tory rebel Anna Soubry told the BBC that Leave voters would be right to question what was in it for them. ""The Brexit we are heading towards is very, very different to the one we were promised,"" she said. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed the speech, saying it provided ""clarity"" about  the UK leaving the single market and customs union and a ""recognition"" that trade-offs will inform future talks on a deal. But the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt was not impressed. He said: ""Theresa May needed to move beyond vague aspirations, we can only hope that serious proposals have been put in the post. While I welcome the call for a deep and special partnership, this cannot be achieved by putting a few extra cherries on the Brexit cake. "" The DUP, whom Mrs May relies on for key Commons votes, welcomed Mrs May's ""clear commitment that she will not countenance any new border being created in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom"". Leader Arlene Foster said she had ""set forward the basis upon which it would be possible to move forward."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he remained ""concerned that some of the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market are still not fully recognised"". He added: ""We will now need to see more detailed and realistic proposals from the UK.  Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short."" Business group the CBI tweeted: ""Excellent news if UK can stay in key agencies like EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) - glad PM has focused on them."" The TUC said there was ""still a chasm between the prime minister's rhetoric and reality"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Teen locked up for Bieber terror plotHe was planning a so-called Islamic State-inspired vehicle attack on the day of a Justin Bieber concert.10h10 hours agoWales,"A 17-year-old boy who was ""hours away from committing an act of atrocity"" in Cardiff has been detained indefinitely and must serve at least 11 years. Lloyd Gunton was arrested after researching the security arrangements of a Justin Bieber concert, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The jury was told he plotted to commit mass murder in an Islamic State-inspired vehicle attack. Police investigated after he uploaded terror-related social media posts. Gunton, from near Llantrisant, south Wales, was arrested after he uploaded social media content to photo-sharing social media site Instagram in late June 2017 which promoted jihad and supported al-Qaeda. The former A-level student, who has an autism diagnosis, had published images of terrorists, as well as pictures of the so-called Islamic State flag, and photos encouraging a terrorist attack in Cardiff. Police found the password for the account was ""truck attack"". One post read: ""May Allah bring terrorism to Cardiff on 30th June."" He had researched how to carry out a vehicle ramming attack and how to stab and kill and had also looked into the security arrangements of the Justin Bieber concert in Cardiff's Principality Stadium. His internet history included searches for ""Isis beheading video"", ""how to create a terror attack"" and ""what does getting shot feel like"". When arrested, the teenager was found with a gutting knife and a hammer in his school rucksack, and the ""martyrdom letter"" said he was a ""soldier of the Islamic state"" and ""more attacks will follow"". He was found guilty of one charge of engaging in the preparation of a terrorist act, two charges of encouraging terrorism, and a further two charges of possessing terrorist information. He was detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure at Birmingham Crown Court and will be returned to a young offenders institution where he has been held since his conviction. An order banning his identification was lifted by the court. How terror teenager plotted city attack Judge Mark Wall QC told Gunton: ""At the time of your arrest you were within hours of committing an act of atrocity on the streets of Cardiff. ""It is not possible to estimate how many people would have been murdered or seriously injured by your actions as the attack was foiled before you could undertake it. ""I am sure that you planned not just the killing of one person but rather mass murder."" A claw hammer and a gutting knife were found in the student's rucksack The judge said Gunton's diagnosis of autism made him ""something of a loner and someone more easily impressed by the things you read on the internet"". ""Yours is not a condition from which you will recover,"" said Judge Wall. ""It is important that, having been tempted to commit a serious offence such as this, you are under some form of supervision for the rest of your life.""
