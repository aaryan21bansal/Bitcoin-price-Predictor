How do you create the next N'Golo Kante?,"N'Golo Kante's route to the top has not been easy or straightforward, but he has always had a quiet and steely determination He may be just 5ft 6Â½in, but N'Golo Kante is a giant of the Premier League. He is also the best midfielder in the world right now, according to Chelsea and England great Frank Lampard. Kante was instrumental in Leicester's astonishing Premier League triumph last year and has been so effective for Chelsea this season that Eden Hazard said lining up alongside him was like ""playing with twins"". Sincesigning Kante in July,the west London club have gone from a mid-table finish to 10 points clear at the top. Without him, Leicester are six points off the relegation zone having sacked title-winningmanager Claudio Ranieri. The 26-year-old France midfielder is energetic, adept at stopping the opposition, and arguably the most important player in the Premier League. He is also hot favourite to win numerous end-of-season awards. But what shaped him? What makes him so good? And are Premier League academies trying to to produce the Kantes of the future? Listen to Creating N'Golo Kante herefrom 21:00 BST on 29 March Kante was 24 when Steve Walshbrought him to Englandfor Â£5.6m in the summer of 2015. By that stage he had spent a decade at JS Suresnes in Paris, had two seasons in the French lower leagues for Boulogne and another two years at Caen, winning promotion to Ligue 1. By the time Kante was helping Caen consolidate their top-flight status in what would be his final season in France, Walsh had seen enough. Now the director of football at Everton, he had a similar role at Leicester and by 2015 was in the midst of a long campaign to persuade Ranieri to sign Kante. There are photos of Kante playing for numerous junior teams dotted around the clubhouse at Suresnes Ranieri wasn't so sure - he wondered if Kante lacked the size needed for the rigours of the Premier League - but every time Walsh walked past the Italian in the corridor at the club's Belvoir Drive training ground, he would whisper ""Kante, Kante"". The battle for recognition, the need to persuade others of what he has to offer, is nothing new to Kante. In fact, it probably defined his formative years. Nobody at JS Suresnes - a modest club on the western outskirts of Paris, not far from the Parc des Princes - seems exactly sure of when the tiny kid first appeared, whether it was 1999 or 2000. He turned up on his own one day - indeed nobody at the club remembers seeing his parents in the decade he played for them. His parents had come from Mali in 1980 and Kante grew up in a small flat in the district of Rueil-Malmaison, close to where Suresnes play. Kante's sister is in the youth system at the club. Kante was as quiet and unassuming on that day as every other throughout his time there - but there was something about him. Piotr Wojtyna coached him for years and the Pole was always impressed by both his athleticism and ability to learn. ""He was very receptive to coaching - with tactical information or positioning, where to be on the field,"" Wojtyna told BBC Sport. ""He always listened very carefully and the decisions he made on the pitch were very intelligent. I always put him with the weakest kids because his efforts counted for double."" Former Everton defender Sylvain Distin and Nottingham Forest winger Armand Traore also played for Suresnes, but neither were there anywhere near as long as Kante. There is a feeling around Paris that Suresnes is a club that has its most talented players pinched by others - but not where Kante is concerned. Suresnes is close to Paris St-Germain, but they missed him. So did Rennes, Lorient and Sochaux. The French national academy at Clairefontaine wasn't interested either. Kante spent a decade at JS Suresnes, a club on the western outskirts of Paris Suresnes' deputy manager Pierre Ville thinks he knows why. ""It was because he was a little guy, not spectacular. He did not play for himself, he played for the team,"" he said. Photos from his time there show so clearly just how small he was, but eventually he got a move to struggling second-tier club Boulogne, 160 miles from Paris on the northern French coast. He initially joined the reserve team, the move apparently helped by Suresnes' president having a good contact at Boulogne, but at last, here was his chance. When he arrived, he became a team-mate of current Brentford defender Maxime Colin, deputising for him at right-back. He started out in the reserve side and by the time he made his first-team breakthrough he was playing in midfield and his team had been relegated to the third tier of French football. But, by then, Colin had seen enough to know the club had signed someone special. Pierre Ville (left) and Piotr Wojtyna both talk fondly about the Kante they remember at Suresnes ""One day we did a running test. You needed to run at your maximum and it was him who killed the test,"" Colin told BBC Sport. ""He kept running after everyone had stopped, going around the track. ""Month after month, people started to see that N'Golo was a really good player. ""I remember seeing him going to the supermarket in France with his little bag and his push scooter - he wants to do everything himself. Boulogne was very hilly but he would turn up to training on his scooter.  If you offer him a lift, most of the time he says 'no I will go by myself'. That's why he is so strong mentally, he came from really low and did all this by himself."" Perhaps wisely, Kante eventually bought himself a car but he remains unchanged. Uninterested in displaying his wealth, he now drives a Mini to training at Chelsea. Kante says his time at Boulogne gave him the belief he could make it as a professional footballer - and when he left for Caen in 2013, he was about to take another significant step on his journey. He played in all 38 games as they won promotion to the top flight. The following year he was a mainstay of the side that consolidated their position in Ligue 1. That season, he won the ball back more than any other player in Europe. Walsh was about to start the process of persuading Ranieri to sign him. Kante eventually joined Leicester on the same day Crystal Palace paid a reported Â£7m for striker Connor Wickham. He has been called a ""machine"" and a ""mighty mouse"", and described as your worst nightmare. The stats speak for themselves. Since he arrived in the Premier League, he has made more tackles and interceptions than any other player. Only five players have covered more distance than Kante in the English top flight since his debut. He doesn't seem to get injured. For a player of his position he picks up few yellow cards and has not been sent off since arriving in England. All about Kante Born:Paris Age:26 Height:5ft 6Â½in Club career:Boulogne (2011-13), Caen (2013-15), Leicester (2015-16), Chelsea (2016-) Honours:2015-16 Premier League title Against Swansea in late February, a 24-second clip of Kante was widely shared - it showed him initially losing the ball but then making four tackles in quick succession. It succinctly illustrated why he is so highly rated. Watford captain Troy Deeney speaks eloquently about what it is like to play against Kante, saying: ""Whenever we broke on them last season, I always had the fear factor that Kante was coming back and I knew we didn't have much time before he got there. ""Even if I actually did have time, I always thought he might be there, so I would rush things a bit."" When you interview people about Kante - those who coached him or played alongside him - there are themes that emerge repeatedly. His ability to cover ground, his positional sense and his humble, quiet but determined personality. Veteran Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer was at Leicester last season and watched him at close quarters. When he first saw the Frenchman, he wondered if he was a footballer because he was ""so tiny"" but he too was awestruck by Kante's energy. ""It was second to none,"" said Schwarzer. ""From the very start, players would be scratching their heads and asking how he does it. ""His positional sense was incredible. He was so incredibly quiet but read the game so well. It was like you were being ambushed."" Schwarzer says Kante is a player whose talents and ability only truly emerge when you've taken the time to watch and study him, as he often did from the substitutes' bench last season. But, when training or after a match is over, Kante just melts into the background. Speaking in the tunnel after Chelsea's recent win at Stoke, a smile appeared on the face of Blues defender Cesar Azpilicueta when he was asked if Kante says much in the dressing room. ""No,"" was the Spaniard's eventual answer. Schwarzer says after Leicester's crucial victory at Manchester City last season, Kante just sat in the corner as he did after every win, quietly smiling. He was perhaps at his most animated when he played foot golf with team-mate Riyad Mahrez after training. ""He will not change his personality, he is just made like this,"" says Colin, who caught up with Kante after their two teamsmet in the FA Cup in January. Making up the ground - most distance covered since August 2015 (Premier League) Craig Dawson - 730.4km Darren Fletcher - 723.1km Christian Eriksen - 718.4km Gylfi Sigurdsson - 705.1km N'Golo Kante - 701.8km BBC pundit Phil Neville believes Kante ""is the one who has knitted this Chelsea team together"". ""I thought he was a number six like former Chelsea player Claude Makelele. But he is a number six, an eight and a 10 - he plays absolutely everywhere, three different positions,"" he said. ""I played with one of the greatest at Manchester United in Roy Keane. He got the ball off the back four, played passes, joined up with the frontman, and I think Kante is the most complete midfielder in the Premier League at the moment."" Kante's story is as refreshing as it is incredible. The small and modest man from an immigrant background who showed the persistence and determination to reach the top, but whose feet remain firmly on the ground. But not everyone is convinced. Burnley midfielder Joey Barton - who had a season on loan at Marseille when Kante was still at Boulogne - recently told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche: ""At the moment, everyone swears by N'Golo Kante. It's fashionable. ""For pundits, he's the best midfielder in the world. That's not the case - he's very good, but I played against him three weeks ago. ""He's a phenomenal destroyer who played in a phenomenal team, but he's not a creator. And it's impossible to be so definitive with a player who has not played in the Champions League."" This video can not be played Archive: Everybody loves N'Golo: Pundits purr over Kante Neville agrees the question about the Champions League is valid. ""We saw he could compete in international football at Euro 2016 but I think the Champions League is a higher level,"" he said. ""Can he do it Wednesday-Saturday-Wednesday for 50-60 games a season? ""And can he develop technically so when teams try to leave him on the ball and challenge him to pass and dictate a game, he has the answers?"" Chelsea boss Antonio Conte knows Kante can be improved. ""We are working on some aspects to try to improve him, to make him a more complete player,"" said the Italian. ""In the pass, yes. I think he has a lot of room to improve in the pass, and to look to make his first pass a forward pass. He can improve on these aspects, definitely."" Maybe we saw evidence of this in therecent FA Cup tie against Manchester United.Kante scored the only goal but it was his all-round performance that really caught the eye; he showed a willingness to push forward and was as much an attacking force as defensive shield. The doubts about his ability to produce such consistently high-energy performances when he has to play twice a week will not be answered until we see Chelsea in the Champions League next season. The day afterBarcelona thrashed Paris St-Germain 6-1 in early Marchto pull off one of the most stunning comebacks in football history, Stoke academy director Gareth Jennings was struggling to get his point across. Stoke had earned a superb point witha goalless draw at Manchester Cityon the same night Barca were running riot. ""We spoke to our boys and we were talking about Stoke and how they performed against Manchester City,"" Jennings told BBC Sport. ""A few of them were saying 'Yes, but did you see Barcelona?' They talk about Lionel Messi and Neymar and Luis Suarez but we want them to recognise some of the other qualities in the game as well."" Walsh brought Kante to Leicester and his ability to spot players like Kante is a highly coveted skill Jennings is well placed to talk about the value of producing players such as Kante - he was academy director at Leicester last year beforemoving to Stoke in the summer.,external ""I went to a game last year at Bournemouth, so it was quite early in Kante's Leicester career, and I almost thought he played them on his own,"" said Jennings. ""He has a real discipline about him. He understands his role and what that contribution is going to be. If you are building a development programme to get the best players through your academy system, you need to make sure you are recognising those qualities, other than the ones who are technically gifted. ""I suppose the big danger is, do you miss them because you are looking for the outstanding technical player?"" Liverpool academy director Alex Inglethorpe breaks midfielders down into three categories - destroyers, energisers and magicians. Kante is certainly a destroyer and seems to fit into the middle category as well. Inglethorpe - who managed Exeter and took a youth role at Spurs before joining Liverpool in 2012 - believes that for the academy system to work they must be able to spot and develop all three types. Jennings agrees - arguing for this to work it is crucial clubs value all three categories. ""Talent identification is a really difficult position,"" added Jennings. ""But there are highly skilled people out there. ""We need to make sure we are focused on all kinds of attributes. We like to talk about the world's best players and Kante and players like him need to be added to that list."" But there are questions about whether academies miss out on players like Kante because of their height - certainly, it put clubs off when he was growing up in Paris - and whether there is enough competitive football at youth level where results really matter to hone competitive, box-to-box players. Kante came from a low base where he constantly had to impress, to overcome those who doubted him. He made the first-team breakthrough at lower-league level. Midfielders in the academy system play in a series of leagues formed after the introduction of theElite Player Performance Plan,externaldesigned to overhaul and improve youth football. One academy boss I spoke to wondered whether there were enough games where results mattered, where players learned how to win. In short, whether it prepared players like Kante for the real world. Academies should ensure the preparation is appropriate, because Kante is obviously incredibly valuable. Schwarzer says Kante was a bargain at Â£32m and Chelsea might struggle to keep hold of him. Neville believes more clubs will want players like Kante - athletic, intelligent and capable of playing all over the midfield. ""He will redefine what we are looking for from a midfield player,"" he said. Right now, creating Kante seems more important than ever. Additional reporting by BBC World Service's John Bennett.

David Tennant is 'Dalai Lama of debauchery',"David Tennant plays the libertine DJ David Tennant says his latest play is being constantly tweaked to feature topical jokes - because the news keeps producing such good material. Broadchurch star Tennant plays the debauched lead character in Don Juan in Soho. Patrick Marber's play - first seen in 2006 - has been updated and now includes references to US President Donald Trump and vlogging. Speaking after Tuesday's opening night, Tennant revealed that Marber had written in a line about theDaily Mail's controversial ""Legs-it"" headline, but it didn't make the show. ""We chickened out at the last second!"" he told the BBC. ""We are sprinkling occasional contemporary references as we go. We add them on the day. Prince George is in his third day now. George Osborne lasted for a weekend. Donald Trump is in there."" The play is written and directed by Patrick Marber Tennant added: ""Obviously it has to relate to Don Juan and his world view. He's got this fury about the hypocrisy of the world that he's in. ""The world keeps presenting itself with fresh material and we can't really resist."" Marber's play is a loose adaptation of Moliere's 17th Century tragi-comedy Don Juan that transports the legendary womaniser to contemporary London. Adrian Scarborough and David Tennant in Don Juan in Soho Tennant's character - known as DJ - describes himself in the play as the ""Dalai Lama of debauchery"". At one point his servant Stan, played by Adrian Scarborough, urges the audience: ""Please don't be charmed, he's not a lovable rogue..."" ""It's a delicious role,"" Tennant said, adding that he hadn't done a play that wasn't Shakespeare in about 14 years. ""I adore Shakespeare - I feel like it's in my DNA - but I'm just loving doing something that is this contemporary and that has this bite and extraordinary language.""

Brexit: What is in Article 1 to 49?,"Theresa May has triggeredArticle 50of European Union law. It's the official start of Brexit - the process of Britain leaving the European Union, following the referendum last June. People who voted to leave hope it will mean better control of UK borders and new trade opportunities around the world. Those who voted to stay in the EU fear Britain will become isolated and poorer. But never mind all that, why is everyone banging on about the number 50? And what's in Article 1 to 49? Article 50 states that any member of the EU can leave, so long as they sort out their relationship with the rest of Europe before they go. Theresa May's team have the next two years to deal with that bit. After that Britain won't - in theory - have to stick to Article 2, which ensures democracy, equality and human rights for all citizens. Meanwhile, Article 5 will be argued over because it gives every EU citizen the right to entry another EU state, subject to national border controls. Immigration and free movement between EU states is one of the most debated issues around the UK's exit. The UK welcomed 350 unaccompanied child refugees fleeing countries like Syria, so the UK has already helped out there People who want to see fewer people from overseas in the UK will be glad to ditch Article 6, which allows EU residents to stay in a country for three months, whether they have a job or not. Article 7 lets them stay longer if they have ""sufficient resources"" and don't rely on government handouts. Article 10 gives us the right to vote for the European Parliament. We obviously won't get to do that in a post-Brexit world. Article 20 lets EU citizens work in Europe and claim some social security. If you fancied an exotic job in Europe, then Article 20 is an important one for you Article 24 ensures that the longer someone has lived in a country, the more rights they have to access public and welfare services. Other articles relate to workers' rights across the EU and also setting limits on imports and exports. So in theory, after Britain leaves the EU it can ship as much British produce (Marmite, crumpets, decent cups of tea etc) as it likes. Theresa May a few minutes after signing the letter which triggered Article 50 Other articles relate to how countries should behave as part of the EU - and follow instructions from Europe on how to be a good member. Article 49 is the most important article to countries who arenotpart of the EU. Article 49 states that a European country which respects ""human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities"" can join the EU. So if Britain is nice, it can always ask to be let back in.

10 areas that will shape the Brexit talks,"As the government prepares to trigger Article 50, what are the key areas that will need to be dealt with in the Brexit negotiations with Europe? Click on the links below for more detail. Immigrationâ¼Businessâ¼Securityâ¼ Defenceâ¼Healthâ¼Educationâ¼ Scienceâ¼The environmentâ¼Farming and fishingâ¼ For the future of the economy, there are two intertwined issues at the top of the ""importance"" league table. First, the type of trade deal Britain secures with the European Union following Brexit. In economic terms, the more ""frictionless"" that relationship, the better. Studies by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research suggest leaving the single market could lead to a long-term reduction in total UK trade with Europe of between 22% and 30%, unless Britain signs exactly the same free trade deal as it has now (which many in the EU have made clear they do not support). That stark fall in trade - and therefore in the creation of growth and wealth in the economy - reflects the fact the single market is a comprehensive trade agreement aimed at reducing tariff barriers within the EU (the UK's largest export market). Will Brexit undermine the City of London's global pre-eminence? But, as importantly, the single market also seeks to reduce ""non-tariff barriers"", the rules and regulations governing issues such as safety certification and licensing of goods and services provided across borders. For an economy such as Britain's, driven by services such as retail and finance, non-tariff barriers are very important as well as very complicated. The government believes some of that trade impact can be offset with new free trade deals with countries outside the EU, such as Canada and the US, but they may take a while. Watch the detail closely - the UK's future trade deals will be key to the future performance of the economy. The other issue is immigration and, more precisely, labour mobility. Businesses that operate internationally often need to move key staff in and out of the country as seamlessly as possible. And sectors such as agriculture and food preparation and delivery rely on thousands of EU workers. Freedom of movement rights across the EU - which help many businesses operate - are one of the red lines for Theresa May. She has responded to worries that immigration is too high and cheaper workers from Central and Eastern Europe in particular have undermined employment opportunities and pay for British workers (although, with the economy approaching full employment, there is little actual evidence for this). How ""porous"" the UK's borders remain to labour mobility will be an important factor in the health of its economy. More from Kamal Ahmed The prime minister sees controlling immigration as a red line in the Article 50 negotiations, but whether the end of free movement will see a sharp fall in European migration to the UK once it leaves the EU is much less clear. Immigration was a key issue during the referendum campaign Ministers recognise an immigration ""cliff-edge"" would be problematic for social care, health, construction, hospitality and agriculture, sectors, that currently rely on significant numbers of EU migrant workers. It is suggested the UK might negotiate transitional arrangements lasting several years after Brexit. How and for how long such arrangements might operate will be a key question in the Article 50 talks. The government has said it will work with UK businesses to devise new immigration rules that allow them ""to continue to thrive"". This is likely to mean a visa system, similar to the one already used for non-EU migrants. The independent Migration Advisory Committee,externalcould be given the role of recommending how many visas should be issued to EU citizens working in different sectors. The government will also need to negotiate how UK citizens can access jobs within the European Union, an existential issue for some businesses once free movement rules end. Immigration rules apply to more than workers, of course. The prime minister has said she is hopeful the rights of all EU citizens resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU can be quickly resolved, although exactly the question of who retains residency rights may not be so straightforward. Mrs May has reiterated her commitment to reducing net migration to the tens of thousands, but her government appears to be managing expectations that this can be achieved as quickly as some imagine. More from Mark Easton The number one business concern is failure to agree a trade deal on preferential terms with the UK's largest market for goods and services. The limit of two years is seen by most companies as either pretty tight or impossible. Failure to get it done may mean extra costs and red tape that would make UK companies uncompetitive. Some sectors are more vulnerable than others. The UK car industry is connected to a Europe-wide supply chain that sees components travel to and from the EU several times and be delivered just in time for assembly. Tariffs and border hold-ups could seriously hamper that process. The government has been keen to reassure Nissan about the post-Brexit landscape The European financial services industry is concentrated in London. UK and international firms based there can sell their services across the EU. That could become more difficult after Brexit. Both examples illustrate why many have called for a transitional period to either give extra time for negotiation or to get used to any new arrangements. The government has signalled willingness to consider this, but has also said it is prepared to walk away from negotiations if it doesn't get the deal it wants. Business groups such as the CBI have warned against favouring some sectors over others in the negotiation, but the government has already shown it is prepared to go to considerable lengths to reassure carmakers such as Nissan. The other big worry is staff. Construction and agriculture are heavily dependent on EU labour. While the government has reassured businesses they will be able to hire the EU staff they need, it may prove hard to reassure every sector while hitting the political target of reducing the number of EU migrants. Nevertheless, many business leaders remain confident the mutual self-interest of EU and UK companies will prevail in the negotiations. Others, such as Sir James Dyson, of vacuum cleaner fame, welcome the new focus on fast growing markets beyond the EU that the triggering of Article 50 will prompt. More from Simon Jack In theory, it is in everyone's interests for the UK and the EU to maintain co-operation after Brexit on policing, law enforcement and security. Catching criminals, thwarting terrorism and safeguarding vulnerable people is important to us all. The terror attack at Westminster has served only to emphasise that. In practice, though, it will be hard to achieve the efficiency and effectiveness of the current arrangements. These include: the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) process, under which criminal suspects can be speedily extradited between EU states Europol, an EU agency that co-ordinates continent-wide crime-fighting operations and the exchange of intelligence the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), which issues alerts to officers and border staff about suspects, foreign fighters and missing people There is a consensus that the access Britain has to SIS II, Europol and the EAW is vital to the UK's crime-fighting capabilities. But the access is derived from the UK's membership of the EU, its adoption of an EU-wide data protection framework and compliance with rulings from the European Court of Justice. If the UK no longer signs up to the rules, why should it be allowed into the club? Europol's Rob Wainwright has spoken of ""some diminution"" in the UK's rights and responsibilities post-Brexit Of course, the EU may agree to give the UK some access to SIS II and other crime databases - much of the information generated comes from the UK and so they benefit too. There will undoubtedly still be a role to play for the UK at Europol - as other non-EU states, such as the USA, have. It may also be possible to broker country-to-country extradition deals or an overall treaty with the EU akin to the EAW. But this will all take time. And, as Britain enters negotiations, there is no guarantee it'll happen. More from Danny Shaw Britain is the big spender on defence in Europe. It is one of a handful of countries meeting Nato's target of spending 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence, and one of only two nuclear powers within the EU. Some would argue that's a ""security surplus"" - and the UK should use it as a bargaining chip in the Brexit negotiations. In reality, the UK will have to pay a price. The post-Brexit vote exchange rate has already made the Ministry of Defence's shopping list for new military equipment significantly more expensive. Britain could also lose influence among allies. France and Germany want joint development of military hardware such as helicopters Though talk of a ""European army"" still seems fanciful, EU countries have already agreed to set up a small military command centre that could oversee small-scale operations. Outside the EU, Britain will not have a voice to block any moves towards further integration. Britain's defence industries might also suffer - from the loss of EU research grants and markets. But even out of the EU, Britain will remain a key member of Nato. The UK will also continue defence cooperation with France, based on bilateral agreements. The two not only spend the most on defence in Europe, they are also the most willing to use their armed forces. The most practical problem for UK defence would be if Brexit proved to be the catalyst for Scottish independence. The Royal Navy would have to find a new home for Britain's nuclear-armed submarines. Ministers might also have to rethink plans to build new warships on the Clyde. For the NHS, the issue in the Brexit talks that towers above all others is the status of health workers from around the European Union and the broader European Economic Area (EEA). The prime minister says rights of residency will form part of the negotiations and she does not want to reveal her hand now. NHS leaders, though, are anxious the issue is resolved as soon as possible to prevent uncertainty that might result in an outflow of doctors, nurses and care workers. They fear current recruitment problems could get worse. Asurvey of doctors from the EEA by the British Medical Association,externalsuggested four in 10 were considering moving out of the UK after Brexit, and another two in 10 were unsure whether to stay. The General Medical Council says about 11% of doctors registered in the UK - more than 30,000 - were trained in EEA countries. According to the Nuffield Trust think tank,external, the proportion of nurses and midwives from the European Union is slightly above 4% of the workforce and rising. For healthcare staff, however, the numbers from the rest of the world, presumably unconcerned by the Brexit talks, are higher than those from Europe. Medical research is another area with a lot at stake in the talks. Universities have warned doubts over residency status could deter academics from coming to the UK. And international pharmaceutical companies will take a keen interest in talks on the regulation of drug trials. Currently, there is an EU-wide playing field with a single regulator, the European Medicines Agency. Ministers say they want to negotiate a standardised approval process post-Brexit. If that does not happen, the UK would need to set up its own system for regulating drug trials. More from Hugh Pym In a way that would have been unimaginable a couple of generations ago, many of the UK's universities are global institutions. Their staff, their students and their collaboration with other universities are more multinational than ever before. So you can boil down their anxieties about the triggering of Article 50 into two words, research and people. After the vote to leave in 2016, some immediate reassurance was put in place by ministers. That included a promise to honour existing tuition fee and loan obligations to EU students starting in 2017-18 made just a few days before the deadline for applications. Amidst the uncertainty, the number of students from EU states fell by 9% for some of the most competitive courses. No such guarantee is in place for 2018-19. Without it, EU students would face the same fees as international students, who come to the UK already in far greater numbers. The exception is Scotland, where ministers have recently extended the promise of no tuition fees to students starting courses the following year as well, 2018-19. The Treasury also promised soon after the vote to underwrite British research funded through the main EU programme, Horizon 2020. In the Budget, there was a little more money to support home-grown talent to pursue postgraduate research. None of this provides long-term certainty on what will happen to the research funding universities currently access through various European programmes, or the future of EU nationals currently working in UK universities. It's not impossible a deal can be done that allows UK academics to continue to bid for funding, and attract or retain research talent. A failure to do so would damage institutions ministers accept are an important contributor to economic growth and innovation. The future participation in the Erasmus+  programme, which sees young people from the UK get the chance to study or gain work experience in the EU and some other countries that participate in the programme, will also need to be resolved. Erasmus is not fundamentally about money, but something else universities value and fear is at risk. It places a value on the open exchange of culture, knowledge and experience across borders. More from Branwen Jeffreys In the build-up to the referendum, Leave campaigners offered British science a bright future: the chance to shake off the EU's restrictions on developments such as genetic modification and to seek more exciting partnerships with the US and China. They also pointed out some very big organisations such as Cern and the European Space Agency were not part of the EU and the UK's membership of them would continue. But the scientific community was overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU, and it will be watching the exit negotiations nervously. The government has said the UK will remain a member of the European Space Agency after Brexit One concern is funding. The EU has a massive pot for research, known as Horizon 2020, and British researchers have done well from it - getting more out than Britain pays in. Non-EU countries can share this bounty, but they have to contribute to it. So, Britain would have to keep writing cheques to Brussels and, if the talks turn sour, that may become politically difficult. The Horizon 2020 money comes with another condition: freedom of movement. The idea is to pull together the best scientists from across the European Union. So, for example, a British university might lure a top German professor who in turns hires a brilliant Italian who helps land a big research grant. The future of this free-flow of scientific talent is uncertain. UK scientists have seen how financial specialists may be allowed an exemption to keep entering the country, and they want the same kind of deal for science. More from David Shukman Brexit could dramatically change the way Britain looks. The UK's fields, hedges, streams, wild flowers, birds and insects have been influenced by decades of EU farm grants. When the UK leaves, those grants will be revised - and the current system of handing farmers money for little more than owning land will stop after 2020. The appearance of the UK's future countryside will depend on whether the government favours wildlife-rich fields or a de-regulated farm sector competing on a global market. That could see lowlands more intensively farmed to the detriment of birds and insects, and much of the uplands left to scrub. That would save taxpayers money - but it would trigger fierce resistance. And it's not just the countryside. The government promised in its manifesto to leave the environment in a better condition than it inherited. EU rules have brought cleaner beaches and rivers - and this progress is unlikely to be reversed after Brexit. But some environmental laws might get weakened as ministers strive to minimise regulatory hassle for business. The government said it would copy and paste the 800 pieces of EU ""green"" legislation, but that's not simple. Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary Andrea Leadsom admitted that about a third of environmental laws - including directives on birds and habitats - could not initially be brought into UK legislation. MPs fear ministers may use the process of adapting those laws to chip away environmental protections. That's because although the UK has often led Europe on climate change, it's often resisted other safeguards. On GM crops, chemicals and neonicotinoid pesticides, for instance, it doesn't share the EU principle of caution. The UK typically favours a more bullish attitude to benefit the economy. One big question will be how citizens will appeal if the UK government fails on its environmental targets - as it is now with air pollution. Currently, the European courts and Commission can beat ministers, but the big stick from Brussels will be no more. MPs say the way to safeguard the environment is to pass a new UK Environmental Protection Act during Brexit talks. It's all still a ""big question"", says George Eustice, the man responsible for UK agriculture and fishing. We are still none the wiser as to what will happen when the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) no longer exist. Will farmers still get subsidies? Will the fishing industry be able to catch more fish? It's a devolved issue - so will the nations have more control? People who work in the fishing industry are desperate to be rid of the Common Fisheries Policy's complex quota arrangements A staggering 60% of farm incomes come from subsidies. This will be matched until 2020, but no-one knows what happens after that. Farmers loathe the CAP and its labyrinthine regulations. The hope is fewer rules will let businesses flourish. But who will pick the strawberries and apples? Seasonal workers could well stop coming if they have to fill out lots of forms to be allowed in. Farmers are also nervous about trade deals being struck with food-producing countries where labour is cheap and animal-welfare and environmental standards are lower. And there is the prospect of having to pay tariffs to sell in to the single market. The fishing industry is desperate to be rid of the CFP and its fiendishly complex quota system: no-one wants to throw dead fish overboard. But fish move around. The aim of the CFP was to manage a common resource, and some fish stocks, such as cod, have been recovering. It also pressures governments to pay attention to environmental and social factors when handing out rights. As for fishing rights, post-Brexit, the UK nations will still have to negotiate quotas and somehow police the marine territory. Farmers and people who work in the fishing industry are waiting for some - any - answers. The people who are negotiating Brexit Brexit triggered: What happens now?

Galaxy S8: Samsung's most important yet?,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 will likely be the South Korean firm's biggest test yet: a phone that has to live up to the highest expectations and also the toughest scrutiny. Even in normal circumstances, the stakes are high when a phone maker unveils its latest flagship handset. But the past few months have been anything but normal for Samsung. And at the simultaneous release of the S8 in London and New York, the elephant in the room is a big one. This is the launch that follows the Note 7 scandal last year, the phone Samsung recalled and then eventually scrappedafter some batteries overheated and caught fire. ""With this launch, Samsung gets a chance to redeem itself after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco...but it may be too early to say that Samsung's troubles are behind it now,"" says Kiranjeet Kaur of tech analysts IDC. While the Galaxy S models are the company's flagship line and widely seen as the only serious competitor to Apple's iPhone, the Note models are a range of large-screen phablets, aimed only at a niche market. So did the global headlines of Note phones going up in flames burn the Samsung image? Samsung has said its Note 7 recall has cost it millions of dollars Anecdotally the brand still seems in good shape. Despite the YouTube videos of burning phones, the drip-drip of negative stories and the internet memes, Samsung does not seem to have been as tarnished anywhere near as badly as you might expect. A Reuters/IPSOS study,externalin the aftermath of the scandal found Samsung users in the US remained as loyal to their brand as Apple users were to their iPhones. Because the problem was identified shortly after the Note 7 was released the recall was mostly limited to early adopters, and this limited the negative experiences, said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. ""Your own personal experience trumps what you read and what people tell you,"" Dawson said at the time of the Reuters/Ipsos poll. Yet recalling, and then ultimately killing off, the Note 7, is thought to have cost Samsung $5.3bn (Â£4.3bn). No. Samsung Electronics saw profits surge 50% in the last three months of 2016, despite the Note 7 phone fiasco. And the firm's share price has climbed steadily over the past 12 months. Despite a difficult year, Samsung's shares have climbed and climbed That resilience is largely because the Galaxy S7 - the precursor to the new phone launched this Wednesday - has been a real success. And it is even more remarkable given Samsung is also embroiled in South Korea's political corruption scandal - with the firm accused of having bribed the government in return for political favours - something it strenuously denies. Samsung heir apparent and de facto boss Lee Jae-yong has beenarrested and is on trialaccused of bribery and corruption. He also has maintained his innocence. While this scandal has sent shockwaves though South Korea and the country's corporate world, there is no evidence it has impacted the decision of consumers around the world when it comes to choosing their next smartphone. For the past several years, Samsung's has been caught in the middle, competing with both Apple's premium iPhone on the one hand, and cheaper Chinese smartphones on the other. Neither of these have gone away. The iPhone 7 continues to be a top seller for Apple, with the US company now even offering cheaper options - the older iPhone 6s and the scaled down iPhone SE - that still benefit from the premium brand image but are more affordable. These factors saw Apple overtake Samsung in smartphone shipments for the first time in the last three months of 2016. The IDC data showed Apple had 18.3% market share compared with Samsung's 18.1%. From the side ofChinese competition, the likes of Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi are continuing to offer Android phones that regularly get top reviews but tend to be much cheaper than whatever Samsung has to offer with comparable specifications. The likes of Huawei are ready to take a big bite out of Samsung's market dominance So for a long time, Samsung's lower and mid-tier offerings have been able to benefit from Samsung's reputation of very good quality phones - distinguishing them from that ""cheaper upstart"" image of the Chinese competition. In that respect, brand image was crucial for Samsung and many of its phones feed off the reputation of the flagship. But it is worth noting Huawei, Oppo and another Chinese brand Vivo are now the third, fourth and fifth best-selling handsets respectively - with Oppo and Vivo each recording more than 100% year on-year growth in 2016, though admittedly from a low base. New smartphones tend to have incremental updates. Innovation is rarely distinctive enough to really stand out from whatever the previous model had to offer. And that means all smartphone makers face the growing problem of handset fatigue. Even Apple's latest iPhone has been criticised as ""more of the same"", with improved details but lacking enough new features to wow the average consumer. Samsung faces the same tough problem. How to stand out from the competition? The attention will be on three hardware elements: the camera, the display and the battery. We can safely assume that the camera will be better, possibly trying to edge out the iPhone's snapper with some added 3D features. The display is expected to be bigger with a smaller bezel so that there might be more screen packed into the same overall size of the phone. As for the battery, it is safe to assume that after the Note 7 issues, Samsung will have pushed its engineers more towards battery safety than capacity this time round. In terms of software, analysts are also expecting a range of changes, with the new Bixby virtual assistant being just one of them. Samsung's Galaxy S8 might well be a make it or break it moment for the company. If it does everything right, there is a good chance they can hold on to the crown of the Android market and the Note 7 will go down as a one-off flop. Yet should anything at all go wrong, things might turn out differently. Trust tends to be a lot easier to lose than to regain. The close scrutiny that Samsung's new phone will be facing in the coming weeks and months, means even small glitches risk being magnified. Jake Saunders, vice president of tech research firm ABI says there is little doubt that Samsung will have had its engineers working around the clock to make sure that the new phone is absolutely foolproof - but there will still be nerves. ""Samsung may be hoping for a smooth, glitch-free launch to restore consumer confidence in the brand, but it could be a long, hot summer.""â Samsung mulls 'exploding' Note 7 relaunch Samsung probe blames batteries for fires South Korea's presidential scandal Latest TVs battle to blend in at home Samsung takes Â£4.4bn hit from Note 7 Samsung LA firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing blazes as fifth wildfire breaks out Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

Corrie's Ken and other classic whodunnits,"There are several characters with a motive to harm Ken Coronation Street fans were left with a classic soap cliffhanger on Monday after Ken Barlow (William Roache) was found at the bottom of his stairs unconscious. And fans were left wondering if he fell or if he was pushed. The long-running Street resident suffered a stroke in the autumn, so many wondered if he was ill again. But with Barlow having rubbed up family members, neighbours and acquaintances the wrong way in recent weeks, could he have been shoved? We take a look back at some of the best TV whodunnits from over the past few years. The original Dallas ran from 1978 to 1991 Who could forget this long-running saga involving the Dallas oil baron we all loved to hate? It took eight months for viewers to discover that it was JR's sister-in-law and former mistress, Kristin Shepard. But not before JR's long-suffering wife Sue Ellen got the blame first and was jailed. T-shirts printed with the slogans ""Who Shot JR?"" and ""I Shot JR"" flew off the shelves in the summer of 1980. The storyline became one of television's first big water-cooler moments and prompted pretty much every soap going to get in on the cliffhanger act. Everyone was guessing who shot Phil in Albert Square So it didn't have the glamorous Dallas backdrop but the British answer to the JR mystery was, of course, who shot Phil Mitchell? The EastEnders bad boy came under fire in 2001 but fans only had to wait a month to find out who it was, although many suspects had come under the spotlight during that time, including Mark Fowler, Ian Beale, Steve Owen and Dan Sullivan. But in April 2001, it transpired that Phil's ex, Lisa, had pulled the trigger. She confessed to Phil himself - while also admitting that she still loved him. EastEnders followed up its successful storyline with several other whodunnits, including ""Who killed Lucy Beale?"" and ""Who killed Archie Mitchell?"". The identity of the father of Michelle Fowler's baby kept EastEnders' viewers gripped Another twist on the whodunnit, this device was first used by EastEnders back in 1985. This time, the mystery surrounded teenager Michelle Fowler who had become pregnant. But who was the father? There were several suspects, including Tony Carpenter and Ali Osman but of course, we all now know that it was Dirty Den, her best friend's dad. 'Scandi noir' has grown in popularity in the UK Of course, it's not just soaps and their fans who love a good old whodunnit. Many crime dramas have centred entire series on finding an elusive killer. Scandinavian drama The Killing (2007) saw Sophie Grabol's detective Sarah Lund investigating the rape and murder of teenager Nanna Birk Larsen, whose body was found in the boot of a car submerged in a lake. Under suspicion on this occasion were Copenhagen mayoral candidate Troels Hartmann, along with his campaign manager Morten Weber, while Larson's teacher Rama also found himself on Lund's radar. In the end, it turned out to be family friend Vagn Saerbaek - and it wasn't the first time he had killed either, having also murdered Lund's partner and a former girlfriend, too. Laura Palmer's death gripped the town of Twin Peaks David Lynch's cult 1990s hit series, Twin Peaks, was entirely based on this question. Was it Laura's psychiatrist Dr Lawrence Jacoby who was infatuated with the teen? Her boyfriend Bobby? What about Benjamin Horne, who had hired Laura as a prostitute? Drug dealers Leo Johnson and Jaques Renault also came under the spotlight. But it was Laura's father who murdered her, while possessed by the demon Killer Bob. Now fans are excited about series three arriving in May, 27 years after the first season aired. Watch this space. The third and final series of Broadchurch has focused on a rape storyline The first series of Broadchurch in 2013 was a huge hit for ITV, as crime-fighting duo DI Hardy and DS Miller tried to solve the mystery of who murdered a local schoolboy. Viewers were addicted to the twists and turns of the plotline as Danny's dad and the local vicar were among those under investigation. The moment when DS Miller (Olivia Colman) discovered her husband was the murderer was one of television's scenes of the year. Series two couldn't quite match the original's dizzy heights but the current third and final series is gripping viewers once again as Hardy (David Tennant) and Miller try to catch a serial rapist.

David Tennant as 'Dalai Lama of debauchery',"David Tennant plays the libertine DJ David Tennant says his latest play is being constantly tweaked to feature topical jokes - because the news keeps producing such good material. Broadchurch star Tennant plays the debauched lead character in Don Juan in Soho. Patrick Marber's play - first seen in 2006 - has been updated and now includes references to US President Donald Trump and vlogging. Speaking after Tuesday's opening night, Tennant revealed that Marber had written in a line about theDaily Mail's controversial ""Legs-it"" headline, but it didn't make the show. ""We chickened out at the last second!"" he told the BBC. ""We are sprinkling occasional contemporary references as we go. We add them on the day. Prince George is in his third day now. George Osborne lasted for a weekend. Donald Trump is in there."" The play is written and directed by Patrick Marber Tennant added: ""Obviously it has to relate to Don Juan and his world view. He's got this fury about the hypocrisy of the world that he's in. ""The world keeps presenting itself with fresh material and we can't really resist."" Marber's play is a loose adaptation of Moliere's 17th Century tragi-comedy Don Juan that transports the legendary womaniser to contemporary London. Adrian Scarborough and David Tennant in Don Juan in Soho Tennant's character - known as DJ - describes himself in the play as the ""Dalai Lama of debauchery"". At one point his servant Stan, played by Adrian Scarborough, urges the audience: ""Please don't be charmed, he's not a lovable rogue..."" ""It's a delicious role,"" Tennant said, adding that he hadn't done a play that wasn't Shakespeare in about 14 years. ""I adore Shakespeare - I feel like it's in my DNA - but I'm just loving doing something that is this contemporary and that has this bite and extraordinary language.""

Rugby players 'burnt by 3G pitch',"A Welsh rugby coach has posted photographs on social media of burns his players received playing on an artificial pitch. Merthyr RFC coach Lee Jarvis said seven players suffered the friction burns to their legs and arms after their match at Sardis Road, Pontypridd. Merthyr were playing RGC 1404 in the National Cup semi-final on Sunday. A spokesman for Pontypridd RFC said the club had no comment to make. Merthyr RFC posted photos of the injuries on Twitter. Mr Jarvis said: ""The pitch was a little bit dry on the weekend and the boys came away with some nasty burns. ""With the weather being dry, they do say you need to water the pitch."" He said the players would be assessed later to see if they are fit to play their fixture against Pontypridd on Saturday. The Â£500,000 pitch was installed in September. Mr Jarvis said there had not been any problems when they played there previously and he did not think it would put players off using the pitch again. ""3G and 4G pitches are the way forward for me,"" he said. ""We've played all our games throughout the season and none were called off, compared to last season when we had five or six called off. ""I'm sure Pontypridd will sort it out. It's a club I love and I hope people don't think we are trying to pull something over them. ""The usage has most probably flattened the pitch and made it a little bit harder than what it was. I'm guessing that's why these friction burns have occurred."" Last month, Pontypridd outside half Ceri Sweeney retweeted a picture of burn marks he received to his face during a game against Newport. Sardis Road is due to hold an international under-18s tournament next month.

One-hit wonders," Monday 27th March 2017 The wheels of pop are well-oiled, and for every artist that manages to score Top 10 hit after Top 10 hit there are thousands that become best-known for sending just one killer tune storming up the charts. There's no shame in that - plenty of acts have built long touring careers off the back of a single smash - and as we look back at these eight era-defining songs from the 2000s let's be clear that we're being loose with our definition of 'one-hit wonder'. Some, likeDuffy, followed a platinum-selling No.1 (Mercy) with a song that charted well, but sold far less (Warwick Avenue) and in the case ofGnarls Barkley, both members have had plenty of success independent from each other. Still, bet these songs will forever remind you of the noughties... Groovejet (If This Ain't Love) (feat. Sophie EllisâBextor) Spiller Background: Pop's always had its odd couples and the matching of 6'8"" Italian house/disco producerCristiano SpillerwithSophie Ellis-Bextor, the British indie-kid daughter of Janet Ellis, a former Blue Peter presenter, is certainly among the more unusual. In 1998, Spiller visited Miami nightclub Groovejet and was inspired to write an instrumental track, which sampled Love Is You byCarol Williams, as a tribute. He included it on his 1999 Mighty Miami EP before asking Sophie, whose bandTheaudiencehad called it quits in 1999, to write and record a vocal. She wrote the verses, Rod Davis (formerly of glam rock bandMud) came up with the chorus, and the new version became an Ibiza anthem and UK No.1 in August 2000. It was also the first song to be played on an iPod, asWiredreported. What happened: Sophie became a pop star in her own right (her first three solo singles all went Top 3 and five of her six albums to date made the Top 20) and a model, as well as a mainstream British celebrity, who appeared onStrictly Come Dancingin 2013 and came fourth. Spiller's follow-up track, 2002's Cry Baby, scraped into the UK Top 40 - at 40 - but he never repeated the success of Groovejet. He still DJs and produces music on his own label, Nano. Do You Really Like It DJ Pied Piper & The Masters of Ceremonies Background: British dance music splintered into a myriad of different forms in the 1990s, one of which was UK garage - a blend of house, jungle, ragga and RnB that produced a string of chart hits towards the end of the decade, includingShanks & Bigfoot's Sweet Like Chocolate and Re-Rewind (The Crowd Say Bo Selecta) byArtful DodgerandCraig David. By 2001, the scene was beginning to falter, but not beforeDJ Pied Piper & The Masters of Ceremonies(MCs DT, Melody, Sharky P and the Unknown MC) shot up the charts to No.1 with Do You Really Like It? and it's immortal line, ""We're loving it, loving it, loving it! We're loving it like this!"" What happened: DJ Pied Piper & The Masters of Ceremonies are true one-hit wonders insofar as they never charted again, but Pied Piper remains an active DJ and he often performs with MCs from Masters of Ceremonies. As for UK garage, the sound morphed into yet more new forms, most notably grime, dubstep and UK funky. But there have been constant revivals and you can hear its influence in the music of 2010s' groups likeDisclosure. Also,Craig David is backand on some pirate stations, likeKurupt FM, UK garage will never die. Because I Got High Afroman Background: We take it for granted now, but the power of the internet to spread a song and help it become a hit was a new phenomenon in 2001 and, before fans of Arctic Monkeys and Lily Allen harnessed MySpace to help their heroes break through, we had...Afroman, a Napster success story. His near-novelty song about how smoking cannabis made him forget to do almost everything, ultimately resulting in him messing up his ""entire life"", became a student favourite first and then a bona fide smash, reaching No.1 in the UK, securing him a Grammy nomination and evenlanding him an interview on Radio 4's Today programme. What happened: Contradicting his portrayal in Because I Got High, Afroman was nothing if not prolific throughout the 2000s, releasing an album a year, mostly independently, and touring continuously. He slowed down in the 2010s, but put out a knowing EP called One Hit Wonder in 2014, before an incident at a 2015 gig in Mississippi threatened to overshadow his entire career -he was arrested for hitting a woman who was dancing on stage, and has since apologised, claiming he was in the midst of a nervous breakdown. BBC Advice - Cannabis Las Ketchup - The Ketchup Song (Asereje) (Spanglish Version) (Official Video) 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info Background: Spanish artists looking to make it outside of Spain naturally head west to Latin America and the US in search of fame and fortune; few make it big here, although there are exceptions, likeEnrique Iglesias. And then there's the kind of Spanish novelty dance song, complete with an easy-to-do routine, that has no respect for geography and becomes a hit in seemingly every country in the world. In the 1990s it wasLos del Río's Macarena; in the 2000s we had The Ketchup Song about a mysterious man called Diego byLas Ketchup, a family girl group put together by flamenco record producer Manuel 'Queco' Ruiz. Different versions (Spanish, 'Spanglish' and Portuguese) went to No.1 in 27 countries, including the UK, although the nonsensical chorus was the same on all versions. Or perhaps it wasn't nonsensical. At the time, a controversy blew up about the chorus and the song's Spanish title, Aserejé, which were thought to reference Satan. We kid you not. What happened: Off the back of the success of The Ketchup Song, Las Ketchup's debut album, Hijas del Tomate, was a hit (especially in Finland, of all places), but their second album, 2006's Un Blodymary, failed. The group sang the title track from the album as Spain's entry at the 2006Eurovision Song Contest(it came 21st) and, although they haven't released any new material since then, they still tour. Junior Senior - Move Your Feet (Official music video, HD) 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info Background: Great pop songs, including many on this list, often don't make much sense and Danish duoJunior Senior- Jesper Mortensen and Jeppe Laursen - came up with Move Your Feet by melding together two bits of other tracks to create a still-loved classic that became a hit in their home country in 2002, before being re-released worldwide in 2003. We sent it to No.3 here and it won the group a fanbase in Japan, Australia and South America, too. It's lo-fi pixel art video worked perfectly with the band's colourful, DIY aesthetic. What happened: In many ways, a typical indie-band-goes-major-label tale. Their debut album, D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat, was a critical hit, but their second album, Hey Hey My My Yo Yo, got caught up in label wranglings. It was released in Japan in 2005, where it went to No.2, but only made it to America in 2007, and it never saw the light of day here. Junior Senior quit in 2008; Jesper formed other bands, which existed under the radar, while Jeppe had a crack at representing Denmark in the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. He also co-wrote Born This Way withLady Gaga. The Bravery - An Honest Mistake 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info Background: After the success ofThe StrokesandYeah Yeah Yeahsin 2001, A&Rs were on the hunt for the next big New York indie rock band, leading to something of a feeding frenzy to signThe Bravery, who formed in 2003. In the 2000s, US buzz bands were often shipped over to the UK to make a splash here first (such as happened with The Strokes,The White StripesandKings of Leon) and we duly took The Bravery to our hearts in 2004. They won theBBC Sound of 2005poll, ahead ofBloc PartyandKano, and reached No.7 with debut single An Honest Mistake in 2005. What happened: A story of diminishing returns. The next two singles, Fearless and Unconditional, from their self-titled debut album failed to make the Top 40 and, although they released two more albums in the 2000s, they were spent by the end of the decade and officially quit in 2014. Meanwhile, frontman Sam Endicott had scored success co-writing three songs forShakira's 2009 album She Wolf, including the lead single, and he also co-wrote theChristina Aguilerasong Monday Morning. He currently fronts a new band, Mercy Beat. Gnarls Barkley - Crazy 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info Background: Another of pop's odd couples (and they knew it, calling their second album The Odd Couple) comprised of two super-talents who had long CVs before joining forces asGnarls Barkley.CeeLo Greenhad been a member of pioneering Southern rap groupGoodie Moband had won critical and commercial acclaim, mostly in the US, for two early-2000s soul albums, His Perfect Imperfections and ...Is the Soul Machine. He'd alsowritten Don't Cha for The Pussycat Dolls.Danger Mousehad releasedJay-Z/Beatlesmashup record The Grey Album and producedGorillaz's 2005 second album Demon Days. Crazy was the first Gnarls Barkley single and it stayed at No.1 here for nine weeks. It's also famous for being the first single to top the UK Singles Chart on download sales alone. What happened: Gnarls Barkley was only ever one of many projects both CeeLo and Danger Mouse worked on, but both their albums together were critically praised and there's still talk of a currently-shelved third album being released. Danger Mouse went on to become one of music's most in-demand and respected producers (he's been nominated for 19 Grammys and won 6), working with the likes ofThe Black Keys,Red Hot Chili PeppersandU2, while CeeLo scored another huge UK No.1 with Forget You in 2010. In 2014, he pleaded no contest to a charge of furnishing an illegal drug to a companion and was sentenced to three years' probation. Duffy - Mercy 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info Background: WhenDuffyemerged in 2007, she seemed both an heir to great Welsh singers likeShirley BasseyandTom Jonesand a less controversial version ofAmy Winehouse, riding high at the time with second album Back to Black and with whom Duffy shared a retro-soul sound. Duffy's debut single Rockferry just missed the UK Top 40, then she had a huge Europe-wide No.1, including in the UK, with Mercy in early 2008. It was the first time a Welsh woman had hit the top spot in the UK since 1983. What happened: Unfairly or not, she was criticised - most notably byNoel GallagherandAlison Goldfrapp- for sounding too much like Winehouse. Her debut album, Rockferry, released soon after Mercy, went four-times platinum in the UK, won both a Grammy and Brit and produced one more hit single, Warwick Avenue. However, Well, Well, Well, the lead single from 2010 second album failed to make the Top 40, resulting in Duffy announcing soon after that she was taking a break from music. She's worked as an actress since (and recorded three songs for the soundtrack of 2015 British gangster film Legend, in which she had a part) and may still return with a third album. 10 long-awaited albums that will be the soundtrack of 2019 8 predictions for music in 2019 from expert pop forecasters 7 of the most scathing record reviews of the year 9 brilliant music videos that you may have missed in 2018 Test your knowledge of the year in music with our poptastic quiz 7 heartbreaking Christmas songs that might make you cry Check out the artists we're taking to SXSW! 5 things we learned from Bros' chat on Radio 2 How Bring Me the Horizon became one of the UKâs biggest bands Seven of the most outrageous bands ever  Sign into the BBC,orRegister"
