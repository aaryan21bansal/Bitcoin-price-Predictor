Review: Gillian Wearing's statue of Millicent Fawcett âââââ,"I think it's fair to say that on the whole we have the same relationship with all those public statues of long dead grandees dotted around our towns and cities as we do with the terms & conditions box we are asked to click on for a software update. That is to say, by and large, we ignore them. A bit like the stars in the sky during the day - we just don't see them. They have become invisible, a part of an urban fabric that forms the backdrop to our busy lives. There are exceptions, of course even beyond divisive figures such as Cecil Rhodes, who has gained renewed visibility in our post-colonial age. In London's Parliament Square, for instance, the pugnacious representation of Sir Winston Churchill stands out from the mainly 'invisible' statues of other political figures. Statue of Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, by Ivor Roberts-Jones, which was unveiled in 1973 As does a slightly comical depiction of David Lloyd George next to him, in which the last Liberal Prime Minister is made to look curiously like the Fat Controller out of Thomas the Tank Engine. But until Tuesday it was an entirely male line-up in the Square. Thankfully, that has now changed with the welcome arrival of Dame Millicent Fawcett (1847- 1929) to the ranks. The statue celebrating the life of the suffragist, Dame Millicent Fawcett, in Parliament Square Credit for this goes to the writer and activist Caroline Criado Perez, who made the initial suggestion of having a statue to commemorate the suffragist who fought for decades for women to have the vote. That the statue is of a woman makes it exceptional. But it is also exceptional in terms of its execution by the Turner Prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing. This video can not be played 60 Minutes Silence was Gillian Wearing's Turner Prize-winning work I'm not only talking about the technical side of things and the quality of the work by the foundry, which is first class (they've made bronze look and feel like tweed). But also the conceptual element of its creation, which is the bit Wearing really excels at. The foundry that cast the bronze statue made Millicent Fawcett's outfit look and feel like tweed As an artist, Gillian Wearing has spent most of her life exploring the extraordinary inner lives of outwardly ordinary people. She is a chronicler of the everyday, a champion of the disregarded. And that is why it makes perfect sense for her to be given the job of making this new public statue. She knows how to make us see the overlooked. And so the first thing you notice about the statue is not Millicent Fawcett. It is the banner she holds across her body reading 'Courage Calls To Courage Everywhere', that catches the eye. The text is taken from a reflective piece Fawcett wrote about the suffragette Emily Wilding Davison who died after running onto the Epsom racecourse during the Derby in 1913. It is a compelling statement. It is also a call-back to the artworks that made Wearing's name. In the early 1990s she produced a series of photographs with the collective title, 'Signs That Say What You Want Them To Say And Not Signs That Say What Someone Else Wants You To Say (1992-93). ""I signed on and they would not give me nothing,"" 1992-3, on display at Tate Britain To make the work she had to overcome her natural shyness to approach people randomly on high streets or in parks to ask them to write down an inner thought on a large piece of white card. Those who agreed were then asked by Wearing to hold up their personal statement while she took their photograph (think Bob Dylan and his one-word lyrics on placards in Subterranean Homesick Blues film). The point of the exercise was a revelation, to make their private public. 'I'm desperate', wrote a young man with a side parting and a smart suit and a tie. A less well-dressed, slightly older man held up his card, which read, 'I've Thought About Being A Gigolo But I'm Worried About The Health Risks!' You can view these images as stand-alone artworks, or as a unified entity, or as documentation of a performance piece by the individuals who participated. Or, when you look at them now in the context of the bronze Millicent Fawcett, as living statues. Gillian Wearing on a visit to the foundry, which was casting her statue of Millicent Fawcett All of which is to say, there is more to the slogan that the suffragist holds than the words we read. It is, for Wearing, an expression of Fawcett's inner feelings: her truth. It is as much a statue of the subject as it is of the lifelike figure behind. The Fawcett we meet is middle-aged, dignified and resolute. Wearing doesn't do hyperbole or grandstanding; she is more interested in finding the dazzling in normality. Hence, she gives us Millicent Fawcett unmasked, a private woman on a public stage. Millicent Fawcett speaking at a rally in Hyde Park in around 1913 A woman who went through her life without compromise, and now stands facing Parliament in a no-nonsense 'walking suit', challenging those inside to do the right thing. Which brings us to the most potent part of this statue, and that is the weighty impact it makes as a piece of contemporary sculpture. I'm not talking about its scale, or about its form, or the materials from which it has been made. Neither am I talking about all those neat smaller details, like the belt of photographs of Fawcett's fellow campaigners that goes around the top of the stone plinth on which she stands. In fact, I am not talking the physical object at all. I am talking about the effect it has on its surroundings. That is sculpture's secret weapon. It doesn't just occupy a space; it alters how we read the environment around it. The Fawcett statue makes most of the others look ridiculous, or pompous or both (not Gandhi who stands to her right side). It also creates a palpable tension that stretches between the Houses of Parliament and the implacable Fawcett. Which in turn gives this small island of lawn a focal point that it has lacked since the late Brian Haw occupied its southern edge with his tented peace protest (maybe he'll get a statute on this plot of land one day?). This statue of Millicent Fawcett has been too long coming, but at least Gillian Wearing has made it worth the wait.

ABBA announce first new music since 1982,"Pop group Abba have returned to the studio to record their first new music since the 1980s. The Swedish quartet said the new material was an ""unexpected consequence"" of their recent decision to put together a ""virtual reality"" tour. ""We all four felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the studio,"" the band said on Instagram. ""And it was like time stood still."" No release date has been set for the new songs - but one of them, titled I Still Have Faith In You, will be performed in December on a TV special broadcast by the BBC and NBC.

Abba's spokesperson Gorel Hanser told the BBC the atmosphere in the studio was ""magic"". ""It was like no time had passed at all,"" she said. ""It was like the olden days. They were happy, it was easy and warm-hearted, and it was actually quite moving. I wasn't the only one with tears in my eyes."" But she said said the group would not perform live, other than as holograms in the forthcoming Abba Avatar tour. ""It's a studio moment, I can promise you,"" she said. ""Don't expect too much.""

The band have resisted pressure to reform since they stopped recording together in 1982, despite a reported $1bn (Â£689m) offer to tour in 2000. In an interview with the BBC in 2013,Agnetha Faltskog saidshe preferred to leave the band in the past. ""It was such a long time ago, and we are getting older, and we have our different lives,"" she explained. News of the new material comes in a bumper year for Abba fans. An immersive exhibition based on the band's career is running on London's South Bank, while Chess, the musical Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson wrote with Sir Tim Rice, is being revived in the West End. Will Abba's new music ruin their legacy? Abba give first performance in 30 years 6 shocks from the Mamma Mia 2 trailer Abba's Agnetha comes out of retirement A sequel to the film version of Mamma Mia!, starring Amanda Seyfried, Lily James and Cher, will be released on 20 July. Speaking to BBC News, Rod Stephen, founder of Abba tribute act Bjorn Again, described the new material as ""a whole new beginning"". Bjorn, Anni-Frid, Agnetha and Benny pictured at the Swedish production of Mamma Mia in 2016 ""I heard about Abba releasing new songs and I was instantly, like everyone else in the Abba community, really excited to know what the songs were and how they're going to sound. Will it have that 1970s sound or will it be up to date? ""It's brilliant really, because we love Abba's music to death. I just hope they're great songs, I hope they're equivalent to Dancing Queen or Mamma Mia."" He added: ""I know Benny and Bjorn wouldn't release something in this way unless they were good songs."" Speaking to the BBC's Adam Fleming last week, Ulvaeus had hinted that there could be new material. Here's what he said: This video can not be played Bjorn Ulvaeus hints there could be new ABBA material How did the Abba avatar idea come about? We were introduced to an idea by Simon Fuller who is, as you know, an entertainment entrepreneur -  [creator of] the format of American Idol and manager of the Spice Girls and so forth. He came to Stockholm and he presented this idea to us that we could make identical digital copies of ourselves of a certain age and that those copies could then go on tour and they could sing our songs, you know, and lip sync. I've seen this project halfway through and it's already mind-boggling. What does it actually look like? Does it look like a younger you? Yes. Real. And they say once it's finished you'll never see that it's not a human being. And what attracted me personally to this is of course I'm always curious, scientifically-curious and this is new technology and we are pioneers. So I thought, 'Yeah let's go for it,' and you know the other three went for it as well. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

What is the actual format of the tribute show going to be? Is it going to be these Abba-tars all the way though? No, other people as well. And as for the format I'm not entirely sure what it's going to look like but some sort of tribute show with these Abba-tars for want of a better word as the kind of centrepiece. Will you write new material for it? We don't know what the Abba-tars will sing yet but there's lots to choose from of the old stuff and yeah, I'm not ready to say that yet. So there could be new songsâ¦ I'mâ¦ it's up in the air. Stay tunedâ¦ Yeah. Why not reform and have a reunion? The real you, rather than the virtual ones. Yeah, why not? Wellâ¦ it never seemed like a good idea. It's not that we haven't had offers over the years. But somehow we always thought that the Abba that people have in their minds are the once-young and energetic group from the '70s. And we just never felt the urge to go on tour, I guess. On the whole we toured very little. We had like 10 years together and of those 10 years maybe we toured, like, seven months. Not more than that. So to go on tour as a geriatric, I don't know! Formed in 1972, Abba were essentially a Swedish supergroup, consisting of songwriters Ulvaeus and Andersson from The Hep Stars and singers Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, who had scored success as solo artists. But their joint project completely eclipsed their previous successes. After winning the Eurovision Song Contest with Waterloo in 1974, the band sold almost 400 million singles and albums around the world. Mamma Mia!, the musical based on their hits and produced by Ulvaeus and Andersson, has been seen by more than 50 million people. During their most successful period, the band survived marriage break-ups between Ulvaeus and Faltskog, and Lyngstad and Andersson, but they finally called it a day in 1983. Their final recording sessions, in 1982, produced the hits Under Attack and The Day Before You Came, which featured on the compilation album The Singles. Their last public performance came three years later, on the Swedish version of TV show This Is Your Life, which honoured their manager Stig Anderson.

Windrush: Who exactly was on board?,"The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948 carrying hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean hoping for a new life in Britain - alongside hundreds from elsewhere. Who were they? June 2020: To mark this year's Windrush Day, on 22 June, we have retrieved this article from our archives. The former passenger liner's journey up the Thames on that misty June day is now regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration between 1948 and 1971 known as the ""Windrush generation"". Many were enticed to cross the Atlantic by job opportunities amid the UK's post-war labour shortage. But, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it emerged last year that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation, denied access to NHS treatment, benefits and pensions and stripped of their jobs.The UK government was forced to apologise and offered compensationfor anyone who had ""suffered loss"". The ship - which dropped anchor on 21 June and released its travellers a day later - was carrying 1,027 passengers, including two stowaways, according to BBC analysisof the ship's records kept by the National Archives.,external Alongside those travelling from the Caribbean for work, there were also Polish nationals displaced by World War Two, members of the RAF and people from Britain. Passenger Lucile Harris, who settled in Britain from the Caribbean, recalled her arrival in Tilbury in aninterview with the BBC in 1998to mark the 50th anniversary of the Windrush sailing. ""It was a lovely day, beautiful, and they [family] were all at the dock waiting for me... I was very excited."" According to the ship's passenger lists, more than half of the 1,027 listed official passengers on board (539) gave their last country of residence as Jamaica, while 139 said Bermuda and 119 stated England. There were also people from Mexico, Scotland, Gibraltar, Burma and Wales. According to Nicholas Boston of the City University of New York, those who gave Mexico as their last country of residence were agroup of Polish refugees,external- mainly women and children - who had been offered permanent residence in Britain. Who are the Windrush generation? Advice for the Windrush generation on what to do next How do you prove you've been living in the UK? Overall, 802 passengers gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean. Many of them had paid Â£28 (about Â£1,000 today) to travel to Britain in response to job adverts in local newspapers. Among them wereJohn Hazel, 21, a boxer, Harold Wilmot, 32, a case maker and John Richards, 22, a carpenter,seen here in a photograph taken on arrival - alongside their records from the National Archives passenger list. Mr Richards,interviewed by the BBC in 1998, was, like many others, shocked to discover the difference between the ""mother country"" he had seen in books and the reality he was confronted with. ""I know a lot about Britain from school days but it was a different picture from that one, when you came face to face with the facts. It was two different things,"" he said. ""They tell you it is the 'mother country', you're all welcome, you all British. When you come here you realise you're a foreigner and that's all there is to it."" According to the ship's records, most of the Windrush's passengers got on in Jamaica, but others also joined the vessel in Trinidad, Tampico and Bermuda. As many of the eyewitness accounts have stated since, the majority of the people on board were men. There were 684 males over the age of 12, alongside 257 females of the same age. There were also 86 children aged 12 and under. The listed occupations on the passenger lists give some indication of the wide range of skills that were on offer. Among those arriving from the Caribbean were mechanics, carpenters, tailors, engineers, welders and musicians. According to the RAF,dozens of the Caribbean passengers were also RAF airmen,externalreturning from leave or veterans re-joining the service. A future Mayor of Southwark,Sam King, who had served in England with the wartime RAF, was among them. Also among the Caribbean passengers was a hatter, a retired judge, a potter, a barrister, two hairdressers, two actresses, two piano repairers, two missionaries, three boxers, five artists and six painters. The most noted occupation, though, was ""HD"" - or ""housing domestic"" - meaning a housewife, servant or cleaner. There were 172 overall on board - 96 from the Caribbean. Among the boxing hopefuls on board wereCharles Smith, 21, a welder and boxer, Vernon ""Boy"" Solas, 18, mechanic and boxer, and boxing manager Mortimer Martin, 31, who was also a welder,captured in this photograph on arrival. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular destination recorded by passengers from the Caribbean was London - 296 people gave the city as their planned place of residence. Interestingly, 109 passengers didn't give any address, perhaps indicating they had no fixed plan on arrival. A number of other passengers planned to go to Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Plymouth. Those that had nowhere to stay were temporarily housed in a former air raid shelter at Clapham South underground station. Newspaper reports from the time state how those at the shelter went on to find jobs through the nearest Labour Exchanges (Job Centres), one of which was in Coldharbour Lane, Brixton. Many then moved into rented houses and rooms in the Brixton and Clapham areas, working for employers such as the National Health Service or London Transport. From here, large Caribbean communities developed, contributing to the political, social and musical life of Britain ever since. The ship - full name HMT Empire Windrush - was originally a German passenger liner given to the UK as war reparation in 1945. First called Monte Rosa, it was converted to a troopship and renamed HMT Empire Windrush in 1947. This video can not be played What was life like on-board the Windrush? Oswald ""Columbus"" Denniston, who was the first of the Windrush passengers to get a job according to the Daily Express at the time,told the BBC in 1998 that the atmosphere on the ship was ""jolly"".,external ""We had two or three bands - calypso singers. And Jamaican people are happy-go-lucky people. When you have more than six you have a party."" On leaving the ship on 22 June, the then 35-year-old began work the same day handing out rations at the shelter in Clapham where the Windrush passengers were staying. Mr Denniston, who died in 2000 aged 86, went on to settle in Brixton, where he worked as a street trader. ""Many of us thought we would come here to get a better education and to stay for about five years,"" he said. ""But then some of us have ended staying for 50."" As for the ship itself, it made its final voyage in 1954, catching fire and sinking in the Mediterranean Sea with the loss of four members of crew. All of its passengers were saved.

Memo leak 'suggests Rudd told of targets',"Home Secretary Amber Rudd is facing fresh calls to quit after a leaked memo suggested she had been informed about immigration removal targets. The home secretary had initially told MPs probing the Windrush scandal there were no targets - before admitting ""local"" targets had been set. She told the Commons on Thursday she had not been aware of them. Butthe Guardian has reported,externala June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that refers to targets. Home Office 'to scrap removals targets' Home Office 'knew about Windrush issues' Who are the Windrush generation? Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""Amber Rudd either failed to read this memo and has no clear understanding of the policies in her own department, or she has misled Parliament and the British people. ""Either way, she needs to accept responsibility and resign immediately."" But Conservative vice-chair Kemi Badenoch backed Ms Rudd. ""Aside from this issue, she has been doing a good job,"" the MP for Saffron Walden told Radio 4's Any Questions. ""She's apologised, she's taken action to deal with it swiftly. And also, we have an immigration bill that's coming later in the year - she's the only person who can drive this forward."" By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake The problem is not the policy. Targets are often used by government departments to monitor performance. Labour had many targets of its own on immigration. But Amber Rudd was already under pressure because she appeared to be unaware of what her own department was doing. The Guardian has now published a leaked memo suggesting she was told of immigration removal targets. This is despite her previously telling MPs that ""we don't have targets for removals."" A resignation issue, according to Labour. But removing Amber Rudd from office would leave the prime minister further exposed to criticism of her record at the Home Office and put a high-profile Remainer on the backbenches. So whether the home secretary stays in her job may well be a matter for Amber Rudd to decide for herself. The Guardian reports that the six-page memo, from Immigration Enforcement Agency boss Hugh Ind, states: ""IE has set a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18, aided by the redistribution of resources towards this area. ""This will move us along the path towards the 10% increased performance on enforced returns, which we promised the home secretary earlier this year."" It adds: ""We have exceeded our target of assisted returns. We set an internal target of 1,250 of these returns for 2016-17â¦ we delivered 1,581."" This video can not be played Appearing before a select committee, Home Secretary Amber Rudd denies there are targets The Guardian says the memo was copied to Ms Rudd and then-immigration minister Brandon Lewis, as well as some civil servants and advisers. On Friday, Rob Whiteman, who was chief executive of the UK Border Agency from 2011 to 2013, told the BBC all public services operated on targets and ""of course"" ministers would be aware of them. He said: ""Fair's fair, ministers could say we don't actually set these targets, they are being set by the operations but I think it is disingenuous, surely, to suggest that they don't know that they exist because they will have seen them in performance reports and other internal documents."" Ms Rudd has been under pressure over the issue of targets this week, having initially told the home affairs select committee on Wednesday: ""We don't have targets for removals."" Butan inspection report from December 2015,externalemerged, showing targets for the voluntary departures of people regarded as having no right to stay in the UK existed at that time. A 2015 report from the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration details an annual target of 12,000 voluntary departures for 2015/16 On Thursday, Ms Rudd told MPs: ""I have never agreed that there should be specific removal targets and I would never support a policy that puts targets ahead of people. ""The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. ""These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change."" On the issue of targets, she added: ""Unfortunately, I was not aware of them, and I âwant to be aware of them, which is why I am now putting in place different measures to ensure that that happens."" The home secretary has faced calls to quit from Labour, the SNP and the Green Party, following her admission that the targets did exist and, according to union officials, are prominently displayed on posters at regional immigration centres. But Conservative backbenchers, including Sir Nicholas Soames and Philip Davies, rallied behind Ms Rudd on Thursday, with Mr Davies saying most members of the public backed tougher action against illegal immigration. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged migrants from Commonwealth Caribbean countries and their relatives who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants if they could not provide a range of documentation that proved they had lived in the UK continuously.

Daughter left mum to die in own faeces,"Emma-Jane Kurtz was a qualified solicitor who specialised in caring for elderly clients The daughter of a woman who died covered in faeces on a sofa in the same clothes she had worn for a decade has been jailed. Emma-Jane Kurtz, 41, of Blackwater Way, Didcot, was found guilty of wilful neglect at Oxford Crown Court. Cecily Kurtz's body was found at the family home in 2014 ""covered from head to toe"" in excrement, police said. Judge Peter Ross said Kurtz would serve at least half of her two-and-a-half year sentence in prison. The rest would be ""served in the community subject to licence"", he added. Emma-Jane Kurtz was a qualified solicitor who specialised in caring for elderly clients. She was charged in April 2017 with wilful neglect after paramedics removed the body of her mother in July 2014. Sentencing, Judge Ross said: ""Cecily Kurtz was left to rot. ""There was a closing of the door both metaphorically and literally."" He said the pictures from the post-mortem examination of Mrs Kurtz ""looked like a photo from a concentration camp"". Cecily Kurtz's body was found slumped on the soiled sofa An investigation was launched after concerns were raised about the condition of her dilapidated property and the state the 79-year-old's body was found in. The court heard how when the paramedics lifted Cecily Kurtz's body, her trousers began to disintegrate, her white underwear was a ""dark mahogany brown"", and excrement and urine had ""engrained"" into her hands, feet and face. Following sentencing, investigating officer Det Con Francesca Griffin said Mrs Kurtz ""was found on a sofa and she had been slumped over with her chin on her knees for five days"". ""She had become incontinent and was covered from head to toe in faeces, had not changed her clothing for a decade and had urine burns."" The officer added: ""Emma-Jane Kurtz said she had gone into the room with her mother three or four times a day. ""There had been many opportunities over months and years to help her and remove her from that situation."" Judge Ross said he recognised Kurtz had mild autism and was undergoing therapy. He said he believed she was capable of showing empathy, but that she had stopped caring for her mother, who had depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Kirsty Allman, senior crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, described Mrs Kurtz as ""emaciated"" at just 39kg. She said she had ""suffered unimaginably"" in ""horrifically squalid conditions"". She added: ""It is rare to come across a case that involves such sheer and blatant neglect against a vulnerable, elderly woman, by someone who was supposed to love and care for her. ""This has been one of the most shocking and sickening cases of neglect I have come across.""

Islamic State 'Sim card man' jailed,"Rabar Mala: IT support for Islamic State group A man who helped hundreds of jihadist fighters to communicate by activating mobile phone Sim cards for them in the UK has been jailed for eight years. Rabar Mala, who lived in Warrington, became what amounted to an IT support worker for the Islamic State group. He helped hundreds of militants in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey get online by exploiting how social media accounts are registered to phone numbers. Court documents revealed that Mala was living illegally in the UK. It's not clear whether the Home Office had tried to remove him. Mala - originally from Iraq - admitted two counts of possession of property for a terrorist purpose. Manchester Crown Court heard he also had unfulfilled aspirations to attack the Royal Cheshire County Show. Sentencing Mala, Judge Patrick Field QC, said: ""Your support of this cause engaged you in playing a significant role in the dissemination of IS propaganda and facilitating communications between the followers of IS."" Sim cards: Hundreds activated When detectives searched Mala's home they found hundreds of Sim cards and 29 social media accounts on a number of handsets. These contained a vast number of chat groups and more than 700,000 messages, many of which were between IS militants. As they delved deeper into these records, they established that over 18 months, Mala had registered and activated 360 Sim cards - and he used these in turn to help fighters who had no easy means of registering social media accounts without drawing attention to themselves. Every time Mala bought and activated a Sim card in one of his mobile phones, he forwarded the number to his contacts abroad In turn they could use that number to start creating a new social media account These services, such as Twitter, send a verification code to the phone number to make sure it definitely belongs to the user But Mala exploited this security check by forwarding the verification codes he received back in the UK The fighter was then able to trick the system into believing they owned the phone number - and that completed the creation of the account. Mala kept the Sim cards, more than 100 of which had names written on them in Arabic and Kurdish, so that militants could create further accounts as required. He was caught only because police linked him to extremist material posted on YouTube. There's no evidence that Mala made any money from offering the service, leading police to conclude he did it because he believed in the cause. Some of his messages indicated his commitment to the IS group. In one, he urged associates to consider joining him to attack the Royal Cheshire County Show. ""I am in a place... itchy for operation. About half a million people will attend the show,"" he wrote. ""I have about seven tickets - it only needs people and weapon."" The 33-year-old arrived in the UK in 2008. At the time of his arrest last August he had been refused leave to remain. He was working illegally under an assumed name as a car valet. It's not clear why he was still in the UK and whether the Home Office, which has been approached for comment, made any attempt to locate and remove him. ""By day Mala appeared to be a hardworking well-liked man but when he got home he'd dedicate his time to helping promote truly evil causes,"" said Detective Superintendent Will Chatterton of Counter Terrorism Policing North West. ""This was an incredibly complex investigation due to the sheer amount of data the team had to analyse.""

Pig brains kept alive without a body,"The scientists used pumps, heaters, and bags of artificial blood to restore circulation to the pig brains Researchers at Yale University have restored circulation to the brains of decapitated pigs, and kept the organs alive for several hours. Their aim is to develop a way of studying intact human brains in the lab for medical research. Although there is no evidence that the animals were aware, there is concern that some degree of consciousness might have remained. Details of the study were presented at a brain science ethics meeting held at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda in Maryland on 28 March. The research has also been reported on this week in the MIT Technology Review.,external The work, by Prof Nenad Sestan of Yale University, was discussed as part of an NIH investigation of ethical issues arising from neuroscience research in the US. Prof Sestan explained that he and his team experimented on more than 100 pig brains. They discovered that he could restore their circulation using a system of pumps, heaters, and bags of artificial blood. As a result the researchers were reportedly able to keep the cells in the brain alive and capable of normal activity for as long as 36 hours. Prof Sestan is said to have described the result as ""mind-boggling"". If this could be repeated with human brains, researchers would be able to use them to test out new treatments for neurological disorders. But Prof Sestan is among the first to raise potential ethical concerns. These include whether such brains have any consciousness and if so deserve special protection, or whether their technique could or should be used by individuals to extend their lifespans - by transplanting their brains when their bodies wear out. The Yale University researchers recognise that their work raises potential ethical concerns In a commentary published in the Journal Nature this week,Prof Sestan and 15 other leading US neuroscientists called for clear regulation to guide them in their work,external. ""If researchers could create brain tissue in the laboratory that might appear to have conscious experiences or subjective phenomenal states, would that tissue deserve any of the protections routinely given to human or animal research subjects?"", the researchers ask in the commentary. ""This question might seem outlandish. Certainly, today's experimental models are far from having such capabilities. But various models are now being developed to better understand the human brain, including miniaturised, simplified versions of brain tissue grown in a dish from stem cells. And advances keep being made."" The researchers say that ways of measuring consciousness need to be developed and strict limits set for them to be able to continue their work with the public's support. Brain back-up venture 'will kill users' Rules of memory 'beautifully' rewritten Would you preserve your brain for future generations? Prof Colin Blakemore, of the School of Advance Study at the University of London, backs the research team's call for a public debate on the issue. ""The techniques, even to a researcher, sound pretty ghoulish - so it is very, very important that there should be a public discussion about this, and not least because the researchers who have some investment can tell the public why it would be so important to develop such techniques,"" he told BBC News. ""There is a paradox here, and that is - the better such methods are at maintaining a whole brain, fully functional but without connection to a body, the more useful that would be for research purposes. But the more likely it would also be for the brain to have some sentience and consciousness, which would be deeply worrying"". This video can not be played WATCH: Can you freeze your body for the future? Prof Blakemore said that he was ""very uneasy about the quest for immortality"" by those considering preserving their brains until surgery advances, in order to place them in a new body. ""Our planet is already overpopulated. You need space for young people and new ideas, and the notion of desperately clinging on to any mechanism possible for human beings living forever, I find very unsavoury.""

Five key summit moments,"The two leaders have agreed to begin ""a new age of peace"" The meeting between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in marks just the third time that leaders of the two Koreas have met. The historic summit, where the two sides pledged to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons, was the first time that an international audience got an unfettered glimpse of Kim Jong-un and his personality. Hence, perhaps unsurprisingly, it was also a meeting with several symbolic and unusual moments. North Korea had agreed that the supreme leader would meet Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of Panmunjom. This harkened back to a remark made by late South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to Kim Jong-il at the first inter-Korea summit in June 2000 in Pyongyang. Kim Dae-jung, who was 17 years older than the then North Korean leader, pointed out that the onus was on the younger man to visit the older man, and that it would be appropriate for Kim Jong-il to reciprocate and visit South Korea. Kim Jong-un invited Moon Jae-in to cross the line into North Korea with him That never happened, so by being the first North Korean leader to visit the South since 1951, Kim Jong-un is showing President Moon a degree of deference, perhaps to buttress his message that this round of inter-Korea talks will be different to the last. The high-level inter-Korean meeting kicked off at the military demarcation line (MDL) with President Moon stepping on the North-South border to shake Kim Jong-un's hand. Mr Moon asked Mr Kim when he might be able to visit North Korea. And then something unscripted happened. In a demonstration of his humour and devil-may-care personality, Mr Kim pulled Mr Moon over the cinder block marking the division of the Koreas and remarked ""how about now?"" The two then walked, hand in hand, across the border. Mr Kim's behaviour at this summit is intended to broadcast that he is in the driver's seat. But he also behaved respectfully around President Moon, showing Mr Kim's sincerity about peace on the Korean peninsula and that Pyongyang intends to limit its more provocative activities for now. This spate of interactions between the two Koreas will also be different to those during the 2000s, because the two Koreas will pursue more modest economic and social co-operation. Mr Kim's bodyguards ran alongside his car There are many perks of being North Korea's supreme leader - including a large security entourage. Members of Mr Kim's Guard Command, and his personal security escorts, went into each of the meeting rooms beforehand to inspect them and sweep for electronic eavesdropping devices and explosives. The chairs where Mr Kim sat and the surfaces that he used were sprayed with sanitizers. When the high-level summit broke for lunch, 100 minutes after convening, Kim Jong-un's Mercedes Benz limousine was accompanied by a dozen of his closest bodyguards who ran alongside it.  This was an unprecedented show of force. In his opening remarks to President Moon, Kim Jong-un touched on several thorny issues. Mt Paektu, which straddles the North Korea-China border, is held sacred by Korean people He said that ""displaced people, defectors and residents of the island of Yeonpyeong"" would have high expectations of their meeting. It was unusual for him to acknowledge North Korean defectors - Pyongyang typically views defectors as traitors, and their families may be targeted for punishment. Meanwhile, his reference to Yeonpyeong was an allusion to the November 2010 artillery attack by North Korea's armed forces on the island in the south - which observers believed was part of Kim Jong-il's efforts to ensure the succession of his son. Most interestingly, however, Kim Jong-un admitted that North Korea's critical infrastructure needed improvement. Mr Moon told Mr Kim that he would like to climb Mount Paektu, a mountain in the North held sacred by the Korean people. Kim Jong-un told him: ""I feel embarrassed about the poor transit infrastructure."" A modern railway passage to the area near Mt Paektu has been under construction for several years and it seems Kim Jong-un was, unusually, conceding that the project has proceeded unevenly. Mr Kim's sister, Kim Yo-jong, accompanied him to the summit At the initial interactions with Moon Jae-in, Kim Jong-un only took with him his younger sister Kim Yo-jong, and Kim Yong-chol, the former military intelligence boss who has since become the North's top policymaker on inter-Korean relations. These are two of Kim Jong-un's closest advisers and aides, and both travelled to South Korea during the Olympics. Prior to the meetings, Kim Yo-jong carried the folder with her brother's briefing papers and during the morning session with the South Korean leadership took copious notes. Kim Jong-un brought several other senior officials to different phases of the summit meeting. Could more sports diplomacy be on the way? He brought the DPRK's top two foreign policy officials, the top two military officials and officials involved in culture, sports and humanitarian exchanges - highlighting his focus on establishing further diplomatic and military interactions and additional cultural and sports exchanges. However, in contrast to Kim Jong-un's visit to China when he met President Xi Jinping, no economic officials or managers of the North's internal security services were present. This indicates that much of this initial interaction between Mr Moon and Mr Kim is cosmetic and that more substantive interactions along the lines of economic co-operation and joint development projects will occur at a later date. North Korean Defence Minister Gen Pak Yong-sik and the head of the Korean People's Army Gen Staff Vice Marshal Ri Myong-su, saluted Moon Jae-in as a goodwill gesture of respect when the North and South delegations greeted one another. The two Koreas are still technically at war - but this could change soon Their South Korean counterparts did not salute Kim Jong-un. For his part, Kim Jong-un participated in reviewing South Korea's military honour guard, but did not salute back. The salutes are a poignant reminder that the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice - not a peace treaty. The two leaders have agreed to begin ""a new age of peace"" - but a lot of the hard work now lies ahead.

The cold noodle craze,"Kim Jong-un may have made history by crossing the military line into South Korea, but it was a throwaway quip about cold noodles that began the most unexpected of crazes. Once the handshake was done and dusted, the North and South Korean leaders were not averse to making jokes and Kim Jong-un's contribution to the jollity was a remark about how he had brought some of North Korea's famous cold noodles for the summit. According to media reports, he said: ""I've been checking news and people are talking about food a lot. So I brought some Pyongyang cold noodles for President Moon to enjoy. Pres Moon, please feel easy and have some delicious Pyongyang noodles that we brought."" Another translation suggested he also joked that the noodles had been brought ""a long way... ah, we probably shouldn't say it is far"". On the face of it, not a momentous statement of diplomacy - but his comments lit up South Korea and sparked a craze for Pyongyang cold noodles.

But it wasn't just online that the mania was evident. South Koreans have seized the moment and gone out to eat it with lines forming outside Seoul restaurants that serve it. Sungjoo Han shared a selfie on Instagram saying:  ""I ate the cold noodles for lunch to celebrate two Korea summit."" ""There was a long line when I arrived there. No seats available in the restaurant so I had to wait to eat the noodle. I believe everybody came to the restaurant for the same reason,"" he told BBC Korean. A light quip about noodles The Yonhap news agency quotes one Pyongyang cold noodles restaurant in eastern Seoul say it had run out of parking because of the demand. It also says that at one restaurant, Jeongin Myunok in Yeuido, Seoul, people shouted with joy when they were called by the staff for their turn. ""Wow, let's try Pyongyang Naengmyeon,"" one of them said out loud. ""Let's eat them with Kim Jong-un"". One tour operator that offer tours of Pyongyang refers to the dish as one of the most ""iconic noodle dishes"", and one you'll find in every major Pyongyang restaurant. Pyongyang noodles are served with a cold soup For the uninitiated, they are handmade buckwheat noodles served cold in a flavoured broth of beef, pork and chicken and topped with kimchi, cucumber and pickles or meat. In North Korea, the noodles are known as Raengmyun. Latest summit updates Flagpole rivalry: The 'petty' side of Korean relations Moment Kim crossed border.

Koreas make nuclear pledge after summit,"This video can not be played Welcoming Kim Jong-un with pomp and ritual The leaders of North and South Korea have agreed to work to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons, after holding a historic summit. The announcement was made by the North's Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in of South Korea after talks at the border. The two also agreed to push towards turning the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953 into a peace treaty this year. The summit came just months after warlike rhetoric from North Korea. Speaking at a banquet after Friday's talks, Mr Kim hailed the progress he said had been made. ""We bade farewell to the frozen relationship between North and South Korea, which was a nightmare. And we announced the beginning of a warm spring to the world,"" he said. Historic summit as it happened Five key moments from the meeting Read the Korean declaration in full,external Details of how denuclearisation would be achieved were not made clear and many analysts remain sceptical about the North's apparent enthusiasm for engagement. An issue for the North is the security guarantee extended by the US, a nuclear power, to South Korea and Japan and its military presence in both countries. Previous inter-Korean agreements have included similar pledges but were later abandoned after the North resorted to nuclear and missile tests and the South elected more conservative presidents. Mr Kim said the two leaders had agreed to work to prevent a repeat of the region's ""unfortunate history"" in which progress had ""fizzled out"". ""There may be backlash, hardship and frustration,"" he said, adding: ""A victory cannot be achieved without pain."" This video can not be played Kim Jong-un issues his pledge for peace with South Korea Other points the leaders agreed on in a joint statement were: An end to ""hostile activities"" between the two nations Changing the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides the country into a ""peace zone"" by ceasing propaganda broadcasts An arms reduction in the region pending the easing of military tension To push for four-way talks involving the US and China Organising a reunion of families left divided by the war Connecting and modernising railways and roads across the border Further joint participation in sporting events, including this year's Asian Games The commitment to denuclearisation does not explicitly refer to North Korea halting its nuclear activities but rather the aim of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"". Why has Kim halted nuclear tests now? Profile: Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis in 300 words The two countries have also agreed to seek international support to reach this goal, the joint statement says. China later praised the political determination and courage of both leaders and said it hoped the momentum could be maintained. US President Donald Trump also welcomed the news, tweeting that ""good things are happening"". This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea Mr Kim is due to meet Mr Trump in the coming weeks. Speaking in Washington, Mr Trump said the meeting would take place in one of two countries under consideration and vowed he would not be ""played"" by the North Korean leader. ""We will come up with a solution and if we don't we'll leave the room,"" he said. New US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - who earlier this month travelled secretly to Pyongyang to meet Mr Kim - said his impression was that Mr Kim was serious about reaching a deal. ""The economic pressure put in place by this global effort that President Trump has led has led him to believe that it's in his best interest to come to the table and talk about denuclearisation,"" he said, speaking at a Nato meeting in Brussels. The leaders were met by an honour guard in traditional costume on the South Korean side. The pair walked to the Peace House in Panmunjom, a military compound in the DMZ. Mr Kim then invited the South Korean president to step briefly across the demarcation line into North Korea, before the pair stepped back into South Korea - all the while holding hands. It was an apparently unscripted moment during a highly choreographed sequence of events. Mr Kim and his wife Ri Sol-ju (L) sat with Mr Moon and his wife Kim Jung-sook (R) The two leaders spoke together during a session broadcast live on South Korean TV. Mr Kim jokingly apologised to Mr Moon for repeatedly forcing him to get up early because of the North's missile and nuclear tests. ""I heard you [President Moon] had your early morning sleep disturbed many times to attend National Security Council meetings,"" he said. ""I will make sure that your morning sleep won't be disturbed."" ""Now I can sleep in peace,"" Mr Moon replied. Mr Kim also acknowledged that the North's infrastructure lagged behind that of the South. ""I'm worried that our transport situation is bad so it may discomfort you, it may be embarrassing [for me] if you visit North Korea after living in the South's environment,"" he said. Korea summit sparks cold noodle craze Diplomacy on the menu: How food can shape politics After separating for lunch, the two leaders took part in a tree-planting ceremony using soil and water from both countries. Mr Kim travelled in a car surrounded by jogging bodyguards They later attended a banquet whereMr Kim was expected to be served the Swiss potato dish rÃ¶sti- a nod to his time studying in Switzerland - along with the North's signature dish of cold noodles, and a North Korean liquor. Mr Kim was accompanied for the symbolic discussions by nine officials, including his powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong. Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon So farthere has been no mention of the summit's outcome on North Korean TV. Few had predicted a development like this, as North Korea continued its nuclear and missile tests and stepped up its rhetoric through 2016 and 2017. Mr Kim waved as he returned to North Korea The rapprochement began in January whenMr Kim suggested he was ""open to dialogue"" with South Korea. Did the Winter Olympics repair relations? North and South set up hotline ahead of summit The following month the two countries marched under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, held in the South. Many South Koreans were overcome with emotion as they saw the historic moment on TV Mr Kim announced last week that he was suspending nuclear tests.

Merkel lobbies Trump on trade and Iran,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she will stay in close touch with US President Donald Trump on the Iran nuclear deal, which he could scrap. Mrs Merkel described the 2015 international accord as a ""first step"" that prevented Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Mr Trump vowed to never let Iran have nuclear weapons, but would not say if he would consider military force. Mrs Merkel was in Washington for a brief ""working visit"" with Mr Trump. The optics of her trip contrasted starkly with the pomp and ceremony rolled out for French President Emmanuel Macron during his glitzy state earlier visit this week. Mr Macron had three days; Mrs Merkel had barely three hours. The German leader's differences with the US president on trade were laid bare at their Friday afternoon press conference. What is the Iran nuclear deal? Could the Iran nuclear deal collapse? Merkel visits Trump - so will she envy Macron's bromance? She hoped to persuade Mr Trump not to impose US tariffs on European steel and aluminium products. Berlin expects a US exemption on global duties to expire on 1 May. Analysis by BBC's Barbara Plett Usher Neither the French president nor the German chancellor made any tangible progress on Iran during their trips to Washington this week. In a co-ordinated campaign they delivered the same message to President Trump: the nuclear accord was working but flawed, and should be used as a building block for further action to contain Iran in the region. In this way the Europeans are hoping to convince President Trump not to scrap the deal by a self-imposed deadline next month. They're trying to buy time to continue ongoing negotiations aimed at addressing his concerns, many of which they share: Iran's ballistic missile programme, its support for armed groups in the region, and its future nuclear activity once the limits in the existing agreement expire. But publicly Mr Trump gave no ground, and Mr Macron said at the end of his visit he was inclined to believe the US president would indeed pull out of the accord. Even if President Trump does so, he has declared that Iran would not be allowed to restart its nuclear programme. But he has not divulged any plan to curb Iran's nuclear activity without the deal if, indeed, he has one. Mrs Merkel was asked by a reporter whether she had secured an assurance from Mr Trump not to impose the duties. ""The president will decide. That's very clear,"" she said, amid a co-ordinated lobbying campaign with other European leaders. ""We had an exchange of views. The decision lies with the president."" Mr Trump said he wanted a ""reciprocal"" trade relationship with Germany and other European nations. This video can not be played Trump and Macron's touching moments The other deadline looming large for the German chancellor is 12 May, when Mr Trump must decide whether to revive US sanctions on Iran. Doing so could kill off the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which world powers view as crucial to preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. The German chancellor is hoping to persuade Mr Trump not to torpedo the pact, which Germany - along with the US, France, UK, China and Russia - helped seal. The US president has demanded an overhaul of the accord to curtail Iran's ballistic missile programme and its sphere of influence in the Middle East, which has alarmed America's ally Israel. Mrs Merkel said the Obama-era pact was a ""first step that has contributed to slowing down their activities in this particular respect"". During his visit, the French president also lobbied Mr Trump to preserve the Iran agreement. But despite all the headlines about the two leaders' tactile ""bromance"", Mr Macron said he suspectsthe US president is going to pull out of the accord for ""domestic reasons"". This video can not be played Merkel handshake offer to Trump falls on deaf ears For his part, Mr Trump pressed Mrs Merkel to bolster spending on the German armed forces, up to the 2% of GDP required by Nato. On Friday, Mrs Merkel said Germany would spend 1.3% on defence, a slight increase. Last year, on her first Washington trip since Mr Trump took office, there was an awkward moment when Mr Trump apparently misheard her offer of a handshake. But on Friday he warmly shook her hands after greeting her with a cheek kiss. As he welcomed her to the Oval Office, Mr Trump insisted he has ""a really great relationship"" with his visitor.

"DJ found in contempt over Â£837,000 NHS claim","Atwal appeared in a music video during the period in which he claimed he was unable to work A DJ who tried to claim Â£837,000 from the NHS for negligence has been found in contempt of court. Sandip Singh Atwal, 33, from Birmingham, went to hospital for injuries to his hands and lip after being attacked in 2008. He said the treatment he received was negligent, and had left him unemployed and dependent. But the DJ was filmed working as a courier and dancing in a music video for a single he also released. It is thought to be the first time an NHS trust has brought such proceedings. Atwal - whose stage name is Sunny - was found in contempt of court on 14 counts. The trust said the ruling highlighted the consequences of submitting ""dishonest and exaggerated claims"". On 20 June 2008, Atwal, who was working in his family's taxi firm, was injured in an attack with a baseball bat and went to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. He was treated for fractures to the index finger of his right hand and the ring finger of his left hand, and a laceration to his lower lip. Atwal could now face up to two years in prison He later brought a claim for negligent treatment, which was admitted by Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, who offered Â£30,000 to settle the case. But Atwal asked for Â£837,109, including very substantial sums for future loss of earnings and future care, on the basis he was unable to work and grossly incapacitated. In order to justify the much larger claim, Atwal said he was suffering from disability, self-consciousness about his lip and hands, had becoming a social recluse, suffered alcohol dependence and reliance on pain killers and was unable to work as a DJ or a courier between 2010 to 2015. But the NHS trust was suspicious, put Atwal under surveillance and investigated his social media postings which ""gave the lie"" to much of what he was asserting, said the High Court judge Mr Justice Spencer. Surveillance footage showed Atwal working and lifting heavy items, with no visible signs of discomfort, leading the trust to accuse him of fraudulent exaggeration. In March 2016, Atwal said he would accept the trust's compensation offer made nearly five years earlier. However, the whole of the Â£30,000 compensation went to pay the trust's costs, with Atwal ending up after eight years of litigation owing it Â£5,000. The High Court ruled that 14 allegations of contempt relating to false statements by Atwal had been proved. They included: Claiming he was unable to work as a DJ because of the loss of strength and dexterity in his hands Telling a specialist that he had lost the confidence to perform as a professional DJ and had to delegate to an assistant Telling a consultant it was impossible for him to do any lifting that was part of the job of a courier driver Telling a care expert that he was unemployed Saying in a witness statement that he was unable to carry heavy bags Asserting that he needed ongoing physical and psychological support The case is believed to be the first time an NHS trust has brought contempt proceedings against someone for making a dishonestly inflated medical negligence claim. Atwal is due to be sentenced on 1 June unless he can bring a successful challenge against the ruling. The maximum sentence for contempt is two years imprisonment. NHS Resolution, on behalf of Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust, said the case should be seen as a demonstration of its commitment to combating fraud - but should not deter genuine claimants.

"Man, 86, foils burglary - then offers him lift","Mr Turner described his experience as ""absurd"" An 86-year-old man who offered a lift to a man who had broken into his Perth home said he ""felt sorry"" for the would-be thief. Harry Turner had returned to his house after forgetting to take a newspaper to a visit to his local pub. Mr Turner said he discovered the housebreaker in his bedroom with the top drawer of his bedroom cabinet open. The housebreaker fled after Mr Turner turned his back to lock his front door after offering the man a lift. Mr Turner told BBC Scotland'sStephen Jardine Programmethat the experience had been ""absurd"". He said: ""I felt remorse for this young man. ""A fine young Scotsman in his mid 20s, to resort to this in his life. ""What a shame, what a disaster. I just felt sorry for him."" Mr Turner, who has lived in the house for 17 years, said he had not locked his door after leaving for the pub because ""there's never anybody about here"". When he returned he said he ""knew something wrong"" as the back door was wide open. Mr Turner said: ""I looked up the corridor to the bedroom and there was a young man standing by my bed in the top drawer of the bedside cabinet with several of my Masonic cases open. ""It happened so quickly I didn't know what I was doing really, I just asked him what he was doing here, what does he want?"" Mr Turner said the man reassured him he had not stolen anything and ""looked a bit bewildered himself."" He said: ""He showed me no aggression at all and he let me look into his little handbag and he'd got nothing in there."" After walking the man out of the house Mr Turner asked if he could help and the man asked if he could have a lift. Mr Turner said: ""I said where do you want to go and he said North Muirton. ""So I went back to lock up and when I'd come back he'd gone.""

Man jailed for boys' hit-and-run deaths,"Casper Platt-May, two, and his brother Corey, six, were on a family trip to a park when they were hit by a car A driver who killed two young brothers in a hit-and-run crash while high on cocaine has been jailed for nine years. Casper Platt-May, two, and his brother Corey, six, were struck while on their way to a Coventry park. Robert Brown, 53, of Attwood Crescent, Wyken, who was doing more than 60mph,admitted causing the deathsby dangerous driving. Brown had 30 previous convictions for driving without a licence or insurance, Warwick Crown Court heard. The court was told that the boys' lives had been ""ripped away"" in the incident on 22 February. Robert Brown and Gwendoline Harrison showed no emotion as they were sentenced Midlands Live: GP jailed for assaulting patient; taxi driver fined for refusing to pick up disabled passenger The boys' mother, Louise Platt-May, was unable to speak in court. Her husband Reece read her statement in which she wrote: ""I can't work, my heart is broken, and time will never heal this. I will miss them forever. This monstrous act will haunt me."" Corey (left) and Casper Platt-May were described by Corey's head teacher as ""lovely boys"" Gwendoline Harrison, 42, of Triumph Close, Wyken, who was a passenger in the car, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. She had admitted a charge of assault intending to resist arrest and trying to leave the scene when she ""knew two children lay dying"". ""No sentence can alleviate the pain of the family of these precious children,"" the judge Andrew Lockhart QC said. Brown and Harrison were both found to be four times over the limit for cocaine when the Ford Focus driven by Brown ""ploughed"" into the boys as they crossed Longfellow Road with their family. Corey was thrown into the air by the impact of the collision and landed some distance away, the court heard. The scene of the crash was ""like a bomb had gone off"", the boys' grandfather said West Midlands Police Collision Investigation Unit calculated that Brown was driving at more than 60mph. The crash happened at about 14:00 GMT as the boys were out with their brothers Connor, nine, and Cooper, four. In court, Connor said he ""misses play nights and games"" with his brothers. Casper, he said, was ""really good at running and jumping in puddles"", while Corey was talented at ""football, games, drawing and reading"". The brothers relive the accident, Ms Platt-May said, and suffer nightmares and panic attacks. Judge Lockhart said CCTV of the moment of the collision was ""extremely distressing"" and that he would have ordered against playing it in court. Floral tributes were laid at a memorial service for the brothers at Coventry Cathedral Dashcam footage from a bus showed that members of the public intervened to prevent Brown and Harrison from leaving the ""terrible scene"". One man was attacked by Harrison who hit him over the head with a handbag containing cans of beer as he tried to restrain the pair. They were discovered by police hiding behind a nearby garden shed and arrested. A week before the crash Brown had been released from prison for possessing an offensive weapon. He was disqualified from driving for 10 years after his release, while Harrison was disqualified for 27 months. Ms Platt-May said Brown had ""got off lightly"", and called on the government to ""honour"" the death of her sons with ""tougher punishments for drivers who think they are above the law"".

Labour expels activist over remarks to MP,"Marc Wadsworth is an anti-racism campaigner and Momentum activist Labour has expelled an activist for bringing the party into disrepute after he criticised a Jewish MP at the launch of an anti-Semitism report. Marc Wadsworth accused Ruth Smeeth of working ""hand in hand"" with the media to undermine Labour. Labour's National Constitutional Committee found he breached the party's rules and should be thrown out. Mrs Smeeth welcomed the result but Mr Wadsworth said he would see whether he could launch a legal challenge. The announcement followed a high-profile disciplinary hearing in which Mrs Smeeth gave evidence against him. Before Wednesday's hearing, Mr Wadsworth - an anti-racism campaigner and Momentum activist - suggested that he was being ""hung out to dry"". Mrs Smeeth branded his comments, at the launch of the Chakrabarti report into anti-Semitism, ""vile conspiracy theories"" while a group of MPs who accompanied her to the hearing had demanded action. A Labour spokesman said: ""The National Constitutional Committee of the Labour Party has found that two charges of a breach of the Labour Party's rule 2.1.8 by Marc Wadsworth have been proven."" ""The NCC consequently determined that the sanction for this breach of Labour Party rules will be expulsion from membership."" Ruth Smeeth (wearing sunglasses) was escorted to Wednesday's hearing by other MPs The MP thanked all those who had supported her throughout what she said had been a two-year ""ordeal"", saying there was no place for ""bullying and intimidation"" within the party. ""I am relieved that after nearly two years this matter has finally been resolved,"" she said. ""I hope that this decision represents the first step towards a return to the values of decency and respect throughout the Labour Party."" The Jewish Labour Movement also welcomed the outcome, saying the case was ""symptomatic of the ongoing delays in resolving disciplinary matters"". Mr Wadsworth said in a statement that he had been ""overwhelmed by the support I've received"" and intended to look at ""all my options to legally challenge the decision"". He added: ""I deplore anti-Semitism, anti-black racism, Islamophobia and all forms of prejudice, bigotry and discrimination that I have campaigned against all my political life and will continue to do so."" Mr Wadsworth said the Labour leader ""had a go"" at him for his choice of language but was largely supportive He later told reporters that Mr Corbyn, whom he described as an ""old friend and comrade"", had ""had a go"" at him after the incident and told him he could have used ""kinder language"". But he said Labour's leader had been supportive since then and had told mutual friends he ""doesn't see I did anything wrong"". He suggested a member of Mr Corbyn's team had contacted him on the morning of the hearing to say they were ""working behind the scenes"" on his behalf but would not say who this was. The activist was supported by Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, who said he was ""astonished"" by the ""absurd"" decision to expel the activist. ""It flies in the face of the evidence presented and offends against the principles of natural justice,"" he said, in a statement on Facebook. ""The NCC's [National Constitutional Committee] decision has all the hallmarks of predetermination and tramples on Labour's record of standing up for fairness."" The MP for Derby North said he would help Mr Wadsworth in his efforts to ""clear his name"". But Labour MP Anna Turley, one of those who accompanied Mrs Smeeth to the hearing, said the decision was the right one as Labour should be in the ""vanguard of the fight against prejudice and hate"".

"Knifeman kills students in ChinaA knife-wielding man attacks 19 students as they are heading home, killing at least seven.","Local citizens turned out to give blood after the incident Nine students have been stabbed to death and 10 injured in a knife attack outside a school in northern China, officials say. A man suspected of carrying out the attack is alleged to be a former student taking revenge for having been bullied at the school. The assault took place near Mizhi County Number Three secondary school in Shaanxi province as the students were heading home for the day. The suspect remains in custody. Chinese police have given his surname as Zhao and say he is 28. Their preliminary assessment is that he was motivated to take revenge because he was bullied in his third year (where students are typically aged 13-14). Alarm bells ring over China school attacks Police say the dead are seven girls and two boys. Photos on social media showed several young students lying on the ground in Yulin city, surrounded by shocked onlookers. The attack happened at the school at around 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) on Friday, a local government statement said. The injured children are receiving treatment in hospital. Their exact ages have not been given but reports suggest they may be middle school children, which would make them aged 12 to 15. Knife attacks have made the headlines in China in recent years: A spate of unconnected stabbings at schools between 2010 and 2012 left at least 25 dead and more than 100 injured The country executed three men in March 2015 after they were found guilty of a savage knife attack at Kunming station, where 29 people were hacked to death and more than 100 others wounded.

EU agrees near-total neonicotinoid ban,"This video can not be played Campaigners in Brussels celebrate the new ban Member states have voted in favour of an almost complete ban on the use of neonicotinoid insecticides across the EU. Scientific studies have long linked their use to the decline of honeybees, wild bees and other pollinators. The move represents a major extension of existing restrictions, in place since 2013. Manufacturers and some farming groups have opposed the move, saying the science remains uncertain. Neonicotinoids are the most widely used class of insecticides in the world, but concerns about their impact on bees have been reinforced by multipleresearch efforts, including so-called ""real world"" trial results published last year. Back in 2013 the European Union opted for a partial ban on the use of the three chemicals in this class: Imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam. The restrictions applied to crops including maize, wheat, barley, oats and oil seed rape. The newly agreed Commission regulation goes much further, meaning that almost all outdoor uses of the chemicals would be banned. Voting on the proposal had been postponed a number of times as countries were split on the move. However, Friday's meeting saw a qualified majority vote in favour of the ban. The action has been driven by arecent report from the European Food Safety Authority(Efsa), which found that neonicotinoids posed a threat to many species of bees, no matter where or how they are used in the outdoor environment. ""The Commission had proposed these measures months ago, on the basis of the scientific advice from the European Food Safety Authority,"" said EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis. ""Bee health remains of paramount importance for me since it concerns biodiversity, food production and the environment."" Another key element that helped push the vote through was the UK's change of heart on the use of these insecticides. Environment Secretary Michael Goveannounced last Novemberthat Britain would now support further restrictions. ""I think it has helped the dynamic,"" Franziska Achterberg from Greenpeace told BBC News. ""It has helped sway Ireland definitely, and then lately, the Germans, the Austrians and the Dutch. I think the fact the UK had come around was a good signal for them as well, that they could not stay behind."" The new ban sees restrictions extended to crops like sugar beet Growers will only be free to use neonicotinoids in greenhouses across the EU, despite some environmental groups having reservations about the chemicals leaching into water supplies. Other neonicotinoids, such as thiacloprid, will continue to be exempt from the ban. Environmental campaigners have welcomed the ban. Some five million people around the world had signed petitions calling for an extension of restrictions. ""Banning these toxic pesticides is a beacon of hope for bees,"" said Antonia Staats, from Avaaz, ""Finally, our governments are listening to their citizens, the scientific evidence and farmers who know that bees can't live with these chemicals and we can't live without bees."" Many farmers are unhappy about the increase in restrictions, saying they do not believe they are warranted on scientific grounds and that the existing partial ban has not delivered results. ""The Commission hasn't been able to find that these restrictions have delivered any measurable benefits for bees,"" said Chris Hartfield from the National Farmers' Union (NFU) in the UK. ""That has been a big question for us, and if we can't be certain they can deliver measurable benefits why are we doing this?"" The new regulation will be adopted in the coming weeks and will be applicable by the end of the year. Some farmers believe it will have significant impacts on the types of crops grown across the Continent. ""The irony of the current restrictions is that it has led to the decline of oil seed rape being grown in the UK and that's reflected across the whole of Europe,"" Mr Hartfield said. The use of neonicotinoids on oil seed rape has been banned since 2013 ""We're not decreasing our consumption of that product; we are just importing it from outside Europe, where it is often treated with neonicotinoids. I would expect to see that continue."" Some campaigners believe that the extended ban heralds a new era for EU farmers where the needs of the environment are seen as more important than production. ""It's a significant indication that we need a different form of farming across Europe that farms with nature and not against it,"" said Sandra Bell from Friends of the Earth. ""The ban on neonicotinoids could be a really important step towards a more general questioning of the use of pesticides and the harm they are doing to our environment.""

UK economy in weakest growth since 2012,"The impact of the 'Beast from the East' weather front was ""relatively small"", the ONS said The UK economy grew at its slowest rate since 2012 in the first quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. GDP growth was 0.1%, down from 0.4% in the previous quarter, driven by a sharp fall in construction output and a sluggish manufacturing sector. The ONS said,externalthe recent extreme weather had a ""relatively small"" impact. The prime minister's spokesman said the data was ""clearly disappointing"" but the economic fundamentals ""are strong"". He said the economy ""has grown every year since 2010 and unemployment is at a 40-year low, but we are not complacent"". The government would continue with a balanced approach, he added. Sterling fell sharply as the chances of an interest rate rise in May receded. Following the news the pound was down almost one and a half cents against the dollar at $1.3775. Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, said: ""Our initial estimate shows the UK economy growing at its slowest pace in more than five years with weaker manufacturing growth, subdued consumer-facing industries and construction output falling significantly. ""While the snow had some impact on the economy, particularly in construction and some areas of retail, its overall effect was limited with the bad weather actually boosting energy supply and online sales."" The figures are a first estimate and are likely to be revised by the ONS as more data becomes available. Many economists had forecast first-quarter growth of 0.3%. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""These are only preliminary figures and are based largely on estimates rather than actual data for March, when the snow was at its worst. So there could be larger than usual revisions."" Construction was the biggest drag on GDP, falling 3.3% over the first three months of the year, while manufacturing growth slowed to 0.2%. Consumer-facing industries, including retail, fell sharply amid an ongoing spending squeeze caused by higher inflation and slow wage growth. Ahmed: Why is economic growth so poor? House building slumps as 'Beast' hits economy Carney: Brexit uncertainty could delay rate rise Year-long wage squeeze nearing an end UK inflation falls to lowest in a year Last week, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, hinted that interest rates could rise more gradually than expected due to continuing uncertainty over Brexit and ""mixed data"" on the economy. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that taken with the latest GDP figures, the chances of a rate rise had now fallen dramatically. ""As recently as last week markets were pricing in a near 90% chance that the Bank of England would raise rates next month... today the market's saying there's just a 25% chance that rates will move in May."" Everybody was all set to blame the Beast from the East, the blast of snow and cold that hit the country last month, for a slowdown in growth. But not only was the slowdown much sharper than thought, but the ONS then very helpfully explained that it was NOT due to the bad weather. Any fall in economic activity as we huddled indoors was mainly replaced by us turning up the heating and shopping online. Now, GDP figures are often revised and there will be some bounce back. But the more worrying factor is that construction is deep in recession, manufacturing's spurt of growth is slowing, and consumer-facing service companies are not as full of the joys of spring as they were. If that trend continues the economy will struggle to rebound, no matter what the weather. Despite the weak figures, some economists suggested the slowdown could prove to be temporary, noting the one-off impact of this winter's weather. Wage growth is also picking up, unemployment is at a four-decade low and inflation fell in March to the lowest rate in a year. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the latest data ""reflects some impact from the exceptional weather that we experienced last month, but our economy is strong and we have made significant progress"". ""Our economy has grown every year since 2010 and is set to keep growing, unemployment is at a 40 year low, and wages are increasing as we build a stronger, fairer economy that works for everyone."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The chancellor will want to blame this all on a bit of bad weather, but the ONS say this had a limited impact. The truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. ""It's clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt.""

Memo leak 'suggests Rudd told of targets'Amber Rudd's claim she knew nothing about migrant removal targets is put in doubt by a memo leaked to the Guardian.6m7 minutes agoUK Politics,"Home Secretary Amber Rudd is facing fresh calls to quit after a leaked memo suggested she had been informed about immigration removal targets. The home secretary had initially told MPs probing the Windrush scandal there were no targets - before admitting ""local"" targets had been set. She told the Commons on Thursday she had not been aware of them. Butthe Guardian has reported,externala June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that refers to targets. Home Office 'to scrap removals targets' Home Office 'knew about Windrush issues' Who are the Windrush generation? Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""Amber Rudd either failed to read this memo and has no clear understanding of the policies in her own department, or she has misled Parliament and the British people. ""Either way, she needs to accept responsibility and resign immediately."" But Conservative vice-chair Kemi Badenoch backed Ms Rudd. ""Aside from this issue, she has been doing a good job,"" the MP for Saffron Walden told Radio 4's Any Questions. ""She's apologised, she's taken action to deal with it swiftly. And also, we have an immigration bill that's coming later in the year - she's the only person who can drive this forward."" By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake The problem is not the policy. Targets are often used by government departments to monitor performance. Labour had many targets of its own on immigration. But Amber Rudd was already under pressure because she appeared to be unaware of what her own department was doing. The Guardian has now published a leaked memo suggesting she was told of immigration removal targets. This is despite her previously telling MPs that ""we don't have targets for removals."" A resignation issue, according to Labour. But removing Amber Rudd from office would leave the prime minister further exposed to criticism of her record at the Home Office and put a high-profile Remainer on the backbenches. So whether the home secretary stays in her job may well be a matter for Amber Rudd to decide for herself. The Guardian reports that the six-page memo, from Immigration Enforcement Agency boss Hugh Ind, states: ""IE has set a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18, aided by the redistribution of resources towards this area. ""This will move us along the path towards the 10% increased performance on enforced returns, which we promised the home secretary earlier this year."" It adds: ""We have exceeded our target of assisted returns. We set an internal target of 1,250 of these returns for 2016-17â¦ we delivered 1,581."" This video can not be played Appearing before a select committee, Home Secretary Amber Rudd denies there are targets The Guardian says the memo was copied to Ms Rudd and then-immigration minister Brandon Lewis, as well as some civil servants and advisers. On Friday, Rob Whiteman, who was chief executive of the UK Border Agency from 2011 to 2013, told the BBC all public services operated on targets and ""of course"" ministers would be aware of them. He said: ""Fair's fair, ministers could say we don't actually set these targets, they are being set by the operations but I think it is disingenuous, surely, to suggest that they don't know that they exist because they will have seen them in performance reports and other internal documents."" Ms Rudd has been under pressure over the issue of targets this week, having initially told the home affairs select committee on Wednesday: ""We don't have targets for removals."" Butan inspection report from December 2015,externalemerged, showing targets for the voluntary departures of people regarded as having no right to stay in the UK existed at that time. A 2015 report from the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration details an annual target of 12,000 voluntary departures for 2015/16 On Thursday, Ms Rudd told MPs: ""I have never agreed that there should be specific removal targets and I would never support a policy that puts targets ahead of people. ""The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. ""These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change."" On the issue of targets, she added: ""Unfortunately, I was not aware of them, and I âwant to be aware of them, which is why I am now putting in place different measures to ensure that that happens."" The home secretary has faced calls to quit from Labour, the SNP and the Green Party, following her admission that the targets did exist and, according to union officials, are prominently displayed on posters at regional immigration centres. But Conservative backbenchers, including Sir Nicholas Soames and Philip Davies, rallied behind Ms Rudd on Thursday, with Mr Davies saying most members of the public backed tougher action against illegal immigration. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged migrants from Commonwealth Caribbean countries and their relatives who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants if they could not provide a range of documentation that proved they had lived in the UK continuously. Some of the Windrush generation have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs or been refused access to medical treatment.

US singer speaks about concert miscarriageHalsey also reveals she plans to freeze her eggs so she can have children in future.4h4 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"Halsey was diagnosed with endometriosis in 2016 US singer Halsey has spoken about the moment she realised she was having a miscarriage during a concert. She was talking on a TV show in a segment about endometriosis, a condition sherevealed,externalshe has in 2016. ""I was on tour, and I found out I was pregnant,"" Halsey told The Doctors. ""Before I could really figure out what that meant to me and what that meant for my future... the next thing I knew I was on stage miscarrying in the middle of my concert."" Anestimated1.5 million women in the UK live with endometriosis - where cells like those that line the womb develop in other parts of the body. It can cause painful and heavy periods, as well as infertility, fatigue and bowel and bladder problems. Halsey continued: ""The sensation of looking a couple hundred teenagers in the face while you're bleeding through your clothes and still having to do the show, and realising in that moment... I never want to make that choice ever again of doing what I love or not being able to because of this disease. ""So I put my foot down and got really aggressive about seeking treatment and I had surgery about a year ago and I feel a lot better."" Halsey at the Vanity Fair party after the Oscars last month During the interview, Halsey - real name Ashley Nicolette Frangipane - also revealed she plans to freeze her eggs so she can have children in the future. ""When I tell people that, they're like, 'You're 23, why do you need to do that? Why do you need to freeze your eggs?'"" she said. ""Doing an ovarian reserve is important to me because I'm fortunate enough to have that as an option, but I need to be aggressive about protecting my fertility, about protecting myself."" She also discussed the ""bittersweet"" feeling when she was diagnosed with endometriosis - which she described in January 2016 as ""excruciatingly painful"". She told the CBS TV show: ""My tour manager had to take me to a hospital. And the whole time I was there, no-one knew what to tell me. Dehydration, stress, anxiety. ""And I was saying, 'What about my pain?' A lot of the time they can make you think it's in your head."" Speaking about finally getting the diagnosis, she continued: ""It was the relief of knowing that I wasn't making it up, and I wasn't being sensitive, and it wasn't all in my head, but it also kind of sucked to know that I was going to be living with this forever. ""The thing with endometriosis is that it comes down to that doctors can tend to minimise the female experience when it comes to dealing with it,"" she added. ""My whole life, my mother had always told me, 'Women in our family just have really bad periods.' It was just something she thought she was cursed to deal with and I was cursed to deal with, and that was just a part of my life.""

"DJ guilty of contempt over Â£837,000 NHS claim","Atwal appeared in a music video during the period in which he claimed he was unable to work A DJ who tried to claim Â£837,000 from the NHS for negligence has been found in contempt of court. Sandip Singh Atwal, 33, from Birmingham, went to hospital for injuries to his hands and lip after being attacked in 2008. He said the treatment he received was negligent, and had left him unemployed and dependent. But the DJ was filmed working as a courier and dancing in a music video for a single he also released. It is thought to be the first time an NHS trust has brought such proceedings. Atwal - whose stage name is Sunny - was found in contempt of court on 14 counts. The trust said the ruling highlighted the consequences of submitting ""dishonest and exaggerated claims"". On 20 June 2008, Atwal, who was working in his family's taxi firm, was injured in an attack with a baseball bat and went to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. He was treated for fractures to the index finger of his right hand and the ring finger of his left hand, and a laceration to his lower lip. Atwal could now face up to two years in prison He later brought a claim for negligent treatment, which was admitted by Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, who offered Â£30,000 to settle the case. But Atwal asked for Â£837,109, including very substantial sums for future loss of earnings and future care, on the basis he was unable to work and grossly incapacitated. In order to justify the much larger claim, Atwal said he was suffering from disability, self-consciousness about his lip and hands, had becoming a social recluse, suffered alcohol dependence and reliance on pain killers and was unable to work as a DJ or a courier between 2010 to 2015. But the NHS trust was suspicious, put Atwal under surveillance and investigated his social media postings which ""gave the lie"" to much of what he was asserting, said the High Court judge Mr Justice Spencer. Surveillance footage showed Atwal working and lifting heavy items, with no visible signs of discomfort, leading the trust to accuse him of fraudulent exaggeration. In March 2016, Atwal said he would accept the trust's compensation offer made nearly five years earlier. However, the whole of the Â£30,000 compensation went to pay the trust's costs, with Atwal ending up after eight years of litigation owing it Â£5,000. The High Court ruled that 14 allegations of contempt relating to false statements by Atwal had been proved. They included: Claiming he was unable to work as a DJ because of the loss of strength and dexterity in his hands Telling a specialist that he had lost the confidence to perform as a professional DJ and had to delegate to an assistant Telling a consultant it was impossible for him to do any lifting that was part of the job of a courier driver Telling a care expert that he was unemployed Saying in a witness statement that he was unable to carry heavy bags Asserting that he needed ongoing physical and psychological support The case is believed to be the first time an NHS trust has brought contempt proceedings against someone for making a dishonestly inflated medical negligence claim. Atwal is due to be sentenced on 1 June unless he can bring a successful challenge against the ruling. The maximum sentence for contempt is two years imprisonment. NHS Resolution, on behalf of Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust, said the case should be seen as a demonstration of its commitment to combating fraud - but should not deter genuine claimants.

China students stabbed to death,"Local citizens turned out to give blood after the incident Nine students have been stabbed to death and 10 injured in a knife attack outside a school in northern China, officials say. A man suspected of carrying out the attack is alleged to be a former student taking revenge for having been bullied at the school. The assault took place near Mizhi County Number Three secondary school in Shaanxi province as the students were heading home for the day. The suspect remains in custody. Chinese police have given his surname as Zhao and say he is 28. Their preliminary assessment is that he was motivated to take revenge because he was bullied in his third year (where students are typically aged 13-14). Alarm bells ring over China school attacks Police say the dead are seven girls and two boys. Photos on social media showed several young students lying on the ground in Yulin city, surrounded by shocked onlookers. The attack happened at the school at around 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) on Friday, a local government statement said. The injured children are receiving treatment in hospital. Their exact ages have not been given but reports suggest they may be middle school children, which would make them aged 12 to 15. Knife attacks have made the headlines in China in recent years: A spate of unconnected stabbings at schools between 2010 and 2012 left at least 25 dead and more than 100 injured The country executed three men in March 2015 after they were found guilty of a savage knife attack at Kunming station, where 29 people were hacked to death and more than 100 others wounded. The trio had been convicted of murder and terrorism offences In July 2017, two people died and nine were injured by a knife-wielding man at a Wal-Mart supermarket in the southern city of Shenzhen In February, a knifeman killed a woman and injured 12 others at a Beijing shopping centreâ Eight dead after Xinjiang knife attack Three executed over Kunming attack The knife attack that changed Kunming China knife attack leaves 29 dead Man held over China stabbing deaths Alarm bells ring over China school attacks Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Man, 86, foils burglary - then offers him liftHe made the offer after discovering the would-be thief in the bedroom of his home in Perth.","Mr Turner described his experience as ""absurd"" An 86-year-old man who offered a lift to a man who had broken into his Perth home said he ""felt sorry"" for the would-be thief. Harry Turner had returned to his house after forgetting to take a newspaper to a visit to his local pub. Mr Turner said he discovered the housebreaker in his bedroom with the top drawer of his bedroom cabinet open. The housebreaker fled after Mr Turner turned his back to lock his front door after offering the man a lift. Mr Turner told BBC Scotland'sStephen Jardine Programmethat the experience had been ""absurd"". He said: ""I felt remorse for this young man. ""A fine young Scotsman in his mid 20s, to resort to this in his life. ""What a shame, what a disaster. I just felt sorry for him."" Mr Turner, who has lived in the house for 17 years, said he had not locked his door after leaving for the pub because ""there's never anybody about here"". When he returned he said he ""knew something wrong"" as the back door was wide open. Mr Turner said: ""I looked up the corridor to the bedroom and there was a young man standing by my bed in the top drawer of the bedside cabinet with several of my Masonic cases open. ""It happened so quickly I didn't know what I was doing really, I just asked him what he was doing here, what does he want?"" Mr Turner said the man reassured him he had not stolen anything and ""looked a bit bewildered himself."" He said: ""He showed me no aggression at all and he let me look into his little handbag and he'd got nothing in there."" After walking the man out of the house Mr Turner asked if he could help and the man asked if he could have a lift. Mr Turner said: ""I said where do you want to go and he said North Muirton. ""So I went back to lock up and when I'd come back he'd gone.""

Coroner's burial release policy 'unlawful',"There have been calls for Mary Hassell to ""consider her position"" following the High Court ruling A London coroner has been ordered by the High Court to change her ""cab-rank"" queuing policy for handling burials after it was ruled ""unlawful"". Senior coroner Mary Hassell had said she would not fast-track inquests based on religion. Under Jewish and Islamic law, bodies must be buried on the day of death or as soon as possible afterwards. Her jurisdiction covers north London which is home to large communities of orthodox Jews and Muslims. Lord Justice Singh said the policy set by Ms Hassell was discriminatory and must be quashed. Coroner should 'review her position' Jewish leaders call on Inner North London coroner to quit Sitting with Mrs Justice Whipple, he said: ""We hope that, with appropriate advice from others, including the chief coroner and perhaps after consultation with relevant bodies in the community, the defendant can draft a new policy which meets the needs of all concerned, including protection of the legal rights of all members of the community. ""We are hopeful that a satisfactory solution can be found in this sensitive area."" Lawyers representing religious groups, who brought the legal challenge, argued Ms Hassell's stance ignored ""deeply held beliefs"" of certain religious communities. They said Ms Hassell's policy was unlawful and breached the Human Rights Act and the Equality Act. BBC's religious affairs producer Callum May This case will not set a precedent for coroners across the UK. Each coroner has discretion over the order in which bodies are released. In Mary Hassell's case, the High Court decided she was acting unlawfully by refusing to ever consider religion as a reason to prioritise the release of a body. Two judges, Lord Justice Singh and Mrs Justice Whipple, said a coroner was ""entitled to prioritise cases, for religious or other reasons, even where the consequence of prioritising one or some cases may be that other cases will have to wait longer for a decision."" The chief coroner for England and Wales has been asked to give advice to Ms Hassell, and for her to consult Muslim and Jewish communities, before drafting a new policy. The court previously heard the coroner's patch covered the boroughs of Camden, Islington, Hackney and Tower Hamlets, which between them have ""sizeable"" Jewish and Muslim minority populations. Following the court's ruling,Board of Deputies,externalvice president Marie van der Zyl called on Ms Hassell ""to consider her position."" ""She has previously said that she does not believe that using her discretion to order cases, which she needs to do to uphold the religious freedom of the diverse communities she is meant to serve, is 'fair',"" she said. ""If she cannot carry out this basic function of her role, she must vacate her position. ""Whatever the future for the inner north London coroners' service, the issues raised by this case have highlighted the lack of accountability for this public service and the pressing need for reform.""

'On the run' GP found dead with girlfriend,"Noemi Gergely is believed to have been shot by her boyfriend Titus Bradley A doctor thought to have embezzled Â£400,000 of NHS cash before fleeing the UK has been found dead with his partner in an apparent murder-suicide. Titus Bradley, 42, left Hastings a year ago shortly before a large quantity of money was found to be missing from the accounts of four GP practices he ran. His body was found with that of his Hungarian girlfriend in the Divin' Art guest house in Cape Verde on 15 April. Sussex Police confirmed it had been investigating the theft of NHS funds. The force said it was contacted by NHS Hastings and Rother Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) in May last year about ""the possible inappropriate use of funds at the Cornwallis Plaza surgery"". A subsequent investigation established a substantial sum of money had been taken, police said. Officers were not able to confirm the amount. The force said inquiries had been made to trace two former employees at the group in connection with its investigation. It said it had received reports the couple had been found dead, but said the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was taking the lead on further inquiries. Live: More news from across the South East The bodies of Dr Bradley, who is originally from the Llanelli area in Wales, and Noemi Gergely, 28, were found two days after they had checked in to the guest house on the island of Santo Antao, off the west coast of Africa. Santo Antao police chief Cipriano Bandeira said officers believed it was a murder-suicide and they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. He said: ""We believe he shot the woman and then himself using a 6.35mm pistol."" He said officers had found the weapon. Launching an online fundraising campaign to pay for the repatriation of Ms Gergely's body and a memorial service, her mother Lorand Gergely said: ""We were devastated when we found out that our dear Noemi is no longer with us."" ""We want to honour her last wish to be cremated and then her remains to be scattered in the sea, but first, we would like to offer the opportunity to her dear family and friends to say goodbye to her in her hometown,"" she added. Sussex Police had been investigating the theft of funds from the Cornwallis Plaza surgery in Hastings Helder Bentub, co-manager of the guest house, told BBC South East it was understood the couple had been arguing in the restaurant and their room. ""Three minutes later, clack clack with the gun and I called the police. ""The police go in the room and see the two people dead in the toilet,"" he said. He said staff had not seen much of the pair, but they had ""seemed friendly"". A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: ""Our staff are assisting the family of a British man following his death in Cape Verde and are in contact with the local authorities."" Dr Bradley was registered by the General Medical Council in 2000 after graduating from the University of Leicester, but was suspended from practice on 28 March, according to records held. He was also listed as a director of Manchester-based Bradley Jones Surgeries Ltd until his appointment was terminated on Thursday, Companies House records showed.

'Stuffed anteater' photo disqualified,"Mr Cabral said flashes and a long exposure were needed to capture the scene A winning entry in theWildlife Photographer of the Year,externalcompetition has been disqualified for featuring a taxidermy specimen. The image, known as The Night Raider, shows an anteater moving towards a termite mound in a Brazilian reserve. London's Natural History Museum, which runs the competition, says the use of stuffed animals breaches its rules. The photographer, Marcio Cabral, denies he faked the scene and claims there is a witness who was with him on the day. Other photographers and tourists were in the park at the same time and therefore ""it would be very unlikely anyone wouldn't see a stuffed animal being transported and placed carefully in this position"", he told BBC News. But Roz Kidman Cox, the chair of judges for Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY), was stern in her criticism. ""This disqualification should remind entrants that any transgression of the rules and spirit of the competition will eventually be found out,"" she said. The taxidermy specimen is held at a visitorsâ centre at an entrance to the park The Night Raider picture won the Animals In Their Environment category in the 2017 WPY awards. It was taken inEmas National Park,external. The green lights are click beetles hoping to lure termites into being their prey with a bioluminescent display. The anteater's appearance was described in the citation caption as being serendipitous - a ""surprise bonus"" that walked into the shot. But the Natural History Museum (NHM) says third parties recently raised concerns the image was staged - that the hungry interloper is in fact a static model that can be seen at a visitors' centre at an entrance to the reserve. When alerted to this possibility, the museum asked five scientists to review the winning photo and to compare it with the centre's display model. These experts, who included the NHM's own taxidermy specialist and South American mammal and anteater researchers, worked independently of each other, but they all came to the same conclusion - that the two animals were one and the same. The scientists found the markings, the postures, the morphologies and even the positioning of the fur tufts to be just too similar. The NHM says Mr Cabral fully cooperated with the investigation, supplying RAW images for inspection that were taken ""before"" and ""after"" the winning scene. But none of these included the anteater. ""Unfortunately, I do not have another image of the animal because it is a long exposure of 30 seconds and ISO 5000,"" Mr Cabral said. ""After the flashes were fired, the animal left the place, so it was not possible to make another photo with the animal coming out of the place that is totally dark."" The WPY rules state that ""entries must not deceive the viewer or attempt to misrepresent the reality of nature"". And it is on this basis that The Night Raider has been stripped of its title and removed from display in the competition's UK tour. Roz Kidman Cox has been a judge on WPY for more than 30 years. She told the BBC: ""I find it disheartening and surprising that a photographer would go to such lengths to deceive the competition and its worldwide following. ""The competition places great store on honesty and integrity, and such a breach of the rules is disrespectful to the wildlife-photography community, which is at the heart of the competition."" This is not the first time the WPY judges have had to disqualify a winning entry. In 2009, they threw out the grand prize photo that supposedly depicteda wild Spanish wolf jumping over a gate,external. A similar investigation concluded that the pictured animal was not wild at all, but a tame wolf from a zoo. Ms Kidman Cox said the judges were always alert to the possibility that photos might be staged but that the artifice could be very hard to spot if the featured animals were in a natural pose in a low-lit scene. ""The judges themselves are chosen to include a range of skills and expertise, both biological and photographic, and are well able to question the veracity of an image,"" she added. ""The rules also make it clear that the competition champions honest and ethical photography, and they are translated into a number of languages to prevent any misunderstanding."" Mr Cabral describes his exclusion as a sad decision and one he will continue to contest. The visitors' centre is locked at night and has guards and so he could not have had access to the model, the photographer says. He intends to return to Emas National Park later this year to collect evidence that he believes will exonerate him.

Pensioner offers housebreaker a lift,"Mr Turner described his experience as ""absurd"" An 86-year-old man who offered a lift to a man who had broken into his Perth home said he ""felt sorry"" for the would-be thief. Harry Turner had returned to his house after forgetting to take a newspaper to a visit to his local pub. Mr Turner said he discovered the housebreaker in his bedroom with the top drawer of his bedroom cabinet open. The housebreaker fled after Mr Turner turned his back to lock his front door after offering the man a lift. Mr Turner told BBC Scotland'sStephen Jardine Programmethat the experience had been ""absurd"". He said: ""I felt remorse for this young man. ""A fine young Scotsman in his mid 20s, to resort to this in his life. ""What a shame, what a disaster. I just felt sorry for him."" Mr Turner, who has lived in the house for 17 years, said he had not locked his door after leaving for the pub because ""there's never anybody about here"". When he returned he said he ""knew something wrong"" as the back door was wide open. Mr Turner said: ""I looked up the corridor to the bedroom and there was a young man standing by my bed in the top drawer of the bedside cabinet with several of my Masonic cases open. ""It happened so quickly I didn't know what I was doing really, I just asked him what he was doing here, what does he want?"" Mr Turner said the man reassured him he had not stolen anything and ""looked a bit bewildered himself."" He said: ""He showed me no aggression at all and he let me look into his little handbag and he'd got nothing in there."" After walking the man out of the house Mr Turner asked if he could help and the man asked if he could have a lift. Mr Turner said: ""I said where do you want to go and he said North Muirton. ""So I went back to lock up and when I'd come back he'd gone.""

Spanish police said Natalie Cormack, 19, had realised she did not have her keys when she returned from work at a bar in the resort of Magaluf. She went to a friend's apartment and tried to climb to her flat at the Eden Rock de Torrenova block. An ambulance crew called to the scene were unable to save her life.

Natalie Cormack was working at a bar in the resort of Magaluf A Civil Guard officer at the Spanish island's regional headquarters in Palma said: ""We are still investigating. But it seems she did not have any keys when she arrived at her apartment and went to a friend's flat. ""She was climbing to her own balcony when she fell from the seventh floor. We understand that she comes from Scotland and was working in a nearby bar, but we don't have any more details yet."" A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ""We are supporting the family of a British national following her death in Spain, and our staff are in contact with the Spanish and UK police regarding the incident.""

Wales is first to offer safer Down's test,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Vaughan Gething says the test is safer for mothers and babies Pregnant women in Wales are to become the first in the UK to receive a non-invasive test for Down's syndrome. The NHS blood test, available from Monday, is said to be safer and more accurate than existing screenings for Down's, Edward's and Patau's syndromes. It will be offered to women with a higher chance of identifying the syndromes in the first three months of pregnancy. But some people have raised concerns it could lead to more terminations. Living with a child with Down's syndrome A world without Down's syndrome? Down's syndrome: 'The doctor said to us: I'm sorry' Karaoke mums' Down's syndrome video goes viral The Non-invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) test will be offered as an alternative to the invasive amniocentesis test currently available, which carries a small risk of miscarriage. The Welsh Government said it was expected the introduction of the new test would reduce this risk, as fewer invasive tests would be needed. The new test will not offer a complete diagnosis, as only the invasive test can confirm the syndrome, but aims to better inform women of the risks of having a child with the genetic disorder. Women who are given a positive NIPT test would not be able to opt for a termination based on that result alone. The introduction of the test will be evaluated in the next three years Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said: ""Our antenatal screening programme plays an important role in providing expectant mothers with the information and support they need throughout their pregnancy. ""I'm pleased Wales is leading the way by offering NIPT as part of our programme."" Helen Rogers, the Royal College of Midwives' director for Wales, welcomed the test. She added: ""Screening is always an individual choice for women and their partners and midwives in Wales have undergone additional training so they can share clear information on this non-invasive test with women which will support them in their decision making and to make the right choice for them."" This video can not be played Living with Down's syndrome ""more colourful"" But some campaigners, including the movementDon't Screen Us Out,external, are concerned the test could lead to more terminations and negatively impact the Down's syndrome community. Kate Harris, 41, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, whose 12-year-old son James has Down's syndrome said: ""Currently, you would be told that there are all these different medical negatives [associated with Down's syndrome] that you could get and you would be advised to seek advice from professionals who ultimately do also advise in terms of termination. ""What we'd like to see is that whilst that body that advises still has a place, there is a very big gap that should be filled by people living the truth, that is living with a child with Down's syndrome, and although that can be varied as it can with any child, it's very different to actually experience, even if it is reading in black and white."" Amniocentesis - where a needle is used to extract amniotic fluid - carries a risk of miscarriage The decision to implement the new test follows expert advice from the UK National Screening Committee. Sharon Hillier, director of screening at Public Health Wales, added: ""It is important that women are supported with information about the conditions and the screening offered so they can make the right decision for them as to whether they want to accept this offer."" The test will be rolled out in England from Autumn 2018, although details on what it will look like are yet to be decided by Public Health England. One in every 200 women loses their baby after an amniocentesis, in which the fluid around the developing foetus is tested for genetic disorders NIPT instead tests for fragments of foetal DNA, which reaches the mother's blood via the placenta NIPT will only be offered to women who have already received a higher-chance result from a combined screening test, which is available on the NHS The test is currently available privately in Wales Living with a child with Down's syndrome 'Safer' Down's test to be introduced Government approves new Down's test Project to 'scope' Down's test for Wales Actress Sally Philips talks about her son who has Down's syndrome.

Labour activist expelled over verbal attack,"Marc Wadsworth is an anti-racism campaigner and Momentum activist Labour has expelled an activist for bringing the party into disrepute after he criticised a Jewish MP at the launch of an anti-Semitism report. Marc Wadsworth accused Ruth Smeeth of working ""hand in hand"" with the media to undermine Labour. Labour's National Constitutional Committee found he breached the party's rules and should be thrown out. Mrs Smeeth welcomed the result but Mr Wadsworth said he would see whether he could launch a legal challenge. The announcement followed a high-profile disciplinary hearing in which Mrs Smeeth gave evidence against him. Before Wednesday's hearing, Mr Wadsworth - an anti-racism campaigner and Momentum activist - suggested that he was being ""hung out to dry"". Mrs Smeeth branded his comments, at the launch of the Chakrabarti report into anti-Semitism, ""vile conspiracy theories"" while a group of MPs who accompanied her to the hearing had demanded action. A Labour spokesman said: ""The National Constitutional Committee of the Labour Party has found that two charges of a breach of the Labour Party's rule 2.1.8 by Marc Wadsworth have been proven."" ""The NCC consequently determined that the sanction for this breach of Labour Party rules will be expulsion from membership."" Ruth Smeeth (wearing sunglasses) was escorted to Wednesday's hearing by other MPs The MP thanked all those who had supported her throughout what she said had been a two-year ""ordeal"", saying there was no place for ""bullying and intimidation"" within the party. ""I am relieved that after nearly two years this matter has finally been resolved,"" she said. ""I hope that this decision represents the first step towards a return to the values of decency and respect throughout the Labour Party."" The Jewish Labour Movement also welcomed the outcome, saying the case was ""symptomatic of the ongoing delays in resolving disciplinary matters"". Mr Wadsworth said in a statement that he had been ""overwhelmed by the support I've received"" and intended to look at ""all my options to legally challenge the decision"". He added: ""I deplore anti-Semitism, anti-black racism, Islamophobia and all forms of prejudice, bigotry and discrimination that I have campaigned against all my political life and will continue to do so."" Mr Wadsworth said the Labour leader ""had a go"" at him for his choice of language but was largely supportive He later told reporters that Mr Corbyn, whom he described as an ""old friend and comrade"", had ""had a go"" at him after the incident and told him he could have used ""kinder language"". But he said Labour's leader had been supportive since then and had told mutual friends he ""doesn't see I did anything wrong"". He suggested a member of Mr Corbyn's team had contacted him on the morning of the hearing to say they were ""working behind the scenes"" on his behalf but would not say who this was. The activist was supported by Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, who said he was ""astonished"" by the ""absurd"" decision to expel the activist. ""It flies in the face of the evidence presented and offends against the principles of natural justice,"" he said, in a statement on Facebook. ""The NCC's [National Constitutional Committee] decision has all the hallmarks of predetermination and tramples on Labour's record of standing up for fairness."" The MP for Derby North said he would help Mr Wadsworth in his efforts to ""clear his name"". But Labour MP Anna Turley, one of those who accompanied Mrs Smeeth to the hearing, said the decision was the right one as Labour should be in the ""vanguard of the fight against prejudice and hate"".

"China students stabbed to deathA knife-wielding man attacked 19 students as they were heading home, killing at least seven.6m7 minutes agoChina","Local citizens turned out to give blood after the incident Nine students have been stabbed to death and 10 injured in a knife attack outside a school in northern China, officials say. A man suspected of carrying out the attack is alleged to be a former student taking revenge for having been bullied at the school. The assault took place near Mizhi County Number Three secondary school in Shaanxi province as the students were heading home for the day. The suspect remains in custody. Chinese police have given his surname as Zhao and say he is 28. Their preliminary assessment is that he was motivated to take revenge because he was bullied in his third year (where students are typically aged 13-14). Alarm bells ring over China school attacks Police say the dead are seven girls and two boys. Photos on social media showed several young students lying on the ground in Yulin city, surrounded by shocked onlookers. The attack happened at the school at around 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) on Friday, a local government statement said. The injured children are receiving treatment in hospital. Their exact ages have not been given but reports suggest they may be middle school children, which would make them aged 12 to 15. Knife attacks have made the headlines in China in recent years: A spate of unconnected stabbings at schools between 2010 and 2012 left at least 25 dead and more than 100 injured The country executed three men in March 2015 after they were found guilty of a savage knife attack at Kunming station, where 29 people were hacked to death and more than 100 others wounded. The trio had been convicted of murder and terrorism offences In July 2017, two people died and nine were injured by a knife-wielding man at a Wal-Mart supermarket in the southern city of Shenzhen In February, a knifeman killed a woman and injured 12 others at a Beijing shopping centreâ Eight dead after Xinjiang knife attack Three executed over Kunming attack The knife attack that changed Kunming China knife attack leaves 29 dead Man held over China stabbing deaths Alarm bells ring over China school attacks Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Who attended talks?,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un will be bringing an elite group of confidantes and advisers along with him when he crosses into South Korea. The South say it has never hosted such a senior delegation from Pyongyang. This is the third inter-Korean summit, but this time it is also a prelude to a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. So who does Kim trust the most as he heads into uncharted diplomatic waters? The importance of Kim Yo-jong to her brother's master plan was made clear when she was made the ambassador for the recent Winter Olympics in the South, which is arguably where this all started. This video can not be played What we've seen of Kim Yo-jong from North Korean media (2018 video) At that point, she was thought to be the first immediate member of the Kim dynasty to visit the South since the Korean war ended in 1953. She remains on a US sanctions list over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea, but was still wined and dined by South Korea's president and top officials. She was the smiling face of the North Korean leadership at the Olympics, as South Korean media analysed her freckles and clothing - and speculated on whether she was pregnant. But her power within the state is not to be underestimated, and analysts say that many of the ruthless decisions Mr Kim took were probably made with his sister by his side. North Korean sister with a 'tomboy streak' Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon The 90-year-old Kim Yong-nam has seen the rule of all three North Korean leaders in his career. Unlike Kim Jong-un, he has travelled abroad on official visits. He went to Iran last summer to attend President Hassan Rouhani's inauguration ceremony for his second term. His loyalty to the leadership has never been questioned and some have pointed out that his ability to survive purges is impressive. ""He makes no mistakes. That's why he could keep his high-level post in a country where political purges are common,"" South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted one North Korean defector as saying. What this 'casual' photo tells us about N Korea North Korea's sports minister is known for his relatively relaxed demeanour in his state media appearances and photo opportunities. His first post of any significance was as a manager of the Sea of Blood opera troupe in the mid-1980s,according to the North Korea Leadership Watch blog.,external He has spent most of his career in North Korea's arts sector and is even thought to have been involved in the establishment of Moranbong Band, a North Korean all-female pop group. The breakthrough role of the Winter Olympics in North-South relations as well as recent cultural exchanges may account for his importance. Six extraordinary facts about music in North Korea North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive One of the more controversial figures in the delegation is Kim Yong-chol, a former military intelligence chief who is accused of masterminding attackson the South Korea warship Cheonanand Yeonpyeong Island in 2010. Gen Kim has a reputation for being difficult to work with and sarcastic, North Korea Leadership Watch reports. During talks with South Korea in 2007, he reportedly rejected an offer from the South by saying: ""Maybe you have another briefcase of proposals."" North Korea's controversial Olympics delegate Mr Ri - previously known as Ri Chol - has connections with the Kims going way back. He went to school with Kim Jong-il, before acting as guardian for his children, including the current leader, when they studied in Switzerland in the 1990s. Michael Madden of North Korea Leadership Watch has called him a ""father figure"" to Kim Jong-un. He went on to travel widely to represent the country and was made foreign minister in 2014, at a time when the role was becoming increasingly influential. He now directs the International Affairs Department, enabling him to interact often with foreign diplomats. According to North Korean Leadership Watch, he is respected as a diplomat at the UN and is considered an approachable figure. Mr Ri took over as military chief of staffin 2016. Two of his predecessors under Kim Jong-un are believed to have been executed and another purged. In his 80s, he is a Korean War veteran and seen as a leading military strategist. According to North Korea Leadership Watch, he acted as a tutor for Kim Jong-un as he began being groomed for leadership. He disappeared for a few years after Kim Jong-il's death but is now front and centre in the leadership line up. He has been head of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces,externalsince 2015. The MPAF handles the military's administrative and logistics activities, as well as diplomatic interactions with foreign armies. Mr Pak has overseen restructuring of the military as well as recovery operations after disastrous flooding in 2016. A career diplomat, Ri Yong-ho was for a long time North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator and has held several ambassadorial positions, including in the UK. He was promoted to the role of foreign minister in 2016.and has has developed a reputation for being outspoken. Last year, he accused the US of ""declaring war"" on North Korea and compared President Donald Trump's threats to the country as ""the sound of a dog barking"". He is also on Twitter.,external Ri Son-gwon's position as head of the group overseeing relations with South Korea - the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the County - made him the lead figure in the talks to get North Korea in the Winter Olympics. Until 2016 he was a senior armed forces colonel. He has issued warnings against military exercises in the South, denied his government's involvement in the 2010 naval incident and trashed South Korean politicians.

Trump 'likely' to meet Queen in UK visit,"This video can not be played Where will the US president go and what might greet him? Donald Trump is likely to meet the Queen when he visits the UK this July, the BBC understands. They will either meet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said. The US president is to visit the UK on Friday, 13 July, after previously cancelling a trip amid claims he would face mass protests. Downing Street called it a ""working visit"" - not the full-blown state visit Mr Trump was promised last year. Mr Trump will hold talks with Prime Minister Theresa May, Downing Street said, with further details to be ""set out in due course"".

Donald Trump is likely to meet the Queen on his visit to the UK in July Mr Trump cancelled a planned trip to London to open the new US embassy in Vauxhall earlier this year, complaining the move to an ""off location"" south of the Thames had been a ""bad deal"".

Some have been suggesting that Mr Trump should avoid London, where protests are expected. More than 33,000 people on Facebook have already said they will attend a protest organised by left-wing journalist Owen Jones. Six Conservative groups - including the think tanks the Bow Group and the Bruges Group - have written to Mr Trump urging him to focus his visit on his ""ancestral home"" of Scotland, where his mother was born. ""A visit to London by the president is likely to draw major protests, crime and disorder, and we do not wish to see Britain or President Trump embarrassed by this,"" Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of the Bow Group, said. ""Many in Britain... wish for President Trump to be afforded the warmest of welcomes,"" he added. ""Sadly that will not be the case in London.""

Doctor shortage 'due to immigration rules',"This video can not be played 'Shortage of doctors has led to treatment delays' Immigration rules are hampering the ability of the NHS to recruit doctors, health leaders are warning. The number of skilled non-EU workers granted UK visas is capped - with the Home Office arguing the restriction is in ""the national interest"". But NHS bosses say increasing numbers of doctors are being refused permission, worsening rota gaps and the waits patients face for treatment. It comes amid a row after visas for 100 Indian doctors were refused. The doctors had been recruited as part of a long-running scheme in the North West which supplies junior doctors to more than 30 NHS trusts. Bosses at the trusts have written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Amber Rudd asking them to urgently look into the problem. Analysis: 10 charts illustrating NHS woes NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff Jon Rouse, chief officer of the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, which represents services across the region, said he was shocked and concerned by the development. ""As we reach the end of a winter where the NHS has been stretched to its very limits, partly as a result of a lack of medical workforce, we find it almost impossible to understand how this decision can have been reached,"" he said. He said these doctors would have worked across hospital services - and warned rotas would now go unfilled. The NHS is already short of doctors, with a report from the regulator NHS Improvement warning one in 11 posts was vacant.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said he had heard of another 400 cases of blocked visas since December. ""We have examples of clinics being cancelled and delays in terms of patients receiving care. ""It exacerbates pressures in what are relatively small medical teams."" It is unclear exactly why this has happened. There is evidence in the NHS that it is getting harder to recruit and retain EU staff, putting pressure on non-EU sources. The skilled worker cap applies to all sectors so the numbers the NHS can recruit is also influenced by other sectors from IT to banking. Nurses have been placed on the shortage occupation list, which means they are given a priority in international recruitment. A Home Office spokeswoman said the system was in the ""national interest"". She said any Tier 2 applications - as they are known - which are refused in oversubscribed months could reapply in future ones. And she added there were a range of specialities, including A&E and radiology, that were on the shortage occupation list too. The GMC, which assesses the skills of non-EU doctors who want to work in the UK, said hundreds more overseas doctors were applying to them each year but then struggling to get visas. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the GMC, said: ""It is frustrating that while one government department is working hard to recruit doctors into an overstretched health service, another is enforcing eligibility conditions which stifle those efforts.""

Coroner order to change 'cab-rank' policy,"There have been calls for Mary Hassell to ""consider her position"" following the High Court ruling A London coroner has been ordered by the High Court to change her ""cab-rank"" queuing policy for handling burials after it was ruled ""unlawful"". Senior coroner Mary Hassell had said she would not fast-track inquests based on religion. Under Jewish and Islamic law, bodies must be buried on the day of death or as soon as possible afterwards. Her jurisdiction covers north London which is home to large communities of orthodox Jews and Muslims. Lord Justice Singh said the policy set by Ms Hassell was discriminatory and must be quashed. Coroner should 'review her position' Jewish leaders call on Inner North London coroner to quit Sitting with Mrs Justice Whipple, he said: ""We hope that, with appropriate advice from others, including the chief coroner and perhaps after consultation with relevant bodies in the community, the defendant can draft a new policy which meets the needs of all concerned, including protection of the legal rights of all members of the community. ""We are hopeful that a satisfactory solution can be found in this sensitive area."" Lawyers representing religious groups, who brought the legal challenge, argued Ms Hassell's stance ignored ""deeply held beliefs"" of certain religious communities. They said Ms Hassell's policy was unlawful and breached the Human Rights Act and the Equality Act. BBC's religious affairs producer Callum May This case will not set a precedent for coroners across the UK. Each coroner has discretion over the order in which bodies are released. In Mary Hassell's case, the High Court decided she was acting unlawfully by refusing to ever consider religion as a reason to prioritise the release of a body. Two judges, Lord Justice Singh and Mrs Justice Whipple, said a coroner was ""entitled to prioritise cases, for religious or other reasons, even where the consequence of prioritising one or some cases may be that other cases will have to wait longer for a decision."" The chief coroner for England and Wales has been asked to give advice to Ms Hassell, and for her to consult Muslim and Jewish communities, before drafting a new policy. The court previously heard the coroner's patch covered the boroughs of Camden, Islington, Hackney and Tower Hamlets, which between them have ""sizeable"" Jewish and Muslim minority populations. Following the court's ruling,Board of Deputies,externalvice president Marie van der Zyl called on Ms Hassell ""to consider her position."" ""She has previously said that she does not believe that using her discretion to order cases, which she needs to do to uphold the religious freedom of the diverse communities she is meant to serve, is 'fair',"" she said. ""If she cannot carry out this basic function of her role, she must vacate her position. ""Whatever the future for the inner north London coroners' service, the issues raised by this case have highlighted the lack of accountability for this public service and the pressing need for reform.""

Car park penalty tickets at record high,"The number of parking tickets issued by car park management firms in Britain hit a record 5.65m last year, analysis of government driver data suggests. The RAC Foundation says the number rose by almost a fifth in a year and was far above levels of a decade ago. Motorists face charges of as much as Â£100 for contraventions such as overstaying, it said. The government is backing a bill to introduce a new code of practice for the private parking industry. The motoring research group said the number of tickets issued in the 2017-18 financial year rose from 4.71m - a year-on-year increase of nearly 20%. A decade ago 499,000 tickets were issued. Private parking charges: Your rights Watchdog: Car charges you shouldn't have to pay RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said: ""Each year we publish this analysis and each year we are not only astonished by the numbers involved, but also by the fact that those numbers keep rocketing up. ""Pursuing so many people must be a major administrative task for the companies involved, but the questions the numbers really beg are what's going wrong? Are Britain's motorists really flouting the rules on such an industrial scale?"" When Timothy Sheppard arrived at Lingfield Station car park in Surrey on 28 December last year, he found that the parking ticket machines were out of order. In a rush to catch the train to London, the retired advertising executive said he asked a staff member inside the train station what to do. ""He told me 'it's not ours, we don't operate it' but said 'if you want to catch your train, you can sort it out when you get back',"" says Mr Sheppard. He planned to find a way to pay the Â£5.50 car parking ticket on his return. Instead, however, he found a penalty notice for Â£60 from a company called Indigo Park Solutions which operates the Lingfield Station car park on behalf of Southern Railway. Mr Sheppard, 76, said he wrote to Indigo Park Solutions to explain that he had been unable to buy a ticket because all the machines were not working and enclosed a payment of Â£5.50. Despite having proof of purchase from Royal Mail, Indigo Park Solutions said it had not received the letter. In the meantime, it had turned the matter over to a debt collecting agency. Mr Sheppard attempted to dispute the parking penalty with the British Parking Association. However, to use that service, the driver must first show that he appealed to the operator - in this case Indigo Park Solutions - within 28 days of the date of the original charge. Because Indigo Park Solutions claimed it had not received Mr Sheppard's letter, the dispute could not proceed. Mr Sheppard now says that a debt collector acting on behalf of Indigo Park Solutions is seeking Â£170 - Â£100 of which is the penalty charge and Â£70 for ""administration"". However, after months of anxiety, the situation is now being resolved, Indigo say. A spokesman said the fine was cancelled on 18 April following a review of the details with GTR, the train company. The RAC based its figures on the number of vehicle-owner records purchased by car parking management companies from the DVLA in the last financial year. These businesses are only allowed to purchase car ownership records from the DVLA for the purpose of issuing penalties, said the RAC. Mr Gooding said the total could be even higher as ""some firms will simply slap a demand on to a windscreen"". According to the data, ParkingEye Ltd, which is a car park management company owned by the outsourcing group Capita, was the biggest buyer of car ownership records from the DVLA last year. It purchased 1.76m records compared to 1.53m in the previous financial year. It is followed by Euro Car Park, which manages private parking spaces across the UK, Ireland and Europe, which bought access to 406,323 records compared to 306,857 in the previous period. The RAC said that numbers have increased since clamping cars on private land was banned in 2012 under the Protection of Freedoms Act. The act allowed private parking companies to pursue the registered owner of the vehicle rather than having to prove who the driver was at the time of the offence. The government is supporting a bill by Conservative MP Sir Greg Knight to introduce legislation to regulate the private parking industry. Failing to comply with these rules could mean that companies would be blocked from accessing driver data from the DVLA and issuing fines which, the Ministry of Housing and Local Communities said, would effectively force them out of the industry. A spokesperson for ParkingEye said: ""ParkingEye continues to be a member of the British Parking Association and follows its strict code of practice in all the car parks we manage on behalf of our clients. ""We welcome any additional government legislation that aims to drive consistency and improve processes across the entire private parking sector.""

Coroner order to change 'cab-rank' policySenior coroner Mary Hassell had said she would not fast-track inquests based on religion.6m6 minutes agoLondon,"There have been calls for Mary Hassell to ""consider her position"" following the High Court ruling A London coroner has been ordered by the High Court to change her ""cab-rank"" queuing policy for handling burials after it was ruled ""unlawful"". Senior coroner Mary Hassell had said she would not fast-track inquests based on religion. Under Jewish and Islamic law, bodies must be buried on the day of death or as soon as possible afterwards. Her jurisdiction covers north London which is home to large communities of orthodox Jews and Muslims. Lord Justice Singh said the policy set by Ms Hassell was discriminatory and must be quashed. Coroner should 'review her position' Jewish leaders call on Inner North London coroner to quit Sitting with Mrs Justice Whipple, he said: ""We hope that, with appropriate advice from others, including the chief coroner and perhaps after consultation with relevant bodies in the community, the defendant can draft a new policy which meets the needs of all concerned, including protection of the legal rights of all members of the community. ""We are hopeful that a satisfactory solution can be found in this sensitive area."" Lawyers representing religious groups, who brought the legal challenge, argued Ms Hassell's stance ignored ""deeply held beliefs"" of certain religious communities. They said Ms Hassell's policy was unlawful and breached the Human Rights Act and the Equality Act. BBC's religious affairs producer Callum May This case will not set a precedent for coroners across the UK. Each coroner has discretion over the order in which bodies are released. In Mary Hassell's case, the High Court decided she was acting unlawfully by refusing to ever consider religion as a reason to prioritise the release of a body. Two judges, Lord Justice Singh and Mrs Justice Whipple, said a coroner was ""entitled to prioritise cases, for religious or other reasons, even where the consequence of prioritising one or some cases may be that other cases will have to wait longer for a decision."" The chief coroner for England and Wales has been asked to give advice to Ms Hassell, and for her to consult Muslim and Jewish communities, before drafting a new policy. The court previously heard the coroner's patch covered the boroughs of Camden, Islington, Hackney and Tower Hamlets, which between them have ""sizeable"" Jewish and Muslim minority populations. Following the court's ruling,Board of Deputies,externalvice president Marie van der Zyl called on Ms Hassell ""to consider her position."" ""She has previously said that she does not believe that using her discretion to order cases, which she needs to do to uphold the religious freedom of the diverse communities she is meant to serve, is 'fair',"" she said. ""If she cannot carry out this basic function of her role, she must vacate her position. ""Whatever the future for the inner north London coroners' service, the issues raised by this case have highlighted the lack of accountability for this public service and the pressing need for reform.""

Abdul Hai, a member of Camden Council's ruling cabinet, described the court's decision as a ""resounding victory for those who have campaigned for the coroner's service to be brought into the 21st Century"".

The Kent schoolgirl told BBC South East Today she was 14 when she sent sexual images of herself to a boy, who posted them online for her peers to see. The BBC found more than 50 such groups on social media. Sharing indecent images of a child is illegal,externaleven if the person doing so is a child, said Kent Police. Speaking anonymously, the victim, now 16, said she sent pictures of herself in her underwear to a boy. She found out the images had been shared when some of her friends made fun of her. ""They looked at me and they whispered to their friends and I knew it was all about me,"" she said. The teenager said there were times when she still could not attend school. ""I can't concentrate and I just cry all the time - not all the time, but when I remember,"" she said Online 'bait out' groups give people access to sexual images and gossip ""Bait out"" pages are online groups or pages that invite users to share nude images, videos or sexual gossip about others, according toChildnet,external. Users are often only allowed access to the group or page once they have shared such content.

The people Kim is bringing to the summit,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un will be bringing an elite group of confidantes and advisers along with him when he crosses into South Korea. The South say it has never hosted such a senior delegation from Pyongyang. This is the third inter-Korean summit, but this time it is also a prelude to a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. So who does Kim trust the most as he heads into uncharted diplomatic waters? The importance of Kim Yo-jong to her brother's master plan was made clear when she was made the ambassador for the recent Winter Olympics in the South, which is arguably where this all started. This video can not be played What we've seen of Kim Yo-jong from North Korean media (2018 video) At that point, she was thought to be the first immediate member of the Kim dynasty to visit the South since the Korean war ended in 1953. She remains on a US sanctions list over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea, but was still wined and dined by South Korea's president and top officials. She was the smiling face of the North Korean leadership at the Olympics, as South Korean media analysed her freckles and clothing - and speculated on whether she was pregnant. But her power within the state is not to be underestimated, and analysts say that many of the ruthless decisions Mr Kim took were probably made with his sister by his side. North Korean sister with a 'tomboy streak' Kim's sister and North Korea's secret weapon The 90-year-old Kim Yong-nam has seen the rule of all three North Korean leaders in his career. Unlike Kim Jong-un, he has travelled abroad on official visits. He went to Iran last summer to attend President Hassan Rouhani's inauguration ceremony for his second term. His loyalty to the leadership has never been questioned and some have pointed out that his ability to survive purges is impressive. ""He makes no mistakes. That's why he could keep his high-level post in a country where political purges are common,"" South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted one North Korean defector as saying. What this 'casual' photo tells us about N Korea North Korea's sports minister is known for his relatively relaxed demeanour in his state media appearances and photo opportunities. His first post of any significance was as a manager of the Sea of Blood opera troupe in the mid-1980s,according to the North Korea Leadership Watch blog.,external He has spent most of his career in North Korea's arts sector and is even thought to have been involved in the establishment of Moranbong Band, a North Korean all-female pop group. The breakthrough role of the Winter Olympics in North-South relations as well as recent cultural exchanges may account for his importance. Six extraordinary facts about music in North Korea North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive One of the more controversial figures in the delegation is Kim Yong-chol, a former military intelligence chief who is accused of masterminding attackson the South Korea warship Cheonanand Yeonpyeong Island in 2010. Gen Kim has a reputation for being difficult to work with and sarcastic, North Korea Leadership Watch reports. During talks with South Korea in 2007, he reportedly rejected an offer from the South by saying: ""Maybe you have another briefcase of proposals."" North Korea's controversial Olympics delegate Mr Ri - previously known as Ri Chol - has connections with the Kims going way back. He went to school with Kim Jong-il, before acting as guardian for his children, including the current leader, when they studied in Switzerland in the 1990s. Michael Madden of North Korea Leadership Watch has called him a ""father figure"" to Kim Jong-un.

US suspect traced using genealogy sites,"Former police officer Joseph DeAngelo was arrested on Tuesday and charged with murder Californian prosecutors say genealogy websites played a key role in tracking down a man accused of being a notorious serial killer. Joseph DeAngelo, 72, is suspected of being the so-called Golden State Killer, blamed for a spate of murders and rapes in the 1970s and 1980s. DNA linked the crimes but police had struggled to identify the attacker. Investigators revealed the search was narrowed with genetic information from websites used to trace family ancestry. Mr DeAngelo, who was arrested on Tuesday, has been charged with eight counts of murder. He is due to make his first court appearance in Sacramento later on Friday. Steve Grippi, a prosecuting attorney for Sacramento County, said investigators had compared the DNA they had to information uploaded to genealogical websites by people searching for parents or other relatives. The DNA Doe Project, which helps trace unidentified murder victims and return them to their families, told the BBC that DNA sent to such a site by a relative of the murderer may have provided a crucial clue to police. It is not clear if the websites involved were ordered to provide the information or did so voluntarily. Police have removed items from the home of Mr DeAngelo in Citrus Heights, near Sacramento Authorities were then able to focus on a few individuals. They further narrowed the search by using profiling technique, including the probable age of the killer. Mr DeAngelo lived in a suburb of Sacramento that is not far from the scene of the first murders. Police said Mr DeAngelo, a former police officer, was placed under surveillance and then arrested when ""discarded DNA"" matched him to the crimes. The Golden State Killer - also known as the East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker and the Diamond Knot Killer - is believed to have carried out 12 murders, 51 rapes and more than 120 burglaries between 1976 and 1986. The crime spree terrorised communities in Sacramento, San Francisco and in central and southern California.

RBS profit trebles as costs fall,"Royal Bank of Scotland has reported a profit of Â£792m for the first three months of the year, up from Â£259m for the same quarter last year. The rise is partly thanks to a fall in restructuring costs, and a drop in conduct and litigation costs. Running costs at the bank, which is 72% state-owned, are also falling as it continues its plan to shrink in size. The quarterly profit follows on fromRBS's first annual profit in 10 years,reported in February. The profit figure was well above estimates. RBS did not set aside any more money to cover costs for payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling claims. The bank still has the threat of a major fine for mis-selling mortgages in the US in the run-up to the credit crisis hanging over it. The fine could come any time this year, and estimates of its size vary wildly, between $1bn-$9bn. The bank has already made provisions for the fine of Â£3bn. Once this is out of the way RBS is expected to return to paying dividends. RBS boss defends branch closures The hotel that RBS took and sold to... RBS Barclays pushed into loss by US payout Lloyds Bank profits jump by 23% The bank's chief executive, Ross McEwan, said: ""This is a good set of results, showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market. Our income is up, costs are down and our capital has strengthened again."" RBS's ""buffer"" of capital - a key measure of any bank's strength - is 16.4%, well above its target of 13% and a level which should mean it can withstand any fine from the US Department of Justice for mortgage mis-selling. RBS has been under the spotlight in recent months over the conduct of its specialist recovery division, the Global Restructuring Group (GRG), which operated between 2005 and 2013. The GRG was marketed as an expert service that could save a business, but according to an official report, it mistreated thousands of small firms. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""RBS continues to move away from its previous existence as something of a financial basket case, although the journey is far from over. ""There remain three major hurdles to be cleared in the form of settlement of the US legacy issues once and for all, the removal of the UK government stake and the resumption of the dividend.""

UK growth slows sharply in first quarter,"The impact of the 'Beast from the East' weather front was ""relatively small"", the ONS said The UK economy grew at its slowest rate since 2012 in the first quarter of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. GDP growth was 0.1%, down from 0.4% in the previous quarter, driven by a sharp fall in construction output and a sluggish manufacturing sector. The ONS said,externalthe recent extreme weather had a ""relatively small"" impact. The prime minister's spokesman said the data was ""clearly disappointing"" but the economic fundamentals ""are strong"". He said the economy ""has grown every year since 2010 and unemployment is at a 40-year low, but we are not complacent"". The government would continue with a balanced approach, he added. Sterling fell sharply as the chances of an interest rate rise in May receded. Following the news the pound was down almost one and a half cents against the dollar at $1.3775. Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, said: ""Our initial estimate shows the UK economy growing at its slowest pace in more than five years with weaker manufacturing growth, subdued consumer-facing industries and construction output falling significantly. ""While the snow had some impact on the economy, particularly in construction and some areas of retail, its overall effect was limited with the bad weather actually boosting energy supply and online sales."" The figures are a first estimate and are likely to be revised by the ONS as more data becomes available. Many economists had forecast first-quarter growth of 0.3%. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""These are only preliminary figures and are based largely on estimates rather than actual data for March, when the snow was at its worst. So there could be larger than usual revisions."" Construction was the biggest drag on GDP, falling 3.3% over the first three months of the year, while manufacturing growth slowed to 0.2%. Consumer-facing industries, including retail, fell sharply amid an ongoing spending squeeze caused by higher inflation and slow wage growth. Ahmed: Why is economic growth so poor? House building slumps as 'Beast' hits economy Carney: Brexit uncertainty could delay rate rise Year-long wage squeeze nearing an end UK inflation falls to lowest in a year Last week, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, hinted that interest rates could rise more gradually than expected due to continuing uncertainty over Brexit and ""mixed data"" on the economy. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that taken with the latest GDP figures, the chances of a rate rise had now fallen dramatically. ""As recently as last week markets were pricing in a near 90% chance that the Bank of England would raise rates next month... today the market's saying there's just a 25% chance that rates will move in May."" Everybody was all set to blame the Beast from the East, the blast of snow and cold that hit the country last month, for a slowdown in growth. But not only was the slowdown much sharper than thought, but the ONS then very helpfully explained that it was NOT due to the bad weather. Any fall in economic activity as we huddled indoors was mainly replaced by us turning up the heating and shopping online. Now, GDP figures are often revised and there will be some bounce back. But the more worrying factor is that construction is deep in recession, manufacturing's spurt of growth is slowing, and consumer-facing service companies are not as full of the joys of spring as they were. If that trend continues the economy will struggle to rebound, no matter what the weather. Despite the weak figures, some economists suggested the slowdown could prove to be temporary, noting the one-off impact of this winter's weather. Wage growth is also picking up, unemployment is at a four-decade low and inflation fell in March to the lowest rate in a year. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the latest data ""reflects some impact from the exceptional weather that we experienced last month, but our economy is strong and we have made significant progress"". ""Our economy has grown every year since 2010 and is set to keep growing, unemployment is at a 40 year low, and wages are increasing as we build a stronger, fairer economy that works for everyone."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The chancellor will want to blame this all on a bit of bad weather, but the ONS say this had a limited impact. The truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. ""It's clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt.""

Migrant rules 'leaving NHS short of doctors',"This video can not be played 'Shortage of doctors has led to treatment delays' Immigration rules are hampering the ability of the NHS to recruit doctors, health leaders are warning. The number of skilled non-EU workers granted UK visas is capped - with the Home Office arguing the restriction is in ""the national interest"". But NHS bosses say increasing numbers of doctors are being refused permission, worsening rota gaps and the waits patients face for treatment. It comes amid a row after visas for 100 Indian doctors were refused. The doctors had been recruited as part of a long-running scheme in the North West which supplies junior doctors to more than 30 NHS trusts. Bosses at the trusts have written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Amber Rudd asking them to urgently look into the problem. Analysis: 10 charts illustrating NHS woes NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff Jon Rouse, chief officer of the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, which represents services across the region, said he was shocked and concerned by the development. ""As we reach the end of a winter where the NHS has been stretched to its very limits, partly as a result of a lack of medical workforce, we find it almost impossible to understand how this decision can have been reached,"" he said. He said these doctors would have worked across hospital services - and warned rotas would now go unfilled. The NHS is already short of doctors, with a report from the regulator NHS Improvement warning one in 11 posts was vacant.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said he had heard of another 400 cases of blocked visas since December. ""We have examples of clinics being cancelled and delays in terms of patients receiving care. ""It exacerbates pressures in what are relatively small medical teams."" It is unclear exactly why this has happened. There is evidence in the NHS that it is getting harder to recruit and retain EU staff, putting pressure on non-EU sources. The skilled worker cap applies to all sectors so the numbers the NHS can recruit is also influenced by other sectors from IT to banking. Nurses have been placed on the shortage occupation list, which means they are given a priority in international recruitment. A Home Office spokeswoman said the system was in the ""national interest"". She said any Tier 2 applications - as they are known - which are refused in oversubscribed months could reapply in future ones. And she added there were a range of specialities, including A&E and radiology, that were on the shortage occupation list too. The GMC, which assesses the skills of non-EU doctors who want to work in the UK, said hundreds more overseas doctors were applying to them each year but then struggling to get visas. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the GMC, said: ""It is frustrating that while one government department is working hard to recruit doctors into an overstretched health service, another is enforcing eligibility conditions which stifle those efforts.""

"Trump 'likely' to meet Queen in UK visitThe US president will visit London in July, where he will be holding talks with Theresa May.2h2 hours agoUK","This video can not be played Where will the US president go and what might greet him? Donald Trump is likely to meet the Queen when he visits the UK this July, the BBC understands. They will either meet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said. The US president is to visit the UK on Friday, 13 July, after previously cancelling a trip amid claims he would face mass protests. Downing Street called it a ""working visit"" - not the full-blown state visit Mr Trump was promised last year. Mr Trump will hold talks with Prime Minister Theresa May, Downing Street said, with further details to be ""set out in due course"".

More than 33,000 people on Facebook have already said they will attend a protest organised by left-wing journalist Owen Jones. Six Conservative groups - including the think tanks the Bow Group and the Bruges Group - have written to Mr Trump urging him to focus his visit on his ""ancestral home"" of Scotland, where his mother was born. ""A visit to London by the president is likely to draw major protests, crime and disorder, and we do not wish to see Britain or President Trump embarrassed by this,"" Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of the Bow Group, said. ""Many in Britain... wish for President Trump to be afforded the warmest of welcomes,"" he added. ""Sadly that will not be the case in London.""

"House building falls as 'Beast' hits economyThe number of new house starts fell sharply, adding to fears overall growth will be hit by bad weather.10h10 hours agoBusiness","The number of new houses registered to be built in the first three months of the year fell by 14% due to the harsh winter weather, new figures show. Statistics from the National House Building Council (NHBC) revealed the drop - the worse percentage fall in one three month period since 2012. Alongside poor retail figures, many economists now fear that the first quarter GDP growth figure to be published later this morning will be weak. The NHBC said that although the overall trend for new housebuilding over the decade was up, the recent harsh winter weather dragged down the annual number of new builds for 2017-18 by 2%. The annual fall reveals not just the impact of the Beast from the East in February and March but also how tough the government will find hitting its own target of building 300,000 new homes a year. This video can not be played Frozen ground hit the number of new home builds, says the National House Building Council The NHBC - which registers 80% of all new private and affordable homes built in the UK including most social housing - said that 155,000 new homes were registered in 2017-18. That would make the total number of new houses being built in the region of 190,000, more than 100,000 below the government target for England alone. The government insists that when ""conversions"" are included - such as office blocks changed to housing use - the number of new homes built every year is above 200,000. The NHBC said that up to a month of construction time was lost because of snow and ice, which it described as ""exceptional"". ""By far the biggest influence was the Beast from the East, the extreme cold weather that we had,"" said Steve Wood, chief executive of the NHBC. ""That was very disruptive. I was on site and nothing was happening, the ground was frozen and there was a biting wind. ""Builders typically lost something like 30 days production - that has an impact on registrations, what's coming through the pipeline. That is the main reason we saw the slowdown in the first quarter."" But even accounting for the poor weather, Britain's housebuilders are still not building as many houses as before the financial crisis. Mr Wood said that a lack of bricklayers was one of the biggest problems and that new methods of building houses - such as modular units put together in factories before being moved to construction sites - would have to be promoted more rapidly. ""To get to the 300,000 would require something like an additional 25,000 bricklayers,"" he said. ""That's not going to happen so we need to change the way that we build houses and embrace modern methods much more fully."" Although some parts of the UK such as the north east of England and Wales saw the number of houses built over the year rise, the overall figures were dragged down by sharp falls in places like London. Theresa May has said that people were ""right to be angry"" aboutthe lack of affordable homesand the government was pushing reforms in the market around issues like planning to increase the numbers.

Petty side of Korean relations,"Mr Kim and Mr Moon will soon come face-to-face at the inter-Korean summit, the first in a decade North and South Korea are preparing for their first summit in just over a decade. After years of frosty relations and belligerent rhetoric, this is being hailed as a rare and hopeful moment by South Korean politicians. As a peace treaty was never signed after the end of the Korean War in 1953, the neighbours do not have formal relations. The ""Sunshine Policy"" of re-engagement with the North from the late 1990s earned one leader a Nobel Peace prize, but broke down within a decade as South Korean politics changed course and Pyongyang pursued its illegal nuclear ambitions. But over the years both North and South have also engaged in what some might see as miniscule acts of ""petty"" warfare designed to wind the other up but not cause lasting damage, almost reminiscent of some techniques used by the Soviet Union and the US during the Cold War. ""These kinds of displays provide an important competitive outlet between the two sides outside of possible military conflict,"" analyst Ankit Panda told the BBC. ""For both sides, I think what seems petty to us on the outside has important symbolic value and even operational effectiveness. The two countries are dramatically different in their ideologies and see value in exerting the primacy of their system of government."" These are some of the small-time point-scoring both sides have attempted over the years: Both countries have been fighting an aural battle for years. Before August 2015, the loudspeakers had been turned off for a couple of years, under a deal negotiated between both countries. But in 2015, after two South Korean soldiers were severely injured by North Korean-planted mines in the demilitarised zone (DMZ), the South turned its speakers back on. It was halted again in 2015 and re-started in 2016 in response to the North's claim that it tested a hydrogen bomb. What are the Koreas shouting at each other? The North Korean crisis in 300 words But what exactly does South Korea broadcast from its speakers? South and North Korea have turned these loudspeakers on and off at different points in their tumultuous relationship You can expect to hear anything from weather reports, dramas, news from both Koreas that otherwise would not be heard over the border and even K-pop songs. The loudspeakers are typically aimed at border guards, though they can also reach citizens that live near the DMZ border. ""The loudspeakers are left on all night and day and it hurts morale for some North Korea soldiers because some of them can't go to sleep, some are exhausted from hearing it all day,"" said Dr Kim. ""So what North Korea is concerned about is the psychological impact of these broadcasts."" North Korea's broadcasts carry its characteristically strident condemnations of Seoul and its allies, but are said to be harder to hear - possibly the result of poor speakers. But South Korea has now turned off its loudspeakers,just days after North Korea announced that it was stopping all its nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The North appears to have stopped broadcasting propaganda too, residents on the southern side of the demarcation line say. The South has not said whether it plans to restart the broadcasts once the summits are over. During the 1980s, the South Korean government built a 321.5-foot (97m) tall flagpole in its border village of Daesong-dong. North Korea responded by building a 525-foot tall flagpole in its border town of Gijung-dong. The North Korea flag in Gijung-dong can be seen here from the truce village of Panmunjom ""This is a good sign of one of them trying to one-up the other,"" Dr James Kim of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies told the BBC. ""That being said, it might have been very important to the North to build a bigger flagpole but South Korea might not even have really cared."" Both the North and South have had a long history of launching propaganda balloons at each other. In South Korea, defectors, conservatives and religious groups regularly launch these balloons, which can contain anything from leaflets to chocolate biscuits. Both North and South send their own forms of propaganda through these balloons that can travel for miles The balloons can go on to reach thousands of miles, and have been proven to be ""very effective"", according to Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at Human Rights Foundation (HRF) who runs Flash Drives for Freedom, an initiative which sends flash drives in to North Korea. HRF's flash drives contain anything from a selection of films, TV shows, documentaries and everyday footage of life in South Korea. What the North Korean 'leaflet bombs' say S Korean's chocolate propaganda war But the North themselves have also sent their fair share of balloons over to the South. In 2016, hundreds of leaflets praising North Korea were found in Seoul, sent ahead of North Korea's 7th congress of its Workers Party, which was the first of its kind in 36 years. Speculation arose then that Pyongyang may have sent the leaflets as part of its anti-South Korea psychological warfare. But though the leaflets are unlikely to leave a great impact on South Korea, it could be more than just a matter of ""pettiness"" to North Korea. ""I've been in downtown Seoul and seen the propaganda leaflets a few times. It's interesting and novel for [South Koreans] but it isn't construed as something that is threatening to their daily livelihood,"" Dr Kim told the BBC. ""But for the North Koreans these pamphlets are very important. Ideology is very important to them, it's what keeps their regime together... so they might think that this is even more threatening to them than a small-scale military response."" In 2016, North Korea restarted its coded ""numbers"" broadcasting after a break of 16 years - a move which has angered South Korea. Numbers broadcasts, as the name implies, usually comprise a series of numbers read out on air which will only make sense to someone with the decryption key, usually secret agents in a foreign country. These apparent codes were observed in a late-night 12-minute section on Pyongyang Radio Station, a propaganda station aimed at South Korea. Why the sudden resumption after 16 years? The numbers broadcast comes almost immediately after the US and South Korea announced the deployment of a THAAD defensive missile battery in South Korea. It's not clear if the move is a direct act of retaliation, but it's definitely got under the skin of South Korea, who urged the North to ""desist from such practices."" The North and South's current relationship is arguably the closest the two neighbours have got in recent years. But if the thaw does not  turn into a permanent detente, more imaginative point-scoring is little short of certain.

RBS profit jumps as costs fall,"Royal Bank of Scotland has reported a profit of Â£792m for the first three months of the year, up from Â£259m for the same quarter last year. The rise is partly thanks to a fall in restructuring costs, and a drop in conduct and litigation costs. Running costs at the bank, which is 72% state-owned, are also falling as it continues its plan to shrink in size. The quarterly profit follows on fromRBS's first annual profit in 10 years,reported in February. The profit figure was well above estimates. RBS did not set aside any more money to cover costs for payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling claims. The bank still has the threat of a major fine for mis-selling mortgages in the US in the run-up to the credit crisis hanging over it. The fine could come any time this year, and estimates of its size vary wildly, between $1bn-$9bn. The bank has already made provisions for the fine of Â£3bn. Once this is out of the way RBS is expected to return to paying dividends. RBS boss defends branch closures The hotel that RBS took and sold to... RBS Barclays pushed into loss by US payout Lloyds Bank profits jump by 23% The bank's chief executive, Ross McEwan, said: ""This is a good set of results, showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market. Our income is up, costs are down and our capital has strengthened again."" RBS's ""buffer"" of capital - a key measure of any bank's strength - is 16.4%, well above its target of 13% and a level which should mean it can withstand any fine from the US Department of Justice for mortgage mis-selling. RBS has been under the spotlight in recent months over the conduct of its specialist recovery division, the Global Restructuring Group (GRG), which operated between 2005 and 2013. The GRG was marketed as an expert service that could save a business, but according to an official report, it mistreated thousands of small firms. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""RBS continues to move away from its previous existence as something of a financial basket case, although the journey is far from over. ""There remain three major hurdles to be cleared in the form of settlement of the US legacy issues once and for all, the removal of the UK government stake and the resumption of the dividend."" RBS shares were barely changed in early trading, falling by 0.5% to 271p.

"Rail passengers suffer 'misery', say MPs","The government's management of two of the UK's biggest rail franchises has been ""completely inadequate"", a report by MPs claims. The Public Accounts Committee said that a ""catalogue of failures"" by the Department for Transport, Network Rail and Govia Thameslink had caused ""misery"" for passengers. It said UK passengers are paying for a ""broken"" rail franchising model. However, the DfT said the ""imbalanced"" report made ""inaccurate claims"". The inside track on the East Coast mainline Stagecoach East Coast deal to be probed by MPs Govia Thameslink franchise 'not providing value for money' Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""The operation of the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise has been a multi-faceted shambles causing untold misery for passengers. ""Meanwhile, the East Coast franchise has failed for a third time because of wildly inaccurate passenger growth forecasts. She said: ""In both cases the government appears to have seen its task as simply to contract out the service, with wholly inadequate consideration given to passengers' best interests and behaviour."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling The Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern is the government's largest passenger rail franchise, operating trains in the South East. Govia Thameslink began running the franchise in September 2014. Between July 2015 and March 2017, 146,000 trains were cancelled and more were delayed than on any other franchise. Southern services have suffered major disruption over the past two years from strikes called by rail unions including the RMT. In awarding the franchise, the Department for Transport ""overlooked the poor condition of the infrastructure of the rail network"", the Public Accounts Committee said. It was also ""ambivalent about the risk of industrial action and neglected to engage constructively with rail unions"". East Coast woes The committee also criticised the East Coast franchise, which was due to be run by Stagecoach and Virgin Trains until 2023. But in February, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the rail franchise would need new arrangements ""within a very small number of months and no more"" after Stagecoach found it couldn't make payments. The committee said the government had ""failed to learn the lessons from previous failures of the franchise, and has again allowed the operator to promise more than it could deliver"". It added that ""passenger growth forecasts were wildly wrong"" leading to inaccurate forecasts about how much money Virgin Trains East Coast would make. However, the Department for Transport said the Public Accounts Committee had produced ""an imbalanced report that fails to grasp the complexity of the situation"". A DfT spokesman said that Southern disruption had been ""unacceptable... but services have improved dramatically"". He said: ""Our franchising model already puts passengers and taxpayers first and has doubled the number of passengers using trains since privatisation reversed decades of decline and underinvestment under British Rail."" A spokesman for Govia Thameslink said its Southern services were now ""a third more reliable compared to 2016 when the effect of industrial action was at its worst"". Stagecoach and Virgin Trains said in a joint statement: ""We have met or exceeded all of our contractual commitments on the East Coast and have never lost sight of our focus on customers."" They added they were progressing with an Â£140m investment programme. Network Rail said it had increased its involvement with franchise planning. Mark Carne, Network Rail chief executive, said: ""The PAC and I are in agreement that priorities and incentives of Network Rail and franchise operators need to be aligned."" ""We continue to work with government and industry partners to bring track and train together to deliver a better railway for a better Britain,"" Mr Carne added. 160 trains 'miss stops each day' Stagecoach East Coast deal to end early Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

By Jon Sopel, BBC North American editor The White House announcement confirming the date of the president's visit came sooner than Downing Street had anticipated, which means there is still a lot of detail to work out. The centrepiece will be his talks with Theresa May, but most attention is likely to focus on any audience he has with the Queen. I understand they will meet, either at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. She has, after all, met every serving US president during her reign except of Lyndon B Johnson. What will also be fascinating is to see if Mr Trump meets Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. It's also conceivable that he will bolt on an extra day to his trip to visit Turnberry, the championship golf course he owns on the west coast of Scotland. And then there is the likely logistical issue of policing, and how to keep demonstrators at bay. One minister has been quoted as saying Donald Trump won't go anywhere where he can be publicly shouted at. Mr Trump cancelled a planned trip to London to open the new US embassy in Vauxhall earlier this year, complaining the move to an ""off location"" south of the Thames had been a ""bad deal"".

House building falls as 'Beast' hits economy,"The number of new houses registered to be built in the first three months of the year fell by 14% due to the harsh winter weather, new figures show. Statistics from the National House Building Council (NHBC) revealed the drop - the worse percentage fall in one three month period since 2012. Alongside poor retail figures, many economists now fear that the first quarter GDP growth figure to be published later this morning will be weak. The NHBC said that although the overall trend for new housebuilding over the decade was up, the recent harsh winter weather dragged down the annual number of new builds for 2017-18 by 2%. The annual fall reveals not just the impact of the Beast from the East in February and March but also how tough the government will find hitting its own target of building 300,000 new homes a year. This video can not be played Frozen ground hit the number of new home builds, says the National House Building Council The NHBC - which registers 80% of all new private and affordable homes built in the UK including most social housing - said that 155,000 new homes were registered in 2017-18. That would make the total number of new houses being built in the region of 190,000, more than 100,000 below the government target for England alone. The government insists that when ""conversions"" are included - such as office blocks changed to housing use - the number of new homes built every year is above 200,000. The NHBC said that up to a month of construction time was lost because of snow and ice, which it described as ""exceptional"". ""By far the biggest influence was the Beast from the East, the extreme cold weather that we had,"" said Steve Wood, chief executive of the NHBC. ""That was very disruptive. I was on site and nothing was happening, the ground was frozen and there was a biting wind. ""Builders typically lost something like 30 days production - that has an impact on registrations, what's coming through the pipeline. That is the main reason we saw the slowdown in the first quarter."" But even accounting for the poor weather, Britain's housebuilders are still not building as many houses as before the financial crisis. Mr Wood said that a lack of bricklayers was one of the biggest problems and that new methods of building houses - such as modular units put together in factories before being moved to construction sites - would have to be promoted more rapidly. ""To get to the 300,000 would require something like an additional 25,000 bricklayers,"" he said. ""That's not going to happen so we need to change the way that we build houses and embrace modern methods much more fully."" Although some parts of the UK such as the north east of England and Wales saw the number of houses built over the year rise, the overall figures were dragged down by sharp falls in places like London. Theresa May has said that people were ""right to be angry"" aboutthe lack of affordable homesand the government was pushing reforms in the market around issues like planning to increase the numbers.

UK wants online porn ban for young people,"You're soon going to have to prove you're 18 or over if you want to watch porn online. It could mean handing over your email address or even credit card details to verify your age. This is because the government is going to make it a legal requirement for all porn sites to introduce age-verification software. It claims the change in the law is to protect children. But there's confusion as to how it'll be enforced, fears it could threaten users' privacy and doubts as to whether it'll even work. Radio 1 Newsbeat brings you all you need to know: There are lots of different companies developing age-verification software. So there are likely to be a few different ways you'll be asked to prove your age, depending on the site you visit. It could mean entering your phone number, email address, or credit card details. It could also mean going to a shop, handing over ID and collecting a 16-digit code to use on a porn website. MindGeek, the biggest online porn company in the world, has introduced its own age verification service. It owns streaming sites like Pornhub, YouPorn and RedTube, as well as production studios including Brazzers. The company's product AgeID expects to sign up between 20 to 25 million UK users. Although the final details of what its age verification process will be hasn't been announced yet, a spokesperson told Newsbeat: ""AgeID has multiple third parties covering such methods as a Credit Card, mobile SMS, passport and driving licence. ""However, the regulations pertaining to which age verification methods are to be compliant with the law have not yet been published nor made their way through parliament, therefore AgeID will adapt as these come to light."" Depends who you ask. There are some that feel allowing one company to sign up 25m British porn viewers to its sites is an accident waiting to happen. Pandora Blake who sits on the Advisory Council of the Open Rights Group says: ""It's going to be the most hackable list of what people like to look at ever. ""Do you remember theAshley Madisoncase and people killed themselves. I don't think it's outrageous to fear that's what we could be looking at here, an actual loss of life."" In 2016, the names of almost 800,000 registered users of MindGeek's Brazzers site wereexposedin a data breach. But MindGeek's AgeID says it ""will not and cannot store any age verification data"" and that it won't monitor what you watch.

The changes can be traced back to aspeech,externalformer prime minister David Cameron made to the NSPCC in 2013. His aim was to better protect children from adult content online.

""Too many young people and children are coming across porn by accident and that is completely unacceptable,"" says government minister for online safety Margot James. It was supposed to already be in place. The plans were initially announced in July 2017 and the block was due to start in April 2018. Then in March 2018, hidden away in the 18th paragraph of a governmentpress release,externalabout 5G, it was announced that the date had been pushed back until ""the end of the year"". But the government doesn't expect that to be pushed back any further. That is the responsibility of the British Board of Film Classification. The body is currently responsible for setting the age restrictions on the films we watch. It will ask internet service providers and mobile network operators to block websites that don't comply with the new rules. It will do the same with payment service providers like PayPal and Visa and ask them to withdraw services from porn sites where content is sold. Undeniably there are various ways around it. VPN services allow users to virtually relocate to a country with fewer censorship laws around online porn. And there's nothing stopping people under 18 using them. Similarly there's the possibility children will obtain the personal details, or the login of someone over 18 and pass them around. The NSPCC admit it's not a ""silver bullet"", but believe ""it's a very important step"". So this is where there's a big problem for some people. The BBFC does not have the authority to shut down profiles on social media platforms itself. Margot James the government minister for online safety says: ""It's not watertight. We do have issues with some social media platforms. ""We're taking the view that if the main purpose of a social media platform is completely other than pornographic, for the time being we are not going to subject them to the same requirements."" The NSPCC though wants the government to do more to address this issue. It's possible. If profiles on social media are less likely to be shutdown than adult websites, it may encourage more porn performers to advertise their stuff on social networks. ""There are sometimes unintended consequences of legislation, so I wouldn't rule anything out,"" says Margot James. ""But if a platform tried to start making a business out of it then they would find themselves caught up in it."" The NSPCC's Abbie Gillgan says porn on social media platforms is something that needs sorting. ""We're constantly hearing from young people about negative experiences that they're having on social media around pornographic content,"" says Abbie. ""The government need to address that more.""

Trump lawyer documents to be reviewed,"A New York federal judge has appointed an independent official in a criminal inquiry against US President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The so-called special master, an independent court-appointed official, was named as ex-judge Barbara Jones. She will review documents seized from Mr Cohen by the FBI to determine if they include confidential communications with his legal clients. It comes as Mr Trump distanced himself from his long-time lawyer. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Trump told Fox News his lawyer was ""a good guy"" but only one among his ""many, many attorneys"". Who is Michael Cohen? Why the raid on Trump's lawyer is a big deal ""I don't know his business, but this doesn't have to do with me. He's got a business. He also practises law. I would say probably the big thing is his business. And they're looking at something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with with his business,"" Mr Trump said. This video can not be played An agitated President Trump sounds off He did, however, confirm that Mr Cohen represented him in the ""crazy Stormy Daniels deal"", referring to an adult film actress who alleges she had a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in 2006. Mr Trump has denied having sex with Ms Daniels or any knowledge of the $130,000 (Â£92,000) payment to her by Mr Cohen during the 2016 presidential campaign. Ms Daniels accepted the sum in return for signing a non-disclosure agreement. This video can not be played Non-disclosure agreements have been in the news a lot - but what exactly are they? Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is suing the president and Mr Cohen to invalidate the non-disclosure agreement, claiming it was void because the president did not personally sign it. Mr Cohen said he will invoke his constitutional right to remain silent in the civil case, arguing it could affect the criminal inquiry into his business affairs. The US justice department announced earlier this month it was investigating Mr Cohen's business dealings, rather than his work as a lawyer, following a raid on his home and office. The 9 April raid on Mr Cohen followed a tip-off by the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Stormy Daniels says she was paid by Michael Cohen to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with Mr Trump Russia denies interfering in the election and Mr Trump has denied any collusion. It was unclear if any of those seized documents include material relating to Mr Trump's business dealings. Legal analysts have said that Mr Cohen's $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels could have violated the rules on financing Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. US District Judge Kimba Wood ruled on Thursday that Ms Jones would be the first to review the material, before handing over documents prosecutors could use in their case. Prosecutors had initially said the documents should be reviewed by a separate team of lawyers in their office while Mr Cohen's lawyers argued they should have the first look, citing some of the material could violate attorney-client privilege. The president and the porn star: Why this matters Judge Wood said Ms Jones could meet lawyers as soon as next week, but added she would intervene if the process took too long. ""If at any point it turns out that the special master process is going too slowly, I will revisit it,"" she said. Ms Jones served as a federal judge for 16 years in the Southern District of New York and is a former organised-crime prosecutor. She was appointed in 2016 as the independent review officer for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in a corruption case at the labour union.

Learning to love school in a foreign landVideoVideoThe community trying to unite rich and poorRole play your way through a gun control conversation,"This video can not be played Syrian children learn Turkish so they can join classes with their Turkish peers With millions of Syrians spilling into Turkey as they flee the conflict tearing their homeland apart, schools are at the frontline of the battle to integrate the newcomers into society. On a crisp spring morning in Gaziantep, the playground of Sehit Karayilan school is abuzz with cheers as eight-year-olds face off in a football tournament. Boys compete with passion on the pitch while girls celebrate the goals with songs and laughter. The south-eastern city is only 70km (43 miles) from Syria and almost half the 1,650 students at the school are Syrian. But you wouldn't know it from watching them. They all speak in Turkish. ""I really like this school. I read, learn and I have many Turkish friends. They're great,"" says 10-year-old Eye Kenco in near-perfect Turkish. The Syrian girl says she'd like to stay in Turkey. ""I don't have friends in Syria. It's like home here."" Some 1,650 pupils attend Sehit Karayilan primary school - nearly half of them Syrian Some 3.5 million Syrian refugees have poured into Turkey since the conflict began in 2011. Until recently, many of them preferred makeshift Syrian-only schools with lessons conducted in Arabic. But the government now prioritises integrating Syrian children into Turkish schools, like Sehit Karayilan primary. It is one of thousands that are part of a new project called Promoting Integration of Syrian Children into the Turkish Education System (PICTES), costing 300m euros ($365m) and funded by the EU. Under the model, Syrian children are taught Turkish so they feel able to attend other mixed classes with their Turkish peers. Muhammed Ali Cinar, 25, is one of 5,500 specially trained teachers involved in the scheme. He is clearly popular with students, who run across the playground to hug him. Muhammed Ali Cinar: One of 5,500 specially trained teachers involved in the integration scheme In the classroom, pictures of Turkish and Syrian flags, painted by the children, decorate the walls. But it has not been easy for the youngsters to adjust, says Cinar.  ""The first time I entered the classroom, it was as if I wasn't there. They totally ignored me."" So he employed different tactics. The day the BBC visited, his class was holding a mock song contest in the style of The Voice, with the entire programme played out in Turkish. ""I let them pick the songs and they all chose Turkish tunes,"" says Cinar in surprise. In return, he takes part wearing traditional Arabic costume with a song in Arabic, prompting enthusiastic cheers from his students. Helping Syrian children psychologically is one of the main aims of PICTES. Some 500 counsellors have been deployed to the schools for this purpose. ""The Syrian kids cried if the door was shut too loudly,"" Cinar recalls. ""Once, when they saw the smoke from an aeroplane that passed overhead, they all said 'is that an airstrike or a terror attack?' ""One of my students used to cut himself, fight with his classmates and smoke. He hated Turks,"" Cinar remembers. It took months of effort to get him to co-operate. Cinar says they are now like brothers: ""He says that he loves me the most after [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad."" When Syrian refugees first started coming to Turkey, President Erdogan called them 'guests' - the expectation being that they would stay temporarily. Since then some 300,000 Syrian children have been born in Turkey and it is widely believed many will remain. When asked if the PICTES project is an acknowledgement of this, Cengiz Mete from the education ministry says the goal is to invest in children while they are here. ""If Syrians are going to stay here until the war is over, they have to be in harmony with the society they live inâ¦ We're doing these projects not because we think they will stay but to help them after they return."" Since the project started in November 2016, the number of Syrian children enrolled in Turkish schools has doubled to 344,156 - or about a third of all school-age Syrians in Turkey. The goal is for all of them to join official schools. The education ministry says it will take another three to four years for the project to be sustainable and to get all Syrian children into Turkish schools. They are now in talks to extend EU funding beyond October 2018. The need for greater assimilation of Syrians is clear. An International Crisis Group report says the incidents of violence between Turks and Syrians increased threefold in 2017. At least 35 people died in these incidents. Syrian communities in Turkey tend to cluster together. In some areas in Gaziantep, women are seen in black veils and only Arabic is spoken. The school project is therefore also about integrating these families into Turkish society. ""I've met Turkish and Syrian families who lived in the same building for six years without talking to each other,"" Cinar says. ""Unless they integrate, the Syrian community will become like a ghetto."" He makes a point of visiting his students' homes and takes the family of a Turkish classmate with him each time. That's allowed friendships to flourish outside school, like that of Arif Ince and his twin Syrian classmates Omer and Ali Daba. ""I have both Turkish and Syrian friends,"" says 10-year-old Arif, playing toy darts with the twins at their home. ""There's no difference between us"". Home visits involving Syrians and Turks mean friendships can develop outside school His mother, Ceylan, sips tea with the brothers' parents, communicating with gestures and a few Turkish phrases. She recalls other parents' concerns about the mixed school: ""There was suspicion and prejudice. They said if we were in that situation, Syrians wouldn't help us. They were worried about having too many kids in the classrooms, they said the teachers would focus on the Syrian kids and ignore ours."" Perceptions have changed with time, she adds. But not everyone is happy about the Syrian children's presence in Turkish schools. A bus driver who takes Turkish and Syrian pupils to school thinks they are not grateful enough. ""Most Syrian children are older than their Turkish classmates. They beat our kids. I see it in the bus every day. Instead, they should be grateful they are allowed in the school,"" he says. He is not alone. Many in Turkish society think Syrian refugees have overstayed their welcome. Some, including politicians, argue that Syrian men should return to their country to fight.

Passenger lists reveal Windrush lives,"The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948 carrying hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean hoping for a new life in Britain - alongside hundreds from elsewhere. Who were they? June 2020: To mark this year's Windrush Day, on 22 June, we have retrieved this article from our archives. The former passenger liner's journey up the Thames on that misty June day is now regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration between 1948 and 1971 known as the ""Windrush generation"". Many were enticed to cross the Atlantic by job opportunities amid the UK's post-war labour shortage. But, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it emerged last year that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation, denied access to NHS treatment, benefits and pensions and stripped of their jobs.The UK government was forced to apologise and offered compensationfor anyone who had ""suffered loss"". The ship - which dropped anchor on 21 June and released its travellers a day later - was carrying 1,027 passengers, including two stowaways, according to BBC analysisof the ship's records kept by the National Archives.,external Alongside those travelling from the Caribbean for work, there were also Polish nationals displaced by World War Two, members of the RAF and people from Britain. Passenger Lucile Harris, who settled in Britain from the Caribbean, recalled her arrival in Tilbury in aninterview with the BBC in 1998to mark the 50th anniversary of the Windrush sailing. ""It was a lovely day, beautiful, and they [family] were all at the dock waiting for me... I was very excited."" According to the ship's passenger lists, more than half of the 1,027 listed official passengers on board (539) gave their last country of residence as Jamaica, while 139 said Bermuda and 119 stated England. There were also people from Mexico, Scotland, Gibraltar, Burma and Wales. According to Nicholas Boston of the City University of New York, those who gave Mexico as their last country of residence were agroup of Polish refugees,external- mainly women and children - who had been offered permanent residence in Britain. Who are the Windrush generation? Advice for the Windrush generation on what to do next How do you prove you've been living in the UK? Overall, 802 passengers gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean. Many of them had paid Â£28 (about Â£1,000 today) to travel to Britain in response to job adverts in local newspapers. Among them wereJohn Hazel, 21, a boxer, Harold Wilmot, 32, a case maker and John Richards, 22, a carpenter,seen here in a photograph taken on arrival - alongside their records from the National Archives passenger list. Mr Richards,interviewed by the BBC in 1998, was, like many others, shocked to discover the difference between the ""mother country"" he had seen in books and the reality he was confronted with. ""I know a lot about Britain from school days but it was a different picture from that one, when you came face to face with the facts. It was two different things,"" he said. ""They tell you it is the 'mother country', you're all welcome, you all British. When you come here you realise you're a foreigner and that's all there is to it."" According to the ship's records, most of the Windrush's passengers got on in Jamaica, but others also joined the vessel in Trinidad, Tampico and Bermuda. As many of the eyewitness accounts have stated since, the majority of the people on board were men. There were 684 males over the age of 12, alongside 257 females of the same age. There were also 86 children aged 12 and under. The listed occupations on the passenger lists give some indication of the wide range of skills that were on offer. Among those arriving from the Caribbean were mechanics, carpenters, tailors, engineers, welders and musicians. According to the RAF,dozens of the Caribbean passengers were also RAF airmen,externalreturning from leave or veterans re-joining the service. A future Mayor of Southwark,Sam King, who had served in England with the wartime RAF, was among them. Also among the Caribbean passengers was a hatter, a retired judge, a potter, a barrister, two hairdressers, two actresses, two piano repairers, two missionaries, three boxers, five artists and six painters. The most noted occupation, though, was ""HD"" - or ""housing domestic"" - meaning a housewife, servant or cleaner. There were 172 overall on board - 96 from the Caribbean. Among the boxing hopefuls on board wereCharles Smith, 21, a welder and boxer, Vernon ""Boy"" Solas, 18, mechanic and boxer, and boxing manager Mortimer Martin, 31, who was also a welder,captured in this photograph on arrival. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular destination recorded by passengers from the Caribbean was London - 296 people gave the city as their planned place of residence. Interestingly, 109 passengers didn't give any address, perhaps indicating they had no fixed plan on arrival. A number of other passengers planned to go to Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Plymouth. Those that had nowhere to stay were temporarily housed in a former air raid shelter at Clapham South underground station. Newspaper reports from the time state how those at the shelter went on to find jobs through the nearest Labour Exchanges (Job Centres), one of which was in Coldharbour Lane, Brixton. Many then moved into rented houses and rooms in the Brixton and Clapham areas, working for employers such as the National Health Service or London Transport. From here, large Caribbean communities developed, contributing to the political, social and musical life of Britain ever since. The ship - full name HMT Empire Windrush - was originally a German passenger liner given to the UK as war reparation in 1945. First called Monte Rosa, it was converted to a troopship and renamed HMT Empire Windrush in 1947. This video can not be played What was life like on-board the Windrush? Oswald ""Columbus"" Denniston, who was the first of the Windrush passengers to get a job according to the Daily Express at the time,told the BBC in 1998 that the atmosphere on the ship was ""jolly"".,external ""We had two or three bands - calypso singers. And Jamaican people are happy-go-lucky people. When you have more than six you have a party."" On leaving the ship on 22 June, the then 35-year-old began work the same day handing out rations at the shelter in Clapham where the Windrush passengers were staying. Mr Denniston, who died in 2000 aged 86, went on to settle in Brixton, where he worked as a street trader. ""Many of us thought we would come here to get a better education and to stay for about five years,"" he said. ""But then some of us have ended staying for 50."" As for the ship itself, it made its final voyage in 1954, catching fire and sinking in the Mediterranean Sea with the loss of four members of crew. All of its passengers were saved.

"Sinclair computer designer diesRick Dickinson, who drew up designs for Sinclair computers in the early 1980s, has died in the US.9h9 hours agoTechnology","Rick Dickinson, the designer of Sinclair computers, has died in the US while receiving treatment for cancer. The British designer, thought to be in his 60s, worked in-house for Sinclair Research and oversaw the creation of its home computers in the 1980s. He was responsible for the boxy look of the ZX80 and ZX81 and the Bauhaus-inspired appearance of the Spectrum. Mr Dickinson also helped to develop the technologies for the UK company's touch-sensitive and rubber keyboards. He was recently linked to a crowd-funded project by Retro Computers to turn the Spectrum into a handheld computer. Some of the early reference designs for the machine were drawn up by him. In an interview with the BBCin 2012, Mr Dickinson said the development of the keyboards had been driven by a desire to cut costs. The touch-sensitive mats used in the Sinclair machines were much cheaper and simpler than traditional keyboards made of hundreds of components. In the interview, he said he had had doubts that the first machines would be successful but the company had been ""overwhelmed"" by interest and demand once they had launched. The boxy look of the ZX81 helped to cut the cost of producing the machine He said the machines had ""spawned a generation"" of coders that had helped to establish the UK's reputation as a creative, game-making powerhouse. He added: ""Sinclair products were born out of staggering innovation and clever shortcuts to get things into ever smaller packages at lower costs."" The drawing board on which Mr Dickinson designed the Spectrum is now in the Science Museum. A graduate in industrial design from Newcastle Polytechnic, he joined Sinclair in 1979. After leaving the company, Mr Dickinson set up an industrial design consultancy Dickinson Associates. Through the Cambridgeshire-based firm, he was involved with the design of the first Amstrad portable computers, early mobile phones and game consoles. The first news of Mr Dickinson's death came via an email sent by his wife, Elizabeth, to family and friends, asking that it be sent on to all those might want to know of his passing. A spokesman at Dickinson Associates confirmed he had died earlier this week. The email said Mr Dickinson had been diagnosed with cancer in 2015, for which he had received successful treatment. However, it said, the cancer had returned last year. Mr Dickinson had then travelled to the US for specialist care but had died suddenly between bouts of treatment.

Amazon's sales surge and profits doubleThe online retailer beat expectations with a 43% rise in revenues during the first quarter.3h3 hours agoBusiness,"Amazon has reported a 43% surge in revenues for the first quarter, fuelled by online shopping in the US. The internet retail giant said sales rose to $51bn (Â£36.6bn) in the three months to March, surpassing analysts' forecasts. Amazon also said that its profit more than doubled, sending its share price to a new high in after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It added that it expects profit and revenue to grow in the second quarter. Over the three months to March, Amazon's net profit rose to $1.6bn from $724m in the same period last year. Amazon was founded and is led by Jeff Bezos who, according to Forbes magazine, is now the richest man in the world and owns The Washington Post newspaper. The company has recently been targeted byUS President Donald Trump, who claims Amazon does not pay enough tax. He has also claimed it is ripping off the US Postal Service which, he alleges, loses an average $1.50 for each package it delivers for Amazon. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, according to Forbes Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Reuters that success is ""the best revenge that Bezos can get against the administration for its veiled threats about sales taxes and not paying its fair share"". Amazon reported that sales from its North American business rose to $30.7bn compared to $20.9bn in the first quarter last year. Its profit also leapt to $1.1bn from $596m previously.

"Sinclair computer designer diesRick Dickinson, who drew up designs for Sinclair computers in the early 1980s, has died in the US.","Rick Dickinson, the designer of Sinclair computers, has died in the US while receiving treatment for cancer. The British designer, thought to be in his 60s, worked in-house for Sinclair Research and oversaw the creation of its home computers in the 1980s. He was responsible for the boxy look of the ZX80 and ZX81 and the Bauhaus-inspired appearance of the Spectrum. Mr Dickinson also helped to develop the technologies for the UK company's touch-sensitive and rubber keyboards. He was recently linked to a crowd-funded project by Retro Computers to turn the Spectrum into a handheld computer. Some of the early reference designs for the machine were drawn up by him. In an interview with the BBCin 2012, Mr Dickinson said the development of the keyboards had been driven by a desire to cut costs. The touch-sensitive mats used in the Sinclair machines were much cheaper and simpler than traditional keyboards made of hundreds of components. In the interview, he said he had had doubts that the first machines would be successful but the company had been ""overwhelmed"" by interest and demand once they had launched. The boxy look of the ZX81 helped to cut the cost of producing the machine He said the machines had ""spawned a generation"" of coders that had helped to establish the UK's reputation as a creative, game-making powerhouse. He added: ""Sinclair products were born out of staggering innovation and clever shortcuts to get things into ever smaller packages at lower costs."" The drawing board on which Mr Dickinson designed the Spectrum is now in the Science Museum. A graduate in industrial design from Newcastle Polytechnic, he joined Sinclair in 1979. After leaving the company, Mr Dickinson set up an industrial design consultancy Dickinson Associates. Through the Cambridgeshire-based firm, he was involved with the design of the first Amstrad portable computers, early mobile phones and game consoles. The first news of Mr Dickinson's death came via an email sent by his wife, Elizabeth, to family and friends, asking that it be sent on to all those might want to know of his passing. A spokesman at Dickinson Associates confirmed he had died earlier this week. The email said Mr Dickinson had been diagnosed with cancer in 2015, for which he had received successful treatment. However, it said, the cancer had returned last year. Mr Dickinson had then travelled to the US for specialist care but had died suddenly between bouts of treatment.
