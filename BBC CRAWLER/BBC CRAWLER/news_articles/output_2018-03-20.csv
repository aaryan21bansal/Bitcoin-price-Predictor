Russian diplomats leave amid spy row,"The former diplomatic staff and their families flew out from Stansted Airport Russian diplomats and their families have left the UK in an expulsion following the Salisbury spy attack. Diplomatic vehicles drove them from the embassy in London to Stansted Airport, where they boarded a plane to Moscow. The UK expelled 23 diplomats after Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was ""culpable"" for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter. The government decided on Tuesday not to impose further sanctions on Russia for now. However, at a meeting of the National Security Council, Mrs May said: ""There are other measures that government and security officials are actively considering and stand ready to deploy at any time."" Strict checks by border officials on private flights have been introduced as the UK increases efforts to monitor and track those entering the country, Mrs May's spokesman added. What happens when you expel a diplomat? Russia stockpiling nerve agent - Johnson Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Spy poisoning: What we know so far Moscow has denied all involvement, and is expelling 23 British diplomats in response. The UK diplomats have until Saturday to leave Russia. The Kremlin is also closing down both the British Council in Russia, which promotes cultural ties between the nations, and the consulate in St Petersburg. The Russian foreign ministry, meanwhile, has invited all foreign ambassadors in Moscow to a meeting on Wednesday to clarify the Russian position on the Skripal affair, the Russian news agency Interfax has reported. The Russian Embassy in London said around 80 people - including the Russian intelligence officers and their families - were due to leave the UK on Tuesday, the deadline given by Mrs May. A small crowd gathered outside the embassy and waved goodbye to people carrying suitcases, children and pets as they boarded vehicles. Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenkotweeted:,external""Today we bid farewell to our colleagues heading home after the hostile move of the UK Government, and wish them all the best in their careers."" Around Russian 80 nationals were aboard the plane heading for Moscow The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said launching further measures ""risks an endless tit for tat with the Kremlin"". But ""not to do so risks accusations of weakness from some quarters,"" he added. Meanwhile, drivers or cyclists who captured video footage near the home of a murdered Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov on 11 March or 12 March arebeing asked to contact police.,external Mr Glushkov wasfound dead from apparent ""compression to his neck""at his home in New Malden, south-west London last week. Russianformer military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal,66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench and unconscious on 4 March. They had been exposed to a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, the UK government claims. More than two weeks on from the attack, the head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, said the focus of the Salisbury investigation is ""on the movements of the Skripals"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Officers are trawling through 4,000 hours of CCTV footage and have already taken 400 statements with more to come. ""It is going to take weeks, possibly months,"" Mr Basu told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: ""This is going to be frustrating for people."" Meanwhile, following a phone call between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mrs May, Downing Street said Japan condemned the Salisbury attack and ""shared our outrage"". The leaders of France, Germany and the US have already pledged support for the UK in a joint statement and the EU offered its ""unqualified solidarity"". EU leaders will meet at a summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss any potential response to Russia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbynsaid the UK must still deal with Russia despite ""all fingers"" pointing to itover the Salisbury spy attack. He said he would ""do business"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin but assertively and on the basis of the UK's values. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsonpreviously said it is ""overwhelmingly likely"" that President Putin ordered the nerve agent attack.Russia said the accusations were ""shocking and unforgivable"". Mr Skripal, a retired military intelligence colonel, came to the UK in 2010 after being released from prison in Russia. He had been jailed in Moscow in 2006 for spying for Britain and passing the identities of Russian secret agents in Europe to MI6, the UK's Secret Intelligence Service. His daughter, Yulia, flew into the UK from Russia on 3 March, the day before she and Mr Skripal were found on a bench near The Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

NHS pay deal set to be signed off,"Put your money where your mouth is? Well, I'm told that when it comes to the NHS, ministers plan to do that with taxpayers' money, with a pay deal for NHS staff in England that could mean more than Â£4bn over the next three years. More than a million staff, including nurses, porters and paramedics, could expect average increases of about 6%, after years of a tight spending settlement. The idea is that the lowest paid will get the biggest hikes, with those on the lowest wages receiving the most significant rises, for example a porter's salary could rise from Â£15,000 to Â£19,000. And contrary to recent suggestions, the unions and the government won't force staff to give up a day's holiday in return for bigger pay rises. But insiders say that the deal, to be signed off at lunchtime, does include an agreement for staff and the Department of Health to look for ways of reducing rates of sickness in the NHS and changes to automatic pay rises, so called increments. If the deal is formally announced, as expected, a consultation with staff will follow. But I'm told the biggest health unions, Unison and the Royal College of Nursing, are poised to back the agreement after months of negotiations with multiple unions, the government and NHS Employers. Potentially, if the 'I's' are dotted and the 'T's crossed, NHS staff could look forward to pay increases as early as July. The government indicated some time ago that the pay cap, which had been one of the main restrictions that held back public spending, was over. But this deal could pave the way for expensive, even if overdue, pay deals for other parts of the public sector. Crucially, sources say the deal will be fully funded by the Treasury, rather than coming out of existing NHS budgets. The precise detail of what ministers say later will therefore be vital. But the move is likely to add to the growing sense,including in Tory party, that somehow, more cash for the health service needs to be found.

BBC host 'betrayed' over cancer sick pay,"This video can not be played Radio 4's Kirsty Lang told her story to a committee of MPs A BBC radio presenter has told how she worked through cancer treatment because she wasn't eligible for sick pay after being taken off a staff contract. Kirsty Lang, who co-hosts BBC Radio 4's Front Row, has given evidence to a committee of MPs about how the BBC set up presenters' tax arrangements. Many say the BBC forced them into going freelance instead of being staff, so they didn't get benefits like sick pay. Lang told the committee she had been ""hung out to dry"" and ""betrayed"". She was one of four broadcasters who spoke to MPs on Tuesday. They said the BBC put pressure on presenters to be employed via a personal service company (PSC). Some are being investigated by HM Revenue & Customs and facing huge bills for unpaid tax. Lang was originally on a staff contract - but said that when she asked to go part-time after her son started having problems at school in 2013, she was told she could only do so if she went freelance. She said she ""didn't really feel like I had a choice because of my family situation"", and the arrangement was not a way for her to avoid paying tax. ""In fact, I was quite frightened,"" she told the House of Commons culture select committee. ""I was frightened of getting sick and I was worried about the pension... ""Then, sure enough, all my worst fears came true. Not long after I went freelance, my stepdaughter died suddenly, and I was unable to take bereavement leave. ""In fact, I went back and did the first show even before her funeral because I had to get some money in. Then, two years after that, I was diagnosed with cancer. ""I had surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy. I worked the whole way through. I took one month off at the end of chemo, actually."" Liz Kershaw hosts a Saturday show on BBC 6 Music She said that about a year ago, she was told she would have to be paid via PAYE for tax purposes - but was told she still would not get sick pay or holiday pay, and was still without a contract. ""None of us take pleasure in being here,"" she added. ""I would rather have sorted this out with the BBC. I entered in to this in good faith. I trusted the BBC, I'm proud to be part of the BBC and I feel I've been hung out to dry, I feel betrayed. ""I ask this - where is their duty of care towards me and my colleagues, because I speak for many, many people in this situation. ""I have seen many women presenters being deprived of maternity leave. I have seen many colleagues deprived of sick pay. And we keep on doing it because we love the job."" Lang was joined on the panel by 6 Music's Liz Kershaw, Radio 4 Money Box's Paul Lewis and Stuart Linnell from Radio Northampton. Lewis told the MPs the BBC had saved around Â£10m per year on National Insurance payments by paying presenters through personal companies. The committee's chairman Damian Collins MP said the BBC had fallen ""well below"" the standards expected in its treatment of staff and said he would demand answers from director general Lord Hall. He also said he was ""disappointed"" that no-one from BBC management had appeared in front of the committee. In a statement, the BBC said it recognised there were ""issues to address"" and had ""always tried to balance our responsibilities to presenters with our responsibility to spend the licence fee appropriately"". Samira Ahmed gave written evidence saying she felt ""hugely bullied"" The corporation has now announced an independent dispute resolution process. It could lead to the BBC paying a share of historical bills, which in some cases run into thousands of pounds. Other presenters gave their stories to the committee in written evidence. They included an unnamed female BBC local radio presenter who said she tried to kill herself, partly because of the stress over her employment arrangements. She told the committee she was ""forced"" to set up a PSC in 2011 - even though she lost out financially as a result. She said she was later forced to work on three-month contracts with ""no sick pay, no holiday, no permanent contract"" opposite a better-paid male staff member who had such benefits. ""I have been paid too little due to the use of incorrect tax codes, been subject to clawback, received no information for months on end as to what I was going to live off,"" she said. ""My mental health deterioration is absolutely linked to the increased stress of working for the BBC. ""I have always loved working for the BBC but the way they have behaved has reduced me to more than tears. It's one of the factors that three days ago took me into my loft where I tried to hang myself."" Another unnamed presenter said: ""My physical and mental health has suffered and the quality of life with my young family has been impacted. In the darkest of days and the spectre of retrospective action from HMRC hanging over me daily, I contemplated taking my own life."" TV and radio presenter Samira Ahmed also gave evidence ahead of the hearing, saying she felt ""hugely bullied"" over her employment status. Mr Collins said the accounts were ""highly disturbing"". He said: ""By allegedly being coerced into these contracts, these individuals may have been denied employment rights, and some face liability for huge tax bills. ""This evidence indicates that the BBC is falling well below the standards we would expect in terms of how it treats its staff."" Presenters will now be able to ask for a review of their cases through the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution. The process will consider whether it is ""appropriate or reasonable"" for the BBC to make a contribution towards historic demands for employers' National Insurance.

Hawking's ashes to be interred at abbey,"The professor was a fellow at Gonville and Caius College for more than 50 years The ashes of Professor Stephen Hawking will be interred next to the grave of Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey, it has been revealed. The renowned theoretical physicist's final resting place will also be near that of Charles Darwin, who was buried there in 1882. Prof Hawking, who had motor neurone disease,died on 14 March, aged 76, at his home in Cambridge. The Dean of Westminster said the location was ""entirely fitting"". A private funeral service will take place at Great St Mary's, the University Church on 31 March, Prof Hawking's family said. The church is close to Gonville and Caius College, where Prof Hawking had been a fellow for more than 50 years. Prof Hawking's ashes will be interred at Westminster Abbey later this year The flag flew at half mast on Prof Hawking's college, Gonville and Caius, on the day his death was announced The thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey will take place later in the year. Announcing funeral arrangements on the college website, Prof Hawking's children Lucy, Robert and Tim said: ""Our father lived and worked in Cambridge for over 50 years. ""He was an integral and highly recognisable part of the university and the city. ""For this reason, we have decided to hold his funeral in the city that he loved so much and which loved him. Our father's life and work meant many things to many people, both religious and non-religious. So, the service will be both inclusive and traditional, reflecting the breadth and diversity of his life."" Obituary: Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking: A life in pictures Cambridge remembers Stephen Hawking China's love for the late Stephen Hawking The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, said: ""It is entirely fitting that the remains of Professor Stephen Hawking are to be buried in the Abbey, near those of distinguished fellow scientists. ""Sir Isaac Newton was buried in the Abbey in 1727. Charles Darwin was buried beside Isaac Newton in 1882.""

Irish call over 'Hooded Men' case rejected,"This video can not be played Francie McGuigan, one of the hooded men, said there was 'no weakness in our determination' A request to find that men detained during internment in Northern Ireland suffered ""torture"" has been rejected by the European Court of Human Rights. A group known as the hooded men claimed they were subjected to torture by the Army in 1971. Their lawyers have called on the Irish government to appeal the latest ruling. In 1978, the European Court of Human Rights held that the UK had carried out inhuman and degrading treatment, but fell short of defining this as torture. Allow Twitter content?

In 2014, the Irish government said it would ask the European Court to revise the 1978 judgement. TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said the ECHR's decision would be ""fully considered by the government"". He said Tuesday's judgement did not alter the court's original ruling in 1978 that the men ""suffered inhuman and degrading treatment"". ""I am due to meet the men in the coming weeks and look forward to hearing their views,"" he added. The 14 hooded men alleged they were subjected to torture sanctioned by the state. They said they were forced to listen to constant loud static noise; deprived of sleep, food and water; forced to stand in a stress position and beaten if they fell. The men also said they were hooded and thrown to the ground from helicopters - despite being at near ground level, they had been told they were hundreds of feet in the air. Francie McGuigan, one of the hooded men, said they were ""far, far, far from giving up"". The so-called hooded men have claimed they were tortured by the Army in 1971 ""While any one of us have breath left in our bodies we will fight it and we will keep on fighting it. ""With the exception of two, the rest of us are now over 70 and I don't see a weakness in our determination yet. ""At this stage, the European Court has missed a great opportunity to try to stamp out torture, be it here in Ireland or any corner of the world."" by Vincent Kearney, Home Affairs Correspondent This ruling will be greeted with sighs of relief in the corridors of power at Whitehall and much further afield. A number of other countries, including the USA and Israel, have relied on the European Court's 1978 judgement to defend interrogation techniques used by their security forces. A decision to revise that judgement and find that the five techniques used on the hooded men constituted torture could have had huge repercussions. It would have left the British government and others facing potentially huge claims for damages. He added: ""I think there's a strong onus on the Irish government to take this appeal and push it for all it's worth."" Another one of the hooded men, Jim Auld, told BBC Talkback that he was ""angry and frustrated"" with the ECHR's decision. ""It's important for people to understand that none of us had any self gain out of this, we embarked on this programme to try and create the conditions where no government could torture their citizens."" Darragh Mackin, a solicitor who represents some of the hooded men, said: ""In circumstances where the Belfast High Court, the London Supreme Court has ruled that these techniques are torture, it is difficult to comprehend how the European Court has missed this opportunity. The ECHR found that it had not been demonstrated that there was new evidence that would have a ""decisive influence on the original judgement"" ""It is deeply regretful that we are left with only the consideration that it is procedural gymnastics that have allowed for this ruling to continue and for this grave injustice that the hooded men suffer and continue to suffer."" The five techniques the men were subjected to were later banned by the prime minister at the time, Edward Heath. The ECHR found: ""The Government of Ireland had not demonstrated the existence of facts that were unknown to the court at the time or which would have had a decisive influence on the original judgment,external. ""There was therefore no justification to revise the judgment."" The revision request was dismissed by six votes to one with only the judge elected in respect of Ireland issuing a dissenting opinion.

The Irish government had said new facts had emerged in a television documentary aired in June 2014. It had subsequently submitted that a psychiatrist, Dr L., who had been heard as an expert for the UK in the original proceedings had misled the court by saying the effects of the ill-treatment were short-lived. In fact, it was alleged, he had known that the use of the five techniques had long-lasting and severe effects. The Irish government also referred to other documents released from archives which it said showed that the UK Government had tried to prevent the ECHR from accessing the full truth about the five techniques. Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner used the Special Powers Act to introduce internment without trial for those suspected of being involved in violence on 9 August 1971. During the first morning of Operation Demetrius, 342 people were arrested. More than 100 were released two days later as it became increasingly clear that the RUC's intelligence, based on records more than a decade old, was arguably useless. Most of the new IRA leadership had escaped army raids by hiding in safe houses or heading south of the border. Internment stayed in place and by the eve of direct rule from London in 1972, the internees numbered 924. Surviving members of the group launched a bid for a judicial review against a PSNI decision in 2014 that there was not enough evidence to warrant an investigation into their treatment.

As well as seeking a judicial review of that decision, the legal bid also challenged decisions by the chief constable, Department of Justice and Northern Ireland Office as ""constituting a continuing failure"" to order a full and independent investigation.

Trump congratulates Putin over election,"This video can not be played Trump congratulates Putin and will meet him ""in the not too distant future"" US President Donald Trump has spoken to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to congratulate him on his electoral victory two days ago. He said they would meet in the ""not too distant future"" to discuss limiting a growing arms race, Ukraine and Syria. Mr Putin was re-elected by a landslide, with more than 76% of the vote, for a fourth six-year term. But there was no strong challenger, with the main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, barred from the race. European observers said that while the poll was conducted efficiently, there was a lack of genuine choice,external. Putin basks in election he could not lose Google's most popular Putin search queries answered 'Better than Trump': What young Russians think of Putin Mr Trump said the arms race between the US and Russia was ""getting out of control... but we will never allow anybody to have anything close to what we have"". According to the Washington Post, citing officials it said were familiar with the matter,the call was made despite warnings from Mr Trump's national security advisers,external, who provided a briefing which included a section that read ""DO NOT CONGRATULATE"". During the call, Mr Trump did not mention the issue that has sparked growing Western tensions with Moscow - the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Britain. The UK government blamed the nerve agent attack on Russia, which denies any involvement. The Kremlin said the conversation between the US and Russian presidents was ""constructive and business-like"", adding that Russia hoped to ""overcome problems"" that had arisen between the two nations. Mr Putin was re-elected by a landslide, with more than 76% of the vote USSenator John McCain criticised Mr Trump over the call,external. ""An American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections. And by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country's future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin's regime,"" McCain said in a statement. EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker also wrote a letter of congratulations to the Russian leader,externalon Tuesday, pledging to ""always be a partner"" in improving security co-operation with the Kremlin. ""I have always argued that positive relations between the European Union and Russian Federation are crucial to security of our continent,"" he said in the letter, which he shared on Twitter. But the leader of the UK Conservative Party's group in the European Parliament, MEP Ashley Fox, said Mr Juncker's letter was ""disgraceful"" and ""nauseating"" in its ""failure to mention Russia's responsibility"" in the attack on Mr Skripal and his daughter. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was among the first Western leaders to ""warmly congratulate"" Mr Putin on Monday - a day after his re-election - stressing the need to continue dialogue ""to address important bilateral and international challenges and find viable solutions"". French President Emmanuel Macron wished Mr Putin success in ""modernising Russia"", but urged Moscow to shed light on the ""unacceptable"" attempted assassination of an ex-spy in Britain. On Tuesday, 23 Russian diplomats expelled by the UK left London. Moscow has also ordered 23 British diplomats to leave in a tit-for-tat response. The US recently imposed sanctions on a group of Russiansover alleged interference in favour of the election of Donald Trump as US president in 2016.

The producers' statement added: ""As the producers of The Crown, we at Left Bank Pictures are responsible for budgets and salaries; the actors are not aware of who gets what, and cannot be held personally responsible for the pay of their colleagues. ""We understand and appreciate the conversation which is rightly being played out across society and we are absolutely united with the fight for fair pay, free of gender bias, and for a rebalancing of the industry's treatment of women, both those in front of the camera and for those behind the scenes. ""We all have a responsibility to do what we can to ensure that these issues are tackled, and as a leading production company we want to make our contribution to the debate."" Foy and Smith will be replaced as The Crown moves into the 1970s The company added that it was ""engaged in conversations"" with ERA 50:50, which lobbies for equal representation for actresses, and was ""keen to talk"" to the Time's Up movement. The pay gap between Foy and Smithwas revealed last week, when the producers said Smith was worth more because of his higher profile from his days in Doctor Who. Foy was reportedly paid $40,000 (Â£28,000) per episode for the first two series of The Crown. It is unclear what Smith was paid. According to Variety,external, co-producer Suzanne Mackie last week said that in the future, the lead actress would not be paid less. ""Going forward, no-one gets paid more than the queen,"" she said. Olivia Colman will play the monarchin the third series.

'Dad got mum pregnant then killed her',"This video can not be played Tasnim Lowe, who visited her father in prison, said he showed no remorse for what he had done A woman whose mother gave birth to her at 14 says she wants an inquiry into why police did not charge her killer father with child sex crimes. Tasnim Lowe says her father has shown no remorse for murdering Lucy Lowe in a house fire in Telford -the town mired in fresh child sex abuse claims. Lucy was 16 and pregnant a second time by Azhar Ali Mehmood, 26, when she died in the blaze in 2000. West Mercia Police said it could not comment on specific cases. Lucy was legally incapable of consent when she was targeted and groomed by Mehmood at 12 years old. The taxi driver was jailed for life in 2001,externalfor murdering Lucy, and her sister and mother, by pouring petrol inside the house and setting it alight. He was not prosecuted for sex crimes. Lucy Lowe was 14 when she became pregnant by taxi driver Azhar Ali Mehmood Ms Lowe, 18, told the BBC: ""I would like to see that my dad shows remorse and that we can set up an investigation into why he was never charged with sex crimes."" She continued: ""He's my dad and it doesn't excuse what he did. He doesn't show any understanding but it's not something that I can say I really like him or really hate him. It's hard to explain."" Ms Lowe said the authorities and her mother's school should have ""taken charge"" to stop the teenager being groomed by Mehmood. ""They should have been like, 'This is wrong. This is illegal, we are going to do something about it',"" she added. 'Nobody asked me any questions' Telford abuse team cases 'near doubled' White working class girls 'traded for sex' Lucy was legally incapable of consent when she was targeted by Mehmood aged 12 Telford has been in the spotlight since the Sunday Mirror published a report about ""groups of mainly Asian men"" targeting vulnerable white teenagers in the town since the 1980s,external. Operation Chalice, launched by West Mercia Police,led to the jailing in 2012 of a group of menofficers believe may have targeted more than 100 girls. Lucy's father George Lowe, 73, said he believes the authorities did ""nothing"" to protect his daughter, who was described at Mehmood's trial as being in a ""relationship"" with her killer, despite her being underage. He said: ""The social services did nothing, schools did nothing and police did nothing, in a way. ""I had a word with her, but you know, you couldn't talk to her. ""She wasn't going to school for a start. They should have done something then. I can't understand it."" Azhar Ali Mehmood was ten years older than Lucy Telford and Wrekin Council said it could not discuss individual cases but added in a statement: ""We accept and regret that some historic practices were not effective 10 - 20 years ago. ""But so were services right across the country because awareness of child sexual exploitation (CSE) was then very different from now."" West Mercia Police previously said it is currently working with approximately 46 young people who were CSE victims or considered ""at risk"". This video can not be played Father of Telford abuse victim wishes daughter had told him Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans said: ""We cannot provide any details which relate to specific individuals or investigations which may or may not be ongoing.

Facebook boss summoned over data claims,"This video can not be played Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica was filmed by undercover reporters for Channel 4 News Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has been called on by a parliamentary committee to give evidence about the use of personal data by Cambridge Analytica. The consulting firm is accused of harvesting the data of 50 million Facebook users without permission and failing to delete it when told to. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Commons inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of ""misleading"" the committee. London-based firm Cambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing. Both companies are under scrutiny following claims by a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica and alleges it amassed large amounts of data through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life. He claims that 270,000 people took the quiz, but the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie says that data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them, with a view to influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Cambridge Analytica: The story explained Facebook data sharing - time to act? US consumer watchdog  'probes Facebook' In a letter to Mr Zuckerberg, Mr Collins accused Facebook of giving answers ""misleading to the Committee"" at a previous hearing which asked whether information had been taken without users' consent. He said it was ""now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process"". Requesting a response to the letter by 26 March, the MP added: ""Givenyour commitment at the start of the New Year to ""fixing"" Facebook,I hope that this representative will be you."" His intervention comes after the UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said she would be applying to court for a warrant to search the offices of Cambridge Analytica. The firm insists it followed the correct procedures in obtaining and using data,but it was suspended from Facebook last week. President Donald Trump welcomed any investigation into Cambridge Analytica as ""Americans' privacy should be protected"", according to a deputy press secretary at the White House. Facebook shares fell by a further 5%on Tuesday, following a 6.7% drop on Monday, meaning that in total, about$50bn has been wiped from its market value. The company held an open meeting with its employees on Tuesday to discuss the matter, but the BBC's North America technology reporter Dave Lee said neither Mr Zuckerberg nor his deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, chaired it. They have not spoken publically since the story about Cambridge Analytics broke last week, he added. Meanwhile, consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission - which has the power to levy large fines -has reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook. Dr Aleksandr Kogan, who created the personality app from which the data had been harvested, is a senior research associate at the University of Cambridge. A spokesman from the university said they had ""sought and received assurances"" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that. However, he confirmed the university was writing to Facebook to ""request all relevant evidence in their possession"". Meanwhile,Channel 4 News,externalhas also broadcast hidden camera footage in which Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix appears to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. This video can not be played Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie says the firm planted fake news In the footage, asked what ""deep digging"" could be done, Mr Nix told an undercover reporter: ""Oh, we do a lot more than that."" He suggested one way to target an individual was to ""offer them a deal that's too good to be true and make sure that video's recorded"". He also said he could ""send some girls around to the candidate's house..."" adding that Ukrainian girls ""are very beautiful, I find that works very well"". Mr Nix continued: ""I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what has been done."" Channel 4 News said its reporter had posed as a fixer for a wealthy client hoping to get a political candidate elected in Sri Lanka. This video can not be played Mr Nix spoke to BBC Newsnight before the Channel 4 report was aired on Monday night. He declined to be interviewed after the undercover footage was broadcast However, Cambridge Analytica said the report had ""grossly misrepresented"" the conversations caught on camera. ""In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios,"" the company said in a statement. ""Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honey traps',"" it said. Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been ""deliberately entrapped"". On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it can provide data and insights to ""drive your voters to the polls and win your campaign"" and says it has played a ""pivotal role"" in winning US presidential races. There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data. Keep an eye on apps, especially those which require you to log in using your Facebook account - they often have a very wide range of permissions and many are specifically designed to pick up your data Use an ad blocker to limit advertising Look at your Facebook security settings and make sure you are aware of what is enabled. Check the individual app settings to see whether you have given them permission to view your friends as well as yourself. You can download a copy of the data Facebook holds on you, although it is not comprehensive. There is a download button at the bottom of the General Account Settings tab. However bear in mind that your data may be less secure sitting on your laptop than it is on Facebook's servers, if your device is hacked. You can of course, simply leave Facebook, but the campaign group Privacy International warns that privacy concerns extend beyond the social network. ""The current focus is on protecting your data being exploited by third parties, but your data is being exploited all the time,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Many apps on your phone will have permission to access location data, your entire phone book and so on. It is just the tip of the iceberg.""

Red Arrows engineer killed in jet crash,"This video can not be played A large black plume of smoke was seen coming from the crash site An engineer has died after a Red Arrows jet crashed at RAF Valley on Anglesey. The pilot of the Hawk aircraft, which is used by the famous aerobatic display team, survived and is receiving treatment in hospital. Eyewitnesses had reported that only one person had ejected from the jet before it crashed and burst into flames. An air ambulance was sent to the scene at about 13:30 GMT on Tuesday but it was later confirmed the engineer had died. This video can not be played RAF Group Captain Nick Tucker-Lowe confirmed the death at a press conference at the air base Reading a statement at the RAF base, Group Captain Nick Tucker-Lowe described the crash as a ""tragic accident"" and said the families of the engineer and the pilot had been informed. Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier, head of the RAF, said the crash was a ""reminder that we must never take for granted the risks our people take in the service of our country"". ""My deepest thoughts are with the friends and family of those involved at this terrible time,"" he added. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""My condolences to the family of the RAF engineer who sadly died today on Anglesey. ""My thoughts are also with the pilot and with the Red Arrows following this tragic incident."" Profile: The Red Arrows North Wales Police said its investigators, supported by other specialists, would begin a joint investigation led by the Air Accident Investigation Branch. This video can not be played Eyewitness Howard Rigby said he saw ball of flames after the crash Eyewitnesses had described the moment they heard a loud explosion. Howard Rigby, who was playing golf near RAF Valley, said: ""I turned immediately to the airport; I could see a ball of flame and a multi-coloured parachute. ""Just one parachute, not very high - which is a bit worrying. I immediately knew there'd been a major incident."" Sian Rebecca Williams, 18, was waiting at Rhosneigr railway station when the jet flew overhead. She said: ""The Red Arrow came over and because I'd hardly seen one before I thought 'Wow, it's out'. ""From what I remember, it did a loop and flew towards the runway and looked like it was about to land. ""As I was looking I saw the parachute of one pilot open and then the plane hit the runway with a bang and a crumbling noise. ""Then it just burned bright orange and there was smoke everywhere."" This video can not be played An air ambulance was sent to the scene at RAF Valley The on-base fire engine drove out to the wreckage ""instantly"", she said, putting the flames out before an air ambulance arrived. Anne Wilson, 52, who works at nearby The Anglesey Golf Club, saw the aftermath of the crash. She said: ""I heard a very loud noise - we are used to the planes going over, but this was unusual. ""I did go and have a look and there was a big fireball and lots of smoke... quite a few of the members actually saw it. ""They said the plane came in quite steeply and saw a pilot eject, but that it was very low to the ground when they ejected."" A Welsh Ambulance Service spokeswoman said it received a call about the crash just before 13:30 GMT and it sent an emergency ambulance and an air ambulance. It is believed the aircraft was flying from RAF Valley to RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, where the Red Arrows are based, when it crashed. The Red Arrows are the RAF's world-famous aerobatic team, performing stunts and daredevil displays in the distinctive Hawk fast-jets. It is understood the aircrew had been at RAF Valley for routine Hawk simulator training - something that takes place once a month. In total, about 1,500 service personnel, civil servants and contractors work at RAF Valley.

Man guilty of hate crime over 'Nazi pug',"Mark Meechan's clip was viewed more than three million times on YouTube A man who filmed a pet dog giving Nazi salutes before putting the footage on YouTube has been convicted of committing a hate crime. Mark Meechan, 30, recorded his girlfriend's pug, Buddha, responding to statements such as ""gas the Jews"" and ""Sieg Heil"" by raising its paw. But police were alerted and he was arrested for allegedly committing a hate crime. The original clip had been viewed more than three million times on YouTube. Meechan, of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, went on trial at Airdrie Sheriff Court where he denied any wrong doing. He insisted he made the video, which was posted in April 2016, to annoy his girlfriend Suzanne Kelly, 29. But Sheriff Derek O'Carroll found him guilty of a charge under the Communications Act that he posted a video on social media and YouTube which was grossly offensive because it was ""anti-semitic and racist in nature"" and was aggravated by religious prejudice. Sheriff O'Carroll told the court he did not believe Meechan had made the video only to annoy his girlfriend and ruled it was anti-Semitic. He also said he believed Meechan - who was supported at court by Tommy Robinson, former leader of far-right group the English Defence League (EDL) - left the video on YouTube to drive traffic to other material he had on there. He added: ""In my view it is a reasonable conclusion that the video is grossly offensive ""The description of the video as humorous is no magic wand. ""This court has taken the freedom of expression into consideration. ""But the right to freedom of expression also comes with responsibility."" Sheriff O'Carroll said Meehan was ""quite obviously an intelligent and articulate man"". But he added: ""The accused knew that the material was offensive and knew why it was offensive. ""Despite that the accused made a video containing anti-Semitic content and he would have known it was grossly offensive to many Jewish people."" Ross Brown, defending, said Meechan had only intended the video to be seen by a small group of friends and to annoy his girlfriend. He said the material had been leaked and gone viral but Police Scotland then wrongly pursued Meechan despite his later videos attempting to ""set the record straight"". Mr Brown said: ""His girlfriend testified that Mr Meechan had never made known to her any anti-Semitic views whatsoever. ""The accused possesses both tolerant and liberal views. ""His girlfriend is in no doubt it was an example of his sense of humour."" Mr Brown told the court it was wrong to focus on the phrase ""gas the Jews"" when it had been taken out of context of the whole video. He claimed Jewish comedian David Baddiel had voiced his support for Meechan and had asked for him to walk free. He added: ""I can see that the video may not be to everyone's taste. ""Others may be able to see the comedic or satirical element to it. ""The court should seek to acquit Mr Meechan for no other reason but to show it is 2018 and not 1984."" Prosecutors had earlier asked for Meechan to be convicted and branded the video ""an odious criminal act that was dressed up to look like a joke."" Comedian Ricky Gervais took to Twitter to comment on the case after the verdict. He tweeted: ""A man has been convicted in a UK court of making a joke that was deemed 'grossly offensive'. ""If you don't believe in a person's right to say things that you might find 'grossly offensive', then you don't believe in Freedom of Speech.""

Inflation eases on falling petrol prices,"Falling petrol prices and a slower rise in the cost of food contributed to a drop in UK consumer price inflation during February. The rate fell from 3% to 2.7%, the lowest figure since July 2017. The fall eases pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. There had been speculation it could raise rates at its meeting in May. The figures suggest the squeeze on households, caused by rising inflation and stagnant wages, may be ending. The ONS will publish the latest pay growth figures on Wednesday. Economists expect those figures to show pay growth edged higher, to an annual rate of 2.6% in the three months to January. And the situation could improve further this year, according to the Bank of England. It expects wages to grow more quickly than inflation. Ahmed: Is the incomes squeeze coming to an end? UK growth forecast raised by British Chambers of Commerce Leggings in and pork pies out of latest inflation basket Restaurants warn chancellor over 'damaging closures' The price of petrol and food played a key part in this month's figures. Petrol prices fell by 0.2p per litre on the month, while diesel dropped by 0.1p. Food prices rose by 0.1% between January and February, compared with a 0.8% rise the year before. Last year's figure was boosted by a shortage of salad and vegetables, when crops in southern Mediterranean countries were hit by bad weather. The main rise in the cost of living came from clothing and footwear prices, especially women's shoes, which went up by 1.7% on the month, compared with 1.2% in 2017. Consumer price inflation hit a six-year high of 3.1% in November and has been edging lower since then. Phil Gooding, from the Office for National Statistics, said: ""Many of the early 2017 price increases due to the previous depreciation of the pound have started to work through the system. ""Hotel prices also fell and the cost of ferry tickets rose more slowly than last year, when prices were collected on Valentine's Day, when many people could have been taking mini-breaks. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ""We know families feel the cost of living at the end of every working week. ""We are increasing the National Living Wage which is already helping the lowest earners see their pay rise by almost 7% above inflation."" The inflation drop suggests that the pay squeeze is easing. Incomes data do lag prices, but if the trends continue (inflation easing and wages increasing) then it is likely that many millions of people will see their real incomes start rising again by the end of the year. Which is much better news than we have had recently, particularly after the inflation spike which followed the Brexit referendum and the fall in the value of the pound. That increased the import prices of things like food and fuel, which pushed up costs here. That does not mean Britain's incomes problem is over. As the latest Resolution Foundation report, The Living Standards Outlook, revealed, the last decade has seen the most anaemic rates of wage growth for 200 years. Before the financial crisis, average wage growth topped 4% but since 2009 it has been below 3% and benefits for those in work have also been cut. Yes, there have been increases in things like the National Living Wage, but the government is well aware that, overall, the picture on incomes is pretty gloomy. Read more of Kamal's blog here. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, said: ""It is not a surprise to see UK inflation starting to fall back. ""Forecasters were expecting price increases to ease back this year. But the rate of reduction is likely to remain slow and volatile. The fact that Easter is early this year could push inflation back up again in March. ""This fallback in inflation therefore provides little reason for the Bank of England to hold back from gradually raising interest rates. ""A further interest rate rise would be justified this spring."" However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said:  ""Inflation is falling back to the 2% target much more rapidly than the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) expected - undermining the case for raising interest rates again as soon as May. ""We think that the MPC will refrain from ratcheting up its guidance and won't clearly signal an imminent rate rise in the minutes of Thursday's meeting, prompting markets to reassess their view that the chances of a May rate hike are as high as 80%.""

Gunman dies after being shot at US school,"This video can not be played 'Greatest nightmare - our children attacked' A gunman who shot and injured two teenage students at a high school in the US state of Maryland was shot dead after a gunfight with a police officer. Austin Wyatt Rollins, 17, shot a 16-year-old girl, who is in a critical condition, and a 14-year-old boy. The attack happened on Tuesday morning before lessons at Great Mills High School in St Mary's County, 65 miles (104km) south-east of Washington DC. Rollins had a prior relationship with the girl, Sheriff Tim Cameron said. The school shooting comes a month after a high school shooter killed 17 in Parkland, Florida. St Mary's County Sheriff's Deputy Blaine Gaskill, who was assigned to the school as a resource officer, exchanged gunfire with the attacker but it is unclear if the gunman was hit by the guard's gunfire or shot himself. A student is comforted Florida survivors: Don't arm teachers US students in mass walkout for gun reform Mr Cameron said the shooting began in a hallway at the school. The gunman fired at a female and then a male student, hitting them both, he said. ""Our school resource officer who was stationed inside the school was alerted,"" he told reporters. ""He pursued the shooter, engaged the shooter. During that engagement he fired a round at the shooter. ""Simultaneously, the shooter fired a round as well,"" he said. School resource officer Blaine Gaskill engaged the shooter Mr Gaskill was not hurt, Mr Cameron said, adding that the gunman's cause of death was still under investigation. The female student is in a critical condition in hospital. This video can not be played Thousands of US students protest for gun reform Some 1,600 students attend the school in the community of Great Mills near the Chesapeake Bay and were evacuated to a nearby school after the event. Federal agents from the FBI, and the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - as well as local police - are at the school investigating the incident.

""Today's horrible events should not be an excuse to pause our conversation about school safety,"" he said in a statement. ""Instead, it must serve as a call to action."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the attack serves as ""another tragic and exasperating reminder of the enduring threat of gun violence"", and called upon ""our so-called leaders in Washington"" to take action to stem gun attacks. The shooting comes four days before the March for Our Lives rally for student safety inspired by the 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in southern Florida.

French police hold ex-president Sarkozy,"Mr Sarkozy (left) clinched big trade deals for France with Libya's Gaddafi in 2007 when he was president Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been taken into police custody for questioning over allegations that he received campaign funding from the late Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. Police are investigating alleged irregularities over the financing of his 2007 presidential campaign. Police have questioned him previously as part of the probe. Mr Sarkozy has denied any wrongdoing. The centre-right politician failed to return to power in 2012. Judicial sources said he was being questioned in Nanterre, a suburb in western Paris. In 2013, France opened an investigation into allegations that his campaign had benefited from illicit funds from Gaddafi. The sources said one of Mr Sarkozy's former ministers and a close ally, Brice Hortefeux, was also being questioned by police on Tuesday. Alexandre Djouhri is in London fighting extradition to France A former aide, Alexandre Djouhri, is fighting extradition to France after being arrested in London in January on suspicion of money laundering as part of the case. The Swiss businessman has denied the allegation and says the investigation is politically motivated, according to Reuters news agency.,external The claims about funding from Gaddafi came from a French-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine, and some former Gaddafi regime officials. The investigation has not reached that stage yet. ""Garde Ã  vue"" - custody - means he can be held and questioned by police for up to 48 hours. Then he may appear before a judge and may face charges. French media say it is the first time that police have detained him over the Libya allegations. Buthe was detained in 2014 in a separate investigation into alleged campaign funding abuses- the first time this has happened to a French ex-president. France's Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woes Sarkozy under investigation In November 2016, Ziad Takieddine told the French news website Mediapart,externalthat in 2006-2007 he had handed over three suitcases stuffed with 200- and 500-euro notes to Mr Sarkozy and Claude GuÃ©ant, who was his chief of staff. Ziad Takieddine says he delivered Libyan cash to Mr Sarkozy's aides Mr Takieddine alleged that the cash came from Gaddafi and totalled â¬5m (Â£4.4m; $6.2m). Mr GuÃ©ant, who was managing Mr Sarkozy's presidential campaign at the time, told the franceinfo website on Tuesday that he had ""never seen a penny of Libyan financing"". He was placed under formal investigation earlier this year over a â¬500,000 bank transfer in 2008. He has denied wrongdoing and claimed the money came from the sale of two paintings. French daily Le Monde reported that Bashir Saleh, who ran Libya's sovereign wealth fund at the time, had confirmed that Gaddafi financed Mr Sarkozy. Possible charges in this case would be influence peddling, fraud, handling of stolen goods and money laundering. Mr Sarkozy has been ordered to stand trial in a separate case of alleged illicit campaign financing. It is alleged that he engaged in accounting fraud to overshoot the ceiling for campaign expenditure in 2012, which was â¬22.5m. Mr Sarkozy denies he was aware of the overspending. The affair is known as the Bygmalion scandal. In connection with his 2007 campaign, Mr Sarkozy was previously cleared over claims that he had used secret funding from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt and that he had tried to influence investigating magistrates.

The story so far,"This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far It's a sensational story containing allegations of sleaze, psychological manipulation and data misuse that has provoked an internationally furious response. Tech giant Facebook and data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica are at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data - and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election or the UK Brexit referendum. Both firms deny any wrongdoing. The boss of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, has since been suspended, while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been called on by a Commons parliamentary committee to give evidence. Channel 4 News,externalsent an undercover reporter to meet executives from data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, following reports by the journalist Carole Cadwalladr in theObserver newspaper,external. The firm had been credited with helping Donald Trump to presidential victory. The reporter posed as a Sri Lankan businessman wanting to influence a local election. Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix was apparently filmed giving examples of how his firm could discredit political rivals by arranging various smear campaigns, including setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging situations in which apparent bribery could be caught on camera. This video can not be played Alexander Nix, CEO, Cambridge Analytica: ""These sort of tactics are very effective"" The firm denies all the claims and says the documentary was ""edited and scripted to grossly represent the nature of those conversations"". It claims the conversations were led by the reporters. ""I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honey traps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose,"" said Mr Nix. In 2014 a quiz on Facebook invited users to find out their personality type. It was developed by University of Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan (the university has no connections with Cambridge Analytica). As was common with apps and games at that time, it was designed to harvest not only the user data of the person taking part in the quiz, but also the data of their friends. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can scrape in this way. Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, alleges that because 270,000 people took the quiz, the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them. Cambridge Analytica denies any of it was used as part of the services it provided to the Trump campaign. The data was gathered using Facebook's infrastructure at that time, and many other developers had taken advantage of it - but the data was not authorised for them to share with others. The other key point is that even the people directly taking part in the personality quiz would have had no idea that they were potentially sharing their data with Donald Trump's election campaign. Facebook say when they learned their rules had been breached, they removed the app and demanded assurances that the information had been deleted. Cambridge Analytica claims that it never used the data, and deleted it when Facebook told it to. Both Facebook and the UK Information Commissioner want to find out whether it was properly destroyed, as Mr Wylie claims it was not. There are calls for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress US senators have called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how Facebook will protect users. In the UK, the chairman of a parliamentary committee, Damian Collins,has summoned Mr Zuckerbergto explain the ""catastrophic failure"" to MPs. The head of the European Parliament said it would investigate to see if the data was misused. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""very concerned"" about the revelations. Meanwhile, Cambridge Analyticahas suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix,saying his comments ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm"". And the academic who created the app at the centre of the storm, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, said he has been made ""a scapegoat"". Where is Mark Zuckerberg? Facebook data row academic says he is 'scapegoat' The global reach of Cambridge Analytica There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data. Keep an eye on apps, especially those which require you to log in using your Facebook account - they often have a very wide range of permissions and many are specifically designed to pick up your data Use an ad blocker to limit advertising Look at your Facebook security settings and make sure you are aware of what is enabled. Check the individual app settings to see whether you have given them permission to view your friends as well as yourself. You can download a copy of the data Facebook holds on you, although it is not comprehensive. There is a download button at the bottom of the General Account Settings tab. However bear in mind that your data may be less secure sitting on your laptop than it is on Facebook's servers, if your device is hacked. You can of course, simply leave Facebook, but the campaign group Privacy International warns that privacy concerns extend beyond the social network. ""The current focus is on protecting your data being exploited by third parties, but your data is being exploited all the time,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Many apps on your phone will have permission to access location data, your entire phone book and so on. It is just the tip of the iceberg.""

How to protect your Facebook data,"People increasingly want to know how much information tech firms have on them Allegations that research firm Cambridge Analytica misused the data of 50 million Facebook users have reopened the debate about how information on the social network is shared and with whom. Data is like oil to Facebook - it is what brings advertisers to the platform, who in turn make it money. And there is no question that Facebook has the ability to build detailed and sophisticated profiles on users' likes, dislikes, lifestyles and political leanings. The bigger question becomes - what does it share with others and what can users do to regain control of their information? Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix told MPs it used data from ""Facebook surveys"" We've all seen these quizzes - offering to test your IQ, reveal your inner personality, or show you what you'd look like if you were a glamorous actor. It was information from one such Facebook quiz - This is Your Digital Life - that Cambridge Analytica is alleged to have used to harvest the data of millions of people. Many such quizzes come with reassurances that your data is safe. These games and quizzes are designed to tempt users in but they are often just a shop front for mass data collection - and one that Facebook's terms and conditions allow. Privacy advocates Electronic Frontier Foundation said the way these quizzes collected data reflected ""how Facebook's terms of service and API were structured at the time"". Facebook has changed its terms and conditions to cut down on the information that third parties can collect, specifically stopping them from accessing data about users' friends. It is not yet clear exactly what information the firm got hold of - this is now subject to an investigation by theUK data protection authority, the ICO. Log in to Facebook and visit the App settings page Click edit button under Apps, Websites and Plugins Disable platform App settings can be found via a drop down menu in blue bar at the top of Facebook page This will mean that you won't be able to use third-party sites on Facebook and if that is is a step too far, there is a way of limiting the personal information accessible by apps while still using them: Log into Facebook's App settings page Unclick every category you don't want the app to access, which includes bio, birthday, family, religious views, if you are online, posts on your timeline, activities and interests There are some others pieces of advice too. ""Never click on a 'like' button on a product service page and if you want to play these games and quizzes, don't log in through Facebook but go directly to the site,"" said Paul Bernal, a lecturer in Information Technology, Intellectual Property and Media Law in the University of East Anglia School of Law. ""Using Facebook Login is easy but doing so, grants the app's developer access to a range of information from their Facebook profiles,"" he added. Digital fingerprints are getting bigger as people share more information online There really is only one way to make sure data we create on a daily basis remains entirely private, thinks Dr Bernal. ""Leave Facebook."" ""The incentive Facebook will have to protect people more will only come if people start leaving. Currently it has very little incentive to change,"" he told the BBC. It seems he is not alone in his call -the hashtag #DeleteFacebook is now trending on Twitterin the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But Dr Bernal acknowledges that it is unlikely many will quit - especially those who see Facebook as ""part of the infrastructure of their lives"". The less drastic option is deactivation, which stops an account from appearing in search results but gives the user the option to bring it back.  It would stop future tracking but means all the information already collected will still be kept. For those that decide deletion is the best option, users can head to thedelete my account page,external, which explains that once gone, information cannot be retrieved. The page is not easy to find on the site and requires quite a few steps: From the top right of the blue bar, click the downward arrow Select settings Click General Click Manage Account Click Request Deletion In the pop-up box, which is aimed at people who want to delete their account in the event of their death, click Learn More Scroll down to the section headed Deleting Your Account and click on the link Facebook advises users who delete their account to download a copy of their information before they delete it. They also warn users that the process can take up to 90 days, during which time the information is inaccessible to others using the platform. Mr Schrems has been involved in a series of complaints against Facebook since 2011 Under current data protection rules, users can make a Subject Access Request to individual firms to find out how much information they have on them. When Austrian privacy advocate Max Schrems made such a request to Facebook in 2011, he was given a CD with 1,200 files stored on it. He found that the social network kept records of all the IP addresses of machines he used to access the site, a full history of messages and chats, his location and even items that he thought he had deleted, such as messages, status updates and wall posts. But in a world where Facebook information is shared more widely with third parties, making such a request gets harder. As Dr Bernal says: ""How do you ask for your data when you don't know who to ask?"" That is likely to change this summer with the introduction  of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which aims to make it far easier for users to take back control of their data. The threat of big fines for firms that do not comply with such requests could make it more likely that they will share this information, which must be given to consumers ""in a clear and readable form"". Can you remove your profile from social media? Data protection laws in Europe suggest that firms should only keep user data ""as long as necessary"" but the interpretation of this can be very flexible. In Facebook's case, this means that as long as the person posting something does not delete it, it will remain online indefinitely. Users can delete their accounts, which in theory will ""kill"" all their past posts but Facebook encourages those who wish to take a break from the social network simply to deactivate them, in case they wish to return. And it must be remembered that a lot of information about you will remain on the platform, from the posts of your friends. One of the biggest changes of GDPR will be the right for people to be forgotten and, under these changes it should, in theory, be much easier to wipe your social network or other online history from existence.

Is it time to delete your Facebook?,"""It is time. #deletefacebook."" After reports ofCambridge Analytica using Facebook's user informationcame to light, people across social media have begun to urge others to either #DeleteFacebook or #BoycottFacebook in response. One surprising voice has joined this movement - WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton. Mr Acton left the company in 2017, three years afterFacebook bought WhatsApp for $19bn(Â£11.4bn at the then exchange rates) in 2014. Allow Twitter content?

""My deepest thoughts are with the friends and family of those involved at this terrible time,"" he added. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""My condolences to the family of the RAF engineer who sadly died today on Anglesey.

Police investigate US school shooting,"This video can not be played 'Greatest nightmare - our children attacked' A gunman who shot and injured two teenage students at a high school in the US state of Maryland was shot dead after a gunfight with a police officer. Austin Wyatt Rollins, 17, shot a 16-year-old girl, who is in a critical condition, and a 14-year-old boy. The attack happened on Tuesday morning before lessons at Great Mills High School in St Mary's County, 65 miles (104km) south-east of Washington DC. Rollins had a prior relationship with the girl, Sheriff Tim Cameron said. The school shooting comes a month after a high school shooter killed 17 in Parkland, Florida. St Mary's County Sheriff's Deputy Blaine Gaskill, who was assigned to the school as a resource officer, exchanged gunfire with the attacker but it is unclear if the gunman was hit by the guard's gunfire or shot himself. A student is comforted Florida survivors: Don't arm teachers US students in mass walkout for gun reform Mr Cameron said the shooting began in a hallway at the school. The gunman fired at a female and then a male student, hitting them both, he said. ""Our school resource officer who was stationed inside the school was alerted,"" he told reporters. ""He pursued the shooter, engaged the shooter. During that engagement he fired a round at the shooter. ""Simultaneously, the shooter fired a round as well,"" he said. School resource officer Blaine Gaskill engaged the shooter Mr Gaskill was not hurt, Mr Cameron said, adding that the gunman's cause of death was still under investigation. The female student is in a critical condition in hospital. This video can not be played Thousands of US students protest for gun reform Some 1,600 students attend the school in the community of Great Mills near the Chesapeake Bay and were evacuated to a nearby school after the event. Federal agents from the FBI, and the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - as well as local police - are at the school investigating the incident.

""Today's horrible events should not be an excuse to pause our conversation about school safety,"" he said in a statement. ""Instead, it must serve as a call to action."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the attack serves as ""another tragic and exasperating reminder of the enduring threat of gun violence"", and called upon ""our so-called leaders in Washington"" to take action to stem gun attacks. The shooting comes four days before the March for Our Lives rally for student safety inspired by the 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in southern Florida.

Harry and Meghan choose wedding cake,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have chosen an organic lemon and elderflower cake for their wedding in May. Instead of a more traditional fruit cake, it will involve ""spring"" flavours and be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers. The couple have enlisted Californian pastry chef and food writer Claire Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in east London, to make it. Ms Ptak said she was delighted and that she shared the couple's values on food. Kensington Palace said the couple were ""very much looking forward to sharing"" the cake with their wedding guests on 19 May. Like Ms Markle, Ms Ptak was raised in California. She worked as a pastry chef at Chez Panisse under chef and campaigner Alice Waters. Mums' Down's syndrome video goes viral 'I've been given my sight back' Sex and the City star runs for NY governor She later moved to the UK where she worked at The Anchor and Hope gastropub in Waterloo and set up a market stall on Broadway Market, east London. She said: ""Knowing that they really share the same values as I do about food provenance, sustainability, seasonality and most importantly flavour, makes this the most exciting event to be a part of."" Ms Markle has previously interviewed Ms Ptak for her former lifestyle website TheTig.com which covered topics such as food, beauty, fashion and travel. Prior to the wedding of Queen Victoria in 1840, wedding cakes were not considered an important part of the celebrations. Instead guests at the wedding banquet were often offered a slice of ""bride pie"". Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's own cake weighed 300lb and featured the figure of Britannia blessing the bride and groom - who were dressed in ancient Greek costume. In 2016 a man brought a leftover slice of the wedding cakefor Â£1,500 at an auction. In more recent royal history, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had two cakes for their wedding day. The first was an eight-tiered iced fruit cakedecorated with 900 delicate sugar paste flowers. The second was an unbaked chocolate biscuit cake - a favourite from Prince William's childhood - made from broken up rich tea biscuits by the company McVitie's. Staff put the finishing touches to the cake for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. McVitie and Price also made the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's wedding cake in 1947 - it measured 9ft high. Instead of flowers, this cake was decorated with painted panels of the armorial bearings of both families, monograms of the couple and sugar-iced figures depicting their favourite activities. The cake was made using ingredients given as a wedding gift by the Australian Girl Guides as rationing was still in place. Prince Charles and Princess Diana's wedding cake was 5ft high, weighed 255lb, and was made by the Royal Navy's Cookery school. A slice of their cake was sold for Â£828 by an American auction house in 2014.

Jail term for Briton over 'pornography'Daniel Jones receives a suspended sentence in Cambodia over photos used to promote a pool party.3h3 hours agoAsia,"Daniel Jones has already served one month and 22 days in remand A British man has received a one-year suspended prison sentence in Cambodia for using ""pornographic"" photos to promote a pool party. Daniel Jones, 31, wasone of 10 foreigners detained by police in Siem Reapfollowing a raid on a pub crawl and pool party on 25 January. He insisted there was no sex or nudity at the party, which he promoted on Facebook with the line ""Let's Get Wet"". Prosecutors argued the images were illegal and against Cambodian culture. Judge Um Chan Thol handed down the maximum sentence, saying Jones had ""unintentionally produced pornography that affects Khmer culture"". Jones has already served one month and 22 days on remand. The remaining 10 months of the sentence has been suspended. Defending Jones, who denied the charge, lawyer Ouch Sopheaktra said:  ""There was no evidence against my client. As a lawyer, I am not happy with this decision."" Cambodia country profile Cambodia deports tourists accused of producing pornography The other nine foreigners - four Britons, two Canadians, a Norwegian, a New Zealander and a Dutch national - were deported after charges against them were dropped. They all denied the charges andclaim that photos showing partygoers are several years old and have nothing to with them,external. Siem Reap is popular with tourists because it is close to the famous ancient ruins of Angkor Wat, Cambodia's biggest tourist site. A police handout picture shows people appearing to imitate sex acts at a party but those accused claim the photo is several years old The country's nightlife scene has rapidly grown over the past few years as it has become more popular among backpackers and budget travellers. This has sometimes placed tourists at odds with Cambodia's socially conservative Buddhist culture. In 2016 the country announced a ban on tourists wearing ""revealing clothes"" from visiting the ancient temple park, after a number of foreign tourists were arrested and deported for taking nude photographs at the site.

Zuckerberg summoned to Commons inquiry,"This video can not be played Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica was filmed by undercover reporters for Channel 4 News Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has been called on by a parliamentary committee to give evidence about the use of personal data by Cambridge Analytica. The consulting firm is accused of harvesting the data of 50 million Facebook users without permission and failing to delete it when told to. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Commons inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of ""misleading"" the committee. London-based firm Cambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing. Both companies are under scrutiny following claims by a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica and alleges it amassed large amounts of data through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life. He claims that 270,000 people took the quiz, but the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie says that data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them, with a view to influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Cambridge Analytica: The story explained Facebook data sharing - time to act? US consumer watchdog  'probes Facebook' In a letter to Mr Zuckerberg, Mr Collins accused Facebook of giving answers ""misleading to the Committee"" at a previous hearing which asked whether information had been taken without users' consent. He said it was ""now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process"". Requesting a response to the letter by 26 March, the MP added: ""Givenyour commitment at the start of the New Year to ""fixing"" Facebook,I hope that this representative will be you."" His intervention comes after the UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said she would be applying to court for a warrant to search the offices of Cambridge Analytica. The firm insists it followed the correct procedures in obtaining and using data,but it was suspended from Facebook last week. President Donald Trump welcomed any investigation into Cambridge Analytica as ""Americans' privacy should be protected"", according to a deputy press secretary at the White House. Facebook shares fell by a further 5%on Tuesday, following a 6.7% drop on Monday, meaning that in total, about$50bn has been wiped from its market value. The company held an open meeting with its employees on Tuesday to discuss the matter, but the BBC's North America technology reporter Dave Lee said neither Mr Zuckerberg nor his deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, chaired it. They have not spoken publically since the story about Cambridge Analytics broke last week, he added. Meanwhile, consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission - which has the power to levy large fines -has reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook. Dr Aleksandr Kogan, who created the personality app from which the data had been harvested, is a senior research associate at the University of Cambridge. A spokesman from the university said they had ""sought and received assurances"" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that. However, he confirmed the university was writing to Facebook to ""request all relevant evidence in their possession"". Meanwhile,Channel 4 News,externalhas also broadcast hidden camera footage in which Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix appears to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. This video can not be played Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie says the firm planted fake news In the footage, asked what ""deep digging"" could be done, Mr Nix told an undercover reporter: ""Oh, we do a lot more than that."" He suggested one way to target an individual was to ""offer them a deal that's too good to be true and make sure that video's recorded"". He also said he could ""send some girls around to the candidate's house..."" adding that Ukrainian girls ""are very beautiful, I find that works very well"". Mr Nix continued: ""I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what has been done."" Channel 4 News said its reporter had posed as a fixer for a wealthy client hoping to get a political candidate elected in Sri Lanka. This video can not be played Mr Nix spoke to BBC Newsnight before the Channel 4 report was aired on Monday night. He declined to be interviewed after the undercover footage was broadcast However, Cambridge Analytica said the report had ""grossly misrepresented"" the conversations caught on camera. ""In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios,"" the company said in a statement. ""Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honey traps',"" it said. Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been ""deliberately entrapped"". On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it can provide data and insights to ""drive your voters to the polls and win your campaign"" and says it has played a ""pivotal role"" in winning US presidential races.

UK 'has to do business with Putin',"Vladimir Putin was re-elected for his fourth term as president Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK must still deal with Russia despite ""all fingers"" pointing to it over the Salisbury spy attack. He said he would ""do business"" with Vladimir Putin but assertively and on the basis of the UK's values. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says he believes Mr Putin was responsible. But Mr Corbyn said he wanted ""an absolutely definitive answer"" about the source of the nerve agent used in the attempted murder before blaming Moscow. In a wide-ranging interview with Radio 4'sWorld at One,Mr Corbyn said if he won power, he would challenge the newly re-elected president on human rights and the whole basis of the UK's relationship with Moscow. Russia stockpiling nerve agent - Johnson Labour row over Corbyn stance on Russia Putin ready for 'constructive' dialogue Former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench on 4 March. They had been exposed to a nerve agent. The 23 Russian diplomats expelled from London after Theresa May told the Commons that Russia was ""culpable"" for the attack are due to leave on Tuesday. A removal van is reportedly in the embassy grounds, the BBC understands. The PM will also chair a meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday to consider possible further steps against Russia. Moscow has denied all involvement, and is expelling 23 British diplomats in turn. Meanwhile, the head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, said the focus of the Salisbury investigation is ""on the movements of the Skripals"". Mr Corbynhas been criticisedby Tory and some Labour MPs for not blaming the Russian state categorically for the attack. In an interview to be broadcast on Tuesday, he told The World at One people should ""not shoot from the hip"" and instead wait for experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to complete their work testing the poison, again repeating his call for Russia to be sent samples of the nerve agent to identify. ""All fingers point towards Russia's involvement in this, and obviously the manufacture of the material was undertaken by the Russian state originally,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said the UK should deal with Russia on the basis of its own principles ""What I'm saying is the weapons were made from Russia, clearly. ""I think Russia has to be held responsible for it but there has to be an absolutely definitive answer to the question where did the nerve agent come from?"" He added: ""I asked the Russians be given a sample so that they can say categorically one way or the other."" On Sunday, Mr McDonnell - one of Mr Corbyn's closest allies - said he agreed with the prime minister that ""whichever way you look at it"", Vladimir Putin ""is responsible and all the evidence points to him"" - adding that it was ""highly likely"" to have been an attempted state execution. Asked if he agreed with Mr McDonnell on this point, Mr Corbyn said: ""I think John put the case there that it's highly likely that there's Russian involvement in it."" He said all countries, not just Russia, had to abide by the Chemical Weapons Convention and that the UK should maintain a robust dialogue with Moscow on a range of issues rather than shunning it. ""Would I do business with Putin, sure? And I'd challenge him on human rights in Russia, challenge him on these issues and challenge him on that whole basis of that relationship. ""You have to deal with people who are in the position they are as head of state,"" he added What are Novichok nerve agents? Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Russian spy: What we know so far ""Russia is a huge country that suffered more than anyone else in the Second World War and we have to recognise that there has to be a relationship with Russia. Robust, yes, assertive, yes, demanding yes, but there has to be a relationship."" In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the Russian president was taking his country in a ""dangerous direction"", with his actions at home and abroad clearly linked. ""The obvious Russian-ness of the weapon was designed to send a signal to anyone pondering dissent amid the intensifying repression of Mr Putin's Russia,"" he wrote. ""The message is clear: we will hunt you down, we will find you and we will kill you - and though we will scornfully deny our guilt, the world will know that Russia did it."" Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg also argued that the prime minister is ""a very cautious leader"" who would not have made the claims she has about Russia ""without being very convinced that we have the evidence"". He told Nick Ferrari's LBC radio programme that Russia has not behaved as a ""normal nation behaves"", through its invasion of Georgia and Ukraine sovereign territory and ""its willingness to murder people in British streets - that's not how a normal nation behaves and we can't allow that to go unnoticed, unresponded to.""

FBI investigating new blast in Texas,"This video can not be played Texas explosions: The search for the suspect US President Donald Trump has said that a series of deadly bombings in Texas were carried out by ""sick people"", and also pledged justice for the victims. ""We're looking. It's not easy to find,"" Mr Trump said on Tuesday after a parcel bomb exploded at a FedEx depot - the fifth bomb to explode in recent days. US authorities are probing whether that incident is connected to a series of bomb attacks targeting Austin. Tuesday night's explosive was due to be shipped to that city, local police say. ""The bombings in Austin are terrible,"" Mr Trump told reporters before a meeting at the White House with Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""This is obviously a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals,"" he added. ""We will get to the bottom of it. We will be very strong."" The incident occurred at 00:30 (05:30 GMT) in Schertz, 65 miles (104km) south of the city of Austin, where four bombs have killed two people in recent weeks. One person was lightly injured but did not require treatment, police said. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency suspected a link to previous bombings in the state FBI spokeswoman Michelle Lee told US media that the agency believed the blast in Schertz could be connected to the previous attacks. Local media, citing law enforcement sources, report that the bomb which went off in Schertz was addressed to Austin. The bomb which exploded in Schertz was filled with nails and shrapnel, officials say. It went off as it was moving from an upper conveyor belt to a lower one, the news4sanantonio website reports.,external A female employee standing nearby was treated at the scene for a possible concussion, the website adds. About 75 employees were working in the depot at the time. Hours after the blast, police said a hazardous materials team had been sent to a FedEx shipping facility near Austin's airport to check reports of a suspicious package. If the explosion in Schertz is linked to the previous four, it will be the first time the bomber has used the mail. Three of the four devices were hidden in parcels left at residential addresses in Austin while police say the fourth was probably activated by a tripwire: The first device exploded on 2 March, killing Anthony Stephan House, 39, at his home On 13 March,Draylen William Mason, 17, was killed and his mother was critically injured when he brought a package inside his home from the doorstep Hours later on 13 March, a 75-year-old Hispanic woman, who has not been named, was injured by another package On 18 March, a device injured two men who may have set off a tripwire while walking along a street in the south-west of the city Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Austin Five bombs in 18 days and still no real idea of motive. That's the position the police and the FBI find themselves in as they analyse the latest blast, this time at a FedEx warehouse. What seems clear is that they're dealing with someone or some group that has a significant level of knowledge of bomb making and who seem set on keeping the authorities guessing. Even with $115,000 worth of reward on offer, there's still no sign of a promising lead. There's understandable nervousness in Austin itself. The sheer geographical spread of the bombings making everyone feel vulnerable. However, talking to some in the city last night, there was also a determination not to let the bomber get the upper hand. ""I decided I was still going to go out to dinner,"" one young woman told me. But there was some frustration too. One drinker in a pub I met said he felt the police were being slow in tracking the bomber down. Until they do, Texas is holding its breath, wondering where the next strike could come. Investigators initially said they were looking at a possible racial motivation for the attacks, which had killed two black men and injured a Hispanic woman. However, the two men injured in the 18 March blast were both white. 'Serial bomber' suspected in Austin blasts ""With this tripwire, this changes things,"" said Christopher Combs, the special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio office. ""It's more sophisticated. It's not targeted to individuals. We're very concerned that with tripwires, a child could be walking down the sidewalk and hit something."" Fred Milanowski, the special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Houston, said the agency had a ""high degree of confidence that the same individual built all these devices"". Mr Combs said more than 350 FBI special agents had been drafted in to work on the investigation, calling it an ""unprecedented response."" Mr Trump praised the inter-agency response, but added: ""We have to produce, we have to find this very sick person or people."" ""We have to find them, really, immediately,"" he continued. The FBI made a rare public appeal to the bomber to get in touch. ""We would really like the bomber to contact us so we can talk to him,"" Mr Combs said. Austin police have offered a $100,000 (Â£71,340) reward for information, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott has offered an additional $15,000. Residents in Austin, a city of 974,000, have been asked to look out for suspicious packages.

Presenters' stress over BBC 'tax pressure',"This video can not be played Radio 4's Kirsty Lang told her story to a committee of MPs A BBC radio presenter has told how she worked through cancer treatment because she wasn't eligible for sick pay after being taken off a staff contract. Kirsty Lang, who co-hosts BBC Radio 4's Front Row, has given evidence to a committee of MPs about how the BBC set up presenters' tax arrangements. Many say the BBC forced them into going freelance instead of being staff, so they didn't get benefits like sick pay. Lang told the committee she had been ""hung out to dry"" and ""betrayed"". She was one of four broadcasters who spoke to MPs on Tuesday. They said the BBC put pressure on presenters to be employed via a personal service company (PSC). Some are being investigated by HM Revenue & Customs and facing huge bills for unpaid tax. Lang was originally on a staff contract - but said that when she asked to go part-time after her son started having problems at school in 2013, she was told she could only do so if she went freelance. She said she ""didn't really feel like I had a choice because of my family situation"", and the arrangement was not a way for her to avoid paying tax. ""In fact, I was quite frightened,"" she told the House of Commons culture select committee. ""I was frightened of getting sick and I was worried about the pension... ""Then, sure enough, all my worst fears came true. Not long after I went freelance, my stepdaughter died suddenly, and I was unable to take bereavement leave. ""In fact, I went back and did the first show even before her funeral because I had to get some money in. Then, two years after that, I was diagnosed with cancer. ""I had surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy. I worked the whole way through. I took one month off at the end of chemo, actually."" Liz Kershaw hosts a Saturday show on BBC 6 Music She said that about a year ago, she was told she would have to be paid via PAYE for tax purposes - but was told she still would not get sick pay or holiday pay, and was still without a contract. ""None of us take pleasure in being here,"" she added. ""I would rather have sorted this out with the BBC. I entered in to this in good faith. I trusted the BBC, I'm proud to be part of the BBC and I feel I've been hung out to dry, I feel betrayed. ""I ask this - where is their duty of care towards me and my colleagues, because I speak for many, many people in this situation. ""I have seen many women presenters being deprived of maternity leave. I have seen many colleagues deprived of sick pay. And we keep on doing it because we love the job."" Lang was joined on the panel by 6 Music's Liz Kershaw, Radio 4 Money Box's Paul Lewis and Stuart Linnell from Radio Northampton. Lewis told the MPs the BBC had saved around Â£10m per year on National Insurance payments by paying presenters through personal companies. The committee's chairman Damian Collins MP said the BBC had fallen ""well below"" the standards expected in its treatment of staff and said he would demand answers from director general Lord Hall. He also said he was ""disappointed"" that no-one from BBC management had appeared in front of the committee. In a statement, the BBC said it recognised there were ""issues to address"" and had ""always tried to balance our responsibilities to presenters with our responsibility to spend the licence fee appropriately"". Samira Ahmed gave written evidence saying she felt ""hugely bullied"" The corporation has now announced an independent dispute resolution process. It could lead to the BBC paying a share of historical bills, which in some cases run into thousands of pounds. Other presenters gave their stories to the committee in written evidence. They included an unnamed female BBC local radio presenter who said she tried to kill herself, partly because of the stress over her employment arrangements. She told the committee she was ""forced"" to set up a PSC in 2011 - even though she lost out financially as a result. She said she was later forced to work on three-month contracts with ""no sick pay, no holiday, no permanent contract"" opposite a better-paid male staff member who had such benefits. ""I have been paid too little due to the use of incorrect tax codes, been subject to clawback, received no information for months on end as to what I was going to live off,"" she said. ""My mental health deterioration is absolutely linked to the increased stress of working for the BBC. ""I have always loved working for the BBC but the way they have behaved has reduced me to more than tears. It's one of the factors that three days ago took me into my loft where I tried to hang myself."" Another unnamed presenter said: ""My physical and mental health has suffered and the quality of life with my young family has been impacted. In the darkest of days and the spectre of retrospective action from HMRC hanging over me daily, I contemplated taking my own life."" TV and radio presenter Samira Ahmed also gave evidence ahead of the hearing, saying she felt ""hugely bullied"" over her employment status. Mr Collins said the accounts were ""highly disturbing"". He said: ""By allegedly being coerced into these contracts, these individuals may have been denied employment rights, and some face liability for huge tax bills. ""This evidence indicates that the BBC is falling well below the standards we would expect in terms of how it treats its staff."" Presenters will now be able to ask for a review of their cases through the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution. The process will consider whether it is ""appropriate or reasonable"" for the BBC to make a contribution towards historic demands for employers' National Insurance.

Thousands of miles of roads in disrepair,"Some 10% of the road network maintained by local authorities in Great Britain is in poor condition, or has been flagged for further inspection. About 37,000 kilometres (22,990 miles) across England, Wales and Scotland fell below top standard in surveys carried out on behalf of the Department for Transport. The RAC said the road network had suffered from years of underinvestment The government said it was investing Â£6bn in improving local roads. The analysis by the BBC Shared Data Unit comes as a separate investigation by the Asphalt Industry Alliance found more than 39,300 kilometres (24,400 miles) of road had been identified as needing essential maintenance in the next year. Simon Williams, a spokesman for the RAC, said: ""Before the cold snap the condition of many local roads was on a knife edge with many councils struggling to fix our roads properly. ""But now, as a result of the 'Beast from the East' some local roads will have deteriorated even further, possibly to the point that they represent a serious risk to the safety of users."" Keith Ralph, a 37-year-old chef, was commuting through Lewisham in south London in January when he struck a pothole and was hurled from his bike.  He was unconscious for more than a minute. ""It's completely out of the blue, I've been cycling in London for 15 years and have had a couple of close shaves with cars but nothing like this,"" he said. Mr Ralph had CT scans which showed he had a bleed on the right hand side of his brain. He had a splint put into his mouth during emergency dental treatment, which left him physically sick from the pain. He also suffered a cut in his right eyebrow and his chin which required stitches, grazing to his legs and a severely bruised elbow. The pothole in the road where Keith was flung from his bicycle ""It has shaken me up a bit, unexpectedly hitting a pothole and coming out of hospital with those injuries,"" he said.  ""I was lucky the bleed on the brain was sorted out quickly."" Having cycled across London over a long period, Mr Ralph feels the condition of London roads is worsening. ""The roads and potholes are getting more repairs but it doesn't seem to be working and things are coming out quickly. ""In the very centre of London, the roads aren't as bad but it's the busier roads outside of the congestion zone that are definitely getting worse."" You may also be interested in: 10 charts that tell the story of Britain's roads 10% of Wales' roads are in a 'poor condition' Britain's bus coverage hits 28-year low The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed the results of annual surveys, which measure the extent of defects such as bumpiness and cracking of the road surface. In England and Wales, the survey measures the percentage of roads in a poor condition.  In Scotland, it measures the percentage of roads in a poor condition, or requiring further inspection.  Data was not available for Northern Ireland. Some 3% (883km) of A-roads and 5% (14,420km) of minor roads across England in 2016-17 were deemed to be in a poor condition. Over the past eight years, London and the South East were consistently the worst performing regions of the UK. Thirteen out of 151 local authority areas saw an increase in the proportion of their road network deemed poor from 2009 to 2017. They were York, Hartlepool, Wigan, West Sussex, Portsmouth, Stoke on Trent, Solihull, Barking and Dagenham, Kingston upon Thames, Bury, Stockport, Herefordshire and Manchester. Julian Bell, who chairs London Councils' Transport and Environment Committee, said: ""[We] recognise that road quality is an urgent concern and are committed to making improvements to the roads."" However, he said present funding was not enough to meet the needs of London's growing population. Some 10% of all roads in Wales were deemed to be in poor condition in 2016-17.  That works out at 3,110 kilometres (1,930 miles) of road. All local authority areas bar Gwynedd saw the proportion of roads in a poor condition fall in the six-year period.  The condition of Conwy's roads remained roughly stable. Some of the worst performing areas were Powys, Ceredigion and Wrexham. A Welsh Local Government Association spokesman said there had been a downward trend in the proportion of roads deemed poor. He said: ""Clearly, local authorities would like to achieve a high standard on all the roads for which they are responsible. ""The network, as with many capital assets, experiences constant wear and tear and is exposed to a range of challenging weather conditions."" In Scotland, some 30% of A-roads were either in a poor condition, or required further assessment.  That works out at 2,220 kilometres (1,380 miles) of road. Some 35%  - or 16,500 kilometres of minor roads - were deemed in a poor condition, or earmarked for further inspection. Some of the worst performing areas were Argyll and Bute, Eilean Siar, North Ayrshire, Inverclyde and Stirling. According to the insurance firm, Admiral, claims for potholes and road defects in Scotland, were over two thirds higher in comparison to England. Luke Bosdet, the AA's public affairs spokesman, said: ""The poor condition of Scottish roads comes as no surprise. It is a long-running problem, often illustrated by the views of AA members."" A UK government Department for Transport spokesman said: ""This government is taking the big decisions for Britain's future and investing a record Â£23bn on our roads to improve journeys. ""We know that road surfaces are a concern for all road users and that is why we are providing local highway authorities in England with just under Â£6bn to help improve the condition of our local highway networks.""

'Working dads lose out in workplace',"""I came back to a load of photocopying,"" says tax specialist Richard Cahill of his return to work at a major international company after the birth of his second child. ""Basically they wanted to make the point that they weren't happy with me,"" he says of his former employers. He had taken the time offunder government rules which since 2015 have allowed mums and dads to share parental leave,external- but according to a new report from MPs, his story is typical of many working fathers who want to take a more equal share of childcare but fear their employers' reaction if they ask for flexible work. Government efforts to support fathers in the workplace have not yet delivered despite good intentions, saysthe report, from MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee.,external ""Workplace policies have not kept up with the social changes in people's everyday lives,"" according to committee chair Maria Miller, who describes ""outdated assumptions"" about men's and women's roles in relation to work and childcare"" as a further barrier to change. This video can not be played What dads think of paternity increase call Are fathers using their paternity leave? How the rules on parental leave work Richard is married to Helen, who already earned more than him and wanted to keep her high-flying career. They both worked long hours, but decided one of them had to be there for school pick-ups, bath time and bedtime stories, the same as their own parents when they were growing up. ""We were very open and honest with each other,"" he says. So Helen took the first seven months of parental leave after giving birth, and then Richard took the next five months. He had wanted to ask for part-time work - but his difficulties over parental leave suggested there was no point.  So he quit. The MPs found today's fathers were doing a greater proportion of the childcare than ever before - but still only about half the amount women do - and men who are agency or casual workers are least likely to get flexible work that suits their childcare needs, as they don't have access to full employment rights. Richard is well qualified and had been a high earner in a full-time job, but his search for flexible work was frustrating. At interviews, he was too often asked: ""But what is your wife doing? Why isn't your wife picking up the children?"" They found it amazing that a man actually wanted to raise his children, he says. The MPs' report draws onresearch from the charity Working Families,externalwhich showed over half of young fathers want to downshift at work to accommodate family life. The committee recommends a series of changes to make it easier for men to work flexibly, including: all new jobs to be advertised as flexible better workplace rights for fathers who are agency or casual workers a possible 12 weeks dedicated leave for fathers in the child's first year better paternity pay Eventually, Richard applied for a job as a Civil Service economist. ""I raised right at the beginning that I wanted flexible part-time work. ""Their response was, immediately: 'We're not going to pay you very well but we would be absolutely happy and would confidently support you in what you need to do with your family.' ""And they have been absolutely true to their word. I have pretty well got to choose the hours I work."" The government argues that improving fathers' rights is key to improving gender equality in the workplace and cutting the gender pay gap. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy welcomed the report, saying ministers were determined to ensure everyone could  succeed in the workplace. ""We have also launched a campaign to encourage more parents to take up Shared Parental Leave so they can better balance childcare and their careers, and we are launching a taskforce to review how the right to request flexible working is currently being applied."" Richard says his flexible job is worthwhile and enjoyable. And his wife is happy too. ""She enjoys challenging herself and advancing herself. That's great for her. ""I am there for my children. I take my daughter to Cubs after school. I put both children to bed. I bath them... ""The kids are happy. They're not missing out on anything. ""So after a year of struggling a bit we seem to have found a level that works for us as a family."" Are fathers using their paternity leave?

Facebook data - time to act?,"Data about Facebook users is gathered and shared all the time say industry experts The gathering storm over how millions of Facebook profiles were apparently exploited for political purposes raises all sorts of questions about how our data is used. But already some in the data and marketing industries are pouring cold water on the story which theGuardian's Carole Cadwalladr,externalhas pursued with such admirable vigour. ""Nothing very new here,"" they say with a world-weary sigh. ""This sort of thing has been going on for years."" But that surely is the point - we are finally waking up to a murky world where there is little regulation, and companies can trade our personal information without a care. Some in the data industry agree. ""It's a bit like the MPs expenses scandal,"" says Nick Halstead, an entrepreneur who has started several data analytics businesses. He believes, that just as MPs had a rude awakening when they were caught out doing what was accepted practice for years, so data firms and the social media giants will have to change their ways. He says the method used by an academic who ran a personality quiz to gather Facebook data and then allegedly passed it to Cambridge Analytica is a familiar one: ""I can name you 10 companies that have hundreds of millions of Facebook profiles using similar methods."" He says these firms are not doing anything illegal, and although they should not be passing on the data to others, they often do. Mr Halstead thinks a recent change in Facebook's rules for external developers which made it harder for them to simply scrape data from users' public profiles, may be a sign that the company knows there is a problem. It might have another as the public row over the data has hit Facebook shares which were down about 5% as politicians, pundits and regulators queued to demand more information. For Stephanie Hare, a tech expert who has worked in the data field, the Cambridge Analytica story raises big questions over a lack of accountability: ""What is really striking here is the absence of any oversight."" Nobody, she points out - not the social network, nor the data company or the academic researcher - seems to have thought that it was their job to ask if data had been improperly shared, and if so to ensure it was deleted. Questions are being asked about how profile data was gathered She thinks there is going to need to be some kind of regulatory oversight to make sure the rules are followed. Much has been made of the fact that users who sign up to the kind of personality quiz used in this case have to explicitly give permission for their data to be accessed. But Stephanie Hare says it is unfair to put the burden on people with busy lives to read through the fine print. And she feels that Facebook's settings should be set to maximise privacy by default. ""It's our jobs as technologists to design systems that are safe,"" she says. ""I don't get on an aeroplane as a passenger and make my own safety checks."" I spent this morning giving a talk at a school in South Wales about the power of social media platforms to spread fake news. I took some time to explain just how much power Facebook puts in the hands of advertisers - and political parties - to target their messages very precisely at, say, 15-25 year olds in Pontypridd who like motor racing. My audience, all keen users of social media, seemed surprised to learn that Facebook owned Instagram and WhatsApp, and Google owned YouTube, meaning that just two giant companies could exert huge influence over the information they received and how they thought. I also warned them against signing up to quizzes on Facebook and elsewhere. But we are now asking a lot of this generation, demanding that they examine every news story to be certain of its sources, and making them read through arcane privacy statements everywhere they go online. Perhaps it is time for the grownups to give them an online world which is safer by default.

Ministers warned not to 'betray' fishermen,"Some Conservative MPs have expressed disappointment at the outlined fishing deal The UK will regain full control over the country's fishing waters for the first time in 40 years after December 2020, Michael Gove has insisted. The environment secretary said he shared the ""disappointment"" of fishing communities who hoped this would happen on Brexit day, 29 March 2019. But Mr Gove urged them to keep their ""eyes on the prize"" of getting control. Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael, who raised the issue, said ""the mood in fishing communities is one of palpable anger"". The fishing industry had wanted the UK to regain full control over the country's fishing waters on Brexit day, 29 March, 2019. Instead the deal will see the UK ""consulted"" on quotas with the situation remaining largely unchanged until 2021. UK and EU agree Brexit transition terms Deal is done - but work remains What is the Brexit implementation period? Mr Gove said the government had pressed for the UK to be an equal partner in fishing negotiations during the 21-month ""implementation period"" - but the EU had blocked this. ""We were disappointed the EU would not move on this,"" he told MPs, saying that the UK only had to wait a further year for complete control of its waters. ""In December 2020, we will be negotiating fishing opportunities as a third country, an independent coastal state deciding who can access our waters and on what terms for the first time in over 40 years,"" he said. ""It's important that all of us, in every area, accept that the implementation period is a necessary step towards securing that prize. ""For our coastal communities it's an opportunity to revive economically, for our marine environment it is an opportunity to be managed sustainably and it's critical that all of us - in the interests of the whole nation - keep our eyes on that prize."" Michael Gove: ""We didn't get everything we wanted on fishing policy"" But Mr Carmichael replied: ""I have to tell you, if you don't already know it, the mood in fishing communities is one of palpable anger - this is not what they were promised."" He added that if the government can ""let us down like this over a deal for the transitional period, how do we know they will not do it again when it comes to the final deal?"" The SNP's Stephen Gethins asked the minister to say ""at what point our fishermen became a bargaining chip"", adding: ""Or has that been the case all along?"" Mr Gove replied: ""For a party that has raised grievance to an art form, you have a damn cheek making that case."" Former Tory minister John Redwood pressed him to go back to the EU and say ""this deal is unacceptable"". Mr Gove said: ""We didn't get everything we wanted, but... it's the view of this government that we need to make sure this implementation succeeds to get the greater prize at the end of it."" This video can not be played David Davis: Transition is about beginning life outside EU Prominent Eurosceptic Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was ""slightly concerned"" by Mr Gove's tone in relationship to negotiations that the European Commission ""would not allow us something in a negotiation"". Mr Gove said the implementation period would allow the government to prepare ""for all the benefits Brexit will bring"". The Commons exchanges came as Scottish Conservative MPs who held talks with the prime minister on fishing said she ""reassured"" them the UK would take control of its waters after the transition period. Alister Jack, the MP for Dumfries and Galloway, said he felt assured by Mrs May's comments but John Lamont, the MP for Berwickshire. Roxburgh and Selkirk, warned: ""The government should be clear that they are on notice - no deal for fishermen, and they will have to think again on the terms of our departure."" The Daily Telegraph,externalreported that Tory critics of the deal are planning to protest on a boat on the Thames by Parliament on Wednesday. Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, claimed the concession made to the EU in the transitional period was ""shaping up to be a massive sell-out of the Scottish fishing industry by the Tories"". EU fishing deal 'far from acceptable' to Scottish industry Politicians win bid for Article 50 review Labour's shadow fisheries minister Holly Lynch said it was ""understandable"" fishing communities felt ""angry and let down"". Bertie Armstrong, head of the Scottish Fishermen's Association, accused the EU of asking ""for the bargain of a lifetime"" by seeking to keep the UK under Common Fisheries Policy rules for ""as long as physically possible"". Compared with Iceland, which is allowed to keep 90% of fish caught in its waters, the UK keeps 40% under the Common Fisheries Policy, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But Niel Wichmann, head of the Danish Fishermen's Association, said the transition period ""is a sensible agreement which gives us time - a couple of years - to work out how we keep our fishing stocks sustainable, how we keep our fisheries sustainable after Brexit"". On Monday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the legal text of the agreement for the 21 months after Brexit marked a ""decisive step"" but added that it was ""not the end of the road"". The key aspects of the agreement announced in Brussels are: The transitional period will last from Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020 EU citizens arriving in the UK between these two dates will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. The same will apply to UK expats on the continent The UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals during the transition period although they can only come into force from 1 January 2021 The UK will still be party to existing EU trade deals with other countries The UK's share of fishing catch will be guaranteed during transition but the UK will, in effect, remain part of the Common Fisheries Policy, yet without a direct say in its rules, until the end of 2020 Other aspects of the post-Brexit relationship yet to be agreed include what happens to the Northern Ireland border in the longer term.

Zuckerberg pressed,"Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is facing intensified calls to appear in person at investigations into the social network's conduct. His company has been accused of failing to properly inform users that their profile information may have been obtained and kept by Cambridge Analytica, a data firm widely-credited with helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election. Facebook said on Friday it had blocked Cambridge Analytica from Facebook while it investigated claims the London-based firm did not, as promised, delete data that was allegedly obtained using methods that were in violation of Facebook's policies. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. Despite pledging that in 2018 he would ""fix"" his company, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has managed to avoid engaging with the site's growing number of critics - instead sending lawyers or policy bosses to various committee hearings. The 33-year-old's recent remarks on some of Facebook's controversies have been communicated in the relatively safe space of a blog post or video message published on his Facebook page. Facebook and Trump data firm 'misled' MPs US to investigate Trump campaign data firm Tech Tent: Facebook and Google take action With the building row over how Facebookdata may have been used to fuel highly-targeted political propaganda, several influential figures on both side of the Atlantic this weekend said it was time for Mr Zuckerberg to step up to publicly defend - or at least justify - his creation. Some called for investigations into whether Mr Zuckerberg's company may have violated laws governing disclosure of a data breach - and also rules on properly obtaining a user's consent to collect personal information. ""This is a major breach that must be investigated,"" demanded Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. ""Itâs clear these platforms canât police themselves. I've called for more transparency and accountability for online political ads. They say 'trust us'."" She added: ""Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary."" That sentiment was backed by Adam Schiff, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is already investigating social media manipulation in the run up to the 2016 presidential election. ""I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees,"" he told the Washington Post. ""And not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space."" On Sunday morning TV, Florida senator and former presidential hopeful Marco Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press he felt technology companies acted as if they are ""above"" regulations. Eight reasons Facebook has peaked Social networks 'too slow' on changes Facebook broke German privacy laws ""Their growth has been a lot faster than perhaps their ability to mature institutionally from within on some of these challenges that they're facing,"" he said. ""I think another part about it is sometimes these companies grow so fast and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think that perhaps they're above sort of the rules that apply to everybody else."" The man in charge of Britain's investigation into Russian meddling in the democratic process said he too wanted to press Mr Zuckerberg on the issue. ""I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,"" said Damian Collins MP. ""It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers."" This video can not be played In the age of big data, is our democracy open to manipulation? Mr Collins also said he would be recalling Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix to parliament to answer more questions. ""It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and parliament,"" Mr. Collins said. Cambridge Analytica and Mr Nix have denied any wrongdoing. In an attempt to get out ahead of a story in the New York Times and Observer newspapers,Facebook made an announcement late Friday night, California time, that it was blocking Cambridge Analytica from using Facebookwhile it investigated claims the inappropriately-obtained data had not been deleted as promised. This was followed by remarks from Alex Stamos, the firm's chief security officer, who wrote and then deleted a series of tweets. He objected to the word ""breach"" being used to describe how data from as many as 50 million peoples' user profiles may have been obtained without explicit user consent. ""I have deleted my tweets on Cambridge Analytica,"" he later wrote. ""Not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in."" Christopher Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica, revealed how it and its partners harvested data belonging to mostly US voters. Over the weekend, he announced he had been suspended from Facebook. On top of its initial statement, Facebook on Sunday said it was conducting a ""comprehensive internal and external review"" into whether the data, gathered via an app created by Global Science Research (GSR), still existed. GSR was set up by University of Cambridge associate professor Aleksandr Kogan and his colleague Joseph Chancellor. According to the Guardian, Mr Chancellor was given a job at Facebook as a researcher just months after GSR carried out the data-gathering exercise that Facebook now says violated its policies. Facebook has not commented on the calls for Mr Zuckerberg to appear in front of the several committees expressing a desire to hear from him. But one analyst warned that this controversy is a direct threat to Facebook's business model, and therefore Mr Zuckerberg will be expected to put investors at ease, sooner rather than later. ""This has potential to grow into something a lot more onerous,"" said Daniel Ives from GBH Insight. ""So he has to get ahead of this storm before it turns into a hurricane.""

'Little price impact' from axing EU tariffs,"Consumers have already seen prices rise by 2% since the referendum, the IFS said Consumers could see prices fall by up to 1.2% if Britain were to abolish all tariffs once it has left the European Union, a report says. But the study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that any gains would be small and were based on ""optimistic"" assumptions. It also said that consumers had already seen prices rise by 2% since the referendum due to the weaker pound. Costs linked to new EU trade barriers could also hit consumers, it said. Those increased costs would ""offset"" any ""rather limited"" gains from becoming tariff free in the future, the report from the think tank says. ""We estimate that complete abolition of all tariffs would reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7-1.2%,"" the report says. ""This could have additional positive economic benefits in the long run but could also be very damaging for some UK industries in the short run."" Tariffs - taxes on imports - are often used to protect parts of a country's economy such as farming and car manufacturing. Abandoning tariffs would mean greater competition for those sectors from abroad which could mean job losses, for example. Following that period, many economists argue that increased competition generally lowers prices for consumers. The IFS suggests some of the short-term economic damage could be alleviated by only reducing tariffs on products Britain does not produce in very high quantities but at present do face high tariffs on entering the EU's customs union, such as olives and oranges. ""This would result in much smaller gains, reducing the total cost of the basket of goods purchased by the typical household by less than 0.4%,"" the IFS said. ""This compares with the estimated 2% increase in prices that followed the depreciation in sterling in the wake of the referendum result. ""This suggests that the scale of 'quick wins' from running an independent trade policy is relatively small."" The report says that average tariffs applied to UK imports as part of the EU's customs union are around 2.8%. It also says that of every Â£100 spent by UK households, only Â£26 is affected, directly or indirectly, by the import prices of goods on which tariffs are charged. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, told the BBC: ""If we leave the customs union, we can come to our own trade deals with other countries, we can reduce tariffs. ""But even if we reduce that as much as possible, the effect on prices will be really quite small relative to what is still a big cost of leaving the customs union because it would make trade with the rest of Europe so much more expensive.""

Corbyn: UK has to do business with Putin,"Vladimir Putin was re-elected for his fourth term as president Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK must still deal with Russia despite ""all fingers"" pointing to it over the Salisbury spy attack. He said he would ""do business"" with Vladimir Putin but assertively and on the basis of the UK's values. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says he believes Mr Putin was responsible. But Mr Corbyn said he wanted ""an absolutely definitive answer"" about the source of the nerve agent used in the attempted murder before blaming Moscow. In a wide-ranging interview with Radio 4'sWorld at One,Mr Corbyn said if he won power, he would challenge the newly re-elected president on human rights and the whole basis of the UK's relationship with Moscow. Russia stockpiling nerve agent - Johnson Labour row over Corbyn stance on Russia Putin ready for 'constructive' dialogue Former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench on 4 March. They had been exposed to a nerve agent. The 23 Russian diplomats expelled from London after Theresa May told the Commons that Russia was ""culpable"" for the attack are due to leave on Tuesday. A removal van is reportedly in the embassy grounds, the BBC understands. The PM will also chair a meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday to consider possible further steps against Russia. Moscow has denied all involvement, and is expelling 23 British diplomats in turn. Meanwhile, the head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, said the focus of the Salisbury investigation is ""on the movements of the Skripals"". Mr Corbynhas been criticisedby Tory and some Labour MPs for not blaming the Russian state categorically for the attack. In an interview to be broadcast on Tuesday, he told The World at One people should ""not shoot from the hip"" and instead wait for experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to complete their work testing the poison, again repeating his call for Russia to be sent samples of the nerve agent to identify. ""All fingers point towards Russia's involvement in this, and obviously the manufacture of the material was undertaken by the Russian state originally,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said the UK should deal with Russia on the basis of its own principles ""What I'm saying is the weapons were made from Russia, clearly. ""I think Russia has to be held responsible for it but there has to be an absolutely definitive answer to the question where did the nerve agent come from?"" He added: ""I asked the Russians be given a sample so that they can say categorically one way or the other."" On Sunday, Mr McDonnell - one of Mr Corbyn's closest allies - said he agreed with the prime minister that ""whichever way you look at it"", Vladimir Putin ""is responsible and all the evidence points to him"" - adding that it was ""highly likely"" to have been an attempted state execution. Asked if he agreed with Mr McDonnell on this point, Mr Corbyn said: ""I think John put the case there that it's highly likely that there's Russian involvement in it."" He said all countries, not just Russia, had to abide by the Chemical Weapons Convention and that the UK should maintain a robust dialogue with Moscow on a range of issues rather than shunning it. ""Would I do business with Putin, sure? And I'd challenge him on human rights in Russia, challenge him on these issues and challenge him on that whole basis of that relationship. ""You have to deal with people who are in the position they are as head of state,"" he added What are Novichok nerve agents? Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Russian spy: What we know so far ""Russia is a huge country that suffered more than anyone else in the Second World War and we have to recognise that there has to be a relationship with Russia. Robust, yes, assertive, yes, demanding yes, but there has to be a relationship."" In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the Russian president was taking his country in a ""dangerous direction"", with his actions at home and abroad clearly linked. ""The obvious Russian-ness of the weapon was designed to send a signal to anyone pondering dissent amid the intensifying repression of Mr Putin's Russia,"" he wrote. ""The message is clear: we will hunt you down, we will find you and we will kill you - and though we will scornfully deny our guilt, the world will know that Russia did it."" Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg also argued that the prime minister is ""a very cautious leader"" who would not have made the claims she has about Russia ""without being very convinced that we have the evidence"". He told Nick Ferrari's LBC radio programme that Russia has not behaved as a ""normal nation behaves"", through its invasion of Georgia and Ukraine sovereign territory and ""its willingness to murder people in British streets - that's not how a normal nation behaves and we can't allow that to go unnoticed, unresponded to.""

FBI 'investigating new blast' in Texas,"This video can not be played Texas explosions: The search for the suspect US President Donald Trump has said that a series of deadly bombings in Texas were carried out by ""sick people"", and also pledged justice for the victims. ""We're looking. It's not easy to find,"" Mr Trump said on Tuesday after a parcel bomb exploded at a FedEx depot - the fifth bomb to explode in recent days. US authorities are probing whether that incident is connected to a series of bomb attacks targeting Austin. Tuesday night's explosive was due to be shipped to that city, local police say. ""The bombings in Austin are terrible,"" Mr Trump told reporters before a meeting at the White House with Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""This is obviously a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals,"" he added. ""We will get to the bottom of it. We will be very strong."" The incident occurred at 00:30 (05:30 GMT) in Schertz, 65 miles (104km) south of the city of Austin, where four bombs have killed two people in recent weeks. One person was lightly injured but did not require treatment, police said. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency suspected a link to previous bombings in the state FBI spokeswoman Michelle Lee told US media that the agency believed the blast in Schertz could be connected to the previous attacks. Local media, citing law enforcement sources, report that the bomb which went off in Schertz was addressed to Austin. The bomb which exploded in Schertz was filled with nails and shrapnel, officials say. It went off as it was moving from an upper conveyor belt to a lower one, the news4sanantonio website reports.,external A female employee standing nearby was treated at the scene for a possible concussion, the website adds. About 75 employees were working in the depot at the time. Hours after the blast, police said a hazardous materials team had been sent to a FedEx shipping facility near Austin's airport to check reports of a suspicious package. If the explosion in Schertz is linked to the previous four, it will be the first time the bomber has used the mail. Three of the four devices were hidden in parcels left at residential addresses in Austin while police say the fourth was probably activated by a tripwire: The first device exploded on 2 March, killing Anthony Stephan House, 39, at his home On 13 March,Draylen William Mason, 17, was killed and his mother was critically injured when he brought a package inside his home from the doorstep Hours later on 13 March, a 75-year-old Hispanic woman, who has not been named, was injured by another package On 18 March, a device injured two men who may have set off a tripwire while walking along a street in the south-west of the city Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Austin Five bombs in 18 days and still no real idea of motive. That's the position the police and the FBI find themselves in as they analyse the latest blast, this time at a FedEx warehouse. What seems clear is that they're dealing with someone or some group that has a significant level of knowledge of bomb making and who seem set on keeping the authorities guessing. Even with $115,000 worth of reward on offer, there's still no sign of a promising lead. There's understandable nervousness in Austin itself. The sheer geographical spread of the bombings making everyone feel vulnerable. However, talking to some in the city last night, there was also a determination not to let the bomber get the upper hand. ""I decided I was still going to go out to dinner,"" one young woman told me. But there was some frustration too. One drinker in a pub I met said he felt the police were being slow in tracking the bomber down. Until they do, Texas is holding its breath, wondering where the next strike could come. Investigators initially said they were looking at a possible racial motivation for the attacks, which had killed two black men and injured a Hispanic woman. However, the two men injured in the 18 March blast were both white. 'Serial bomber' suspected in Austin blasts ""With this tripwire, this changes things,"" said Christopher Combs, the special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio office. ""It's more sophisticated. It's not targeted to individuals. We're very concerned that with tripwires, a child could be walking down the sidewalk and hit something."" Fred Milanowski, the special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Houston, said the agency had a ""high degree of confidence that the same individual built all these devices"". Mr Combs said more than 350 FBI special agents had been drafted in to work on the investigation, calling it an ""unprecedented response."" Mr Trump praised the inter-agency response, but added: ""We have to produce, we have to find this very sick person or people."" ""We have to find them, really, immediately,"" he continued. The FBI made a rare public appeal to the bomber to get in touch. ""We would really like the bomber to contact us so we can talk to him,"" Mr Combs said. Austin police have offered a $100,000 (Â£71,340) reward for information, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott has offered an additional $15,000.

EU agreement 'betrays' UK fishermen,"Some Conservative MPs have expressed disappointment at the outlined fishing deal The UK will regain full control over the country's fishing waters for the first time in 40 years after December 2020, Michael Gove has insisted. The environment secretary said he shared the ""disappointment"" of fishing communities who hoped this would happen on Brexit day, 29 March 2019. But Mr Gove urged them to keep their ""eyes on the prize"" of getting control. Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael, who raised the issue, said ""the mood in fishing communities is one of palpable anger"". The fishing industry had wanted the UK to regain full control over the country's fishing waters on Brexit day, 29 March, 2019. Instead the deal will see the UK ""consulted"" on quotas with the situation remaining largely unchanged until 2021. UK and EU agree Brexit transition terms Deal is done - but work remains What is the Brexit implementation period? Mr Gove said the government had pressed for the UK to be an equal partner in fishing negotiations during the 21-month ""implementation period"" - but the EU had blocked this. ""We were disappointed the EU would not move on this,"" he told MPs, saying that the UK only had to wait a further year for complete control of its waters. ""In December 2020, we will be negotiating fishing opportunities as a third country, an independent coastal state deciding who can access our waters and on what terms for the first time in over 40 years,"" he said. ""It's important that all of us, in every area, accept that the implementation period is a necessary step towards securing that prize. ""For our coastal communities it's an opportunity to revive economically, for our marine environment it is an opportunity to be managed sustainably and it's critical that all of us - in the interests of the whole nation - keep our eyes on that prize."" Michael Gove: ""We didn't get everything we wanted on fishing policy"" But Mr Carmichael replied: ""I have to tell you, if you don't already know it, the mood in fishing communities is one of palpable anger - this is not what they were promised."" He added that if the government can ""let us down like this over a deal for the transitional period, how do we know they will not do it again when it comes to the final deal?"" The SNP's Stephen Gethins asked the minister to say ""at what point our fishermen became a bargaining chip"", adding: ""Or has that been the case all along?"" Mr Gove replied: ""For a party that has raised grievance to an art form, you have a damn cheek making that case."" Former Tory minister John Redwood pressed him to go back to the EU and say ""this deal is unacceptable"". Mr Gove said: ""We didn't get everything we wanted, but... it's the view of this government that we need to make sure this implementation succeeds to get the greater prize at the end of it."" This video can not be played David Davis: Transition is about beginning life outside EU Prominent Eurosceptic Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was ""slightly concerned"" by Mr Gove's tone in relationship to negotiations that the European Commission ""would not allow us something in a negotiation"". Mr Gove said the implementation period would allow the government to prepare ""for all the benefits Brexit will bring"". The Commons exchanges came as Scottish Conservative MPs who held talks with the prime minister on fishing said she ""reassured"" them the UK would take control of its waters after the transition period. Alister Jack, the MP for Dumfries and Galloway, said he felt assured by Mrs May's comments but John Lamont, the MP for Berwickshire. Roxburgh and Selkirk, warned: ""The government should be clear that they are on notice - no deal for fishermen, and they will have to think again on the terms of our departure."" The Daily Telegraph,externalreported that Tory critics of the deal are planning to protest on a boat on the Thames by Parliament on Wednesday. Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, claimed the concession made to the EU in the transitional period was ""shaping up to be a massive sell-out of the Scottish fishing industry by the Tories"". EU fishing deal 'far from acceptable' to Scottish industry Politicians win bid for Article 50 review Labour's shadow fisheries minister Holly Lynch said it was ""understandable"" fishing communities felt ""angry and let down"". Bertie Armstrong, head of the Scottish Fishermen's Association, accused the EU of asking ""for the bargain of a lifetime"" by seeking to keep the UK under Common Fisheries Policy rules for ""as long as physically possible"". Compared with Iceland, which is allowed to keep 90% of fish caught in its waters, the UK keeps 40% under the Common Fisheries Policy, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But Niel Wichmann, head of the Danish Fishermen's Association, said the transition period ""is a sensible agreement which gives us time - a couple of years - to work out how we keep our fishing stocks sustainable, how we keep our fisheries sustainable after Brexit"". On Monday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the legal text of the agreement for the 21 months after Brexit marked a ""decisive step"" but added that it was ""not the end of the road"". The key aspects of the agreement announced in Brussels are: The transitional period will last from Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020 EU citizens arriving in the UK between these two dates will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. The same will apply to UK expats on the continent The UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals during the transition period although they can only come into force from 1 January 2021 The UK will still be party to existing EU trade deals with other countries The UK's share of fishing catch will be guaranteed during transition but the UK will, in effect, remain part of the Common Fisheries Policy, yet without a direct say in its rules, until the end of 2020 Other aspects of the post-Brexit relationship yet to be agreed include what happens to the Northern Ireland border in the longer term.

Briton investigated for Nazi war crimes,"Investigators were preparing to search the home of Stanislaw Chrzanowski in Telford when he died A pensioner has become the first person from the UK to be investigated in Germany for his alleged role in the Holocaust in World War Two. Stanislaw Chrzanowski, 96, from Shropshire, was being investigated in Munich for the murder of civilians in his home town of Slonim in Belarus. He died in October not knowing he was under investigation. German prosecutors confirmed they were now looking through immigration records for possible new suspects in the UK. The unprecedented case has been hailed a landmark in Nazi war crime investigations, clarifying to German prosecutors who they can investigate. Mr Chrzanowski is believed to have murdered civilians while an auxiliary with the Germans in his hometown of Slonim They say it means anyone who served in a German unit can now be prosecuted - regardless of their nationality, the nationality of their victims or where the crimes were committed - as long as there is an accusation of murder. Meanwhile, a separate BBC investigation has identified a roster of auxiliary policemen who served the Nazis in Slonim who could also potentially face investigation. Midlands Live: Man dies after trapping head at cinema; Murder charge over 'car drag' death Mr Chrzanowski, who lived in Hadley, Telford, came to Britain after being taken as a prisoner of war and joining Allied forces. His case was first brought to the attention of British police when his stepson John Kingston, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, sent a dossier of evidence to the Metropolitan Police's war crimes unit. He suspected his stepfather because of stories he allegedly told Mr Kingston when he was a child. Ratko Mladic jailed for life over Bosnia war genocide WATCH: Man, 93, recalls fleeing Nazi Germany This video can not be played Should Nazi war criminals face justice? Berliners have their say In the 1990s, Mr Kingston, who died last week, went to Slonim where he met people who claimed they saw Mr Chrzanowski, an auxiliary working with invading Nazi troops, shooting prisoners at the death pits in the forests. He was questioned by Met detectives, but no action was taken as the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence. The case was reopened a year ago when Nazi war crime prosecutors based in Ludwigsburg, Germany, asked to see the interviews. Mr Chrzanowski, who also lived in Holmfirth for a short time, had always denied he was a war criminal. About 40,000 people are believed to have died in Slonim Thomas Will, deputy Nazi war crime prosecutor in Ludwigsburg, believed there was sufficient evidence from the accounts to launch a criminal investigation and the federal court ruled last July that he could be tried in Germany, passing the case to prosecutors. Holocaust law wields a 'blunt instrument' against Poland's past Holocaust Memorial Day: A Nazi in the family Shortly before he died, Mr Kingston said: ""I think it's good that Germany should actually do something to try to put the past right. ""My stepfather is just one individual, and there were thousands like him, so it's more important that he's an example or a case in particular."" Andrej Umanski, a legal expert at Cologne University, said: ""I would say we are pushing the law to its maximum and showing that crimes like this will be punished even 70 years afterwards because they were so grave."" The Stanislaw Chrzanowski investigation sends out a clear message: Germany has unfinished business when it comes to prosecuting Nazi collaborators. This unprecedented move to investigate a UK resident has been made by a new generation of German prosecutors determined to make up for past failings to bring perpetrators to justice. Even though Mr Chrzanowski and his alleged victims were not German, and his alleged crimes took place outside of Germany, it was ruled that the simple fact he was part of the Nazi German function meant he could be prosecuted. The impact of this means we're likely to see more trials - and they could involve British citizens. I understand legal authorities in Germany have already started to look for possible new suspected Nazi collaborators in the UK following the Chrzanowski investigation, with immigration records being assessed. Mr Chrzanowski came to England in 1944 after being taken as a prisoner of war and joining the Allied forces A BBC investigation with leading holocaust researcher Dr Stephen Ankier has uncovered a roster of auxiliary policemen who served the Nazis in Slonim. Dr Ankier located the roster, which listed 116 names, including Mr Chrzanowski's. Being a member of the auxiliaries does not mean these people are guilty of war crimes, but the post-war trial of Slonim commander Gerhard Erren in Hamburg in 1974 showed some auxiliaries took part in executions. It is believed others named on the list also switched to join the Allies and ended up in the UK. Most are now believed to be dead. The BBC did not find any evidence linking Mr Chrzanowski directly with war crimes.

'Little price impact' from axing EU tariffsThe Institute for Fiscal Studies says any Brexit gains to consumers would be wiped-out by a weak pound.10h10 hours agoBusiness,"Consumers have already seen prices rise by 2% since the referendum, the IFS said Consumers could see prices fall by up to 1.2% if Britain were to abolish all tariffs once it has left the European Union, a report says. But the study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that any gains would be small and were based on ""optimistic"" assumptions. It also said that consumers had already seen prices rise by 2% since the referendum due to the weaker pound. Costs linked to new EU trade barriers could also hit consumers, it said. Those increased costs would ""offset"" any ""rather limited"" gains from becoming tariff free in the future, the report from the think tank says. ""We estimate that complete abolition of all tariffs would reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7-1.2%,"" the report says. ""This could have additional positive economic benefits in the long run but could also be very damaging for some UK industries in the short run."" Tariffs - taxes on imports - are often used to protect parts of a country's economy such as farming and car manufacturing. Abandoning tariffs would mean greater competition for those sectors from abroad which could mean job losses, for example. Following that period, many economists argue that increased competition generally lowers prices for consumers. The IFS suggests some of the short-term economic damage could be alleviated by only reducing tariffs on products Britain does not produce in very high quantities but at present do face high tariffs on entering the EU's customs union, such as olives and oranges. ""This would result in much smaller gains, reducing the total cost of the basket of goods purchased by the typical household by less than 0.4%,"" the IFS said. ""This compares with the estimated 2% increase in prices that followed the depreciation in sterling in the wake of the referendum result. ""This suggests that the scale of 'quick wins' from running an independent trade policy is relatively small."" The report says that average tariffs applied to UK imports as part of the EU's customs union are around 2.8%. It also says that of every Â£100 spent by UK households, only Â£26 is affected, directly or indirectly, by the import prices of goods on which tariffs are charged. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, told the BBC: ""If we leave the customs union, we can come to our own trade deals with other countries, we can reduce tariffs. ""But even if we reduce that as much as possible, the effect on prices will be really quite small relative to what is still a big cost of leaving the customs union because it would make trade with the rest of Europe so much more expensive.""

"'Working dads lose out in workplace'Many fathers want to share childcare but fear asking for flexible work, says report.3h3 hours agoFamily & Education","""I came back to a load of photocopying,"" says tax specialist Richard Cahill of his return to work at a major international company after the birth of his second child. ""Basically they wanted to make the point that they weren't happy with me,"" he says of his former employers. He had taken the time offunder government rules which since 2015 have allowed mums and dads to share parental leave,external- but according to a new report from MPs, his story is typical of many working fathers who want to take a more equal share of childcare but fear their employers' reaction if they ask for flexible work. Government efforts to support fathers in the workplace have not yet delivered despite good intentions, saysthe report, from MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee.,external ""Workplace policies have not kept up with the social changes in people's everyday lives,"" according to committee chair Maria Miller, who describes ""outdated assumptions"" about men's and women's roles in relation to work and childcare"" as a further barrier to change. This video can not be played What dads think of paternity increase call Are fathers using their paternity leave? How the rules on parental leave work Richard is married to Helen, who already earned more than him and wanted to keep her high-flying career. They both worked long hours, but decided one of them had to be there for school pick-ups, bath time and bedtime stories, the same as their own parents when they were growing up. ""We were very open and honest with each other,"" he says. So Helen took the first seven months of parental leave after giving birth, and then Richard took the next five months. He had wanted to ask for part-time work - but his difficulties over parental leave suggested there was no point.  So he quit. The MPs found today's fathers were doing a greater proportion of the childcare than ever before - but still only about half the amount women do - and men who are agency or casual workers are least likely to get flexible work that suits their childcare needs, as they don't have access to full employment rights. Richard is well qualified and had been a high earner in a full-time job, but his search for flexible work was frustrating. At interviews, he was too often asked: ""But what is your wife doing? Why isn't your wife picking up the children?"" They found it amazing that a man actually wanted to raise his children, he says. The MPs' report draws onresearch from the charity Working Families,externalwhich showed over half of young fathers want to downshift at work to accommodate family life. The committee recommends a series of changes to make it easier for men to work flexibly, including: all new jobs to be advertised as flexible better workplace rights for fathers who are agency or casual workers a possible 12 weeks dedicated leave for fathers in the child's first year better paternity pay Eventually, Richard applied for a job as a Civil Service economist. ""I raised right at the beginning that I wanted flexible part-time work. ""Their response was, immediately: 'We're not going to pay you very well but we would be absolutely happy and would confidently support you in what you need to do with your family.' ""And they have been absolutely true to their word. I have pretty well got to choose the hours I work."" The government argues that improving fathers' rights is key to improving gender equality in the workplace and cutting the gender pay gap. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy welcomed the report, saying ministers were determined to ensure everyone could  succeed in the workplace. ""We have also launched a campaign to encourage more parents to take up Shared Parental Leave so they can better balance childcare and their careers, and we are launching a taskforce to review how the right to request flexible working is currently being applied."" Richard says his flexible job is worthwhile and enjoyable. And his wife is happy too. ""She enjoys challenging herself and advancing herself. That's great for her. ""I am there for my children. I take my daughter to Cubs after school. I put both children to bed. I bath them... ""The kids are happy. They're not missing out on anything. ""So after a year of struggling a bit we seem to have found a level that works for us as a family."" Are fathers using their paternity leave?

Cannabis plea boy to petition No 10,"Alfie's mother Hannah Deacon has appealed to the government to act A six-year-old boy with epilepsy has presented a petition to No 10 calling for him to be granted a special licence to use medical cannabis. Alfie Dingley has a very rare form of the illness that causes up to 150 seizures per month. His parents want the government to let him use cannabis oil - which is banned in the UK - to help with his symptoms. Earlier this month, ministers said they were ""exploring every option"" after meeting with the family. Alfie and his mother, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, presented the petition, which has more than 370,000 signatures, to the government. His family said thousands of Alfie's supporters had written to their local MPs urging them to meet the family. Cannabis oil is available for medical purposes in the Netherlands. Alfie's family have previously travelled there to get him cannabis-based treatment and said the results were ""dramatic"" - reducing his seizures in a month to only one that was less severe. His mother, Hannah Deacon, said: ""This isn't a time for bureaucracy - this is a time for compassion. ""I don't want to break the law by going to Holland and bringing his medical cannabis into the UK illegally. And why should I have to do that?"" Alfie Dingley and his family have paid for treatment in the Netherlands The petition comes afterformer justice minister Mike Penning urged the Home Office to grant the licence ""immediately"". He said although there was substantial evidence that cannabis was a harmful drug, ""surely in the 21st Century we can find an acceptable way to separate the two, so that patients who gain relief from the use of the drug are legally and safely able to do so"". Earlier this month,the Home Office said it was considering allowing a medical cannabis trial to treat Alfie.However, it has stressed that ""no decisions have been made"". On Tuesday, Policing Minister Nick Hurd said he was ""hugely sympathetic"" to the situation facing Alfie and his family and was ""determined to explore every option"". ""As we have consistently said, any proposal would need to be led by senior clinicians using sufficient evidence."" The department hadpreviously turned down requests by the family to legally take the drug,saying that cannabis cannot be practically prescribed, administered or supplied to the public and can only be used for research under a licence.

Police call for 'counter-terror citizens',"The Westminster attack on 22 March 2017 was one of five major terror attacks on UK soil within six months Police are asking the public for more help in thwarting terror attacks after more than a fifth of calls to them yielded useful intelligence last year. The Metropolitan Police's Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said: ""If you feel nervous about it, you should report it"". He added that police want every good citizen to become ""a counter-terrorism citizen"". It comes as police launch their Action Counters Terrorism campaign. The campaign -  encouraging people to report suspicious behaviour - comes as figures reveal 30,984 reports were made to counter-terror officers in 2017. New group aims to tackle terrorism Tube bomber's foster mum 'felt betrayed' More than 6,000 of those reports helped inform live investigations, police say. Mr Basu added: ""It's long been a mantra in counter-terrorism policing that we want every good police officer to be a counter-terrorism officer. ""This is an opportunity for every good citizen to be a counter-terrorism citizen."" The call for action from the public comes just before the first anniversary of the Westminster attack in 2017, which was one of five terror attacks which took place in the space of six months. Figures show the police and MI5 are running more than 600 counter-terror investigations relating to about 3,000 individuals. Examples of suspicious activity include receiving deliveries for unusual items bought online, travelling for long periods without being clear where, and taking photos of security measures or CCTV cameras.

Easter eggs 'up to one third packaging',"Thorntons Classic egg comes with substantial packaging As much as a third of the weight of an Easter egg is still the cardboard and plastic packaging it comes in, according to research by Which?. However, manufacturers have made big strides to make sure such packaging can be recycled, the consumer group said. Its research looked at the 10 top-selling eggs in the UK. Thorntons Classic Large Egg had the highest proportion of packaging - 36% of its weight. The firm said this was to maintain freshness and quality. ""All of the packaging used in the Thorntons Classic Collection Easter egg is recyclable, with the exception of the small plastic window film on the carton which contains the Classic collection chocolates,"" the company said. ""In addition to being recyclable, the fitment that protects the egg is itself made from 50% recycled plastic."" Overall, Which? said that packaging accounted for about 25% of the weight of the most popular eggs. But almost all of the cardboard and plastic used in Easter eggs could now be recycled, it said. The industry was previously criticised for producing packaging that could only be placed in landfill. ""It's great to see that some manufacturers have taken on board concerns about excessive packaging and that chocolate lovers can enjoy their eggs without too much compromise,"" said Nikki Stopford, director of research at Which?. Nevertheless, the research would help shoppers who want to cut down on excess packaging, she said. Lindt says it uses recyclable materials wherever possible Among other Easter eggs found by Which? with a high proportion of packaging were: Lindt Lindor milk chocolate egg with truffles (28% packaging) Mars milk chocolate Easter egg and bar (25.5%) Cadbury Creme giant egg (25.1%) Lindt - which is based in Switzerland - said it used recyclable materials wherever possible, but it also tried to source packaging locally, to minimise transport. ""As it is for all our raw materials, we take our responsibility towards the environment extremely seriously, and make sustainability a priority also for our packaging,"" a Lindt spokeswoman said. She also said the packaging was important for transporting the eggs, and keeping them hygienic. Most of the plastic packaging on Easter eggs is recyclable, and uses the same type of plastic that bottles are made of. Foil can also be recycled, with experts recommending consumers clean it first, then scrunch it into a ball. However, plastic typically used to wrap chocolate bars cannot yet be recycled.

Class A drugs 'brought in for patients',"Class A drugs were allegedly brought into the unit A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations of staff at a mental health trust in Essex bringing in drugs for vulnerable patients. The BBC was told Class A drugs had been brought on to secure, locked wards - and that the trust had been alerted. The Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) has launched an inquiry into the allegations. It said it was unaware of them and that it worked with Essex police liaison officers to monitor issues. Relatives and patients claimed drugs were rife at some of the mental health units run by EPUT. Jane's (not her real name) daughter was able to obtain drugs while she was on a locked ward and had to be taken to accident and emergency as a result. ""Obviously that was extremely worrying, that this could be happening when she was supposed to be being kept safe,"" Jane said. ""There was no investigation. It was more seen as a misbehaviour on the part of my daughter rather than an issue that the trust was dealing with."" Karen (not her real name) has been a patient at the trust for three years and said she had been offered drugs. She said staff were well aware of this, particularly when cannabis was being smoked. ""There was a very, very strong smell of cannabis throughout the whole ward and the staff were aware of the smell, but they didn't do anything about it,"" she said. Mental health deaths probed at Essex NHS trust Karen claimed staff did not only condone drugs in some units, but that other patients told her staff were supplying their drugs. ""When I've asked them how they've got them because they're not allowed out they said, 'oh, so-and-so has done it and named a number of people, they've named the staff'."" The BBC was told by other sources that trust managers had been alerted to Class A drugs on secure wards and were told on at least one occasion that it was staff who had brought in the drugs. The trust told the BBC it was unaware of any allegations regarding staff involvement with illicit drugs being brought on to its facilities. After receiving our allegations, it has now opened an investigation. The Trust said it had recently strengthened its search policy and that CCTV and drug sniffer dogs are used to deter drugs and alcohol getting into units. The trust is also facing new allegations of patients engaging in sexual relationships with staff. Karen said she had been in a relationship with a healthcare worker for five months. ""He was bringing me my phone charger, bringing me in Lucozade and putting alcohol in it and getting me drunk. ""No-one - no-one picked up on anything. No-one questioned anything. No-one said a word."" A trust spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases because of strict confidentiality rules. They added that if an allegation was made against a member of staff they would ""follow the national and local safeguarding advice on investigating it and reporting it"". Relatives also told the BBC about sex happening between patients on mixed wards and this resulted in a sexual assault case being reported to the trust. The trust said inappropriate sexual contact between patients is treated as a safeguarding matter. In the past year it has investigated 13 cases involving sexual contact between patients - four have been sent to the police including one alleged sexual assault. The trust has set up a helpline for patients who have been affected by some of the issues raised by the BBC. It will be open from 20:00 on 20 March, and the number is 01268 739182.

Xi warns against China complacency,"Xi Jinping laid out his grand vision for China's future Chinese President Xi Jinping has delivered a fervently nationalistic closing speech to parliament, painting China as the rising global power. Mr Xi said ""achieving total unity"" was the ""collective hope of all Chinese people"" and any attempts to divide it were ""doomed to fail"". The speech was a strong warning against any attempt at separatism from places like Taiwan and Hong Kong. Mr Xi also warned China could not be complacent about its development. Meanwhile, Premier Li Keqiang used his once-a-year news conference to say China was committed to global co-operation on trade. He said China would further open up its economy and ""ensure that both domestic and foreign firms"" were ""able to compete on fair terms in China's large market"". Chinese officials have made similar pledges in the past. China's new anti-corruption super agency How China will change after the NPC The president who lived in a cave The premier's comments are a marked contrast to the recent protectionist rhetoric and threats of tariffs from the Trump administration in the US. Xi Jinping became president in 2013 andnow looks likely to lead China indefinitely,after the National People's Congress (NPC) - a rubber-stamp parliamentary session that meets once a year - voted to remove a two-term limit on the presidency from the constitution. He is now considered the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China, and has further cemented his positionby moving many of his key allies in to leadership roles during the NPC. The president urged lawmakers to rule in the interest of the people In his speech in the Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi highlighted major achievements of Chinese history, like the invention of gunpowder and the writings of Confucius. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Taiwan - the flashpoint island He laid out his own grand vision for China, saying history had proven that ""only socialism can save China"". Chinese people, he said, ""have the spirit of fighting the bloody battle against our enemies to the bitter end"". By Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing In a way it wasn't so much what Xi Jinping said in his Congress closing speech that matters but the fact that he said it. This had traditionally been a day for China's number two leader, the premier, to dominate the stage with an annual press conference. Not any more: President Xi emerges with a keynote speech pushing nationalist buttons and, all of a sudden, he is on the front page where he wants to be. The pushing of Premier Li Keqiang to one side will not seem strange to China watchers, who have seen an already powerful Xi Jinping becoming virtually untouchable at this Congress. The limited check-and-balance provision of presidential term limits has gone; his philosophy under his own name is in the country's constitution; his chief tool for destroying enemies - the anti-corruption crackdown - has been widened into other parts of society and it's hard to see who is left to be able to challenge President Xi in any way whatsoever. Pointing at China's global ambitions, he said his country would be strong but not aggressive and would not develop itself at the expense of the rest of the world. But he warned that China had to be united to prosper, and it was ""absolutely impossible to separate any inch of our great country's territory from China"". ""All acts and tricks to separate the country are doomed to fail and will be condemned by the people and punished by history."" The comments were a clear warning to places like Taiwan, which is self-ruling but considered by Beijing to be a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary. The issue remains a major potential flashpoint. Last week US President Donald Trump angered Beijing by signing a new law which encourages the sending of top officials to Taiwan to meet their counterparts there, and vice-versa. When asked about Mr Xi's speech, Taiwanese foreign ministry spokesman said he hoped ""countries of similar ideology"", such as the US, Japan and the EU, would support Taiwan's role in maintaining regional peace. There have also been vocal calls for greater autonomy or even independence for Hong Kong in recent years - and China says it is fightingan Islamist separatist insurgency in Xinjiang province. China said it will thwart any Taiwanese separatist attempts Dissenting voices or protests are not tolerated at the NPC, which brings together 3,000 delegates who are theoretically elected but in reality handpicked by the government. Among other major changes this year,the NPC confirmed a major shake-up of ministries, introducing several new bodies overseeing areas like the environment, army veterans and culture. Key positions including the central bank head and chief economic adviser were appointed, and the NPC ratified a law to set up a new powerful anti-corruption agency, far extending the reach of Mr Xi's flagship campaign. The anti-corruption drive has seen more than a million officials disciplined, but is seen by some observers as a tool to sideline his political rivals. Yi Gang to head up China's central bank The man Xi turns to on the economy China's Congress: Eye rolls and tame questions Though it was overwhelmingly backed by parliament, the decision to lift the presidential term limits has been criticised both abroad and within China. In the run-up to the NPC, former state newspaper editorLi Datong wrote to lawmakersthat scrapping term limits for the president and vice-president would sow the seeds of chaos. ""This is against the tide of civilisation and won't stand the test of time,"" he told BBC Chinese. ""It will be considered a farce in Chinese history in the future.""

China appoints Xi ally as his deputy Yi Gang to head up China's central bank China announces big ministry shake-up plan China's 'two sessions' to cement Xi's power Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Trump urges death penalty for drug dealersThe president's call to execute traffickers faces stiff political and judicial headwinds.8h8 hours agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump - Get tough and execute drug dealers US President Donald Trump has called for drug traffickers to face the death penalty as part of his plan to combat the US painkiller-addiction epidemic. He outlined the proposal during a speech in New Hampshire, a state badly affected by the opioid crisis. Mr Trump said his administration was attempting to change the law to execute drug dealers, but it will face stiff political and judicial headwinds. Opioids are a class of drugs including prescription painkillers and heroin. What are opioids and what are the risks? Some 2.4 million Americans are estimated to be addicted to the drugs. The crisis claimed an estimated 63,600 lives nationwide in 2016, say health officials. Mr Trump was cheered on Monday as he told a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire: ""If we don't get tough on the drug dealers we're wasting our time. ""And that toughness includes the death penalty."" Mr Trump previously suggested the ""ultimate"" punishment for traffickers at a rally in Pennsylvania this month. This video can not be played The drug addict who became a judge Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump is calling for an expansion of the federal death penalty at a time when its use is being increasingly curtailed across the US. Congress appears unlikely to pass any new extensions of the death penalty and, if it did, the resulting cases would almost certainly be bogged down in legal battles for years, if not decades. On the ground in states like New Hampshire, West Virginia and Kentucky - the front lines of the struggle to control opioid addiction - concern is largely directed at shutting down the supply of illegal narcotics, particularly potent fentanyl and carfentanil, shipped from overseas - and treating the lifelong struggles of millions of addicts. Mr Trump's get-tough rhetoric may garner applause, but in the view of local officials it's federal dollars for prevention and treatment that save lives. Death mail-ordered to your door Outlining its plan, the White House said the Department of Justice would seek the death penalty against drug traffickers ""when it's appropriate under current law"". Drug-related murder is already a capital offence in the US, but no one has ever been executed using those rules. This video can not be played The grandparents' burden: 'We don't resent the kids - but life's hard' Mr Trump said on Monday: ""We have to change the laws and we're working on that now. The Department of Justice is working very hard on that."" However, such a move would require an act of Congress. And it would probably fall afoul of previous Supreme Court rulings on proportional punishment. The US president seemed to accept on Monday that his policy faced an uphill battle. ""The ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty,"" he said. ""Now maybe our country's not ready for that. It's possible, it's possible."" ""Take a look at some of these countries where they don't play games, they don't have a drug problem,"" said Mr Trump on Monday. He has previously praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, whose war against drug dealers has led to extra-judicial killings. This video can not be played Inside Manila's drug war: Female assassin's story Philippines police say they have killed 4,100 drug suspects as part of the campaign. But human rights groups say the real death toll is triple that number, and the International Criminal Court is investigating. Advocates of capital punishment for drug dealers credit it to Singapore's low drug use. But Iran also imposes the death penalty for drug use, yet it is plagued by opiate addiction. The Republican president said his administration would amend government healthcare programmes in order to cut opioid prescriptions by a third over the next three years. This video can not be played Last October, President Trump shared a cautionary tale about his own brother's fatal addiction He opened the way for a crackdown on negligent physicians and pharmacies, adding that implicated pharmaceutical companies could face litigation. The president said his plan would also require electronic data for most international mail shipments to deter the posting of illicit opioids. Mr Trump said he wanted Congress to approve $6bn ($4.2bn) in new funding in 2018-19 to help fight the opioid crisis.

"EU agreement 'betrays' UK fishermenA Scottish Conservative MP made the comment after Brexit negotiators hailed a ""decisive step"".8m8 minutes agoUK Politics","Some Conservative MPs have expressed disappointment at the outlined fishing deal The UK will regain full control over the country's fishing waters for the first time in 40 years after December 2020, Michael Gove has insisted. The environment secretary said he shared the ""disappointment"" of fishing communities who hoped this would happen on Brexit day, 29 March 2019. But Mr Gove urged them to keep their ""eyes on the prize"" of getting control. Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael, who raised the issue, said ""the mood in fishing communities is one of palpable anger"". The fishing industry had wanted the UK to regain full control over the country's fishing waters on Brexit day, 29 March, 2019. Instead the deal will see the UK ""consulted"" on quotas with the situation remaining largely unchanged until 2021. UK and EU agree Brexit transition terms Deal is done - but work remains What is the Brexit implementation period? Mr Gove said the government had pressed for the UK to be an equal partner in fishing negotiations during the 21-month ""implementation period"" - but the EU had blocked this. ""We were disappointed the EU would not move on this,"" he told MPs, saying that the UK only had to wait a further year for complete control of its waters. ""In December 2020, we will be negotiating fishing opportunities as a third country, an independent coastal state deciding who can access our waters and on what terms for the first time in over 40 years,"" he said. ""It's important that all of us, in every area, accept that the implementation period is a necessary step towards securing that prize. ""For our coastal communities it's an opportunity to revive economically, for our marine environment it is an opportunity to be managed sustainably and it's critical that all of us - in the interests of the whole nation - keep our eyes on that prize."" Michael Gove: ""We didn't get everything we wanted on fishing policy"" But Mr Carmichael replied: ""I have to tell you, if you don't already know it, the mood in fishing communities is one of palpable anger - this is not what they were promised."" He added that if the government can ""let us down like this over a deal for the transitional period, how do we know they will not do it again when it comes to the final deal?"" The SNP's Stephen Gethins asked the minister to say ""at what point our fishermen became a bargaining chip"", adding: ""Or has that been the case all along?"" Mr Gove replied: ""For a party that has raised grievance to an art form, you have a damn cheek making that case."" Former Tory minister John Redwood pressed him to go back to the EU and say ""this deal is unacceptable"". Mr Gove said: ""We didn't get everything we wanted, but... it's the view of this government that we need to make sure this implementation succeeds to get the greater prize at the end of it."" This video can not be played David Davis: Transition is about beginning life outside EU Prominent Eurosceptic Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was ""slightly concerned"" by Mr Gove's tone in relationship to negotiations that the European Commission ""would not allow us something in a negotiation"". Mr Gove said the implementation period would allow the government to prepare ""for all the benefits Brexit will bring"". The Commons exchanges came as Scottish Conservative MPs who held talks with the prime minister on fishing said she ""reassured"" them the UK would take control of its waters after the transition period. Alister Jack, the MP for Dumfries and Galloway, said he felt assured by Mrs May's comments but John Lamont, the MP for Berwickshire. Roxburgh and Selkirk, warned: ""The government should be clear that they are on notice - no deal for fishermen, and they will have to think again on the terms of our departure."" The Daily Telegraph,externalreported that Tory critics of the deal are planning to protest on a boat on the Thames by Parliament on Wednesday. Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, claimed the concession made to the EU in the transitional period was ""shaping up to be a massive sell-out of the Scottish fishing industry by the Tories"". EU fishing deal 'far from acceptable' to Scottish industry Politicians win bid for Article 50 review Labour's shadow fisheries minister Holly Lynch said it was ""understandable"" fishing communities felt ""angry and let down"". Bertie Armstrong, head of the Scottish Fishermen's Association, accused the EU of asking ""for the bargain of a lifetime"" by seeking to keep the UK under Common Fisheries Policy rules for ""as long as physically possible"". Compared with Iceland, which is allowed to keep 90% of fish caught in its waters, the UK keeps 40% under the Common Fisheries Policy, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But Niel Wichmann, head of the Danish Fishermen's Association, said the transition period ""is a sensible agreement which gives us time - a couple of years - to work out how we keep our fishing stocks sustainable, how we keep our fisheries sustainable after Brexit"". On Monday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the legal text of the agreement for the 21 months after Brexit marked a ""decisive step"" but added that it was ""not the end of the road"". The key aspects of the agreement announced in Brussels are: The transitional period will last from Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020 EU citizens arriving in the UK between these two dates will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. The same will apply to UK expats on the continent The UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals during the transition period although they can only come into force from 1 January 2021 The UK will still be party to existing EU trade deals with other countries The UK's share of fishing catch will be guaranteed during transition but the UK will, in effect, remain part of the Common Fisheries Policy, yet without a direct say in its rules, until the end of 2020 Other aspects of the post-Brexit relationship yet to be agreed include what happens to the Northern Ireland border in the longer term.

Xi Jinping warns against China complacency,"Xi Jinping laid out his grand vision for China's future Chinese President Xi Jinping has delivered a fervently nationalistic closing speech to parliament, painting China as the rising global power. Mr Xi said ""achieving total unity"" was the ""collective hope of all Chinese people"" and any attempts to divide it were ""doomed to fail"". The speech was a strong warning against any attempt at separatism from places like Taiwan and Hong Kong. Mr Xi also warned China could not be complacent about its development. Meanwhile, Premier Li Keqiang used his once-a-year news conference to say China was committed to global co-operation on trade. He said China would further open up its economy and ""ensure that both domestic and foreign firms"" were ""able to compete on fair terms in China's large market"". Chinese officials have made similar pledges in the past. China's new anti-corruption super agency How China will change after the NPC The president who lived in a cave The premier's comments are a marked contrast to the recent protectionist rhetoric and threats of tariffs from the Trump administration in the US. Xi Jinping became president in 2013 andnow looks likely to lead China indefinitely,after the National People's Congress (NPC) - a rubber-stamp parliamentary session that meets once a year - voted to remove a two-term limit on the presidency from the constitution. He is now considered the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China, and has further cemented his positionby moving many of his key allies in to leadership roles during the NPC. The president urged lawmakers to rule in the interest of the people In his speech in the Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi highlighted major achievements of Chinese history, like the invention of gunpowder and the writings of Confucius. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Taiwan - the flashpoint island He laid out his own grand vision for China, saying history had proven that ""only socialism can save China"". Chinese people, he said, ""have the spirit of fighting the bloody battle against our enemies to the bitter end"". By Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing In a way it wasn't so much what Xi Jinping said in his Congress closing speech that matters but the fact that he said it. This had traditionally been a day for China's number two leader, the premier, to dominate the stage with an annual press conference. Not any more: President Xi emerges with a keynote speech pushing nationalist buttons and, all of a sudden, he is on the front page where he wants to be. The pushing of Premier Li Keqiang to one side will not seem strange to China watchers, who have seen an already powerful Xi Jinping becoming virtually untouchable at this Congress. The limited check-and-balance provision of presidential term limits has gone; his philosophy under his own name is in the country's constitution; his chief tool for destroying enemies - the anti-corruption crackdown - has been widened into other parts of society and it's hard to see who is left to be able to challenge President Xi in any way whatsoever. Pointing at China's global ambitions, he said his country would be strong but not aggressive and would not develop itself at the expense of the rest of the world. But he warned that China had to be united to prosper, and it was ""absolutely impossible to separate any inch of our great country's territory from China"". ""All acts and tricks to separate the country are doomed to fail and will be condemned by the people and punished by history."" The comments were a clear warning to places like Taiwan, which is self-ruling but considered by Beijing to be a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland - by force if necessary. The issue remains a major potential flashpoint. Last week US President Donald Trump angered Beijing by signing a new law which encourages the sending of top officials to Taiwan to meet their counterparts there, and vice-versa. When asked about Mr Xi's speech, Taiwanese foreign ministry spokesman said he hoped ""countries of similar ideology"", such as the US, Japan and the EU, would support Taiwan's role in maintaining regional peace. There have also been vocal calls for greater autonomy or even independence for Hong Kong in recent years - and China says it is fightingan Islamist separatist insurgency in Xinjiang province. China said it will thwart any Taiwanese separatist attempts Dissenting voices or protests are not tolerated at the NPC, which brings together 3,000 delegates who are theoretically elected but in reality handpicked by the government. Among other major changes this year,the NPC confirmed a major shake-up of ministries, introducing several new bodies overseeing areas like the environment, army veterans and culture. Key positions including the central bank head and chief economic adviser were appointed, and the NPC ratified a law to set up a new powerful anti-corruption agency, far extending the reach of Mr Xi's flagship campaign. The anti-corruption drive has seen more than a million officials disciplined, but is seen by some observers as a tool to sideline his political rivals. Yi Gang to head up China's central bank The man Xi turns to on the economy China's Congress: Eye rolls and tame questions Though it was overwhelmingly backed by parliament, the decision to lift the presidential term limits has been criticised both abroad and within China. In the run-up to the NPC, former state newspaper editorLi Datong wrote to lawmakersthat scrapping term limits for the president and vice-president would sow the seeds of chaos. ""This is against the tide of civilisation and won't stand the test of time,"" he told BBC Chinese. ""It will be considered a farce in Chinese history in the future.""

Trump urges death penalty for drug dealers,"This video can not be played Trump - Get tough and execute drug dealers US President Donald Trump has called for drug traffickers to face the death penalty as part of his plan to combat the US painkiller-addiction epidemic. He outlined the proposal during a speech in New Hampshire, a state badly affected by the opioid crisis. Mr Trump said his administration was attempting to change the law to execute drug dealers, but it will face stiff political and judicial headwinds. Opioids are a class of drugs including prescription painkillers and heroin. What are opioids and what are the risks? Some 2.4 million Americans are estimated to be addicted to the drugs. The crisis claimed an estimated 63,600 lives nationwide in 2016, say health officials. Mr Trump was cheered on Monday as he told a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire: ""If we don't get tough on the drug dealers we're wasting our time. ""And that toughness includes the death penalty."" Mr Trump previously suggested the ""ultimate"" punishment for traffickers at a rally in Pennsylvania this month. This video can not be played The drug addict who became a judge Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump is calling for an expansion of the federal death penalty at a time when its use is being increasingly curtailed across the US. Congress appears unlikely to pass any new extensions of the death penalty and, if it did, the resulting cases would almost certainly be bogged down in legal battles for years, if not decades. On the ground in states like New Hampshire, West Virginia and Kentucky - the front lines of the struggle to control opioid addiction - concern is largely directed at shutting down the supply of illegal narcotics, particularly potent fentanyl and carfentanil, shipped from overseas - and treating the lifelong struggles of millions of addicts. Mr Trump's get-tough rhetoric may garner applause, but in the view of local officials it's federal dollars for prevention and treatment that save lives. Death mail-ordered to your door Outlining its plan, the White House said the Department of Justice would seek the death penalty against drug traffickers ""when it's appropriate under current law"". Drug-related murder is already a capital offence in the US, but no one has ever been executed using those rules. This video can not be played The grandparents' burden: 'We don't resent the kids - but life's hard' Mr Trump said on Monday: ""We have to change the laws and we're working on that now. The Department of Justice is working very hard on that."" However, such a move would require an act of Congress. And it would probably fall afoul of previous Supreme Court rulings on proportional punishment. The US president seemed to accept on Monday that his policy faced an uphill battle. ""The ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty,"" he said. ""Now maybe our country's not ready for that. It's possible, it's possible."" ""Take a look at some of these countries where they don't play games, they don't have a drug problem,"" said Mr Trump on Monday. He has previously praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, whose war against drug dealers has led to extra-judicial killings. This video can not be played Inside Manila's drug war: Female assassin's story Philippines police say they have killed 4,100 drug suspects as part of the campaign. But human rights groups say the real death toll is triple that number, and the International Criminal Court is investigating. Advocates of capital punishment for drug dealers credit it to Singapore's low drug use. But Iran also imposes the death penalty for drug use, yet it is plagued by opiate addiction. The Republican president said his administration would amend government healthcare programmes in order to cut opioid prescriptions by a third over the next three years. This video can not be played Last October, President Trump shared a cautionary tale about his own brother's fatal addiction He opened the way for a crackdown on negligent physicians and pharmacies, adding that implicated pharmaceutical companies could face litigation. The president said his plan would also require electronic data for most international mail shipments to deter the posting of illicit opioids. Mr Trump said he wanted Congress to approve $6bn ($4.2bn) in new funding in 2018-19 to help fight the opioid crisis.

Ant McPartlin steps down from TV roles,"Presenter Ant McPartlin has stepped down from his TV roles following his arrest on suspicion of drink driving. His publicist said McPartlin, who spent time in rehab last year, was taking time off ""for the foreseeable future"" and would have further treatment. ITV's Saturday Night Takeaway will not air this weekend and the final two episodes, scheduled for 31 March and 7 April, won't feature McPartlin. The star was involved in a collision in south-west London on Sunday. His decision to step down comes following talks with his presenting partner Declan Donnelly and with ITV. Orlando finale The final episode of ITV's award-winning Saturday Night Takeaway was due to be broadcast live from Universal Orlando Resort in Florida, with 200 fans of the show flying out in a specially-chartered plane. Star guests have also been lined up for the finale. It follows last year's series final, filmed at Disneyworld in Florida. McPartlin's publicist said in a statement: ""Ant has decided to go back into treatment and step down from his current TV commitments. ""He has spoken with Dec and ITV today and asked for time off for the foreseeable future. As such, Saturday Night Takeaway will not be going ahead this Saturday."" Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have been presenting together for many years McPartlin was driving his Mini in Mortlake on Sunday afternoon when he was involved in a collision involving two other cars. The 42-year-old was arrested after failing a roadside breathalyser test. A child passenger in one of the cars was taken to hospital for a check-up as a precaution, the Metropolitan Police said. A number of people were treated for minor injuries. McPartlin was taken to a south London police station for questioning before being released under investigation on Monday. An ITV spokesman said: ""ITV has taken a joint decision with Ant and Dec's team not to broadcast Saturday Night Takeaway this weekend. ""We will be reviewing options for the last two episodes of the series (March 31 and April 7) which would not feature Ant who is taking time off to seek treatment. ""We very much hope that he gets the help that he needs.""

Cambridge Analytica: The story so far,"This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far It's a sensational story containing allegations of sleaze, psychological manipulation and data misuse that has provoked an internationally furious response. Tech giant Facebook and data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica are at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data - and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election or the UK Brexit referendum. Both firms deny any wrongdoing. The boss of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, has since been suspended, while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been called on by a Commons parliamentary committee to give evidence. Channel 4 News,externalsent an undercover reporter to meet executives from data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, following reports by the journalist Carole Cadwalladr in theObserver newspaper,external. The firm had been credited with helping Donald Trump to presidential victory. The reporter posed as a Sri Lankan businessman wanting to influence a local election. Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix was apparently filmed giving examples of how his firm could discredit political rivals by arranging various smear campaigns, including setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging situations in which apparent bribery could be caught on camera. This video can not be played Alexander Nix, CEO, Cambridge Analytica: ""These sort of tactics are very effective"" The firm denies all the claims and says the documentary was ""edited and scripted to grossly represent the nature of those conversations"". It claims the conversations were led by the reporters. ""I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honey traps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose,"" said Mr Nix. In 2014 a quiz on Facebook invited users to find out their personality type. It was developed by University of Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan (the university has no connections with Cambridge Analytica). As was common with apps and games at that time, it was designed to harvest not only the user data of the person taking part in the quiz, but also the data of their friends. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can scrape in this way. Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, alleges that because 270,000 people took the quiz, the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them. Cambridge Analytica denies any of it was used as part of the services it provided to the Trump campaign. The data was gathered using Facebook's infrastructure at that time, and many other developers had taken advantage of it - but the data was not authorised for them to share with others. The other key point is that even the people directly taking part in the personality quiz would have had no idea that they were potentially sharing their data with Donald Trump's election campaign. Facebook say when they learned their rules had been breached, they removed the app and demanded assurances that the information had been deleted. Cambridge Analytica claims that it never used the data, and deleted it when Facebook told it to. Both Facebook and the UK Information Commissioner want to find out whether it was properly destroyed, as Mr Wylie claims it was not. There are calls for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress US senators have called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how Facebook will protect users. In the UK, the chairman of a parliamentary committee, Damian Collins,has summoned Mr Zuckerbergto explain the ""catastrophic failure"" to MPs. The head of the European Parliament said it would investigate to see if the data was misused. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""very concerned"" about the revelations. Meanwhile, Cambridge Analyticahas suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix,saying his comments ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm"". And the academic who created the app at the centre of the storm, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, said he has been made ""a scapegoat"". Where is Mark Zuckerberg? Facebook data row academic says he is 'scapegoat' The global reach of Cambridge Analytica There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data. Keep an eye on apps, especially those which require you to log in using your Facebook account - they often have a very wide range of permissions and many are specifically designed to pick up your data Use an ad blocker to limit advertising Look at your Facebook security settings and make sure you are aware of what is enabled. Check the individual app settings to see whether you have given them permission to view your friends as well as yourself. You can download a copy of the data Facebook holds on you, although it is not comprehensive. There is a download button at the bottom of the General Account Settings tab.

Zuckerberg pressed over breach concerns,"Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is facing intensified calls to appear in person at investigations into the social network's conduct. His company has been accused of failing to properly inform users that their profile information may have been obtained and kept by Cambridge Analytica, a data firm widely-credited with helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election. Facebook said on Friday it had blocked Cambridge Analytica from Facebook while it investigated claims the London-based firm did not, as promised, delete data that was allegedly obtained using methods that were in violation of Facebook's policies. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. Despite pledging that in 2018 he would ""fix"" his company, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has managed to avoid engaging with the site's growing number of critics - instead sending lawyers or policy bosses to various committee hearings. The 33-year-old's recent remarks on some of Facebook's controversies have been communicated in the relatively safe space of a blog post or video message published on his Facebook page. Facebook and Trump data firm 'misled' MPs US to investigate Trump campaign data firm Tech Tent: Facebook and Google take action With the building row over how Facebookdata may have been used to fuel highly-targeted political propaganda, several influential figures on both side of the Atlantic this weekend said it was time for Mr Zuckerberg to step up to publicly defend - or at least justify - his creation. Some called for investigations into whether Mr Zuckerberg's company may have violated laws governing disclosure of a data breach - and also rules on properly obtaining a user's consent to collect personal information. ""This is a major breach that must be investigated,"" demanded Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. ""Itâs clear these platforms canât police themselves. I've called for more transparency and accountability for online political ads. They say 'trust us'."" She added: ""Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary."" That sentiment was backed by Adam Schiff, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is already investigating social media manipulation in the run up to the 2016 presidential election. ""I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees,"" he told the Washington Post. ""And not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space."" On Sunday morning TV, Florida senator and former presidential hopeful Marco Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press he felt technology companies acted as if they are ""above"" regulations. Eight reasons Facebook has peaked Social networks 'too slow' on changes Facebook broke German privacy laws ""Their growth has been a lot faster than perhaps their ability to mature institutionally from within on some of these challenges that they're facing,"" he said. ""I think another part about it is sometimes these companies grow so fast and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think that perhaps they're above sort of the rules that apply to everybody else."" The man in charge of Britain's investigation into Russian meddling in the democratic process said he too wanted to press Mr Zuckerberg on the issue. ""I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,"" said Damian Collins MP. ""It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers."" This video can not be played In the age of big data, is our democracy open to manipulation? Mr Collins also said he would be recalling Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix to parliament to answer more questions. ""It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and parliament,"" Mr. Collins said. Cambridge Analytica and Mr Nix have denied any wrongdoing. In an attempt to get out ahead of a story in the New York Times and Observer newspapers,Facebook made an announcement late Friday night, California time, that it was blocking Cambridge Analytica from using Facebookwhile it investigated claims the inappropriately-obtained data had not been deleted as promised. This was followed by remarks from Alex Stamos, the firm's chief security officer, who wrote and then deleted a series of tweets. He objected to the word ""breach"" being used to describe how data from as many as 50 million peoples' user profiles may have been obtained without explicit user consent. ""I have deleted my tweets on Cambridge Analytica,"" he later wrote. ""Not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in."" Christopher Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica, revealed how it and its partners harvested data belonging to mostly US voters. Over the weekend, he announced he had been suspended from Facebook. On top of its initial statement, Facebook on Sunday said it was conducting a ""comprehensive internal and external review"" into whether the data, gathered via an app created by Global Science Research (GSR), still existed. GSR was set up by University of Cambridge associate professor Aleksandr Kogan and his colleague Joseph Chancellor. According to the Guardian, Mr Chancellor was given a job at Facebook as a researcher just months after GSR carried out the data-gathering exercise that Facebook now says violated its policies. Facebook has not commented on the calls for Mr Zuckerberg to appear in front of the several committees expressing a desire to hear from him. But one analyst warned that this controversy is a direct threat to Facebook's business model, and therefore Mr Zuckerberg will be expected to put investors at ease, sooner rather than later. ""This has potential to grow into something a lot more onerous,"" said Daniel Ives from GBH Insight. ""So he has to get ahead of this storm before it turns into a hurricane.""

Data firm 'misled' MPs,"Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix has spoken of the firm's intricate data Facebook and a US data firm, Cambridge Analytica, have been accused of ""misleading"" Parliament. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said both firms must answer more questions over claims that details from 50 million profiles were gathered without consent. Facebook suspended the US company, saying it breached its policies. Cambridge Analytica said it does not hold or use any Facebook data. Both companies deny any wrongdoing. The data firm is primarily known for its role in US President Trump's election campaign, where it provided details on American voters. Damian Collins, chairman of the Digital Culture Committee, said comments by Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix at a Commons hearing last month must be explained. Did Cambridge Analytica play a role in the EU referendum? Mr Collins said reports by the Guardian and the Observer made it ""clear that he [Mr Nix] has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament by giving false statements"". Cambridge Analytica has denied allegations that Mr Nix misled that committee. Facebook claims Cambridge Analytica, among others, did not destroy all the data it obtained, which breached its policies. The claims against the company rose to prominence after a former employee told the Guardian about his time at Cambridge Analytica. Mr Collins also criticised Facebook, saying his committee had ""repeatedly"" asked the firm about how companies accessed user data from the website and if information had been taken without users' consent. He claims that the firm ""deliberately avoided answering straight questions"" from the committee by sending witnesses who claimed not to know the answers. ""This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed."" He also claimed Facebook had failed to supply evidence of the relationship between the social media platform and Cambridge Analytica. ""The reputation of this company is being damaged by stealth, because of their constant failure to respond with clarity and authority to the questions of genuine public interest that are being directed to them. ""Someone has to take responsibility for this."" A spokesperson for Facebook said that the data collection was not a hack or a breach. ""People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,"" the company said.

Class A drugs 'brought in for patients'The BBC uncovers allegations that staff at an Essex mental health trust supplied vulnerable patients.3m3 minutes agoHealth,"Class A drugs were allegedly brought into the unit A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations of staff at a mental health trust in Essex bringing in drugs for vulnerable patients. The BBC was told Class A drugs had been brought on to secure, locked wards - and that the trust had been alerted. The Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) has launched an inquiry into the allegations. It said it was unaware of them and that it worked with Essex police liaison officers to monitor issues. Relatives and patients claimed drugs were rife at some of the mental health units run by EPUT. Jane's (not her real name) daughter was able to obtain drugs while she was on a locked ward and had to be taken to accident and emergency as a result. ""Obviously that was extremely worrying, that this could be happening when she was supposed to be being kept safe,"" Jane said. ""There was no investigation. It was more seen as a misbehaviour on the part of my daughter rather than an issue that the trust was dealing with."" Karen (not her real name) has been a patient at the trust for three years and said she had been offered drugs. She said staff were well aware of this, particularly when cannabis was being smoked. ""There was a very, very strong smell of cannabis throughout the whole ward and the staff were aware of the smell, but they didn't do anything about it,"" she said. Mental health deaths probed at Essex NHS trust Karen claimed staff did not only condone drugs in some units, but that other patients told her staff were supplying their drugs. ""When I've asked them how they've got them because they're not allowed out they said, 'oh, so-and-so has done it and named a number of people, they've named the staff'."" The BBC was told by other sources that trust managers had been alerted to Class A drugs on secure wards and were told on at least one occasion that it was staff who had brought in the drugs. The trust told the BBC it was unaware of any allegations regarding staff involvement with illicit drugs being brought on to its facilities. After receiving our allegations, it has now opened an investigation. The Trust said it had recently strengthened its search policy and that CCTV and drug sniffer dogs are used to deter drugs and alcohol getting into units. The trust is also facing new allegations of patients engaging in sexual relationships with staff. Karen said she had been in a relationship with a healthcare worker for five months. ""He was bringing me my phone charger, bringing me in Lucozade and putting alcohol in it and getting me drunk. ""No-one - no-one picked up on anything. No-one questioned anything. No-one said a word."" A trust spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases because of strict confidentiality rules. They added that if an allegation was made against a member of staff they would ""follow the national and local safeguarding advice on investigating it and reporting it"". Relatives also told the BBC about sex happening between patients on mixed wards and this resulted in a sexual assault case being reported to the trust. The trust said inappropriate sexual contact between patients is treated as a safeguarding matter. In the past year it has investigated 13 cases involving sexual contact between patients - four have been sent to the police including one alleged sexual assault. The trust has set up a helpline for patients who have been affected by some of the issues raised by the BBC. It will be open from 20:00 on 20 March, and the number is 01268 739182.

'Prices could fall by 1.2% after Brexit',"Consumers have already seen prices rise by 2% since the referendum, the IFS said Consumers could see prices fall by up to 1.2% if Britain were to abolish all tariffs once it has left the European Union, a report says. But the study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that any gains would be small and were based on ""optimistic"" assumptions. It also said that consumers had already seen prices rise by 2% since the referendum due to the weaker pound. Costs linked to new EU trade barriers could also hit consumers, it said. Those increased costs would ""offset"" any ""rather limited"" gains from becoming tariff free in the future, the report from the think tank says. ""We estimate that complete abolition of all tariffs would reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7-1.2%,"" the report says. ""This could have additional positive economic benefits in the long run but could also be very damaging for some UK industries in the short run."" Tariffs - taxes on imports - are often used to protect parts of a country's economy such as farming and car manufacturing. Abandoning tariffs would mean greater competition for those sectors from abroad which could mean job losses, for example. Following that period, many economists argue that increased competition generally lowers prices for consumers. The IFS suggests some of the short-term economic damage could be alleviated by only reducing tariffs on products Britain does not produce in very high quantities but at present do face high tariffs on entering the EU's customs union, such as olives and oranges. ""This would result in much smaller gains, reducing the total cost of the basket of goods purchased by the typical household by less than 0.4%,"" the IFS said. ""This compares with the estimated 2% increase in prices that followed the depreciation in sterling in the wake of the referendum result. ""This suggests that the scale of 'quick wins' from running an independent trade policy is relatively small."" The report says that average tariffs applied to UK imports as part of the EU's customs union are around 2.8%. It also says that of every Â£100 spent by UK households, only Â£26 is affected, directly or indirectly, by the import prices of goods on which tariffs are charged. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, told the BBC: ""If we leave the customs union, we can come to our own trade deals with other countries, we can reduce tariffs. ""But even if we reduce that as much as possible, the effect on prices will be really quite small relative to what is still a big cost of leaving the customs union because it would make trade with the rest of Europe so much more expensive.""

BBC rejects complaints over Corbyn hat,"Newsnight made a mock-up of Mr Corbyn alongside Moscow buildings The BBC has dismissed complaints that Newsnight altered a photo of Jeremy Corbyn to make him look more Russian. Thursday's show used a graphic of the Labour leader next to images of Moscow as the backdrop to an item about his response tothe Salisbury poisoning. Critics said his hat was digitally altered and it was all designed to make him look like a ""Soviet stooge"". But Mr Corbyn's attire was ""not in any way altered or 'Photoshopped' to appear 'more Russian'"",the BBC said. The original photo showed Mr Corbyn at a fares protest at King's Cross Station in 2016 In response to complaints, a statement from the corporation said the BBC Two news programme had ""a long-running tradition of arresting graphics"", which were ""applied to all types of stories"". The backdrop showing Moscow's Red Square had previously been used in a similar mock-up showing Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, it said. It added: ""Mr Corbyn has been photographed wearing this particular hat and coat many times, and they were not in any way altered or 'Photoshopped' to appear 'more Russian'."" On Friday, left-wing columnist Owen Jones appeared on the programme and told presenter Evan Davis: ""The media framing has been a disgrace and I have to say that includes your own programme. ""Yesterday the background of your programme you had Jeremy Corbyn dressed up against the Kremlin skyline, dressed up as a Soviet stooge. You even Photoshopped his hat to look more Russian. ""People should complain to the BBC about that kind of thing."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
