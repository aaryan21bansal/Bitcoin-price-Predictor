Former PM's Brexit negotiator joins Goldman Sachs,"Olly Robbins was Theresa May's chief Brexit negotiator Theresa May's chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins will join investment bank Goldman Sachs after a sabbatical, the Cabinet Office has said. The civil servant headed talks which led to the former prime minister's withdrawal agreement which formed the basis for the UK's exit from the EU. However, the deal repeatedly failed to get through Parliament, prompting Ms May to resign earlier this year. Mr Robbins, 44, announced he would quit his role shortly afterwards. The civil servant attracted criticism from prominent Brexit supporters who accused him of being too pro-EU. But new Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who has himself has been fiercely critical of the withdrawal agreement - paid his own tribute to Mr Robbins on Monday. Mr Robbins' work earned him a knighthood from former prime minister Theresa May in her resignation honours list. Mr Robbins will first spend a sabbatical at the University of Oxford, becoming the first holder of a visiting fellowship set up in memory of former Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood. ""I am delighted that Olly will be the first permanent secretary to take up this fellowship in Jeremy Heywood's memory, which follows his many years of dedication to public service in a variety of different roles,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Robbins will leave the civil service at the end of the fellowship to become a managing director in Goldman Sachs' Investment Banking Division. He will join former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who is the non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs International. He is not the only figure from British politics to have gone into finance. Former Chancellor George Osborne earns Â£650,000 a year in a role with US investment fund Blackrock, while former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling is a non-executive director at investment bank Morgan Stanley.

US pair spend $100k after accidental bank transfer,"Two people in the US have been charged with theft after spending thousands of dollars their bank mistakenly deposited into their account. The Pennsylvanian couple, Robert and Tiffany Williams, received $120,000 (Â£97,000) in error and spent nearly all of it, according to an affidavit. The couple also faces over $100,000 in overdraft fees, having purchased an SUV and other goods, police say. The affidavit says the couple admitted knowing the money was not theirs. Mr and Mrs Williams, 36 and 35 respectively, have been charged with theft and receiving stolen property. They have been released on bail. On Monday, they appeared in court in Lycoming County, and waived their rights to a preliminary hearing. The pair have not commented to US media and it is unclear whether they have obtained legal counsel. The couple received the erroneous deposit in their BB&T bank account on 31 May, state trooper Aaron Brown told the Williamsport Sun-Gazette newspaper.,externalThe money was meant to go to an investment firm. The error was noticed on 20 June, and the money was taken out of the Williams' account and deposited correctly. But police said by this time, the couple had already spent around $107,000 of the money without contacting the bank. The Williams' purchased a Chevrolet Traverse, a camper, a race car and other household goods, according to the complaint. They also gave $15,000 to help friends. 'It took two years to get my Â£100,000 back' What should you do if a cash machine overpays? New Zealand 'runaway millionaire' jailed When she was contacted by bank officials, Mrs Williams told them ""she no longer had the funds because she had already paid off bills"",,externalMr Brown wrote in the criminal complaint, according to CBS News. ""[Tiffany Williams] told the bank her husband had spent a great portion of the funds and purchased a four-wheeler. She said she would speak to her husband and attempt to construct a repayment agreement."" However, the bank was unable to contact the couple after that conversation. When investigators spoke to the couple in July, both ""admitted to knowing the mislaid money did not belong to them, but they spent it anyway"".

Lloyds and Barclays face fresh PPI costs,"Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays have both announced they are facing billions of pounds in new costs to cover a late rush of claims for the mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI). Lloyds said it faced a bill of Â£1.2bn-Â£1.8bn after ""a significant spike"" in claims in the run-up to the final deadline of 29 August. Barclays said it faced new costs of Â£1.2bn-Â£1.6bn. Both banks have already paid out huge sums to cover compensation claims. PPI: 'It was a jaw-dropping amount' PPI was designed to cover loan repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost their job, but many were sold to people who did not want or need them. Banks and other providers sold millions of the policies, mainly between 1990 and 2010. Last month's final deadline for PPI compensation prompted a surge of last-minute claims from consumers. An FCA ad campaign featuring an image of Arnold Schwarzenegger urged consumers to make claims before the deadline Lloyds said that at the time of its half-year results in July, it had assumed that PPI claims would continue to come in at the rate of 190,000 a week. However, in the run-up to the final deadline, it said it received 600,000 to 800,000 a week. ""Including claims by the Official Receiver, the group now estimates that it will need to make an incremental charge for PPI claims, in addition to the provisions to 30 June 2019, in the range of Â£1.2bn to Â£1.8bn in its Q3 interim management statement,"" the bank said. By May, Lloyds had set aside some Â£19.5bn to cover PPI claims, but this bill will have now risen. Barclays, which had already set aside more than Â£9.2bn, said it too had seen a ""higher than expected volume of PPI-related claims"" during August. Other UK banks have been hit by the last-minute rush for compensation. Last week,RBS said it expected to take an additional chargeof between Â£600m and Â£900m, while shares in CYBG fell sharply afterit warned it would take a hit of up to Â£450m. Estimates suggest that the last-minute surge in claims means that banks will ultimately have set aside well over Â£50bn in total to pay for the PPI scandal. In February this year, Lloyds said it planned to buy back Â£1.75bn of its shares this year. However, given the ""uncertainty around the final outcome for PPI"", Lloyds said it had ""decided to suspend the remainder of the 2019 buyback programme, with [around] Â£600m of the up to Â£1.75bn programme expected to be unused at mid-September"".

Latest giant panda breeding attempt fails,"Tian Tian has not become pregnant after being artificially inseminated in March A sixth attempt to produce a giant panda cub at Edinburgh Zoo through artificial insemination has failed. The zoo's female panda, Tian Tian, has not produced a cub followingthe latest procedure in March. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), which owns the zoo, has confirmed the attempt was unsuccessful. Tian Tian has failed to reproduce despite repeated artificial inseminations since her 2011 arrival. Charlotte MacDonald, the zoo's director of conservation and living collections said: ""Tian Tian was artificially inseminated at the end of March and we now know this was not successful. ""Giant panda breeding is an incredibly complex, unpredictable process and we will continue to share our research with our colleagues in China. ""It is too soon to say what any next steps will be."" Tian Tian arrived in Scotland, along with Yang Guang, from China in 2011 Tian Tian, which means ""Sweetie"", and her mate Yang Guang, which means ""Sunshine"" came to Edinburgh in 2011 in a 10-year agreement with the Chinese government. The two giant pandas are being rented by Edinburgh Zoo from the Chinese government for an annual fee of about Â£600,000. Tian Tian had previously given birth to twins in China but all attempts to produce a cub at Edinburgh Zoo have failed. Zoo staff believe she may have been pregnant on a number of occasions but pandas sometimes re-absorb the foetus during the course of the pregnancy. Panda reproduction is notoriously difficult, partly due to the very short breeding window with ovulation occurring only once a year. Staff had hoped Tian Tian would mate naturally with the zoo's male giant panda Yang Guang but after years of failed attempts the breeding programme was suspended last year, with officials saying they wanted to make improvements to the pandas' enclosure before trying again. In November, it was reported that the zoo's male giant pandaYang Guang had both testicles removed after tumours were discovered by keepers. Yang Guang in his new enclosure earlier this year This year, a decision was taken to artificially inseminate her using sperm from a panda in the Chinese panda breeding programme. Some animal rights campaigners have criticised the use of artificial insemination and attempts to breed the animals in captivity as there is no intention to return to them to the wild.

Northern Ireland 0-2 Germany,"Northern Ireland went close to scoring several times in the first half Northern Ireland's Euro 2020 qualifying hopes suffered a major setback as they lost 2-0 to Germany in a pulsating qualifier at Windsor Park. Marcel Halstenberg's stunning half-volley early in the second half and a stoppage-time goal by Serge Gnabry gave Joachim Low's men victory. Germany go top of Group C, above Northern Ireland on goal difference. Conor Washington squandered two gilt-edged chances for the home side and Stuart Dallas also went close. NI keeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell made some fine saves as Germany dominated the second half while Steven Davis became Northern Ireland's most capped outfield player with 113 appearances. Reaction & as it happened O'Neill bemoans 'missed opportunities' Marcel Halstenberg's stunning opener came in the third minute of the second half Northern Ireland produced a spirited display but now face an uphill struggle to qualify for a second successive Euro finals after suffering an eighth consecutive defeat in matches against the Germans. Michael O'Neill's side hoped to build on the momentum generated by winning their first four matches of a qualifying campaign for the first time - home and away doubles over Estonia and Belarus - but eventually came out second best to the three-time European champions. The Netherlands' win over Estonia moves them to within three points of the two teams at the top of Group C and the Dutch will be NI's next opponents in Rotterdam on 10 October. Further matches at home to Ronald Koeman's side and away to the Germans complete the campaign in November with the top two teams to qualify. Northern Ireland striker Conor Washington failed to take two good chances in the first half Northern Ireland were left to rue poor finishing and the lack of a prolific scorer as their enterprising attacking play and energy was not rewarded with goals. Roared on by a vociferous crowd, who were hoping to see their side emulate the famous September victories over England in 2005 and Spain in 2006, the hosts made a bright start but when Hearts striker Washington found himself through on goal after a rare mistake by Toni Kroos, he was unable to beat Manuel Neuer, who was quick off his line to charge the ball down. Lone striker Washington passed up another great opportunity when the ball got stuck under his foot a few yards out after Neuer could only palm Stuart Dallas's low cross from the right into his path. A goalmouth scramble ensued but no Northern Ireland player could apply the final touch in a crowded penalty area. NI's best chance of the second half fell to Leeds United player Dallas but he dragged his effort from substitute Gavin Whyte's cross wide of the post. NI keeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell made a superb first-half save from Timo Werner Northern Ireland defended resolutely for much of the game, keeping their shape and defensive discipline and getting men behind the ball, but when needed goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell distinguished himself with a number of fine saves. The 22-year-old former Leeds player has been starved of first-team action at new club Burnley this season but his performance in this game brought back memories of fellow NI keeper Michael McGovern's display against the same opposition at the Euro 2016 finals in France. Peacock-Farrell denied Niklas Sul, Lukas Klostermann and Thomas Werner on a number of occasions, also diving to push round Marco Reus's free-kick. The Germans also had a couple of penalty appeals turned down in the first half, with Craig Cathcart getting away with a possible handball. Serge Gnabry's late goal from an acute angle made it 2-0 Northern Ireland held their own in the first half, enjoying more than their fair share of possession, but the Germans dominated after the break and those two clinical finishes from Halstenberg and Gnabry proved the difference between the teams. Wing-back Halstenberg's left-foot drive from a right-wing cross flashed past Peacock-Farrell and flew into the top corner three minutes after the break for the opener and his first international goal. A combination of profligate finishing and Peacock-Farrell's heroics kept NI in touch until Gnabry completed a fine move by scoring with an angled drive from an acute angle in added time to make it nine goals in 10 international appearances for the Bayern Munich forward. The injury-hit Germans' defensive frailties were exposed throughout however as O'Neill's side put the four-time world champions under pressure for sustained spells. Alongside several decent opportunities, the hosts had a penalty appeal waved away after Paddy McNair went down under a challenge from Kroos. German manager Joachim Low's rebuilding process after a disastrous World Cup 2018 campaign and relegation from the Nations League looks to be very much a work in progress on the evidence of this display despite the victory. Even if their air of invincibility may have gone as a new generation of players continue to be introduced this win will give them a boost after the disappointing 4-2 defeat by the Netherlands on Thursday. Germany have won three consecutive away games for the first time since September 2015, having lost their previous three in a row. Having lost just two of Michael O'Neill's first 14 competitive meetings at home (P14 W8 D4 L2), Northern Ireland have suffered five defeats in their last seven such games (P7 W2 D0 L5). Northern Ireland failed to score at home for the first time in their last eight international matches, last doing so in a 0-1 defeat to Switzerland in November 2017. Marcel Halstenberg scored his first ever goal for Germany, on his fourth appearance. Northern Ireland's Steven Davis earned his 113th cap for his country - only one other player in the country's history has ever made more appearances for the Green and White Army (Pat Jennings, 119). Germany's Serge Gnabry has scored five goals in his five international appearances in 2019, more than any other German player this year.

UK growth rebound eases recession fears,"The service sector helped to boost growth in July The UK's economy grew faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession. The economy grew 0.3% in July,the UK's official statistics body said,external, helped by the dominant services sector. Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement onthe 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. This contraction, coupled with some weak business surveys, raised concerns the UK was heading for recession. What is GDP and why does it matter? An economy is generally deemed to be in recession if it contracts for two quarters in a row. However, while growth in the services sector - which accounts for about 80% of the UK economy - helped to drive July's stronger-than-expected growth figure, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) warned that the sector remained weak. ""While the largest part of the economy, the services sector, returned to growth in the month of July, the underlying picture shows services growth weakening through 2019,"" the ONS said. The pound rose in reaction to the figures, rising 0.6% against the dollar to $1.2357. The return to growth in the economy in the month of July will be a political relief for a troubled government keen to avoid recession headlines in early November. It makes unlikely the notion of another consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September, the definition of a recession. But that does not make the economic reality rosy. In the three months to July, the economy did not grow. Even with a Q3 registering 0.3% growth, it would be the weakest first three quarters of a year since the financial crisis. Over nine months, much of the volatility around no-deal - stockpiling effects and car industry shutdowns - should have been stripped out too. There is some evidence in the figures that firms are beginning to restart stockpiling in anticipation of the rising possibility of no-deal Brexit next month. It is difficult to predict how the current political impasse affects those patterns. But a prolonged squeeze on business investment was always going to hit productivity and growth. The global context is far from benign too, with the German economy looking likely to be in recession and the eurozone as a whole growing sluggishly. Other survey indicators for the UK look more difficult too. But if July's pattern continued last month and into this, the government should, when full Q3 figures are released in November, be able to avoid the R-word, for now. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also said that concerns remained. ""Although there was a rise in GDP between June and July, the zero growth recorded on the underlying three-month measure points to an economy under pressure from uncertainty over Brexit and weakening global economic conditions,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC. ""The manufacturing sector remains an area of concern, with tightening cash-flow, concerns over disrupted supply chains and weakening demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector."" Last week,a series of downbeat surveysof various sectors of the economy had raised fears that the UK was at risk of slipping into recession. However, analysts said the latest GDP figures appeared to have dampened these concerns. ""The pick-up in GDP in July is a reassuring sign that the economy is on course to grow at a solid - perhaps even above-trend - rate in Q3,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding that figures ""substantially"" weakened the case for any cuts in UK interest rates ""before Britain's Brexit path is known"". ""The upside surprise came from the services sector, which displayed broad-based strength and did not seemingly benefit from any one-off stimuli,"" Mr Tombs said. Analysts also noted that August's growth figure should be boosted by car manufacturers, which were operating last month, contrary to normal practice. Many carmakers had brought their annual shutdown forward for the original Brexit date in March. ""GDP will get a further boost of about 0.2% in August, when car manufacturers will be at work when they are usually on holiday,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""Overall, the economy is still fairly weak - we estimate that the underlying pace of growth is around +0.2% quarter-on-quarter - but it's not in recession. Political chaos, yes. Economic chaos, no."" How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"UK growth rebound eases recession fearsThe economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 0.3% in July, official figures show.BusinessComments","The service sector helped to boost growth in July The UK's economy grew faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession. The economy grew 0.3% in July,the UK's official statistics body said,external, helped by the dominant services sector. Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement onthe 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. This contraction, coupled with some weak business surveys, raised concerns the UK was heading for recession. What is GDP and why does it matter? An economy is generally deemed to be in recession if it contracts for two quarters in a row. However, while growth in the services sector - which accounts for about 80% of the UK economy - helped to drive July's stronger-than-expected growth figure, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) warned that the sector remained weak. ""While the largest part of the economy, the services sector, returned to growth in the month of July, the underlying picture shows services growth weakening through 2019,"" the ONS said. The pound rose in reaction to the figures, rising 0.6% against the dollar to $1.2357. The return to growth in the economy in the month of July will be a political relief for a troubled government keen to avoid recession headlines in early November. It makes unlikely the notion of another consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September, the definition of a recession. But that does not make the economic reality rosy. In the three months to July, the economy did not grow. Even with a Q3 registering 0.3% growth, it would be the weakest first three quarters of a year since the financial crisis. Over nine months, much of the volatility around no-deal - stockpiling effects and car industry shutdowns - should have been stripped out too. There is some evidence in the figures that firms are beginning to restart stockpiling in anticipation of the rising possibility of no-deal Brexit next month. It is difficult to predict how the current political impasse affects those patterns. But a prolonged squeeze on business investment was always going to hit productivity and growth. The global context is far from benign too, with the German economy looking likely to be in recession and the eurozone as a whole growing sluggishly. Other survey indicators for the UK look more difficult too. But if July's pattern continued last month and into this, the government should, when full Q3 figures are released in November, be able to avoid the R-word, for now. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also said that concerns remained. ""Although there was a rise in GDP between June and July, the zero growth recorded on the underlying three-month measure points to an economy under pressure from uncertainty over Brexit and weakening global economic conditions,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC. ""The manufacturing sector remains an area of concern, with tightening cash-flow, concerns over disrupted supply chains and weakening demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector."" Last week,a series of downbeat surveysof various sectors of the economy had raised fears that the UK was at risk of slipping into recession. However, analysts said the latest GDP figures appeared to have dampened these concerns. ""The pick-up in GDP in July is a reassuring sign that the economy is on course to grow at a solid - perhaps even above-trend - rate in Q3,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding that figures ""substantially"" weakened the case for any cuts in UK interest rates ""before Britain's Brexit path is known"". ""The upside surprise came from the services sector, which displayed broad-based strength and did not seemingly benefit from any one-off stimuli,"" Mr Tombs said. Analysts also noted that August's growth figure should be boosted by car manufacturers, which were operating last month, contrary to normal practice. Many carmakers had brought their annual shutdown forward for the original Brexit date in March. ""GDP will get a further boost of about 0.2% in August, when car manufacturers will be at work when they are usually on holiday,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""Overall, the economy is still fairly weak - we estimate that the underlying pace of growth is around +0.2% quarter-on-quarter - but it's not in recession. Political chaos, yes. Economic chaos, no."" How fast is the UK's economy growing?

Latest giant panda breeding attempt failsEdinburgh Zoo's Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in March but it has not led to a pregnancy.,"Tian Tian has not become pregnant after being artificially inseminated in March A sixth attempt to produce a giant panda cub at Edinburgh Zoo through artificial insemination has failed. The zoo's female panda, Tian Tian, has not produced a cub followingthe latest procedure in March. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), which owns the zoo, has confirmed the attempt was unsuccessful. Tian Tian has failed to reproduce despite repeated artificial inseminations since her 2011 arrival. Charlotte MacDonald, the zoo's director of conservation and living collections said: ""Tian Tian was artificially inseminated at the end of March and we now know this was not successful. ""Giant panda breeding is an incredibly complex, unpredictable process and we will continue to share our research with our colleagues in China. ""It is too soon to say what any next steps will be."" Tian Tian arrived in Scotland, along with Yang Guang, from China in 2011 Tian Tian, which means ""Sweetie"", and her mate Yang Guang, which means ""Sunshine"" came to Edinburgh in 2011 in a 10-year agreement with the Chinese government. The two giant pandas are being rented by Edinburgh Zoo from the Chinese government for an annual fee of about Â£600,000. Tian Tian had previously given birth to twins in China but all attempts to produce a cub at Edinburgh Zoo have failed. Zoo staff believe she may have been pregnant on a number of occasions but pandas sometimes re-absorb the foetus during the course of the pregnancy. Panda reproduction is notoriously difficult, partly due to the very short breeding window with ovulation occurring only once a year. Staff had hoped Tian Tian would mate naturally with the zoo's male giant panda Yang Guang but after years of failed attempts the breeding programme was suspended last year, with officials saying they wanted to make improvements to the pandas' enclosure before trying again. In November, it was reported that the zoo's male giant pandaYang Guang had both testicles removed after tumours were discovered by keepers. Yang Guang in his new enclosure earlier this year This year, a decision was taken to artificially inseminate her using sperm from a panda in the Chinese panda breeding programme. Some animal rights campaigners have criticised the use of artificial insemination and attempts to breed the animals in captivity as there is no intention to return to them to the wild.

Handmaid's Tale sequel was 'targeted by thieves',"This video can not be played Margaret Atwood: The Handmaid's Tale has got ""a lot closer to reality"" Margaret Atwood says thieves made concerted efforts to steal her manuscript for The Testaments, the sequel to The Handmaid's Tale. The author and her publisher were targeted by ""fake emails"" from ""cyber criminals"", trying to obtain the unpublished novel, she told the BBC. She described the attempts as a ""phishing exercise"" that could have led to blackmail or identity theft. ""It was a commercial venture of a robbery kind,"" Atwood said. ""People were trying to steal it. Really, they were trying to steal it and we had to use a lot of code words and passwords,"" she told BBC arts correspondent Rebecca Jones. ""What would they have done with it if they had succeeded? They might have said, 'We've got the manuscript, and we're putting it up online [unless you] give us your credit card details'. Or they might have said, 'Read this excerpt and download it. And if you downloaded it, a virus would have stolen your information'. ""Think of how terrible we all would have felt had that happened."" BBC - Culture - Why The Handmaidâs Tale is so relevant today The Handmaid's Tale: Beyond the book Amazon sorry for sending Atwood novel out early Atwood: US going 'back to Puritan values' under Trump Atwood's new book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize even before its publication In the end, the novel was kept out of thieves' hands and a major operation was put in place to ensure plot details did not leak to the press. Early review copies were issued under a different title for fear of their being stolen; while judges for the Booker Prize were required to sign a non-disclosure agreement before they could read watermarked manuscripts that were locked in drawers overnight. Then, last week, online retailer Amazon mistakenly delivered copies of the novel to US customers a week ahead of the 10 September publication date,causing uproar amongst independent booksellers. Atwood played down the incident, characterising it as a ""boo-boo"" and a ""big fracas"", saying the biggest surprise was that Amazon had apologised. ""Apparently, it's the first time they've ever apologised for anything ever,"" said the 79-year-old. ""At least, that's what I was told."" (Never habitually contrite, Amazon has apologised at least once before, in 2009, for remotelydeleting copies of 1984 and Animal Farm,externalfrom people's Kindle devices). However, Atwood suggested that there should be financial penalty for such errors whether ""on purpose or by mistake"". ""I think anybody putting an embargo in place in the future should attach a dollar amount,"" she said. ""They should say if you violate the embargo, this is what it will cost you and that money will go to independent bookstores."" Despite the secrecy surrounding The Testaments, the novel has already received dozens of positive reviews, with critics deeming it an ""addictively readable, fast-paced adventure,external"" and  ""a rallying cry for activism,external"". The Handmaid's Tale TV stars include Elisabeth Moss (left) and Samira Wiley Set 15 years after The Handmaid's Tale, it returns readers to the oppressive Republic of Gilead, a dystopian future America, where women have been stripped of their rights and reduced to sexual slavery. The original narrator, Offred, has escaped to Canada and the story is continued by three female narrators who provide differing perspectives on the regime as it begins to crumble. Atwood says she was inspired to return to Gilead by events in ""the world we've been living in"" - and The Testaments arrives as access to abortion and women's health services are being restricted in several US states. ""The big effort of the Trump administration in that area will be to try and get rid of Roe versus Wade,"" says Atwood, referring to the1973 Supreme Court judgement,external, which enshrined a woman's right to have an abortion. The political shift has made the story of The Handmaid's Tale more relevant to a generation of young women who ""feel they're on the verge of having decisions made about them, and about their future and fate and body and health that they have not been able to design,"" the author continues. ""Young women of reproductive age are always in the minority in any society and therefore, they're never allowed to vote, as a group, on measures that concern them. ""So the people making the decisions are going to be men, and they're going to be women who are not of reproductive age."" The TV version of The Handmaid's Tale will return for a fourth series The Canadian author says she's been encouraged by women who adopt the Handmaid's ""uniform"" of white bonnets and long, red capes to protest laws that restrict women's rights. ""It's a brilliant demonstration stratagem,"" she says. ""It started in Texas, when a number of them went into the Texas legislature where... a group of men in suits were making laws about women's bodies. ""So there they were and you can't kick them out, because they're not saying anything, and you can't kick them out because they're dressed improperly, as they're all covered up. But everybody looking at them knows what they mean. ""So therefore, in the age of TV, they're very visible and very clearly signifying [resistance]."" The imagery has attained even greater cultural relevance thanks to the hit TV adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale, which stars Elisabeth Moss as Offred. While the first series adhered closely to Atwood's novel, the second and third season have developed Offred's story beyond the scope of the source material. The Canadian writer says she reads and approves all the scripts, but has yet to sit down with the box set (""I will watch all of it when I have a little more time""). However, she denies having written The Testaments to reclaim ownership of her story. ""I think you're implying that I'm more vengeful and weird than I actually am,"" she laughs. ""Not that I'mnotvengeful and weird."" ""But everybody in the show is very dedicated to it and for them, it's not just another show, it's not just an acting part. They get very involved.""

"BA accused of 'dumbing down' as strike beginsThe carrier has lost the trust of pilots, says union boss, as the airline grounds most flights.Business","This video can not be played 'BA and pilots are both to blame' British Airways pilots are striking for a second day in an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. Tens of thousands of passengers have been told not to go to airports, with the airline cancelling some 1,700 flights due to the disruption. The pilots' union Balpa said BA management's cost-cuts and ""dumbing down"" of the brand had eroded confidence in the airline. But BA chief Alex Cruz said investment in the operator had never been so big. The walkout is due to end at midnight on Tuesday, although there could be additional unexpected cancellations on Wednesday. Both sides say they are willing to hold further talks, but no date has been set. The pilots are currently scheduled to stage another strike on 27 September. Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""It is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute."" But he told the BBC that while BA says publicly it is willing to talk, ""in private they say they are not going to negotiate"". And although the headline dispute is about pay, he said there was also deep resentment about the airline's direction. ""BA has lost the trust and confidence of pilots because of cost-cutting and the dumbing down of the brand... management want to squeeze every last penny out of customers and staff,"" Mr Strutton said. BA's Terminal 5 was deserted on Monday morning Mr Cruz defended the airline against Mr Strutton's claim, saying it had never in its history embarked on such a big investment programme in services and training. He said the airline was ""ready and willing"" to return to talks with Balpa. It is the first time BA pilots have walked out and the action could cost the airline up to Â£40m a day. Some 4,000 pilots are involved in the strike. In a statement, BA said: ""We understand the frustration and disruption Balpa's strike action has caused our customers. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this. ""Unfortunately, with no detail from Balpa on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100% of our flights."" By Katie Prescott, Business reporter It's unlikely that passengers will see that much disruption at airports. Most of the real problems have happened over the past few weeks as people have rushed to make other travel arrangements, re-book their flights or apply for refunds. In terms of the negotiations, both sides say that they are open to talks but neither has responded to the other, underlining just how acrimonious their relationship has become. Ostensibly this is about pay, but there's also underlying discontent among pilots with the company's strategy. Some say they don't like British Airways' cost-cutting drive and they want to see more of the benefits of their bumper profits. But industry insiders say BA has made those profits because they have cut costs. They also say airlines are expensive and unpredictable beasts to run and are in thrall to a fluctuating oil price (jet fuel accounts for a quarter of their operating costs) and random acts such as drones in the air. BA, however, contend that the company has been recycling profits into new investment in the airline. The company says it is spending Â£6.5bn on new aircraft, new cabins and WiFi on planes. If the two sides don't come to an agreement in the next few weeks, another strike is scheduled for 27 September. The result of the pilots' union ballot allows strike action until the start of next year, but Balpa says it hopes to resolve the situation well before then. Pilots previously rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which was proposed by the airline in July. Balpa says its members have taken lower pay rises and made sacrifices during more stringent times for the airline in recent years. The union insists that now BA's financial performance has improved - its parent company IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they should see a greater share of the profits. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out? No 10 tells BA and pilots to 'sort out' strike Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes Passengers angry at BA 'silence' amid strike chaos BA says its pilots already receive ""world-class"" salaries. The airline believes the pay offer is ""fair and generous"", and that if it is good enough for BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers - whose unions, Unite and the GMB, have both accepted it - it should be good enough for pilots, too. The airline says once the 11.5% pay deal has fully taken effect in three years' time, some BA captains could be taking home more than Â£200,000 a year, allowances included. Two weeks ago, BA informed some customers they would have to re-book their flights due to the planned industrial action. Unfortunately, due to ""human error"" the airline mistakenly sent emails to some customers whose flights were not actually affected, throwingBA's customer service operations into a tailspinover the bank holiday weekend. On Friday, BA said the ""vast majority"" of affected customers had now either accepted a refund or rebooked, either on alternative dates or with other airlines. BA advice,externalsays you can request a full refund, rebook your flight for another time in the next 355 days, or use the value of your fare to fly to a different destination. If your flight has been cancelled due to a strike,the Civil Aviation Authority says,externalpassengers also have a legal right to a replacement flight at BA's expense to get you to your destination, even if this means travelling with a different airline. Most affected passengers would already have been in contact with BA, but they may not have considered additional costs, such as airport parking. They are advised to keep receipts for these extra costs, and BA said it would look at refunding them on a case-by-case basis. The cost of separate hotel or accommodation bookings that cannot be used may need to be claimed from travel insurance. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out?

BA accused of 'dumbing down' as strike begins,"This video can not be played 'BA and pilots are both to blame' British Airways pilots are striking for a second day in an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. Tens of thousands of passengers have been told not to go to airports, with the airline cancelling some 1,700 flights due to the disruption. The pilots' union Balpa said BA management's cost-cuts and ""dumbing down"" of the brand had eroded confidence in the airline. But BA chief Alex Cruz said investment in the operator had never been so big. The walkout is due to end at midnight on Tuesday, although there could be additional unexpected cancellations on Wednesday. Both sides say they are willing to hold further talks, but no date has been set. The pilots are currently scheduled to stage another strike on 27 September. Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""It is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute."" But he told the BBC that while BA says publicly it is willing to talk, ""in private they say they are not going to negotiate"". And although the headline dispute is about pay, he said there was also deep resentment about the airline's direction. ""BA has lost the trust and confidence of pilots because of cost-cutting and the dumbing down of the brand... management want to squeeze every last penny out of customers and staff,"" Mr Strutton said. BA's Terminal 5 was deserted on Monday morning Mr Cruz defended the airline against Mr Strutton's claim, saying it had never in its history embarked on such a big investment programme in services and training. He said the airline was ""ready and willing"" to return to talks with Balpa. It is the first time BA pilots have walked out and the action could cost the airline up to Â£40m a day. Some 4,000 pilots are involved in the strike. In a statement, BA said: ""We understand the frustration and disruption Balpa's strike action has caused our customers. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this. ""Unfortunately, with no detail from Balpa on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100% of our flights."" By Katie Prescott, Business reporter It's unlikely that passengers will see that much disruption at airports. Most of the real problems have happened over the past few weeks as people have rushed to make other travel arrangements, re-book their flights or apply for refunds. In terms of the negotiations, both sides say that they are open to talks but neither has responded to the other, underlining just how acrimonious their relationship has become. Ostensibly this is about pay, but there's also underlying discontent among pilots with the company's strategy. Some say they don't like British Airways' cost-cutting drive and they want to see more of the benefits of their bumper profits. But industry insiders say BA has made those profits because they have cut costs. They also say airlines are expensive and unpredictable beasts to run and are in thrall to a fluctuating oil price (jet fuel accounts for a quarter of their operating costs) and random acts such as drones in the air. BA, however, contend that the company has been recycling profits into new investment in the airline. The company says it is spending Â£6.5bn on new aircraft, new cabins and WiFi on planes. If the two sides don't come to an agreement in the next few weeks, another strike is scheduled for 27 September. The result of the pilots' union ballot allows strike action until the start of next year, but Balpa says it hopes to resolve the situation well before then. Pilots previously rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which was proposed by the airline in July. Balpa says its members have taken lower pay rises and made sacrifices during more stringent times for the airline in recent years. The union insists that now BA's financial performance has improved - its parent company IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they should see a greater share of the profits. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out? No 10 tells BA and pilots to 'sort out' strike Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes Passengers angry at BA 'silence' amid strike chaos BA says its pilots already receive ""world-class"" salaries. The airline believes the pay offer is ""fair and generous"", and that if it is good enough for BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers - whose unions, Unite and the GMB, have both accepted it - it should be good enough for pilots, too. The airline says once the 11.5% pay deal has fully taken effect in three years' time, some BA captains could be taking home more than Â£200,000 a year, allowances included. Two weeks ago, BA informed some customers they would have to re-book their flights due to the planned industrial action. Unfortunately, due to ""human error"" the airline mistakenly sent emails to some customers whose flights were not actually affected, throwingBA's customer service operations into a tailspinover the bank holiday weekend. On Friday, BA said the ""vast majority"" of affected customers had now either accepted a refund or rebooked, either on alternative dates or with other airlines. BA advice,externalsays you can request a full refund, rebook your flight for another time in the next 355 days, or use the value of your fare to fly to a different destination. If your flight has been cancelled due to a strike,the Civil Aviation Authority says,externalpassengers also have a legal right to a replacement flight at BA's expense to get you to your destination, even if this means travelling with a different airline. Most affected passengers would already have been in contact with BA, but they may not have considered additional costs, such as airport parking. They are advised to keep receipts for these extra costs, and BA said it would look at refunding them on a case-by-case basis. The cost of separate hotel or accommodation bookings that cannot be used may need to be claimed from travel insurance. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out?

House of LordsParliament There are three members of the Royal Commission in the Lords tonight to begin the prorogation ceremony, because the leader of Labour in the Lords, and the leader of the Lib Dems are boycotting it. The act of proroguing or suspending Parliament is marked by
a traditional ceremony in the House of Lords. This begins with an announcement on behalf of the Queen,
read by the Leader of the House. A Royal Commission made up of five peers â usually made up of the leader and
deputy leader of the Lords, the Lord Speaker, the shadow leader of the Lords
and the convener of crossbench peers â then enter the Chamber dressed in
parliamentary robes. They instruct Black Rod, a senior officer in the Lords,
to summon the House of Commons. Black Rod then heads to the Commons where, as is
customary, the door is slammed shut in his or her face. After knocking three times with his ebony rod, the door is
opened and MPs proceed to the Lords. When MPs arrive, there is
a ceremonial greeting from the Royal Commission, who doff their hats, with
representatives of the Commons bowing in return. The Clerk of the Crown
then announces the names of Acts to be given royal assent, declaring âLa Reyne
le veultâ â Norman French for âThe Queen wishes itâ, after each Act. The achievements of the government are reviewed and back in the Commons, MPs traditionally file out of the Chamber and shake the Speaker's hand.

Thousands complain about solar panelsPeople who took out large loans say the thousands of pounds in savings they were promised have not materialised.England,"Brian Thompson said he had to use his retirement savings to pay his loan off Thousands of people who bought solar panels have complained to a financial watchdog that they are not bringing them the returns they were promised. Many people took out loans to pay for panels on the promise they would save thousands of pounds in electricity costs and make money generating power. They say they have not had the expected savings, and the Financial Services Ombudsman has had 2,000 complaints. Barclays Bank has put aside Â£38m to deal with potential claims. Brian Thompson from Rowlands Gill, Gateshead, told BBC Inside Out he was contacted by a salesman for PV Solar UK but told him he did not want to take a loan on as he was preparing for retirement. He said he was told the move would provide money towards his pension, which persuaded him, and he took out a loan with Barclays of more than Â£10,000 over 10 years. Mr Thompson said the payments he was getting back from the power his solar panels sent to the National Grid did not correspond with what he was told. ""I had to dip into my savings which I was putting away for retirement to pay the loan off. To me it was lies,"" he said. The Financial Services Ombudsman said it had received 2,000 complaints about solar panels An independent survey of Mr Thompson's system showed even after 20 years the income from the panels would not cover the cost of the loan. Barclays offered him some compensation but Mr Thompson said it was not enough. PV Solar UK went into liquidation in 2017. Robert Skillen, who was the director of the firm when Mr Thompson bought his system, said Mr Thompson's panels would make him money. Mr Skillen is now in business claiming to help people who have been missold solar panels. He did not want to be interviewed. Tony Walch, from Bolton, was told he would be better off by Â£30,000 over 20 years when he bought solar panels from MyPlanet. He said: ""They were very, very persuasive. Everything they said was plausible. It was a no-brainer."" Tony Walch said everything he was told was plausible He took out a loan of Â£15,000 but he said the panels did not generate the amount of electricity he was promised. They also overheated, damaging the equipment, and he believed they had cost him more than Â£500 a year. MyPlanet went into liquidation in 2016. Former director Mark Bonifacio said all calculations had been made using strict methodology, and the performance of the systems was impossible to predict because of different factors affecting performance. He said MyPlanet installed more than 15,000 systems, and customers would be getting free electricity. Debbie Enever, from the Financial Ombudsman Service, said: ""We have got about 2,000 complaints about solar panels at the moment and more coming through every week."" Loans for solar panels were taken out through Barclays Bank, which said: ""We always seek to ensure customers are satisfied with our financial products. Where customers have cause to complain we will review each case individually.""

Where might room for backstop compromise lie?,"Boris Johnson said a no-deal Brexit would be a ""failure"" by both the British and Irish governments When Boris Johnson headed to Dublin on Monday there were no obvious signs of common ground between the British and Irish governments over alternatives to the border backstop. But many expected the prime minister to repeat his ""germ of an idea"" for a common food and agriculture zone across Ireland. He said he had an ""abundance of proposals"" to replace the backstop, though didn't share any of them with reporters. Neither he nor Leo Varadkar gave much away in the press conference before they sat down over breakfast. But behind the scenes, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) likely in turn pointed out the practical and political obstacles for the EU. Why should it drop the comprehensive agreement it negotiated with Theresa May for an approach which may prove tough to implement? So where might the room for compromise lie? Is it possible that you could add bells and whistles to the food zone idea which is based on Northern Ireland following EU agricultural rules? Might that end up looking a bit like a Northern Ireland-only regulatory backstop? The Northern Ireland-only backstop was offered by the EU at an early stage in the Brexit negotiations. Back then the DUP responded angrily to the idea. Theresa May, dependent on them for votes, pivoted to a UK-wide backstop which she was never able to get through the Commons. 'No breakthroughs expected from Johnson meeting' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Now the maths is different. Boris Johnson is well short of the numbers he needs for a workable administration, with or without the DUP, and an election looks inevitable. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said Ireland stood ready to be Britain's ""Athena"" in the Brexit talks Asked about reports that the government might shift back towards an NI only backstop, the Chancellor Sajid Javid responded negatively. He repeated the prime minister's mantra that the backstop is not democratic. The unionist objection has been that, under the backstop, the people of NI would be left subject to EU rules with no way for their local representatives to approve reject or change them. However, could this concern be allayed by providing an enhanced role for Stormont politicians in scrutinising and/or approving any European agricultural or other trade regulations which might apply in NI? Some influential figures believe a backstop could be devised which incorporates the principle of consent built into the Good Friday Agreement. They argue that by harnessing the agreement, a compromise could be found on the island of Ireland. This in turn might address the fear that the backstop is nothing but a trap set by Brussels which would constrain UK sovereignty after Brexit. Devising some mechanism for Stormont input into a Northern Ireland only backstop is fraught with difficulty. Make it too weak and it would look like meaningless consultation. Make it too strong and the EU would balk at the notion that any changes to its future trade rules could be subject to a unionist veto at Stormont. There is, moreover, the rather inconvenient truth that we currently have no working Stormont assembly or power-sharing executive. Why on earth should you give a failed institution extra responsibility? Additionally, there will be suspicions on both sides. Nationalists and the Alliance Party have previously advised the EU not to concede any substantial role for Stormont in the backstop as they fear it would simply invite unionism to wield its veto. The DUP has cautiously welcomed the PM's food zone idea. But DUP politicians may look over their shoulders at the traditional unionists who have already rejected the all-Ireland food zone as a slippery slope which would see NI increasingly diverging from Great Britain. The swiftly changing politics at Westminster may mean both the food zone and the idea of Stormont playing a role in a ""backstop with consent"" never get off the drawing board. However that doesn't mean officials won't want to tease out such proposals in order to see if they might provide an escape route from the potentially destabilising consequences of a no-deal Brexit.

No-deal Brexit 'would be a failure' - Johnson,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson told Leo Varadkar a no-deal Brexit would be ""a failure of statecraft"" A no-deal Brexit would be a failure that both the British and Irish governments would be responsible for, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister was in Dublin for his first meeting with Irish PM Leo Varadkar since he entered Number 10. The government has confirmed Parliament will be suspended later after a vote on holding an early general election. Opposition parties will not back the vote, meaning there will be no election in October as the PM had hoped. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnson said he believed a Brexit deal was still possible by the EU summit in October, but Taoiseach Varadkar said there was no such thing as a ""clean break"" between the UK and the EU. No-deal Brexit checks 'needed near Irish border' Where might room for backstop compromise lie? Johnson and Brexit's border problem MPs set to reject fresh call for early election Mr Johnson has ruled out asking the EU to delay the Brexit deadline of 31 October, although the Irish government has said it would support another extension. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: ""The stakes are high"" But Mr Johnson told reporters in Dublin he was ""absolutely undaunted"" about what might happen in Parliament. The prime minister also said he had looked at the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, and ""wanted to find a deal"". The two leaders spoke privately for half an hour before joining their delegations for another half-hour meeting, said a joint statement. ""While they agreed that the discussions are at an early stage, common ground was established in some areas although significant gaps remain,"" it added. ""We must restore Stormont and we must come out [of the EU] on 31 October, or else permanent damage will be done in the UK to trust in our democratic system,"" he added. During their press conference, Mr Varadkar used a classical reference about his British counterpart that gained attention. ""Negotiating FTAs [free trade agreements] with the EU and US and securing their ratification in less than three years is going to be a Herculean task for you,"" he said. ""We want to be your friend and ally, your Athena, in doing so."" In Greek mythology,the goddess Athena did assist Hercules as an ally,external- but it was by knocking him out and stopping him from killing his family when he went mad. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Boris Johnson arrived in Dublin trying to strike a more conciliatory tone than in previous weeks. Perhaps brought to bear by cabinet ministers concerned about no deal, Mr Johnson insisted he wants an agreement. But trust is a crucial tenet of any political relationship. A stony-faced Leo Varadkar said a deal was still possible, but warned that promises from the UK wouldn't cut it. The Irish government is also watching Westminster closely, knowing the prime minister is currently boxed in by opposition parties, with few options left. A breakthrough was never going to happen today, but what went on behind closed doors around this key meeting could pave the way for movement. The taoiseachinvited Mr Johnson to Dublin two months ago, shortly after he was installed in Downing Street, to discuss Brexit. The Irish government maintains thatthe backstop - the mechanism to avoid an Irish hard border- is needed in any withdrawal agreement, because of decisions made by the UK. But Mr Johnson has said he will not sign up to a deal unless the backstop is removed, because it is ""anti-democratic"". This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue There is also speculation that the government could propose returning to a backstop that would only apply to Northern Ireland, with the possibility of a role for the Stormont assembly before it could be triggered or new EU rules would take effect. However, DUP leader Arlene Foster told the BBC she is convinced that Boris Johnson will not pursue the NI-only backstop. She also said she was encouraged to hear both the British and Irish prime ministers ""dialling down the rhetoric"" and wanting to find a Brexit deal. Parliament will be suspended when business in the Commons finishes later on Monday, after MPs have voted again on whether to hold an early general election. Before Parliament is prorogued, MPs will debate progress reportsupdating them on efforts to restore the Stormont assembly. Unless power-sharing talks succeed before Brexit happens, Mr Smith has saiddirect rule powers from Westminsterwill need to be implemented at pace. Northern Ireland's devolved parliament collapsed in January 2017 whenSinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister, citing the DUP's conduct around aflawed green energy scheme.. Meanwhile, legislation designed to delay a no-deal Brexit and force the prime minister to request an extension to the EU deadline received royal assent on Monday afternoon and has become law. However, Mr Johnson has said he will not ask the EU for another extension, so it is unclear what might happen next. Thegovernment will move another motion asking MPs to vote for a general electionon Monday too, but it is unlikely to pass because opposition parties have agreed to reject the demand, saying Mr Johnson is trying to force through a no-deal exit. The backstop is a key piece of the Brexit deal dictating what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is a last resort that guarantees a frictionless border if no better solution is devised in time - by maintaining close ties between the UK and the EU until such a solution is found.

Johnson and the border blocking Brexit,"This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists ""there is a way"" to avoid checks along the Irish border after Brexit. But why has the Irish border remained a major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations? If Brexit happens, the 310-mile Irish border will represent the only land border between the UK and the EU. As well as no longer being in the EU, Northern Ireland is likely to end up with different rules and standards to its neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. That's because the UK intends to leave the customs union and single market - arrangements designed to make trade easier between EU countries. Lorries travelling to the EU from Northern Ireland would be required to stop at the border for document checks and some product inspections. This would be to ensure their goods meet EU standards. Following incidents likefoot-and-mouth disease,externaland thehorse meat scandal, the EU is very strict about these requirements. In theory, such checks would mean things like cameras and security posts, creating a so-called ""hard border"". Concerns have been raised that the return of a hard border couldjeopardise the Good Friday Agreement. This helped bring the period of violence in Northern Irelandknown as ""The Troubles""to an end. Boris Johnson says there are ""abundant"" technological solutions UK and EU Brexit negotiators came up with a solution - known as the Irish backstop - to avoid border checks. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed. However, the backstop proved unacceptable to many Conservative MPs, who feared the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely. Their opposition eventually led toTheresa May's resignation as prime minister. Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, said a revised Brexit deal must include ""the abolition of the backstop"". He says the current solution would mean ""signing away"" the UK's ""economic independence"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A ""wealth of solutions"" including technology could replace the the backstop and avoid the need for a hard border, Boris Johnson said during the Tory leadership campaign. Supporters say custom checks could be done at warehouses before lorries set off. Mobile phone technology or microchips on lorries, would track goods and avoid the need for border posts. However, the EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has said it will consider other solutions to the Irish border problem, but only once the current Brexit deal has been signed off. It has also expressed doubts about a technological solution. The problem with just relying on technology, is that EU law also require some products to be physically checked - chemicals and food are among them. Single UK-Irish food zone suggested by report Border technology 'could take 10 years' Why are vets being recruited in Ireland? Alongside technology, Mr Johnson has also talked about a trusted trader scheme. Businesses would be allowed to by-pass checks once they've proven to be trustworthy and have met certain standards. For it to work, the UK would need to persuade the EU to recognise it. But setting up such a scheme would a take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. The UK would also need to come up with an effective way of enforcing it and prevent smuggling. Another solution that has been proposed is to allow agriculture checks to take place in""mobile units away from the border"".,external However, existing EU law states that animal checks must take place at designated Border Inspections Posts (BIPs)""in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry"",external- which would include the Irish border. The EU says ""geographic constraints"" are the only exception (eg mountains, cliffs, valleys, rivers). In these cases, ""a certain distance from the point of introduction may be tolerated."" So getting the EU to allow checks to take place away from the border, for non-geographic reasons, would require a change in the rules. DUP leader Arlene Foster also believes technology and other solutions can prevent a hard border after Brexit Mr Johnson has also suggested the idea ofan all-Ireland food standards zone. In other words, Northern Ireland would keep the same food and animal standards as the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it's unclear how food and animal products would be separated from other trade in order to prevent smuggling. If smuggling was to occur, it could threaten the integrity of the single market. But some say the UK could go further and agree a Northern Ireland-only backstop. This would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and parts of the single market - eliminating the need for any cross-border checks. But the DUP, which supports the Conservatives in government, has previously rejected the idea of a Northern Ireland backstop on the basis it would create checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No-one has started building border posts and the UK and Irish governments say they do not want a hard border. So there is a very real question, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, about who would actually install the border posts if the EU insist they're necessary.

No-deal border plan problems?,"The UK government has promised that it will not harden the Irish border in any circumstances The former head of the UK government's Border Delivery Group has saidthe no deal plan for the Northern Ireland border is unsustainable for more than a matter of months. BBC News NI's John Campbell looks at the plan. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will immediately be in different customs and regulatory territories. Normally, in such a situation, countries will carry out customs procedures and other checks at their borders to prevent smuggling. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. This involves customs posts and other infrastructure. Even Sweden and Norway, which are both in the EU's single market, have customs checks at major border crossings. However, the UK government has promised that it will not harden the Irish border in any circumstances. The UK said it will not impose tariffs on Irish goods crossing the border into Northern Ireland. In addition, it will not introduce any new checks or controls on goods at the land border. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button For Irish exporters to Northern Ireland, it would be like Brexit hasn't happened. However, Irish goods going direct to Great Britain, such as on the Dublin-Holyhead route, will be subject to new tariffs and controls. To some extent this will be possible. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) say there will be a ""general anti-avoidance rule"" to discourage Irish firms from using Northern Ireland as a tariff-free back door into GB. However, if Irish businesses have traditionally shipped through Northern Ireland, they can continue to use this route without facing tariffs. If they begin to ship products on this route for genuine commercial reasons, other than avoiding tariffs, that will also be permitted. Irish products which are processed in Northern Ireland and shipped onwards into GB will also be tariff free. HMRC will not be applying any new checks or controls on products crossing from Northern Ireland ports to GB. Instead, there will be ""intelligence led"" enforcement. The no tariff, no checks plan is a unilateral initiative by the UK - it will not be matched by Ireland. As an EU member, Ireland will be obliged to impose tariffs on Northern Ireland goods crossing the border and carry out checks to protect the single market. In effect, this means Northern Ireland goods, particularly in the agrifood sector, will face substantial new trade barriers but Irish goods going in the other direction will not. Single market rules require consignments of food or animals to enter the EU through specified border inspection posts The government has acknowledged this will impact on the competitiveness of Northern Ireland businesses. The Ulster Farmers' Union said that in order to protect the food industry in Northern Ireland the plan should be changed. The union's president, Ivor Ferguson, said the current plan would mean a ""catastrophic"" outcome for farming and food production in Northern Ireland. ""Steep export tariffs, additional checks and regulations, combined with a proposed zero tariff on agricultural goods from Ireland to NI, will result in significant disruption and pose a logistical nightmare for farm businesses."" The most important WTO principle is that members do not discriminate. So, if zero tariffs are applied to one member, they should be applied to all other members. At a glance, the UK government's plan for cross border trade with Ireland would appear to conflict with that. The government is confident that the arrangement will not break WTO rules and that various exemptions to the non-discrimination principle could apply. However, some trade experts have expressed scepticism that the plan is compliant.

Lloyds facing up to Â£1.8bn in fresh PPI costsThe bank becomes the latest UK lender to be hit with extra costs from a late rush of PPI claims.Business,"Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays have both announced they are facing billions of pounds in new costs to cover a late rush of claims for the mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI). Lloyds said it faced a bill of Â£1.2bn-Â£1.8bn after ""a significant spike"" in claims in the run-up to the final deadline of 29 August. Barclays said it faced new costs of Â£1.2bn-Â£1.6bn. Both banks have already paid out huge sums to cover compensation claims. PPI: 'It was a jaw-dropping amount' PPI was designed to cover loan repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost their job, but many were sold to people who did not want or need them. Banks and other providers sold millions of the policies, mainly between 1990 and 2010. Last month's final deadline for PPI compensation prompted a surge of last-minute claims from consumers. An FCA ad campaign featuring an image of Arnold Schwarzenegger urged consumers to make claims before the deadline Lloyds said that at the time of its half-year results in July, it had assumed that PPI claims would continue to come in at the rate of 190,000 a week. However, in the run-up to the final deadline, it said it received 600,000 to 800,000 a week. ""Including claims by the Official Receiver, the group now estimates that it will need to make an incremental charge for PPI claims, in addition to the provisions to 30 June 2019, in the range of Â£1.2bn to Â£1.8bn in its Q3 interim management statement,"" the bank said. By May, Lloyds had set aside some Â£19.5bn to cover PPI claims, but this bill will have now risen. Barclays, which had already set aside more than Â£9.2bn, said it too had seen a ""higher than expected volume of PPI-related claims"" during August. Other UK banks have been hit by the last-minute rush for compensation. Last week,RBS said it expected to take an additional chargeof between Â£600m and Â£900m, while shares in CYBG fell sharply afterit warned it would take a hit of up to Â£450m. Estimates suggest that the last-minute surge in claims means that banks will ultimately have set aside well over Â£50bn in total to pay for the PPI scandal. In February this year, Lloyds said it planned to buy back Â£1.75bn of its shares this year. However, given the ""uncertainty around the final outcome for PPI"", Lloyds said it had ""decided to suspend the remainder of the 2019 buyback programme, with [around] Â£600m of the up to Â£1.75bn programme expected to be unused at mid-September"".

"UK growth rebound eases recession fearsThe economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 0.3% in July, official figures show.Business","The service sector helped to boost growth in July The UK's economy grew faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession. The economy grew 0.3% in July,the UK's official statistics body said,external, helped by the dominant services sector. Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement onthe 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. This contraction, coupled with some weak business surveys, raised concerns the UK was heading for recession. What is GDP and why does it matter? An economy is generally deemed to be in recession if it contracts for two quarters in a row. However, while growth in the services sector - which accounts for about 80% of the UK economy - helped to drive July's stronger-than-expected growth figure, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) warned that the sector remained weak. ""While the largest part of the economy, the services sector, returned to growth in the month of July, the underlying picture shows services growth weakening through 2019,"" the ONS said. The pound rose in reaction to the figures, rising 0.6% against the dollar to $1.2357. The return to growth in the economy in the month of July will be a political relief for a troubled government keen to avoid recession headlines in early November. It makes unlikely the notion of another consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September, the definition of a recession. But that does not make the economic reality rosy. In the three months to July, the economy did not grow. Even with a Q3 registering 0.3% growth, it would be the weakest first three quarters of a year since the financial crisis. Over nine months, much of the volatility around no-deal - stockpiling effects and car industry shutdowns - should have been stripped out too. There is some evidence in the figures that firms are beginning to restart stockpiling in anticipation of the rising possibility of no-deal Brexit next month. It is difficult to predict how the current political impasse affects those patterns. But a prolonged squeeze on business investment was always going to hit productivity and growth. The global context is far from benign too, with the German economy looking likely to be in recession and the eurozone as a whole growing sluggishly. Other survey indicators for the UK look more difficult too. But if July's pattern continued last month and into this, the government should, when full Q3 figures are released in November, be able to avoid the R-word, for now. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also said that concerns remained. ""Although there was a rise in GDP between June and July, the zero growth recorded on the underlying three-month measure points to an economy under pressure from uncertainty over Brexit and weakening global economic conditions,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC. ""The manufacturing sector remains an area of concern, with tightening cash-flow, concerns over disrupted supply chains and weakening demand in key markets weighing on activity in the sector."" Last week,a series of downbeat surveysof various sectors of the economy had raised fears that the UK was at risk of slipping into recession. However, analysts said the latest GDP figures appeared to have dampened these concerns. ""The pick-up in GDP in July is a reassuring sign that the economy is on course to grow at a solid - perhaps even above-trend - rate in Q3,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding that figures ""substantially"" weakened the case for any cuts in UK interest rates ""before Britain's Brexit path is known"". ""The upside surprise came from the services sector, which displayed broad-based strength and did not seemingly benefit from any one-off stimuli,"" Mr Tombs said. Analysts also noted that August's growth figure should be boosted by car manufacturers, which were operating last month, contrary to normal practice. Many carmakers had brought their annual shutdown forward for the original Brexit date in March. ""GDP will get a further boost of about 0.2% in August, when car manufacturers will be at work when they are usually on holiday,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""Overall, the economy is still fairly weak - we estimate that the underlying pace of growth is around +0.2% quarter-on-quarter - but it's not in recession. Political chaos, yes. Economic chaos, no."" How fast is the UK's economy growing?

Lloyds facing up to Â£1.8bn in fresh PPI costs,"Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays have both announced they are facing billions of pounds in new costs to cover a late rush of claims for the mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI). Lloyds said it faced a bill of Â£1.2bn-Â£1.8bn after ""a significant spike"" in claims in the run-up to the final deadline of 29 August. Barclays said it faced new costs of Â£1.2bn-Â£1.6bn. Both banks have already paid out huge sums to cover compensation claims. PPI: 'It was a jaw-dropping amount' PPI was designed to cover loan repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost their job, but many were sold to people who did not want or need them. Banks and other providers sold millions of the policies, mainly between 1990 and 2010. Last month's final deadline for PPI compensation prompted a surge of last-minute claims from consumers. An FCA ad campaign featuring an image of Arnold Schwarzenegger urged consumers to make claims before the deadline Lloyds said that at the time of its half-year results in July, it had assumed that PPI claims would continue to come in at the rate of 190,000 a week. However, in the run-up to the final deadline, it said it received 600,000 to 800,000 a week. ""Including claims by the Official Receiver, the group now estimates that it will need to make an incremental charge for PPI claims, in addition to the provisions to 30 June 2019, in the range of Â£1.2bn to Â£1.8bn in its Q3 interim management statement,"" the bank said. By May, Lloyds had set aside some Â£19.5bn to cover PPI claims, but this bill will have now risen. Barclays, which had already set aside more than Â£9.2bn, said it too had seen a ""higher than expected volume of PPI-related claims"" during August. Other UK banks have been hit by the last-minute rush for compensation. Last week,RBS said it expected to take an additional chargeof between Â£600m and Â£900m, while shares in CYBG fell sharply afterit warned it would take a hit of up to Â£450m. Estimates suggest that the last-minute surge in claims means that banks will ultimately have set aside well over Â£50bn in total to pay for the PPI scandal. In February this year, Lloyds said it planned to buy back Â£1.75bn of its shares this year. However, given the ""uncertainty around the final outcome for PPI"", Lloyds said it had ""decided to suspend the remainder of the 2019 buyback programme, with [around] Â£600m of the up to Â£1.75bn programme expected to be unused at mid-September"".

Extra carriages on trains for Scotland match,"ScotRail is adding extra carriages to trains going to and from Hampden Park for Scotland's Euro 2020 qualifying fixture against Belgium. It comes afterrecent problems with overcrowdingon some of its services. The train operator said it would be adding carriages to trains to and from Mount Florida as well as on trains travelling back to Perth and Dundee. Queuing systems will be in place at Glasgow Central before the match, and at Mount Florida station afterwards. Fans are being advised to head back to Mount Florida as quickly as possible after the game finishes and join the queues on Bolton Drive as trains are expected to be busy. ScotRail said those heading to the game for the 19:45 kick off should allow extra time for travel - as well as purchasing tickets to Mount Florida in advance. An alcohol ban will be in place on trains between Glasgow and Mount Florida from 17:00 and ScotRail will have extra staff on the ground. Train chaos before and after Scotland game ScotRail admits it 'didn't do well enough' after delays ScotRail under fire after major weekend disruption Phil Campbell, ScotRail's head of customer operations, said: ""This is a crucial game for Scotland, and we're looking forward to helping supporters travel to the game to cheer on our national team. ""To help the event run smoothly, we're adding extra carriages to trains to and from Hampden. ""Regular commuters who travel home from Glasgow on the line via Mount Florida should be aware that services will be much busier than normal with fans heading to the match."" ScotRail admitted it did not do well enough following overcrowding on some of its services last month Last month ScotRail said it had ""not done well enough"" after being criticised following major disruption on services from Edinburgh. Commuters claimed trains from Waverley and Haymarket were dangerously overcrowded on the night of Saturday 24 August, while other services were cancelled. Passenger numbers were high as it was the last weekend of the Edinburgh festivals and Murrayfield had hosted an international rugby match. ScotRail said a trespasser on the line and a train failure were partly to blame and admitted it could not cope with the volume of customers on top of two rail incidents. On Friday football fans travelling by train to Hampden for Scotland's game against Russia also faced serious disruption. A train was brought to a halt after a passenger triggered an alarm. As a result, many services to the south of Glasgow including the Cathcart Circle which serves the area of the stadium were cancelled or delayed. It later emerged that knock-on disruption would continue until late evening, affecting fans after the game.

Leo Varadkar invites PM to Dublin for Brexit chat,"Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have had their first exchange of views on Brexit intheir first phone call since the former Mayor of London became Prime Minister. Mr Varadkar reiterated thatthe backstop - the mechanism to avoid an Irish hard border- was needed because of decisions made by the UK. The taoiseach also invited Mr Johnson to Dublin to discuss Brexit. The PM again said the backstop must be removed from any deal with the EU. He insisted the UK will be leaving the EU by the 31 October deadline ""no matter what"". But Mr Varadkar maintained there could be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement. Dublin dismisses backstop pressure 'codswallop' Is Ireland ready for no-deal Brexit? Irish border poll call 'irresponsible' 'Irresponsible' not to plan border vote A UK government spokesperson said that during the call both leaders had reiterated their commitment to work together in the spirit of the ""warm and deep relationship"" the two countries share. A spokesperson for Mr Varadkar said he had explained to the new prime minister that the EU was ""united in its view"" on the withdrawal agreement. Mr Johnson repeated his commitment that the British government would ""never put physical checks or infrastructure on the border"". He said any further Brexit negotiations would be approached by his government in a spirit of friendship - but that any deal must be one that ""abolishes the backstop"". The backstop is a key piece of the Brexit deal dictating what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is a last resort that guarantees a frictionless border if no better solution is devised in time - by maintaining close ties between the UK and the EU until such a solution is found.

The two men also discussed attempts to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly, which collapsed in January 2017. Mr Johnson said the current talks have his ""unequivocal support"" and that he looked forward to visiting Northern Ireland shortly to talk to the leaders of the five main parties about restoring devolution. The taoiseach restated the need for both governments to be ""fully committed"" to the Good Friday Agreement and restoring the institutions. He invited Boris Johnson to Dublin to ""share their respective analyses"" on Brexit, and to continue discussions about Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area.

Brexit: Dublin dismisses backstop pressure 'codswallop',"EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Leo Varadkar in Brussels on 20 June There is a weary sense of ""here we go again"" among Irish government officials dealing with Brexit about briefings coming from London that Dublin is under pressure from other EU members about the backstop to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The backstop is the insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement between the United Kingdom and European Union,designed to ensure that there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. Both sides say they hope it never has to come into effect and that it will become redundant because of a wider trade deal. Leo Varadkar invites PM to Dublin for Brexit chat Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Hard Brexit could 'undermine the union' While Irish sources describe Tuesday's phone call between Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson as ""warm and friendly""on ""both a personal and a political level"", that description is bound to raise an eyebrow given the widening gap between the two capitals. Especially after what the prime minister has been saying about the need tobin the backstop as a precondition to get into Brexit negotiations and to avoid a no-deal exit. Irish sources insist Dublin has not come under any EU pressure to relent on the backstop, with one source describing as ""codswallop"" suggestions otherwise. Another says this isn't the first time there have been inaccurate reports in the British media that pressure is mounting on Dublin. EU officials reject Johnson's Brexit policy No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Boris Johnson's first speech as prime minister in the House of Commons The sources agree that what Mr Johnson is doing, in calling for the binning of the backstop as a first step to allow negotiations, is taking any pressure off Dublin that may have been forthcoming down the line. That's because after the lengthy negotiations that went into the withdrawal agreement to accommodate the British red lines, the EU-27 are not going to suddenly offer Boris Johnson a substantially better deal than the one they gave Theresa May. Another official says the British government's attitude ""is consistent with several of their fundamental misconceptions; such as the EU needs us more than we need them; the damage of a no-deal Brexit is symmetric and affects the EU and the UK both equally: that German car manufacturers will put pressure on Angela Merkel and Ireland is so small it won't be able to withstand pressure"". The Irish authorities have published a number of reports which highlight how drastic a no-deal Brexit would be be for the Republic. The governments summer economic statement suggested there could be 55,000 fewer jobs and a 3% drop in growth. No-deal Brexit would be UK's choice, Ireland says Emergency Irish plan for no-deal Brexit If and when serious talks start in a few weeks time, Fergus Finlay, a newspaper columnist with the Irish Examiner who has experience as an Irish official of negotiations with the British on Northern Ireland, says ""until a compromise is visible, there must be no compromise"". He says the Irish government has ""not been guilty of any triumphalism"", but is seeking to defend its interests and those of Northern Ireland. Irish minister Helen McEntee and the French Minister for Europe AmÅ½ile de Montchalin stand on either side of the border on 19 July There have also been mutterings in the British media that Leo Varadkar is coming under domestic political pressure to alter his government's position on the backstop. That is simply not the case. The taoiseach leadsa minority government that is dependent on the support of the main opposition party in a confidence and supply arrangement. Indeed, there is a widespread consensus in the DÃ¡il (lower house of parliament) that the government must hold the line on the backstop to prevent a hard border and to protectthe 1998 Good Friday Agreement that helped to bring about peace on the island. But there is also a view among a minority of commentators that Dublin is not cognisant enough of UK sensitivities and political needs. They argue that the backstop designed to avoid a hard border might result in that very eventuality if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The new prime minister visited Wales on Tuesday Ministers and officials in Dublin suspect that the prime minister may be more interested in an early general election, than in making the necessary compromises to reach a deal to allow the UK leave the EU on 31 October. They, like everybody else, are keeping an eye on the evolving parliamentary arithmetic at Westminster. And although Boris Johnson has only been a short time in his new job, the next few weeks and months promise to be very interesting and uncertain as bluffs have to be eventually called by all sides.

Q&A: The problem with the no-deal border plan?,"The UK government has promised that it will not harden the Irish border in any circumstances The former head of the UK government's Border Delivery Group has saidthe no deal plan for the Northern Ireland border is unsustainable for more than a matter of months. BBC News NI's John Campbell looks at the plan. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will immediately be in different customs and regulatory territories. Normally, in such a situation, countries will carry out customs procedures and other checks at their borders to prevent smuggling. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. This involves customs posts and other infrastructure. Even Sweden and Norway, which are both in the EU's single market, have customs checks at major border crossings. However, the UK government has promised that it will not harden the Irish border in any circumstances. The UK said it will not impose tariffs on Irish goods crossing the border into Northern Ireland. In addition, it will not introduce any new checks or controls on goods at the land border. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button For Irish exporters to Northern Ireland, it would be like Brexit hasn't happened. However, Irish goods going direct to Great Britain, such as on the Dublin-Holyhead route, will be subject to new tariffs and controls. To some extent this will be possible. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) say there will be a ""general anti-avoidance rule"" to discourage Irish firms from using Northern Ireland as a tariff-free back door into GB. However, if Irish businesses have traditionally shipped through Northern Ireland, they can continue to use this route without facing tariffs. If they begin to ship products on this route for genuine commercial reasons, other than avoiding tariffs, that will also be permitted. Irish products which are processed in Northern Ireland and shipped onwards into GB will also be tariff free. HMRC will not be applying any new checks or controls on products crossing from Northern Ireland ports to GB. Instead, there will be ""intelligence led"" enforcement. The no tariff, no checks plan is a unilateral initiative by the UK - it will not be matched by Ireland. As an EU member, Ireland will be obliged to impose tariffs on Northern Ireland goods crossing the border and carry out checks to protect the single market. In effect, this means Northern Ireland goods, particularly in the agrifood sector, will face substantial new trade barriers but Irish goods going in the other direction will not. Single market rules require consignments of food or animals to enter the EU through specified border inspection posts The government has acknowledged this will impact on the competitiveness of Northern Ireland businesses. The Ulster Farmers' Union said that in order to protect the food industry in Northern Ireland the plan should be changed. The union's president, Ivor Ferguson, said the current plan would mean a ""catastrophic"" outcome for farming and food production in Northern Ireland. ""Steep export tariffs, additional checks and regulations, combined with a proposed zero tariff on agricultural goods from Ireland to NI, will result in significant disruption and pose a logistical nightmare for farm businesses."" The most important WTO principle is that members do not discriminate. So, if zero tariffs are applied to one member, they should be applied to all other members. At a glance, the UK government's plan for cross border trade with Ireland would appear to conflict with that. The government is confident that the arrangement will not break WTO rules and that various exemptions to the non-discrimination principle could apply. However, some trade experts have expressed scepticism that the plan is compliant.

British and Irish PMs set for Dublin meeting,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson told Leo Varadkar a no-deal Brexit would be ""a failure of statecraft"" A no-deal Brexit would be a failure that both the British and Irish governments would be responsible for, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister was in Dublin for his first meeting with Irish PM Leo Varadkar since he entered Number 10. The government has confirmed Parliament will be suspended later after a vote on holding an early general election. Opposition parties will not back the vote, meaning there will be no election in October as the PM had hoped. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnson said he believed a Brexit deal was still possible by the EU summit in October, but Taoiseach Varadkar said there was no such thing as a ""clean break"" between the UK and the EU. No-deal Brexit checks 'needed near Irish border' Where might room for backstop compromise lie? Johnson and Brexit's border problem MPs set to reject fresh call for early election Mr Johnson has ruled out asking the EU to delay the Brexit deadline of 31 October, although the Irish government has said it would support another extension. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: ""The stakes are high"" But Mr Johnson told reporters in Dublin he was ""absolutely undaunted"" about what might happen in Parliament. The prime minister also said he had looked at the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, and ""wanted to find a deal"". The two leaders spoke privately for half an hour before joining their delegations for another half-hour meeting, said a joint statement. ""While they agreed that the discussions are at an early stage, common ground was established in some areas although significant gaps remain,"" it added. ""We must restore Stormont and we must come out [of the EU] on 31 October, or else permanent damage will be done in the UK to trust in our democratic system,"" he added. During their press conference, Mr Varadkar used a classical reference about his British counterpart that gained attention. ""Negotiating FTAs [free trade agreements] with the EU and US and securing their ratification in less than three years is going to be a Herculean task for you,"" he said. ""We want to be your friend and ally, your Athena, in doing so."" In Greek mythology,the goddess Athena did assist Hercules as an ally,external- but it was by knocking him out and stopping him from killing his family when he went mad. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Boris Johnson arrived in Dublin trying to strike a more conciliatory tone than in previous weeks. Perhaps brought to bear by cabinet ministers concerned about no deal, Mr Johnson insisted he wants an agreement. But trust is a crucial tenet of any political relationship. A stony-faced Leo Varadkar said a deal was still possible, but warned that promises from the UK wouldn't cut it. The Irish government is also watching Westminster closely, knowing the prime minister is currently boxed in by opposition parties, with few options left. A breakthrough was never going to happen today, but what went on behind closed doors around this key meeting could pave the way for movement. The taoiseachinvited Mr Johnson to Dublin two months ago, shortly after he was installed in Downing Street, to discuss Brexit. The Irish government maintains thatthe backstop - the mechanism to avoid an Irish hard border- is needed in any withdrawal agreement, because of decisions made by the UK. But Mr Johnson has said he will not sign up to a deal unless the backstop is removed, because it is ""anti-democratic"". This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue There is also speculation that the government could propose returning to a backstop that would only apply to Northern Ireland, with the possibility of a role for the Stormont assembly before it could be triggered or new EU rules would take effect. However, DUP leader Arlene Foster told the BBC she is convinced that Boris Johnson will not pursue the NI-only backstop. She also said she was encouraged to hear both the British and Irish prime ministers ""dialling down the rhetoric"" and wanting to find a Brexit deal. Parliament will be suspended when business in the Commons finishes later on Monday, after MPs have voted again on whether to hold an early general election. Before Parliament is prorogued, MPs will debate progress reportsupdating them on efforts to restore the Stormont assembly. Unless power-sharing talks succeed before Brexit happens, Mr Smith has saiddirect rule powers from Westminsterwill need to be implemented at pace. Northern Ireland's devolved parliament collapsed in January 2017 whenSinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister, citing the DUP's conduct around aflawed green energy scheme.. Meanwhile, legislation designed to delay a no-deal Brexit and force the prime minister to request an extension to the EU deadline received royal assent on Monday afternoon and has become law. However, Mr Johnson has said he will not ask the EU for another extension, so it is unclear what might happen next. Thegovernment will move another motion asking MPs to vote for a general electionon Monday too, but it is unlikely to pass because opposition parties have agreed to reject the demand, saying Mr Johnson is trying to force through a no-deal exit. The backstop is a key piece of the Brexit deal dictating what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is a last resort that guarantees a frictionless border if no better solution is devised in time - by maintaining close ties between the UK and the EU until such a solution is found.

Johnson to meet Irish PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson told Leo Varadkar a no-deal Brexit would be ""a failure of statecraft"" A no-deal Brexit would be a failure that both the British and Irish governments would be responsible for, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister was in Dublin for his first meeting with Irish PM Leo Varadkar since he entered Number 10. The government has confirmed Parliament will be suspended later after a vote on holding an early general election. Opposition parties will not back the vote, meaning there will be no election in October as the PM had hoped. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnson said he believed a Brexit deal was still possible by the EU summit in October, but Taoiseach Varadkar said there was no such thing as a ""clean break"" between the UK and the EU. No-deal Brexit checks 'needed near Irish border' Where might room for backstop compromise lie? Johnson and Brexit's border problem MPs set to reject fresh call for early election Mr Johnson has ruled out asking the EU to delay the Brexit deadline of 31 October, although the Irish government has said it would support another extension. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: ""The stakes are high"" But Mr Johnson told reporters in Dublin he was ""absolutely undaunted"" about what might happen in Parliament. The prime minister also said he had looked at the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, and ""wanted to find a deal"". The two leaders spoke privately for half an hour before joining their delegations for another half-hour meeting, said a joint statement. ""While they agreed that the discussions are at an early stage, common ground was established in some areas although significant gaps remain,"" it added. ""We must restore Stormont and we must come out [of the EU] on 31 October, or else permanent damage will be done in the UK to trust in our democratic system,"" he added. During their press conference, Mr Varadkar used a classical reference about his British counterpart that gained attention. ""Negotiating FTAs [free trade agreements] with the EU and US and securing their ratification in less than three years is going to be a Herculean task for you,"" he said. ""We want to be your friend and ally, your Athena, in doing so."" In Greek mythology,the goddess Athena did assist Hercules as an ally,external- but it was by knocking him out and stopping him from killing his family when he went mad. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Boris Johnson arrived in Dublin trying to strike a more conciliatory tone than in previous weeks. Perhaps brought to bear by cabinet ministers concerned about no deal, Mr Johnson insisted he wants an agreement. But trust is a crucial tenet of any political relationship. A stony-faced Leo Varadkar said a deal was still possible, but warned that promises from the UK wouldn't cut it. The Irish government is also watching Westminster closely, knowing the prime minister is currently boxed in by opposition parties, with few options left. A breakthrough was never going to happen today, but what went on behind closed doors around this key meeting could pave the way for movement. The taoiseachinvited Mr Johnson to Dublin two months ago, shortly after he was installed in Downing Street, to discuss Brexit. The Irish government maintains thatthe backstop - the mechanism to avoid an Irish hard border- is needed in any withdrawal agreement, because of decisions made by the UK. But Mr Johnson has said he will not sign up to a deal unless the backstop is removed, because it is ""anti-democratic"". This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue There is also speculation that the government could propose returning to a backstop that would only apply to Northern Ireland, with the possibility of a role for the Stormont assembly before it could be triggered or new EU rules would take effect. However, DUP leader Arlene Foster told the BBC she is convinced that Boris Johnson will not pursue the NI-only backstop. She also said she was encouraged to hear both the British and Irish prime ministers ""dialling down the rhetoric"" and wanting to find a Brexit deal. Parliament will be suspended when business in the Commons finishes later on Monday, after MPs have voted again on whether to hold an early general election. Before Parliament is prorogued, MPs will debate progress reportsupdating them on efforts to restore the Stormont assembly. Unless power-sharing talks succeed before Brexit happens, Mr Smith has saiddirect rule powers from Westminsterwill need to be implemented at pace. Northern Ireland's devolved parliament collapsed in January 2017 whenSinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister, citing the DUP's conduct around aflawed green energy scheme.. Meanwhile, legislation designed to delay a no-deal Brexit and force the prime minister to request an extension to the EU deadline received royal assent on Monday afternoon and has become law. However, Mr Johnson has said he will not ask the EU for another extension, so it is unclear what might happen next. Thegovernment will move another motion asking MPs to vote for a general electionon Monday too, but it is unlikely to pass because opposition parties have agreed to reject the demand, saying Mr Johnson is trying to force through a no-deal exit. The backstop is a key piece of the Brexit deal dictating what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is a last resort that guarantees a frictionless border if no better solution is devised in time - by maintaining close ties between the UK and the EU until such a solution is found.

Bahamas defends hurricane response amid criticism,"This video can not be played On board a UK ship offering aid and rescue to the Bahamas Bahamian officials have defended their response to Hurricane Dorian after it devastated parts of the island chain last week, killing at least 45 people. Residents on the Abaco Islands have accused the government of failing to provide assistance and prevent looting. Officials have denied covering up the number of deaths. The toll is likely to rise as hundreds, possibly thousands, of people are still missing. Some 70,000 people were in need of food and shelter, the United Nations said. Thousands of residents from the hardest-hit areas in the Abacos have been sent to the country's capital, Nassau, where authorities say they may have to use tents or containers to house the victims.

They wonder why officials haven't come to retrieve all those who perished during Hurricane Dorian. As you walk around the town, there is very little in terms of any official presence. In fact, there's hardly anyone at all - just a scattering of locals looking through what once was their homes, or rummaging for food or supplies. On the hood of a car in one of the worst-hit areas lies the corpse of a large dog, untouched since the storm. Its presence speaks to the lack of attention this area has received in the week since Dorian hit this island. In Marsh Harbour, where 90% of infrastructure is damaged or destroyed, residents complained that aid had been too slow to arrive.

Thousands complain about solar panels,"Brian Thompson said he had to use his retirement savings to pay his loan off Thousands of people who bought solar panels have complained to a financial watchdog that they are not bringing them the returns they were promised. Many people took out loans to pay for panels on the promise they would save thousands of pounds in electricity costs and make money generating power. They say they have not had the expected savings, and the Financial Services Ombudsman has had 2,000 complaints. Barclays Bank has put aside Â£38m to deal with potential claims. Brian Thompson from Rowlands Gill, Gateshead, told BBC Inside Out he was contacted by a salesman for PV Solar UK but told him he did not want to take a loan on as he was preparing for retirement. He said he was told the move would provide money towards his pension, which persuaded him, and he took out a loan with Barclays of more than Â£10,000 over 10 years. Mr Thompson said the payments he was getting back from the power his solar panels sent to the National Grid did not correspond with what he was told. ""I had to dip into my savings which I was putting away for retirement to pay the loan off. To me it was lies,"" he said. The Financial Services Ombudsman said it had received 2,000 complaints about solar panels An independent survey of Mr Thompson's system showed even after 20 years the income from the panels would not cover the cost of the loan. Barclays offered him some compensation but Mr Thompson said it was not enough. PV Solar UK went into liquidation in 2017. Robert Skillen, who was the director of the firm when Mr Thompson bought his system, said Mr Thompson's panels would make him money. Mr Skillen is now in business claiming to help people who have been missold solar panels. He did not want to be interviewed. Tony Walch, from Bolton, was told he would be better off by Â£30,000 over 20 years when he bought solar panels from MyPlanet. He said: ""They were very, very persuasive. Everything they said was plausible. It was a no-brainer."" Tony Walch said everything he was told was plausible He took out a loan of Â£15,000 but he said the panels did not generate the amount of electricity he was promised. They also overheated, damaging the equipment, and he believed they had cost him more than Â£500 a year. MyPlanet went into liquidation in 2016. Former director Mark Bonifacio said all calculations had been made using strict methodology, and the performance of the systems was impossible to predict because of different factors affecting performance. He said MyPlanet installed more than 15,000 systems, and customers would be getting free electricity. Debbie Enever, from the Financial Ombudsman Service, said: ""We have got about 2,000 complaints about solar panels at the moment and more coming through every week."" Loans for solar panels were taken out through Barclays Bank, which said: ""We always seek to ensure customers are satisfied with our financial products. Where customers have cause to complain we will review each case individually.""

Defeat malaria in a generation - here's how,"The world could be free of malaria - one of the oldest and deadliest diseases to affect humanity - within a generation, a major report says. Each year there are still more than 200 million cases of the disease, which mostly kills young children. The report says eradicating malaria is no longer a distant dream, but wiping out the parasite will probably need an extra $2bn (Â£1.6bn) of annual funding. Experts say eradication is a ""goal of epic proportions"". Malaria is a disease caused byPlasmodiumparasites. These are spread from person to person by the bite of female mosquitoes in search of a blood meal. Once infected, people become very sick with a severe fever and shaking chills. The malaria parasites are spread by mosquiotes The parasites infect cells in the liver and red blood cells, and other symptoms include anaemia. Eventually the disease takes a toll on the whole body, including the brain, and can be fatal. Around 435,000 people - mostly children - die from malaria each year. The world has already made huge progress against malaria. Since 2000: the number of countries with malaria has fallen from 106 to 86 cases have fallen by 36% the death rate has fallen by 60% This is largely down to widespread access to ways of preventing mosquito bites, such as bed nets treated with insecticide, and better drugs for treating people who are infected. Sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets prevents mosquitoes biting at night ""Despite unprecedented progress, malaria continues to strip communities around the world of promise and economic potential,"" said Dr Winnie Mpanju-Shumbusho,  one of the report authors. ""This is particularly true in Africa, where just five countries account for nearly half of the global burden."" Eradicating malaria - effectively wiping it off the face of the planet - would be a monumental achievement. The report was commissioned by the World Health Organization three years ago to assess how feasible it would be, and how much it would cost. Forty-one of the world's leading malaria experts - ranging from scientists to economists - have concluded that it can be done by 2050. Their report,published in the Lancet,external, is being described as ""the first of its kind"". ""For too long, malaria eradication has been a distant dream, but now we have evidence that malaria can and should be eradicated by 2050,"" said Sir Richard Feachem, one of the report authors. ""This report shows that eradication is possible within a generation."" However, he warned it would take ""bold action"" in order to achieve the goal. This video can not be played Watch Pallab Ghosh's report on whether ""serenading"" mosquitoes could help stop malaria? The report estimates that based on current trends, the world will be ""largely free of malaria"" by 2050. Malaria vaccine rolled out for tens of thousands of children But there will still be a stubborn belt of malaria across Africa, stretching from Senegal in the north-west to Mozambique in the south-east. To reach eradication by 2050 will require current technologies to be used more effectively, and the development of new ways of tackling the disease, the report says. This could include the ""game-changing potential"" of gene-drive technologies. Unlike the normal rules of genetic inheritance, gene-drives force a gene (a piece of DNA) to spread through the population. It could in theory make mosquitoes infertile and cause their populations to collapse, or make them resistant to the parasite. Gene drive wipes out mosquitoes in the lab GM fungus rapidly kills 99% of malaria mosquitoes, study suggests King Mswati III of Eswatini King Mswati III of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and chair of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance said: ""Malaria eradication within a generation is ambitious, achievable and necessary. ""The struggle has been constant to keep up with the malaria mosquito and the parasite, both of which are evolving to evade the effect of malaria interventions. ""We must make sure that innovation is prioritised."" The report estimates around $4.3bn (Â£3.5bn) is spent on malaria every year at the moment. But it would need a further $2bn a year in order to rid the world of malaria by 2050. The authors say there is also a cost of business as usual, in terms of lives lost and the constant struggle against the malaria parasite and the mosquitoes evolving resistance to drugs and insecticides. The report concludes that getting an extra $2bn a year will be ""challenging"" but the social and economic benefits of eradicating malaria would ""greatly exceed the costs"". The malaria vaccine, which is starting to be rolled out in large trials, should help save lives Eradicating a disease is a challenge on a global scale (literally). It has happened only once before for an infection in people - smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. It required a huge effort and a highly effective vaccine to get the job done. But there is a reason smallpox is the only one, and the history of poliovirus shows how challenging eradication can be. In the wake of the success with smallpox, there was widespread hope polio would be rapidly consigned to history too, and a target of eradicationby the year 2000,externalwas set. Two decades after that initial target and cases have been cut by 99%. However, the last 1% has proved to be incredibly difficult. Nigeria, and as a result the whole of Africa, is on the cusp of eliminating polio, but getting the vaccine to every child in the two remaining endemic countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan) is still proving difficult. ""Eradicating malaria has been one of the ultimate public health goals for a century, it is also proving to be one the greatest challenges,"" said Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization. ""But we will not achieve eradication within this timeframe with the currently available tools and approaches - most of which were developed in the past century or even earlier."" Dr Fred Binka, from the University of Health and Allied Sciences in Ghana, said: ""Malaria eradication is a goal of epic proportions. ""It will require ambition, commitment and partnership like never before, but we know that its return is worth the investment, not only by saving lives in perpetuity, but also improving human welfare, strengthening economies and contributing to a healthier, safer and more equitable world.""

"Defeat malaria in a generation - here's howThe world could be free of malaria by 2050, says a major report that sets out the road to eradication.Health","The world could be free of malaria - one of the oldest and deadliest diseases to affect humanity - within a generation, a major report says. Each year there are still more than 200 million cases of the disease, which mostly kills young children. The report says eradicating malaria is no longer a distant dream, but wiping out the parasite will probably need an extra $2bn (Â£1.6bn) of annual funding. Experts say eradication is a ""goal of epic proportions"". Malaria is a disease caused byPlasmodiumparasites. These are spread from person to person by the bite of female mosquitoes in search of a blood meal. Once infected, people become very sick with a severe fever and shaking chills. The malaria parasites are spread by mosquiotes The parasites infect cells in the liver and red blood cells, and other symptoms include anaemia. Eventually the disease takes a toll on the whole body, including the brain, and can be fatal. Around 435,000 people - mostly children - die from malaria each year. The world has already made huge progress against malaria. Since 2000: the number of countries with malaria has fallen from 106 to 86 cases have fallen by 36% the death rate has fallen by 60% This is largely down to widespread access to ways of preventing mosquito bites, such as bed nets treated with insecticide, and better drugs for treating people who are infected. Sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets prevents mosquitoes biting at night ""Despite unprecedented progress, malaria continues to strip communities around the world of promise and economic potential,"" said Dr Winnie Mpanju-Shumbusho,  one of the report authors. ""This is particularly true in Africa, where just five countries account for nearly half of the global burden."" Eradicating malaria - effectively wiping it off the face of the planet - would be a monumental achievement. The report was commissioned by the World Health Organization three years ago to assess how feasible it would be, and how much it would cost. Forty-one of the world's leading malaria experts - ranging from scientists to economists - have concluded that it can be done by 2050. Their report,published in the Lancet,external, is being described as ""the first of its kind"". ""For too long, malaria eradication has been a distant dream, but now we have evidence that malaria can and should be eradicated by 2050,"" said Sir Richard Feachem, one of the report authors. ""This report shows that eradication is possible within a generation."" However, he warned it would take ""bold action"" in order to achieve the goal. This video can not be played Watch Pallab Ghosh's report on whether ""serenading"" mosquitoes could help stop malaria? The report estimates that based on current trends, the world will be ""largely free of malaria"" by 2050. Malaria vaccine rolled out for tens of thousands of children But there will still be a stubborn belt of malaria across Africa, stretching from Senegal in the north-west to Mozambique in the south-east. To reach eradication by 2050 will require current technologies to be used more effectively, and the development of new ways of tackling the disease, the report says. This could include the ""game-changing potential"" of gene-drive technologies. Unlike the normal rules of genetic inheritance, gene-drives force a gene (a piece of DNA) to spread through the population. It could in theory make mosquitoes infertile and cause their populations to collapse, or make them resistant to the parasite. Gene drive wipes out mosquitoes in the lab GM fungus rapidly kills 99% of malaria mosquitoes, study suggests King Mswati III of Eswatini King Mswati III of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and chair of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance said: ""Malaria eradication within a generation is ambitious, achievable and necessary. ""The struggle has been constant to keep up with the malaria mosquito and the parasite, both of which are evolving to evade the effect of malaria interventions. ""We must make sure that innovation is prioritised."" The report estimates around $4.3bn (Â£3.5bn) is spent on malaria every year at the moment. But it would need a further $2bn a year in order to rid the world of malaria by 2050. The authors say there is also a cost of business as usual, in terms of lives lost and the constant struggle against the malaria parasite and the mosquitoes evolving resistance to drugs and insecticides. The report concludes that getting an extra $2bn a year will be ""challenging"" but the social and economic benefits of eradicating malaria would ""greatly exceed the costs"". The malaria vaccine, which is starting to be rolled out in large trials, should help save lives Eradicating a disease is a challenge on a global scale (literally). It has happened only once before for an infection in people - smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. It required a huge effort and a highly effective vaccine to get the job done. But there is a reason smallpox is the only one, and the history of poliovirus shows how challenging eradication can be. In the wake of the success with smallpox, there was widespread hope polio would be rapidly consigned to history too, and a target of eradicationby the year 2000,externalwas set. Two decades after that initial target and cases have been cut by 99%. However, the last 1% has proved to be incredibly difficult. Nigeria, and as a result the whole of Africa, is on the cusp of eliminating polio, but getting the vaccine to every child in the two remaining endemic countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan) is still proving difficult. ""Eradicating malaria has been one of the ultimate public health goals for a century, it is also proving to be one the greatest challenges,"" said Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization. ""But we will not achieve eradication within this timeframe with the currently available tools and approaches - most of which were developed in the past century or even earlier."" Dr Fred Binka, from the University of Health and Allied Sciences in Ghana, said: ""Malaria eradication is a goal of epic proportions.

Extra carriages on trains for Scotland matchThey will be on trains to and from Mount Florida and on trains travelling back to Perth and Dundee.Glasgow & West Scotland,"ScotRail is adding extra carriages to trains going to and from Hampden Park for Scotland's Euro 2020 qualifying fixture against Belgium. It comes afterrecent problems with overcrowdingon some of its services. The train operator said it would be adding carriages to trains to and from Mount Florida as well as on trains travelling back to Perth and Dundee. Queuing systems will be in place at Glasgow Central before the match, and at Mount Florida station afterwards. Fans are being advised to head back to Mount Florida as quickly as possible after the game finishes and join the queues on Bolton Drive as trains are expected to be busy. ScotRail said those heading to the game for the 19:45 kick off should allow extra time for travel - as well as purchasing tickets to Mount Florida in advance. An alcohol ban will be in place on trains between Glasgow and Mount Florida from 17:00 and ScotRail will have extra staff on the ground. Train chaos before and after Scotland game ScotRail admits it 'didn't do well enough' after delays ScotRail under fire after major weekend disruption Phil Campbell, ScotRail's head of customer operations, said: ""This is a crucial game for Scotland, and we're looking forward to helping supporters travel to the game to cheer on our national team. ""To help the event run smoothly, we're adding extra carriages to trains to and from Hampden. ""Regular commuters who travel home from Glasgow on the line via Mount Florida should be aware that services will be much busier than normal with fans heading to the match."" ScotRail admitted it did not do well enough following overcrowding on some of its services last month Last month ScotRail said it had ""not done well enough"" after being criticised following major disruption on services from Edinburgh. Commuters claimed trains from Waverley and Haymarket were dangerously overcrowded on the night of Saturday 24 August, while other services were cancelled. Passenger numbers were high as it was the last weekend of the Edinburgh festivals and Murrayfield had hosted an international rugby match. ScotRail said a trespasser on the line and a train failure were partly to blame and admitted it could not cope with the volume of customers on top of two rail incidents. On Friday football fans travelling by train to Hampden for Scotland's game against Russia also faced serious disruption. A train was brought to a halt after a passenger triggered an alarm. As a result, many services to the south of Glasgow including the Cathcart Circle which serves the area of the stadium were cancelled or delayed. It later emerged that knock-on disruption would continue until late evening, affecting fans after the game.

"Authorities in Bahamas defend hurricane responseDorian ripped through the island nation last week, with 43 confirmed dead and thousands homeless.Latin America & Caribbean","This video can not be played On board a UK ship offering aid and rescue to the Bahamas Bahamian officials have defended their response to Hurricane Dorian after it devastated parts of the island chain last week, killing at least 45 people. Residents on the Abaco Islands have accused the government of failing to provide assistance and prevent looting. Officials have denied covering up the number of deaths. The toll is likely to rise as hundreds, possibly thousands, of people are still missing. Some 70,000 people were in need of food and shelter, the United Nations said. Thousands of residents from the hardest-hit areas in the Abacos have been sent to the country's capital, Nassau, where authorities say they may have to use tents or containers to house the victims. The path of destruction Who is helping the survivors? In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Desperate search for missing Health Minister Duane Sands dismissedallegations that the government was covering up the number of victims,,externalsaying the priority was not to count the dead but to search for the missing and provide assistance to those in need, according to the Miami Herald newspaper. The BBC's Mat Morrison on the Abaco Islands Locals here warn us that there are more bodies buried beneath the rubble in Marsh Harbour, especially in the shanty towns known as the Mudd and Pigeon Peas. They wonder why officials haven't come to retrieve all those who perished during Hurricane Dorian. As you walk around the town, there is very little in terms of any official presence. In fact, there's hardly anyone at all - just a scattering of locals looking through what once was their homes, or rummaging for food or supplies. On the hood of a car in one of the worst-hit areas lies the corpse of a large dog, untouched since the storm. Its presence speaks to the lack of attention this area has received in the week since Dorian hit this island. In Marsh Harbour, where 90% of infrastructure is damaged or destroyed, residents complained that aid had been too slow to arrive. ""We've had to funnel gasoline out of destroyed cars to get injured people back and forth. There's no food, no medicine and no water,"" said 37-year-old Tepeto Davis. ""We're suffering out here and no-one cares about us."" Carl Smith, spokesperson for the Bahamas' National Emergency Management Agency (Nema), said: ""[We're] doing everything [we] can to move as effectively and as efficiently as [we] can, given the circumstances. We're dealing with a disaster."" Some 70,000 people are in need of food and shelter, according to the UN There were also fears that diarrhoea and waterborne diseases could spread as drinking water might be contaminated, the Pan American Health Organization said, but no cases of cholera had been reported. Mark Green, head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), said he had been ""struck by the focused nature of the devastation"" on the Abacos, and that some areas looked ""almost as though a nuclear bomb was dropped"". About 3,500 people have been evacuated to Nassau by passenger planes, cruise liners and government boats and ships. While some were scrambling for shelter others worried that it would take a long time for them to rebuild their lives. ""The government says everyone's being fed, and that's good,"" 61-year-old Anthony Morley told Reuters news agency at a resort where volunteers had subsidised rooms for survivors. ""But for food I can fish. What I need is a house. I don't have a bed, a refrigerator."" This video can not be played ""Plenty of people are dead,"" says survivor from Hurricane Dorian Jenelle Eli, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross, said: ""People are concerned about their next step, but also how they'll earn an income and what their lives will look like in the future."" On Saturday, a humanitarian cruise ship carrying 1,400 people docked in Riviera Beach, Florida. There were reports on Sunday that passengers aboard a ferry boat which was leaving the Bahamas for the US were ordered to disembark if they did not have a visa. In a statement, theUS Customs and Border Protection said it ""strongly encourage[d] private vessel and aircraft operators,externalto co-ordinate any evacuation missions with Bahamian authorities before evacuating anyone from the Bahamas"".

"Authorities in Bahamas defend hurricane responseDorian ripped through the island nation last Sunday, with 43 confirmed dead and thousands homeless.Latin America & Caribbean","This video can not be played On board a UK ship offering aid and rescue to the Bahamas Bahamian officials have defended their response to Hurricane Dorian after it devastated parts of the island chain last week, killing at least 45 people. Residents on the Abaco Islands have accused the government of failing to provide assistance and prevent looting. Officials have denied covering up the number of deaths. The toll is likely to rise as hundreds, possibly thousands, of people are still missing. Some 70,000 people were in need of food and shelter, the United Nations said. Thousands of residents from the hardest-hit areas in the Abacos have been sent to the country's capital, Nassau, where authorities say they may have to use tents or containers to house the victims. The path of destruction Who is helping the survivors? In pictures: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas Desperate search for missing Health Minister Duane Sands dismissedallegations that the government was covering up the number of victims,,externalsaying the priority was not to count the dead but to search for the missing and provide assistance to those in need, according to the Miami Herald newspaper. The BBC's Mat Morrison on the Abaco Islands Locals here warn us that there are more bodies buried beneath the rubble in Marsh Harbour, especially in the shanty towns known as the Mudd and Pigeon Peas. They wonder why officials haven't come to retrieve all those who perished during Hurricane Dorian. As you walk around the town, there is very little in terms of any official presence. In fact, there's hardly anyone at all - just a scattering of locals looking through what once was their homes, or rummaging for food or supplies. On the hood of a car in one of the worst-hit areas lies the corpse of a large dog, untouched since the storm. Its presence speaks to the lack of attention this area has received in the week since Dorian hit this island. In Marsh Harbour, where 90% of infrastructure is damaged or destroyed, residents complained that aid had been too slow to arrive. ""We've had to funnel gasoline out of destroyed cars to get injured people back and forth. There's no food, no medicine and no water,"" said 37-year-old Tepeto Davis. ""We're suffering out here and no-one cares about us."" Carl Smith, spokesperson for the Bahamas' National Emergency Management Agency (Nema), said: ""[We're] doing everything [we] can to move as effectively and as efficiently as [we] can, given the circumstances. We're dealing with a disaster."" Some 70,000 people are in need of food and shelter, according to the UN There were also fears that diarrhoea and waterborne diseases could spread as drinking water might be contaminated, the Pan American Health Organization said, but no cases of cholera had been reported. Mark Green, head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), said he had been ""struck by the focused nature of the devastation"" on the Abacos, and that some areas looked ""almost as though a nuclear bomb was dropped"". About 3,500 people have been evacuated to Nassau by passenger planes, cruise liners and government boats and ships. While some were scrambling for shelter others worried that it would take a long time for them to rebuild their lives. ""The government says everyone's being fed, and that's good,"" 61-year-old Anthony Morley told Reuters news agency at a resort where volunteers had subsidised rooms for survivors. ""But for food I can fish. What I need is a house. I don't have a bed, a refrigerator."" This video can not be played ""Plenty of people are dead,"" says survivor from Hurricane Dorian Jenelle Eli, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross, said: ""People are concerned about their next step, but also how they'll earn an income and what their lives will look like in the future."" On Saturday, a humanitarian cruise ship carrying 1,400 people docked in Riviera Beach, Florida. There were reports on Sunday that passengers aboard a ferry boat which was leaving the Bahamas for the US were ordered to disembark if they did not have a visa. In a statement, theUS Customs and Border Protection said it ""strongly encourage[d] private vessel and aircraft operators,externalto co-ordinate any evacuation missions with Bahamian authorities before evacuating anyone from the Bahamas"". Meanwhile, the UN's World Food Programme is sending food and supplies. Other offers of international help include: USAID has said it will allocate $2.8m (Â£2.3m) in help, as well as emergency supplies for 44,000 people The American Red Cross says it has committed $2.8m The UK Royal Navy and private organisations are helping evacuate residents to Nassau Dorian ripped through the northern Bahamas as a category five hurricane with winds gusts of 300km/h (200mph) and huge storm surges. The hurricane has diminished into a post-tropical cyclone and it smashed into the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on Saturday,toppling trees and cutting power to more than 450,000 people.

Thousands complain about solar panelsPeople who took out large loans say the thousands of pounds in savings they were promised have not materialised.,"Brian Thompson said he had to use his retirement savings to pay his loan off Thousands of people who bought solar panels have complained to a financial watchdog that they are not bringing them the returns they were promised. Many people took out loans to pay for panels on the promise they would save thousands of pounds in electricity costs and make money generating power. They say they have not had the expected savings, and the Financial Services Ombudsman has had 2,000 complaints. Barclays Bank has put aside Â£38m to deal with potential claims. Brian Thompson from Rowlands Gill, Gateshead, told BBC Inside Out he was contacted by a salesman for PV Solar UK but told him he did not want to take a loan on as he was preparing for retirement. He said he was told the move would provide money towards his pension, which persuaded him, and he took out a loan with Barclays of more than Â£10,000 over 10 years. Mr Thompson said the payments he was getting back from the power his solar panels sent to the National Grid did not correspond with what he was told. ""I had to dip into my savings which I was putting away for retirement to pay the loan off. To me it was lies,"" he said. The Financial Services Ombudsman said it had received 2,000 complaints about solar panels An independent survey of Mr Thompson's system showed even after 20 years the income from the panels would not cover the cost of the loan. Barclays offered him some compensation but Mr Thompson said it was not enough. PV Solar UK went into liquidation in 2017. Robert Skillen, who was the director of the firm when Mr Thompson bought his system, said Mr Thompson's panels would make him money. Mr Skillen is now in business claiming to help people who have been missold solar panels. He did not want to be interviewed. Tony Walch, from Bolton, was told he would be better off by Â£30,000 over 20 years when he bought solar panels from MyPlanet. He said: ""They were very, very persuasive. Everything they said was plausible. It was a no-brainer."" Tony Walch said everything he was told was plausible He took out a loan of Â£15,000 but he said the panels did not generate the amount of electricity he was promised. They also overheated, damaging the equipment, and he believed they had cost him more than Â£500 a year. MyPlanet went into liquidation in 2016. Former director Mark Bonifacio said all calculations had been made using strict methodology, and the performance of the systems was impossible to predict because of different factors affecting performance. He said MyPlanet installed more than 15,000 systems, and customers would be getting free electricity. Debbie Enever, from the Financial Ombudsman Service, said: ""We have got about 2,000 complaints about solar panels at the moment and more coming through every week."" Loans for solar panels were taken out through Barclays Bank, which said: ""We always seek to ensure customers are satisfied with our financial products. Where customers have cause to complain we will review each case individually.""

TUC calls for ban on âclass discriminationâThe body says wealthier graduates are far more likely to start on higher salaries than working-class peers.Business,"Frances O'Grady has led the TUC since 2013 Trade union body the TUC has called for legal measures to tackle discrimination based on class at work. Among the proposals, it said firms should be forced to report any gaps in pay between workers from different social backgrounds. The body said graduates from wealthier families were more than twice as likely to start on a higher salary than their working-class peers. The TUC's annual congress is being held in Brighton from Sunday to Wednesday. It said that without new laws, people from working-class backgrounds would continue to face ""direct"" forms of discrimination, such as employer bias during job applications and interviews. It also warned of indirect forms of discrimination, such as the use of unpaid internships as a gateway into jobs. 'Who you know' It said the country was wasting some of its ""best skills and talent"" and urged the government to outlaw discrimination on the basis of class, as it had done with race, gender and disability. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""If you're from a working-class family, the odds are still stacked against you. ""Everyone knows that getting that dream job is too often a case of who you know, not what you know. It's high time we banned discrimination against working class people. ""Let's have a new duty on employers to stamp out class prejudice once and for all."" The TUC says there are a number of definitions about what working class means, some historic and some more recent. But it said that rather than ""ignite a lengthy debate about definitions, we want to focus on how to tackle the persistent class inequality that still exists in Britain today"". It said other forms of disadvantage experienced by working-class people included low pay and the greater impact of austerity on working-class households.

"BA pilots begin two-day strike over payBritish Airways pilots will walk out on Monday and Tuesday, leaving almost all flights grounded.","This video can not be played 'BA and pilots are both to blame' British Airways pilots are striking for a second day in an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. Tens of thousands of passengers have been told not to go to airports, with the airline cancelling some 1,700 flights due to the disruption. The pilots' union Balpa said BA management's cost-cuts and ""dumbing down"" of the brand had eroded confidence in the airline. But BA chief Alex Cruz said investment in the operator had never been so big. The walkout is due to end at midnight on Tuesday, although there could be additional unexpected cancellations on Wednesday. Both sides say they are willing to hold further talks, but no date has been set. The pilots are currently scheduled to stage another strike on 27 September. Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: ""It is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute."" But he told the BBC that while BA says publicly it is willing to talk, ""in private they say they are not going to negotiate"". And although the headline dispute is about pay, he said there was also deep resentment about the airline's direction. ""BA has lost the trust and confidence of pilots because of cost-cutting and the dumbing down of the brand... management want to squeeze every last penny out of customers and staff,"" Mr Strutton said. BA's Terminal 5 was deserted on Monday morning Mr Cruz defended the airline against Mr Strutton's claim, saying it had never in its history embarked on such a big investment programme in services and training. He said the airline was ""ready and willing"" to return to talks with Balpa. It is the first time BA pilots have walked out and the action could cost the airline up to Â£40m a day. Some 4,000 pilots are involved in the strike. In a statement, BA said: ""We understand the frustration and disruption Balpa's strike action has caused our customers. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this. ""Unfortunately, with no detail from Balpa on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100% of our flights."" By Katie Prescott, Business reporter It's unlikely that passengers will see that much disruption at airports. Most of the real problems have happened over the past few weeks as people have rushed to make other travel arrangements, re-book their flights or apply for refunds. In terms of the negotiations, both sides say that they are open to talks but neither has responded to the other, underlining just how acrimonious their relationship has become. Ostensibly this is about pay, but there's also underlying discontent among pilots with the company's strategy. Some say they don't like British Airways' cost-cutting drive and they want to see more of the benefits of their bumper profits. But industry insiders say BA has made those profits because they have cut costs. They also say airlines are expensive and unpredictable beasts to run and are in thrall to a fluctuating oil price (jet fuel accounts for a quarter of their operating costs) and random acts such as drones in the air. BA, however, contend that the company has been recycling profits into new investment in the airline. The company says it is spending Â£6.5bn on new aircraft, new cabins and WiFi on planes. If the two sides don't come to an agreement in the next few weeks, another strike is scheduled for 27 September. The result of the pilots' union ballot allows strike action until the start of next year, but Balpa says it hopes to resolve the situation well before then. Pilots previously rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which was proposed by the airline in July. Balpa says its members have taken lower pay rises and made sacrifices during more stringent times for the airline in recent years. The union insists that now BA's financial performance has improved - its parent company IAG reported a 9% rise in profits last year - they should see a greater share of the profits. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out? No 10 tells BA and pilots to 'sort out' strike Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes Passengers angry at BA 'silence' amid strike chaos BA says its pilots already receive ""world-class"" salaries. The airline believes the pay offer is ""fair and generous"", and that if it is good enough for BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers - whose unions, Unite and the GMB, have both accepted it - it should be good enough for pilots, too. The airline says once the 11.5% pay deal has fully taken effect in three years' time, some BA captains could be taking home more than Â£200,000 a year, allowances included. Two weeks ago, BA informed some customers they would have to re-book their flights due to the planned industrial action. Unfortunately, due to ""human error"" the airline mistakenly sent emails to some customers whose flights were not actually affected, throwingBA's customer service operations into a tailspinover the bank holiday weekend. On Friday, BA said the ""vast majority"" of affected customers had now either accepted a refund or rebooked, either on alternative dates or with other airlines. BA advice,externalsays you can request a full refund, rebook your flight for another time in the next 355 days, or use the value of your fare to fly to a different destination. If your flight has been cancelled due to a strike,the Civil Aviation Authority says,externalpassengers also have a legal right to a replacement flight at BA's expense to get you to your destination, even if this means travelling with a different airline. Most affected passengers would already have been in contact with BA, but they may not have considered additional costs, such as airport parking. They are advised to keep receipts for these extra costs, and BA said it would look at refunding them on a case-by-case basis. The cost of separate hotel or accommodation bookings that cannot be used may need to be claimed from travel insurance. BA strike: Why are pilots walking out?
