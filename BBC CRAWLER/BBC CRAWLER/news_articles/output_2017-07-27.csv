Boy Scouts apologise for Trump's speech,"This video can not be played Donald Trump delivered a speech to remember to the Boy Scouts of America The chief scout of the Boy Scouts of America has apologised for the remarks made by President Donald Trump at the group's national event this week. Over 30,000 people attending the event, where Mr Trump promoted his agenda and criticised his political rivals. Michael Surbaugh says the president's invitation was customary. ""I want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree."" He went onto say how,externalthe Boy Scouts of America (BSA) have tried to avoid taking political positions since its creation. ""We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting programme,"" he said. He added: ""We teach youth to become active citizens, to participate in their government, respect the variety of perspectives and to stand up for individual rights."" Trump boy scout speech angers parents During Mr Trump's remarks in West Virginia, he assailed his former opponent Hillary Clinton, touted his election victory, and railed against the ""fake news"" media. ""Who the hell wants to speak about politics?"" Mr Trump asked the audience, before beginning his remarks. Many parents and members of the Scout community criticised the highly-politicised nature of the speech that followed. The whoops and hollers ran contrary to some parents' views of boy scout values On Wednesday, BSA president Randall Stephenson, told AP News that the group had been concerned that Mr Trump may say something controversial during his speech. But they felt obliged to issue an invitation to him, as they have done previously for every sitting US president, he said. ""If I suggested I was surprised by the president's comments, I would be disingenuous,"" said Mr Stephenson.

Corporate manslaughter warning over Grenfell,"Police investigating the Grenfell Tower fire say they have ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect that corporate manslaughter offences may have been committed. It means senior executives from the council and the tenant management organisation that ran the block are likely to be interviewed under caution. A letter from the Met Police to residents said officers had ""seized a huge amount of material"". At least 80 people died in the fire in North Kensington on 14 June. Organisations guilty of the offence of corporate manslaughter are liable to an ""unlimited fine"". Individuals cannot be charged with corporate manslaughter, an offence which is intended to work ""in conjunction"" with other forms of accountability. Work to start on covering Grenfell Tower Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What happened at Grenfell Tower? London fire: Six questions for the investigation The relevant section of the letter says Met Police officers have ""seized a huge amount of material and taken a large number of witness statements"". ""After an initial assessment of that information, the officer leading the investigation has today notified the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenancy Management Organisation that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that each organisation may have committed the offence of corporate manslaughter under the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007,"" it said. This video can not be played New Kensington and Chelsea council leader Elizabeth Campbell: ""I will co-operate in any way I possibly can"" The Met Police also released a statement on Thursday, stating that its investigation into the cause and spread of the fire was a ""complex and far reaching investigation that by its very nature will take a considerable time to complete"". Newly elected council leader Elizabeth Campbell, whowas booed and heckled at a public meeting earlier this month, said residents ""deserve answers"" about the blaze and the ""police investigation will provide these"". ""We fully support the Metropolitan Police investigation and we will co-operate in every way we can,"" Ms Campbell added. ""It would not be appropriate to comment further on matters subject to the police investigation."" BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds says the Met Police has briefed a number of times that corporate manslaughter is a possible offence, along with breaches of health and safety laws. The effect of what the police have said is to put both organisations on notice that their senior executives are likely to be questioned under caution in relation to the fire. This means that evidence can be used against both bodies in a court, our correspondent added. Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, whose friend Khadija Saye died in the fire, said the punishment for corporate manslaughter, a fine, would not ""represent justice for the Grenfell victims and their families"". ""Gross negligence manslaughter carries a punishment of prison time, and I hope that the police and the CPS are considering charges of manslaughter caused by gross negligence,"" he added. Yvette Williams, a co-ordinator at the Justice 4 Grenfell campaign group, said the development would help increase levels of trust between the police and the community. ""However, what we would like to see running alongside that is individuals being prosecuted. We want is individuals named and prosecuted - you can have both, but we don't want corporate manslaughter on its own,"" she added. Kensington and Chelsea Council has been criticised for its response to the Grenfell fire The local authority has been accused ofbeing slow to react to the disaster on the groundand not doing enough to re-house residents of Grenfell Tower. Council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown and his deputy Rock Feilding-Mellen resigned following continued criticism of its response to the tragedy. Robert Black, chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, also stepped down to ""concentrate on assisting with the investigation and inquiry"". The news comes after site manager at the tower block, Michael Lockwood,told a public meeting on Wednesday that the building would be covered in August. He said that he expected the demolition of the tower block would begin ""towards the end of 2018"". Some possessions could be retrieved from 33 of the block's flats, he added. The residents of Grenfell Tower hadreportedly raised fire safety concerns for several yearsbefore the blaze, according to a community action group. A Newsnight investigation has shown that an official test of the types of materials used at Grenfell Tower suggest thatdesigns such as that used in the tower's cladding are fundamentally flawed. Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered a public inquiry into the tower fire, which will be led by retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick. He told survivors at a meeting on Tuesdayhe would ""get to the bottom"" of the tragedybut insisted he had ""no power"" to make arrests over the blaze. What happened at Grenfell Tower?

Ireland 'wants sea border with UK',"Theresa May held talks with Leo Varadkar at Downing Street in June TheTimes says Prime Minister Theresa May faces a new setback in her Brexit negotiations,externalafter the Irish government said her plan for free trade between the border that separates the north and south is unworkable. The paper says on its front page the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, wants the Irish Sea to become the post-Brexit border with customs and immigration checks to be located at ports and airports instead. UK officials were said to be taken aback by Dublin's change in tone, expressed at an EU summit in Brussels last week. TheFinancial Times reports the Chancellor Philip Hammond is seeking a transitional deal,externalwith the EU that he wants to break down into two phases. The paper understands he told business leaders in Downing Street on Monday this would start with what is been described as an ""off-the-shelf"" period - rather than a new legal framework for an interim agreement. This would allow the UK to continue having full access to the single market and the customs union, while a new trade deal was finalised. TheDaily Telegraph fears a study commissioned by the Home Secretary Amber Rudd,externalto assess the contribution of EU nationals to the British economy may be used to set up the case for continued free movement. In an editorial, the paper say it is concerned that what it calls a ""trap"" could be set at the last minute because the findings will not be published until six months before Brexit. TheDaily Mail seizes on contradictory remarks from Ms Rudd,external, who suggested free movement could continue for a transitional period, and the immigration minister, Brandon Lewis, who said it should end when the UK leaves the EU in 2019. The paper calls this a ""shambles"", and says it not only shakes public confidence, but gives ammunition to Brussels negotiators. TheDaily Mirror says Brexit was never going to be easy,externalbut it did expect the government to have a coherent plan; instead we have more positions than the Kama Sutra. For theTimes a strategy of sorts has been announced,external.  The paper calls on ministers to confer more carefully with business to avoid sowing confusion among employers planning for the future. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external TheSun says the Ministry of Justice suffered ""outright shame"",externalwhen it published figures which show that more than 70 inmates were freed from prisons in England and Wales by mistake last year. The paper claims an average of 20 prison guards are beaten up each day and it is of the opinion that too many jails are lawless, overcrowded cesspits dramatically worsened by a shortage of staff. TheDaily Mirror,externalsays ministers need to wake up to the fact that our ""failing"" overcrowded jails need fundamental reform. ""Manslaughter"" is the Daily Mail's front page headline,externalafter police found ""reasonable grounds"" to consider corporate manslaughter charges in connection with the fire at Grenfell Tower which killed at least 80 people. The paper describes this as a ""dramatic development"" which means town hall chiefs at Kensington and Chelsea in west London face police interviews over claims they ignored repeated safety warnings. Yvette Williams from the campaign group Justice4Grenfell tells the Guardian,externalthe decision will restore some faith in the police investigation but she would like to see individuals prosecuted as well. Angelina Jolie features in several papers after she revealed how a Cambodian child was cast in her film about the Khmer Rouge. TheDaily Express says the Hollywood actress, director and United Nations goodwill ambassador,externalhas sparked a ""bizarre child actor row"". TheDaily Telegraph reports the auditions involved the crew giving impoverished youngsters money,externalwhich was then snatched away, in order for the children to come up with a reason for wanting the cash. Jolie is quoted in the Daily Mail saying she wanted to elicit an ""authentic connection to pain"",externaland found a girl who said her family did not have enough money for a nice funeral for her grandfather. But critics on social media have accused the star of ""torturing children"" and using a ""monstrous"" and ""cruel"" psychological casting game.

Charlie Gard parents 'denied final wish',"Charlie has encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome Terminally-ill Charlie Gard will be moved to a hospice and have his life support withdrawn soon after, a High Court judge has decided. Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said it was not in his best interests to spend a long time in a hospice. His parents had wanted a private team to care for Charlie so they could have more time with him. ""GOSH have denied us our final wish,"" his mother said. The judgeapproved a plan,externalthat will see Charlie die shortly after being moved. Mr Justice Francis added that no details about when he would be moved and where could be made public. In a statement, the hospital said it deeply regretted ""that profound and heartfelt differences"" between Charlie's doctors and parents have ""had to be played out in court over such a protracted period"". The story of Charlie Gard Charlie has been in intensive care since October Parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, and GOSH had until 12:00 BST to agree Charlie's end-of-life care. However, an agreementwas not reached by the noon deadline. The parents' lawyer, Grant Armstrong said they wanted to spend days with Charlie at a hospice before his death. But hospital bosses said they could not agree to the arrangement as his parents had not found a paediatric intensive care specialist. Commenting on the decision, Connie said: ""We just want some peace with our son, no hospital, no lawyers, no courts, no media, just quality time with Charlie away from everything, to say goodbye to him in the most loving way. ""Most people won't ever have to go through what we have been through, we've had no control over our son's life and no control over our son's death. ""Despite us and our legal team working tirelessly to arrange this near impossible task, the judge has ordered against what we arranged and has agreed to what GOSH asked. ""This subsequently gives us very little time with our son."" Connie Yates was in court on Wednesday to hear the decision about where her son will spend his final days The hospital said there was ""simply no way that Charlie... can spend any significant time outside of an intensive care environment safely"". It added: ""We will arrange for Charlie to be transferred to a specialist children's hospice... who will do all they can to make these last moments as comfortable and peaceful for Charlie and his loved ones."" GOSH said that ""while we always respect parents' views, we will never do anything that could cause our patients unnecessary and prolonged suffering"". TheHigh Court order,externalsays Charlie will continue to be treated in hospital for a ""period of time"" before being moved to the hospice, which cannot be named for legal reasons. It says doctors can then withdraw ""artificial ventilation"" after a period of time. Everyone involved has agreed that the ""arrangements"" will ""inevitably result in Charlie's death within a short period thereafter"", the order adds.

Signal may be from first 'exomoon',"Artist's impression: Where there are exoplanets, there are probably exomoons A team of astronomers has potentially discovered the first known moon beyond the Solar System. If confirmed, the ""exomoon"" is likely to be about the size and mass of Neptune, and circles a planet the size of Jupiter but with 10 times the mass. The signal was detected by Nasa's Kepler Space Telescope; astronomers now plan to carry out follow-up observations with Hubble in October. A paper about the candidate moon ispublished on the Arxiv pre-print site,external. To date, astronomers have discovered more than 3,000 exoplanets - worlds orbiting stars other than the Sun. A hunt for exomoons - objects in orbit around those distant planets - has proceeded in parallel. But so far, these extrasolar satellites have lingered at the limits of detection with current techniques. Dr David Kipping, assistant professor of astronomy at Columbia University in New York, says he has spent ""most of his adult life"" looking for exomoons. For the time being, however, he urged caution, saying: ""We would merely describe it at this point as something consistent with a moon, but, who knows, it could be something else."" The Kepler telescope hunts for planets by looking for tiny dips in the brightness of a star when a planet crosses in front - known as a transit. To search for exomoons, researchers are looking for a dimming of starlight before and after the planet causes its dip in light. The promising signal was observed during three transits - fewer than the astronomers would like to have in order to confidently announce a discovery. The researchers will conduct follow-up observations with Hubble in October The work by Dr Kipping, his Columbia colleague Alex Teachey and citizen scientist Allan R Schmitt, assigns a confidence level of four sigma to the signal from the distant planetary system. The confidence level describes how unlikely it is that an experimental result is simply down to chance. If you express it in terms of tossing a coin, it's equivalent to tossing 15 heads in row. But Dr Kipping said this is not the best way to gauge the potential detection. He told BBC News: ""We're excited about it... statistically, formally, it's a very high probability. But do we really trust the statistics? That's something unquantifiable. Until we get the measurements from Hubble, it may as well be 50-50 in my mind."" The candidate moon is known as Kepler-1625b I and is observed around a star that lies some 4,000 light-years from Earth. On account of its large size, team members have dubbed it a ""Nept-moon"". A current theory of planetary formation suggests such an object is unlikely to have formed in place with its Jupiter-mass planet, but would instead be an object captured by the gravity of the planet later on in the evolution of this planetary system. The researchers could find no predictions of a Neptune-sized moon in the literature, but Dr Kipping notes that nothing in physics prevents one. A handful of possible candidates have come to light in the past, but none as yet has been confirmed. ""I'd say it's the best [candidate] we've had,"" Dr Kipping told me. ""Almost every time we hit a candidate, and it passes our tests, we invent more tests until it finally dies - until it fails one of the tests... in this case we've applied everything we've ever done and it's passed all of those tests. On the other hand, we only have three events."" The work by Dr Kipping and colleagues forms part of theHunt for Exomooons with Kepler (HEK),externalcollaboration.

US Senate backs new Russia sanctions,"President Trump has said he wants to mend relations with Russia The United States Senate has voted 98-2 to impose new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, despite objections from the White House. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this week, also by an overwhelming majority. Having passed through both chambers, it will be sent to President Trump to sign into law. But Mr Trump has sought closer ties with Russia, and has the power to veto the bill despite its political support. A presidential veto can, in turn, be overridden by a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate - where just a handful of politicians voted against the bill. The sanctions were drawn up in part to punish Russia further over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? But the debate over the new measures has taken place against the backdrop of an ongoing investigation into alleged Russian meddling the in the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied the existence of any Russian involvement in the election to help his campaign. But political correspondents say an attempt to veto the new sanctions could fuel suspicion that he is too supportive of the Kremlin. This video can not be played Donald Trump praised the Russian president's leadership during his campaign The White House is also said to be particularly concerned over a provision in the new bill which would limit President Trump's ability to lift the sanctions. Under the legislation, he would be forced to consult Congress first. Speaking earlier this week after the House passed the bill, top-ranking Republican Paul Ryan said it ""tightens the screws on our most dangerous adversaries in order to keep Americans safe"". But the bill was criticised by some European countries which deal with Russian energy pipelines - which may fall foul of the new sanctions. It remains to be seen if the president will attempt to veto the bill. New White House Communications director Anthony Scaramucci told CNN: ""He may sign the sanctions exactly the way they are or he may veto the sanctions and negotiate an even tougher deal against the Russians."" Earlier this week, the White House simply said it was reviewing the bill, ""and awaits a final legislative package for the president's desk"". While much of the attention is on the Russia sanctions, both Iran and North Korea are facing increased pressure over their missile programmes. The sanctions will target financial organisations that deal with North Korea, as well as any person or business involved with Iran's missile programme or its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. North Korea's missile programme US: We'll use force on N Korea if we must Hours later, Japan said it would also impose additional sanctions on North Korea. Kyodo news agency reported that the new measures would, for the first time, target the assets of people and organisations not directly linked to the missile programme - including foreign financial organisations.

Jeff Bezos: Briefly the world's richest man,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos briefly overtook Bill Gates on Thursday to become the world's richest person, as his worth hit $91.4bn (Â£70bn). A sharp rise in Amazon shares meant Mr Bezos's wealth eclipsed that of the Microsoft co-founder for a timeaccording to Forbes,external. But as Amazon shares fell back, Mr Gates regained the top spot. Mr Bezos, 53, owns about 17% of the shares in Amazon, but also has interests in several other businesses. Recently soaring technology stocks have fuelled huge growth in the worth of entrepreneurs such as Mr Bezos and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, 33, who is number five on Forbes's list. But the last person to steal the lead was Spanish fashion boss Amancio Ortega, founder of Zara's owner Inditex. He wasthe world's richest man for two dayslast September. Amazon's current share price puts Mr Bezos only marginally behind Mr Gates. Here are five things you may not know about Mr Bezos: Earlier this year Mr Bezos paid $23m for an old textile museum in Washington DC. Once it's converted to a family home, the Bezos family will be near neighbours in the exclusive neighbourhood with the Obamas, as well as Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. At least that's what the Washington Post reported, a reliable source presumably since Mr Bezos bought the paper in 2013 with $250m of his own money. The former textile museum in Washington DC bought by Jeff Bezos The Bezos family also has homes in Seattle and Beverly Hills, but expenditure on property pales into insignificance compared to Mr Bezos's foremost passion: rocket science. Mr Bezos says he is selling about $1bn of Amazon stock every year to fund Blue Origin, the project he has founded to develop commercial space travel. It was Mr Bezos's idea to start giving away bananas to passers-by in Amazon's home town of Seattle - a generous gesture, especially since about 4,500 people reportedly take up the offer every day. But when it comes to philanthropy that is still peanuts compared to his peers. While he and his family have given millions to good causes, Mr Bezos has been criticised for not doing enough. He doesn't splash out for non-profits on the scale that Bill Gates, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and others do, and is yet to join the 169 of his wealthy peers who have pledged to give away half their personal fortune. But last month Mr Bezos appeared to be toying with new ideas in the philanthropic sphere. He tweeted a request for suggestions as to how he could give money away that would have an impact ""here and now"" - a kind of next-day-delivery philanthropy. It remains to be seen which proposals - ranging from libraries to tech talent in Africa - have caught his imagination. Good causes are already very much the domain of Jeff's brother Mark Bezos. He switched from a career in advertising to work for the New York based anti-poverty organisation Robin Hood. Mark Bezos is also a volunteer firefighter In a2011 TED talk,externalMark Bezos relates how, attending his first fire as a volunteer, he was keen to show what he was made of. But someone else was asked to brave the smouldering building to rescue the owner's puppy. Mark was given the less glamorous task of finding her a pair of shoes. But she was still extremely grateful. He draws this lesson: if you have something to give, however small, do it now. Any ideas for Jeff? One advantage of being super-rich is that people indulge your fantasies. As a life-long Star Trek fan, Mr Bezos was able to secure a minor role in the latest movie. But you may find it hard to spot him on film, sincethe Vine he posted,externalshows him pretty effectively disguised in a wrinkly grey mask. He has never really disguised his inner geek however. Jeff Bezos in full Trekkie alien costume As a child he spent a lot of time with his grandparents on their Texas ranch (learning to vaccinate cattle amongst other vital skills) and his interest in number-crunching was already apparent. ""At that age I'd take any excuse to make estimates and do minor arithmetic. I'd calculate our gas mileage, I'd figure out useless statistics on things like grocery spending,""he told Princeton's class of 2010,external. For example he whiled away some time calculating that smoking would be likely to take nine years off his grandmother's life. ""I expected to be awarded for my cleverness and my arithmetic skills,"" he said. But his grandmother burst into tears. Grandfather talked him through how sometimes ""it's harder to be kind than clever"". As well as the fun stuff he has a serious futuristic vision. Early on he was already imagining space hotels, amusement parks, and cities orbiting the Earth. And Mr Bezos's dreams are getting bigger. Jeff Bezos has boots bearing the slogan of his Blue Origin space company ""I want millions of people living and working in space. I want us to be a space-faring civilisation,""he told Geekwire,externallast year.

Why does the US military buy so much Viagra?,"The Pentagon spends tens of billions of dollars on healthcare for active and retired service personnel Amid the fall-out from US President Donald Trump's announcement on Twitter that transgender people will not be able to serve in the US military, one statistic has been frequently raised to draw attention to the comparatively small estimated costs of transgender healthcare. It refers to the amount the Pentagon spends on erectile dysfunction medication annually: about $84m (Â£63m), according to the Military Times newspaper. In contrast, the Rand Corporation think tankestimated last year,externalthat gender transition-related health care costs for transgender personnel would increase the military's active duty health budget by $8.4m per year at the most. But why does the US defence department spend so much on erectile dysfunction drugs? First, it is worth pointing out that the Military Times'February 2015 report,externalbased its figure on 2014 data from the Defense Health Agency. The spend of $84.2m was for that year, but the newspaper also reported that $294m had been spent on Viagra, Cialis and other such medications since 2011. It pointed out that this cost the equivalent of more than a few fighter jets. In 2014, some 1.18 million prescriptions were filled, mostly for Viagra. But who were they for? The answer goes some way in explaining the massive spend. It is true that some of the erectile dysfunction medication went to active-duty personnel. But the vast majority went to other groups eligible, including millions of military retirees and their family members. In fact, around 10 million people in total are estimated to be covered by the Pentagon's healthcare system, which cost $52bn in 2012. It is well known that erectile dysfunction is more common among older men - which would explain a hefty bill for retired service members. In fact, less than 10% of the prescriptions were for active duty personnel, according to the Military Times. The secret life of a transgender airman 'My stomach dropped': Transgender troops hit by ban Still, erectile dysfunction among those currently serving in the US military has been increasing since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began. A 2014 study by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) found that 100,248 cases of erectile dysfunction were diagnosed among active service members between 2004 and 2013, with ""annual incidence rates"" more than doubling in that time period. Nearly half of all the cases were due to psychological causes,according to the study,external. This video can not be played Riley Dosh explains why she wants to defend her country A study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2015 found that male veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were ""significantly more likely than their civilian counterparts to report erectile dysfunction or other sexual problems"",according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs,external. One study cited found that 85% of male combat veterans with PTSD report erectile dysfunction, nearly four times the rate among those returning from combat who are not diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In 2008, the Rand Corporationreported,externalthat one in five US veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were suffering from PTSD or major depression. Confusion over Trump's transgender ban However, a key statistic buried in the AFHSB study of active duty personnel between 2004 and 2013 suggests one should be cautious of reading too much into the links between America's recent wars, PTSD and erectile dysfunction in relation to the military's massive spend on Viagra. Personnel who had never been deployed were actually more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than their counterparts who had been. Finally, erectile dysfunction is linked to common conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. In 2007,it was estimated,externalthat the prevalence of erectile dysfunction among US men was 18%. In summary: it is a common condition, and the US military pays for the healthcare of millions of men, meaning it spends a lot on Viagra and other such drugs.

Drinking moderately 'cuts diabetes risk',"Raising a glass to the findings of the Danish study? Drinking three to four times a week has been linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes than never drinking, Danish researchers suggest. Wine appears to be particularly beneficial, probably as it plays a role in helping to manage blood sugar, the study, published inDiabetologia,,externalsays. They surveyed more than 70,000 people on their alcohol intake - how much and how often they drank. But experts said this wasn't a ""green light"" to drink more than recommended. And Public Health England warned that consuming alcohol contributed to a vast number of other serious diseases, including some cancers, heart and liver disease. ""People should keep this in mind when thinking about how much they drink,"" a spokeswoman said. Prof Janne Tolstrup, from the National Institute of Public Health of the University of Southern Denmark, who led the research, said: ""We found that drinking frequency has an independent effect from the amount of alcohol taken. ""We can see it's a better effect to drink the alcohol in four portions rather than all at once."" After around five years, study participants were followed up and a total of 859 men and 887 women group had developed diabetes - either type 1 or the more common type 2. The researchers concluded that drinking moderately three to four times a week was linked to a 32% reduced risk of diabetes in women, and 27% in men, compared with people drinking on less than one day a week. Red wine is thought to help with the management of blood sugar Findings also suggest that not all types of alcohol had the same effect. Wine appeared to be particularly beneficial because polyphenols, particularly in red wine, play a role in helping to manage blood sugar. When it came to drinking beer, men having one to six beers a week lowered their risk of diabetes by 21%, compared to men who drank less than one beer a week - but there was no impact on women's risk. Meanwhile, a high intake of spirits among women seemed to significantly increase their risk of diabetes - but there was no effect in men. Unlike other studies, this research did not find a link between binge drinking and diabetes. Prof Tolstrup said this could be down to the small number of participants that reported binge drinking, which was defined as drinking five drinks or more on one occasion. Dr Emily Burns, head of research communications at Diabetes UK, said people needed to be wary as ""the impact of regular alcohol consumption on the risk of type 2 will be different from one person to the next"". While the findings were interesting she said they ""wouldn't recommend people see them as a green light to drink in excess of the existing NHS guidelines"". That advice suggests that men and women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week - equivalent to six pints of average strength beer or 10 small glasses of low strength wine - over the course of three days or more, with some days being alcohol-free. Rosanna O'Connor, director of drugs, alcohol and tobacco at Public Health England, said: ""It is not helpful to talk about the effect of alcohol consumption on diabetes alone. ""Consuming alcohol contributes to a vast number of other serious diseases, including some cancers, heart disease and liver disease, so people should keep this in mind when thinking about how much they drink."" Prof Tolstrup and her team have used the same survey to research the effect of alcohol on other conditions. They found that drinking moderately a few times a week was linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disorders, such as heart attack and stroke. But consuming any amount of alcohol increased the risk of developing gastrointestinal diseases, such as alcohol liver disease and pancreatitis. Prof Tolstrup added: ""Alcohol is associated with 50 different conditions, so we're not saying 'go ahead and drink alcohol'."" Update 7 September 2017: This article has been updated to clarify that while Danish researchers found no causal relationship between drinking and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, they did find that those who drink three to four times a week are less likely than those who never drink to develop diabetes.

Man poisoned after eating cherry seeds,"This video can not be played Matthew Creme started feeling ill after eating three cherry pips A man who suffered cyanide poisoning after eating cherry seeds has called for warnings to be put on packaging. Matthew CrÃ¨me, from Lancashire, said ""curiosity"" got the better of him when he decided to crack three of the seeds. However, he soon started to feel ill. He was admitted to hospital after a 111 operator told him three pips could be fatal but has since fully recovered. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said some products made from stone fruits were regulated for safety. Mr CrÃ¨me called for warnings to be put on fruit packets, saying: ""If something was that severe you'd think it'd be on the packaging."" An FSA spokeswoman said: ""Some non-edible parts of fruits, such as cherry seeds, contain cyanide and are not intended to be consumed. ""Some edible products, such as alcoholic beverages made from stone fruits, and canned stone fruits can also contain a low level of cyanide. However, this is regulated to ensure these products are safe for consumption."" Cherry seeds contain a naturally occurring substance called amygdalin This changes to the toxin cyanide after people eat it Cyanide is a poisonous chemical that can cause nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, thirst, lethargy, nervousness, aches and falling blood pressure In extreme cases it can be fatal Source: Food Standards Agency Mr CrÃ¨me was eating cherries on 17 July when he cracked a seed and found another inside with ""an almond texture"". ""It was just curiosity and you know what they say about curiosity,"" he said. ""[The seed] tasted similar to an almond but with a cherry flavour to it - I didn't think nothing of it, just thought it was a seed, so I ate it and continued to eat more of it."" Within 20 minutes of eating three seeds, he felt extreme tiredness and had a headache. Mr CrÃ¨me only realised the potential for poisoning after an online search and he rang 111. His partner Georgina Mason took him to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where he was given an antidote. Mr CrÃ¨me agreed to let doctors use his case for future reference as they had never previously treated cyanide poisoning caused by fruit seeds.

Amazon founder is briefly the world's richest man,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos briefly overtook Bill Gates on Thursday to become the world's richest person, as his worth hit $91.4bn (Â£70bn). A sharp rise in Amazon shares meant Mr Bezos's wealth eclipsed that of the Microsoft co-founder for a timeaccording to Forbes,external. But as Amazon shares fell back, Mr Gates regained the top spot. Mr Bezos, 53, owns about 17% of the shares in Amazon, but also has interests in several other businesses. Recently soaring technology stocks have fuelled huge growth in the worth of entrepreneurs such as Mr Bezos and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, 33, who is number five on Forbes's list. But the last person to steal the lead was Spanish fashion boss Amancio Ortega, founder of Zara's owner Inditex. He wasthe world's richest man for two dayslast September. Amazon's current share price puts Mr Bezos only marginally behind Mr Gates. Here are five things you may not know about Mr Bezos: Earlier this year Mr Bezos paid $23m for an old textile museum in Washington DC. Once it's converted to a family home, the Bezos family will be near neighbours in the exclusive neighbourhood with the Obamas, as well as Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. At least that's what the Washington Post reported, a reliable source presumably since Mr Bezos bought the paper in 2013 with $250m of his own money. The former textile museum in Washington DC bought by Jeff Bezos The Bezos family also has homes in Seattle and Beverly Hills, but expenditure on property pales into insignificance compared to Mr Bezos's foremost passion: rocket science. Mr Bezos says he is selling about $1bn of Amazon stock every year to fund Blue Origin, the project he has founded to develop commercial space travel. It was Mr Bezos's idea to start giving away bananas to passers-by in Amazon's home town of Seattle - a generous gesture, especially since about 4,500 people reportedly take up the offer every day. But when it comes to philanthropy that is still peanuts compared to his peers. While he and his family have given millions to good causes, Mr Bezos has been criticised for not doing enough. He doesn't splash out for non-profits on the scale that Bill Gates, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and others do, and is yet to join the 169 of his wealthy peers who have pledged to give away half their personal fortune. But last month Mr Bezos appeared to be toying with new ideas in the philanthropic sphere. He tweeted a request for suggestions as to how he could give money away that would have an impact ""here and now"" - a kind of next-day-delivery philanthropy. It remains to be seen which proposals - ranging from libraries to tech talent in Africa - have caught his imagination. Good causes are already very much the domain of Jeff's brother Mark Bezos. He switched from a career in advertising to work for the New York based anti-poverty organisation Robin Hood. Mark Bezos is also a volunteer firefighter In a2011 TED talk,externalMark Bezos relates how, attending his first fire as a volunteer, he was keen to show what he was made of. But someone else was asked to brave the smouldering building to rescue the owner's puppy. Mark was given the less glamorous task of finding her a pair of shoes. But she was still extremely grateful. He draws this lesson: if you have something to give, however small, do it now. Any ideas for Jeff? One advantage of being super-rich is that people indulge your fantasies. As a life-long Star Trek fan, Mr Bezos was able to secure a minor role in the latest movie. But you may find it hard to spot him on film, sincethe Vine he posted,externalshows him pretty effectively disguised in a wrinkly grey mask. He has never really disguised his inner geek however. Jeff Bezos in full Trekkie alien costume As a child he spent a lot of time with his grandparents on their Texas ranch (learning to vaccinate cattle amongst other vital skills) and his interest in number-crunching was already apparent. ""At that age I'd take any excuse to make estimates and do minor arithmetic. I'd calculate our gas mileage, I'd figure out useless statistics on things like grocery spending,""he told Princeton's class of 2010,external. For example he whiled away some time calculating that smoking would be likely to take nine years off his grandmother's life. ""I expected to be awarded for my cleverness and my arithmetic skills,"" he said. But his grandmother burst into tears. Grandfather talked him through how sometimes ""it's harder to be kind than clever"". As well as the fun stuff he has a serious futuristic vision. Early on he was already imagining space hotels, amusement parks, and cities orbiting the Earth. And Mr Bezos's dreams are getting bigger. Jeff Bezos has boots bearing the slogan of his Blue Origin space company ""I want millions of people living and working in space. I want us to be a space-faring civilisation,""he told Geekwire,externallast year. He predicts that in the next few hundred years we will put all our heavy industry off this planet, mine resources and generate energy in space, leaving earth a much more pleasant place to live on. Mr Bezos does plan to go into space himself too, of course - once Blue Origin is ready to take him. But as Blue Origin's slogan says: Gradatim Ferociter, (apparently Latin for ""Step by Step, Ferociously"") maybe he's not rushing things. 1994 Quits Wall Street job to start Amazon 1999 Named Time's Person of the Year 2000 Launches Blue Origin spaceflight firm 2013 Buys the Washington Post 2015 New York Times publishes report painting a critical picture of working conditions at Amazon, which Mr Bezos says he ""doesn't recognise"" 2015 Amazon appears to have come full circle when it opens its first physical bookstore in Seattle 2016 Drawn into a public spat with Trump over the Washington Post and taxes 2017 Manchester By The Sea, a feature produced by Amazon Studios, wins two Oscars including best actor for Casey Affleck, while the studio also picks up the Best Foreign Language gong for The Salesman.

Five times food fights have had an impact on trade talks,"Trade talks, tense affairs at the best of times, often get particularly sticky when it comes to food. When the UK starts to negotiate new trade deals as it leaves the EU in 2019, food will be one of many areas that will need to be addressed. The ongoing spat over chlorine chicken highlights how tastes and safety practices around the world can differ hugely. What might seem normal practice in one country can seem problematic elsewhere. In the US, it is legal to wash chicken carcasses in chlorinated water to kill germs - but this has been banned in the EU since 1997. UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove has saidthe UK should not allow these imports in a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, but Trade Secretary Liam Fox says the practice is ""perfectly safe"". Anthony Scaramucci, US president Donald Trump's new communications director,told BBC Newsnightthat there would ""100%"" be a trade deal between his country and the UK - although he confessed he had no idea what was happening about chlorinated chicken. Here are five occasions when spats over food have made past trade talks tricky. The US wouldn't import Mexican avocados for many years For more than 80 years, the US refused to import Mexican avocados on the grounds that the fruit was infested with fruit flies and other bugs. After the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) in 1994, the US came under pressure to relax its ban, rather than rely on its pricier home-grown avocados. ""Avocados are always used as a pawn in the trading process. Whenever the United States talks to Mexico about opening up other agricultural commodities to US growers... it always comes back to avocados,"" Jerome Steyhle, who chairs the California Avocado Growers Commission,told the BBC in 2003,external. In 1997, the restrictions started to be lifted, and by 2016 the US was importing 1.7 billion avocados across the border each year, according to marketing group Avocados from Mexico. But the avocado war could be reignited now that President Trump has threatened to renegotiate Nafta - which he described as ""the single worst trade deal ever approved [by the United States]"". Earlier this year, there were reports of several Mexican avocado lorries being turned away at the border following an argument about US potato imports. Some cattle in the US are fed growth hormones One of the best known food-related trade disputes was over hormone-fed beef. The use of certain growth hormones in cattle rearing is legal in the US. But in 1988, the EU banned the use of several major growth promotion hormones, which it said posed a potential risk to human health. This was an effective ban on American beef. A decade later, the World Trade Organization (WTO)ruled the EU's refusal to import US beef was not based on scientific evidence and violated its members' obligations,external. However, the trading bloc still wouldn't buy the meat, leading the US to retaliate by levying higher trade tariffs on some of its EU imports. ""American ranchers raise some of the best beef on the planet, but restrictive European Union policies continue to deny EU consumers access to US beef at affordable prices. For several years we have been asking the EU to fix an agreement that is clearly broken, despite its original promise to provide a favourable market for US beef,"" US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said last year. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted assurances that the country would still be able to stockpile food Several years ago, India blocked the implementation of a 2013 global trade agreement it feared would stop it stockpiling food for the poor. India refused to back the Trade Facilitation Agreement until it was assured proposed limits to farming subsidies would not affect its $12bn (Â£9.2bn) food-security programme. It pays farmers over the odds for grain, some of which it sells to poorer households while the rest is set aside in case of shortages. The WTO trade agreement simplified customs procedures and was designed to add $1tn to the global economy, and benefit developing countries in particular, so India's defiance was strongly criticised by the global community. India agreed to lift the veto after WTO members agreed that an arrangement known as a ""peace clause"" - which protects food stockpiling -would remain valid until the WTO could find a permanent solution. It was due to expire in 2017, but will now effectively continue indefinitely. EU negotiators wanted to sell more dairy products to the Japanese, who in turn wanted to sell more cars Negotiations on a big trade deal between Japan and the EU began in 2013. Both sides wanted to slash tariffs on a huge range of goods, to boost trade. This is a sensitive process because domestic producers tend to be wary of foreign competition. The Japanese side was particularly keen to boost car sales in Europe, while the EU negotiators wanted to sell more dairy products. Loosening the dairy rules wasn't such a big deal for hard cheeses such as cheddar and gouda, which are not made in Japan. But Japanese dairy farmers do make softer cheeses, which proved a roadblock in the final stages of the talks, earlier this year. After some late night haggling, the EU's Agriculture Commissioner, Phil Hogan, secured a compromise. The EU would have a yearly quota of 31,000 tonnes for soft cheese exports, in exchange for almost complete market access for hard cheese. A few days later in Brussels, EU leaders and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abeannounced the completion of the deal, dubbed ""cars for cheese"". Some Belgian dairy farmers were worried about the impact of free trade After years of negotiations, the EU completed its most ambitious free-trade deal to date: the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) with Canada. But under EU rules, some far-reaching trade agreements require the consent of all 28 EU countries before they can come into force. To make things even more complicated, in Belgium seven federal, regional and community bodies had to give their approval as well. Wallonia, the country's French-speaking region, said no. Politicians in the staunchly socialist region had concerns about the dispute-settlement mechanism in the agreement, along with something else - milk. Wallonian dairy farmers worried about the impact of free trade on their sales. A group of them marched outside the European Commission in Brussels to voice their disapproval of Ceta. Eventually, Belgian political leaders reached a consensus and broke the deadlock, agreeing an addendum to the Canadian deal, which addressed concerns over the rights of farmers and governments. The European Parliament approved Ceta in February, although it has not come into force yet. Rise in loans dangerous, says Bank official Reality Check: How much household debt do we owe?

Witnessing the agony of Yemen's civil war,"Ahmad weighs half what he should at 10 months old - acute malnutrition rates in Yemen have soared since the war Amid UN warnings of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen, the BBC's Orla Guerin has overcome attempts by Saudi Arabia to block her team from entering the country and has seen for herself the depth of the suffering. Yemen's health, water and sanitation systems are collapsing after two years of war between government forces - backed by a Saudi-led coalition carrying out air strikes - and the rebel Houthi movement. The conflict and a blockade imposed by the coalition have triggered a humanitarian disaster, leaving 70% of the population in need of aid. Orla has beentweeting,externalabout what she saw. We reached the Southern port of Aden after 13 hours at sea. Saudis grounded the UN plane due to fly us in The Saudis prevented us from flying into Yemen though we all had visas from the internationally recognised government In a hospital in Aden, Orla saw staff battle to save the life of an elderly cholera victim - Abdullah Mohammed Salem - who was brought into the building without a pulse. Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholera. Most of those infected will have no or mild symptoms but, in severe cases, the disease can kill within hours if left untreated. Abdullah Mohammed Salem was brought to hospital with no pulse but revived before our eyes. Most cholera victims recover quickly - if treated His life was saved in minutes Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis have contracted cholera in recent months, making it the worst outbreak in history. Hospitals are overcrowded and severe food shortages have led to widespread malnutrition, making people - especially children - even more vulnerable to the infection. Malak, whose name means angel, is too weak to hold her head up straight so her mother does it for her Thirteen-year-old Hassan got prompt attention in Aden but one person is dying every hour from this treatable disease Some 60% of Yemenis do not know where their next meal will come from and the World Food Programme is warning of the danger of famine. Doctors told the BBC that Yemen was in danger of losing its future, with 500,000 children now severely malnourished. If you remember nothing of Yemen remember Hussein Mazen Hussein - malnourished and fighting for every breath In two years of war, houses, hospitals and schools have been destroyed by Saudi airstrikes and more than 3,000 civilians have been killed. Some people are living in the rubble of what were once their homes. Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? How bad is the humanitarian crisis? Yet despite the destruction, no side appears close to a decisive military victory. The Awal family in the wreckage of their home - hit by two Saudi air strikes. Some of them still live in the ruins Civilians are under fire from both sides in Yemen. Imad, 10, used to love football but lost both legs to Houthi shelling Pro-government forces - made up of soldiers loyal to internationally-recognised President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and predominantly Sunni southern tribesmen and separatists - stopped the rebels taking Aden. Mr Hadi and his government have returned from exile and established a temporary home there. But they have been unable to dislodge the rebels from their northern strongholds, including the capital Sanaa. The sides have drifted into stalemate - but the human suffering continues unabated.

"Partition 70 years on: The turmoil, trauma - and legacy","As India and Pakistan celebrate 70 years of independence, Andrew Whitehead looks at the lasting legacy of the Partition of British India, and the turmoil and trauma which marred the birth of the two nations. It's about 700km (430 miles) from Delhi to Islamabad - less than the distance between London and Geneva. A short hop in aviation terms. But you can't fly non-stop from the Indian capital to the Pakistani capital. There are no direct flights at all. It is only one of the legacies of seven decades of mutual suspicion and tension. Take another example: cricket. India and Pakistan played each other a few weeks ago inthe final of the Champions' Trophy.Both countries are cricket crazy. Perhaps the biggest movement of people in history, outside war and famine. Two newly-independent states were created - India and Pakistan. About 12 million people became refugees. Between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence. Tens of thousands of women were abducted. This article is the first in a BBC series looking at Partition 70 years on. Read more:Special report on partition However, the game was played not in South Asia, but in London. India and Pakistan don't play cricket in each other's countries any more, although they have met in one-day matches around the world, including in countries in their region like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It's almost 10 years since India and Pakistan played a Test match on South Asian soil But it is almost 10 years since they faced each other on South Asian soil in a Test match. Despite a lot of shared culture and history,they are not simply rivals, but more like enemies. In the 70 years since India and Pakistan gained independence, they have fought three wars. Some would say four, although when their armies last fought in 1999, there was no formal declaration of war. The simmering tension between India and Pakistan is one of the world's most enduring geopolitical fault lines. It has prompted both countries to develop their own nuclear weapons. So the uneasy stand-off is much more than a regional dispute: it is fraught with wider danger. Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru (l), Viceroy of India Lord Louis Mountbatten (c) and the president of the All-India Muslim League Muhammad Ali Jinnah (r) discuss Partition in 1947 India and Pakistan gained their independence at the same moment. British rule over India, by far its biggest colony, ended on 15 August 1947. After months of political deadlock, Britain agreed to divide the country in two. A separate and mainly Muslim nation, Pakistan, was createdto meet concerns that the large Muslim minority would be at a disadvantage inHindu-majority India. This involved partitioning two of India's biggest provinces, Punjab and Bengal. The details of where the new international boundary would lie were made public only two days after independence. Partition triggered one of the great calamities of the modern era, perhaps the biggest movement of people - outside war and famine - that the world has ever seen. No one knows the precise numbers, but about 12 million people became refugees as they sought desperately to move from one newly independent nation to another. Muslim women board a train in Delhi to travel to Pakistan on 7 August 1947 Amid a terrible slaughter in which all main communities were both aggressors and victims, somewhere between half a million and a million people were killed. Tens of thousands of women were abducted, usually by men of a different religion. In Punjab in particular, where Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs had lived together for generations and spoke the same language, a stark segregation was brought about as Muslims headed west to Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs fled east to India. Amritsar saw violent clashes in March 1947 between the city's Muslims, who wanted to be part of Pakistan, and its Sikh and Hindu population, who wanted to stay in India This was not a civil war with battle lines and rival armies - but nor was it simply spontaneous violence. On all sides, local militias and armed gangs planned how to inflict the greatest harm on those they had come to see as their enemies. An estimated 2,000 were killed, and more than 4,000 injured in communal riots ahead of Partition in Kolkata (Calcutta) in 1946 Those wounds have been left to fester. No one has been held to account - there's been no reconciliation process - and for a long time, the full story of what happened has been smothered in silence. Literature and cinema found ways of representing the horror of what happened. Historians initially focused on the politics of Partition. It took them much longer to turn their attention to the lived experience of this profound rupture. How a jacket and a briefcase shaped a Partition love story How India's 'Flying Sikh' went from Partition orphan to gold medallist Big oral history projects have got under way only in the last few years, as the number of survivors dwindles. There are no towering memorials to the Partition dead. The first museum devoted to Partition opened in 2016 in Amritsar in Indian Punjab. Partition poisoned relations between India and Pakistan, and has shaped - many would say distorted - the geopolitics of South Asia as a whole. Pakistan initially consisted of two wings 2,000km (1,240 miles) apart, but in 1971, East Pakistan gained its independence, with Indian military support.Another new nation, Bangladesh, was born. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both claim in full but control in part Among the loose ends of the independence arrangement was the future ofKashmir, a princely state in the foothills of the Himalayaswhich had a largely Muslim population. The maharaja, a Hindu, decided his state should become part of India. Within months, Indian and Pakistani troops were fighting each other for control of Kashmir. Thecomplex conflict remains unresolvedand, more than any other issue, has bedevilled relations between the two countries. Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it India also accuses Pakistan of supporting militant organisations which have carried out terrorist-style attacks in Indian cities. Pakistan says India colludes with breakaway movements in areas such as Balochistan. The political leaders of the two countries have met from time to time. There have been occasional hopes of a breakthrough in relations but, at the moment, relations are distinctly frosty. Activists burn a poster showing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during Mr Modi's visit to Pakistan in December 2015 The consequences have been far-reaching. India has much more trade with countries such as Nigeria, Belgium or South Africa than with its neighbour to the west. Although India's phenomenally successful Hindi-language film industry - known as Bollywood - is hugely popular in Pakistan, and Pakistan's TV soaps are eagerly watched in India, cultural links are fragile. When tensions rise, which they do regularly, every aspect of relations suffers. After a backlash against his film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (Difficulties of the heart), Indian director Karan Johar pledged not to use Pakistani actors Just a few months ago, one of India's leading film directorsKaran Johar felt obliged to promise that he would never again cast a Pakistani actorin one of his movies. The two countries are not well informed about what is happening on the other side of the border. No major Indian or Pakistani news organisation currently has a correspondent in the other country's capital. For both Indians and Pakistanis, travelling to the other country is not easy - even if it is to visit family. It is not the difficulty of getting a visa or the lack of direct flights between the two capital cities. There are very few air links between the two countries at all. The elaborate daily closing ceremony at the India-Pakistan Wagah border crossing near Amritsar attracts many spectators on both sides Despite a lengthy shared border, India and Pakistan have hardly any border crossings. In Pakistan, the army and its intelligence wing are by far the most powerful institutions - and the country has had repeated spells of military rule. The abiding sense of a military threat from its much larger neighbour has - many feel - boosted the power of the armed forces and hindered the development of a mature democracy. Pakistan has a population of about 200 million - mostly Muslims. India has almost 1,300 million citizens and about one in seven follow Islam. There are almost as many Indian Muslims as Pakistani Muslims. One projection suggests that by 2050, India will overtake Indonesia to become the country with the world's biggest Muslim population. But Muslims are under-represented in India's parliament and many other areas of public life. Some observers believe the perception - however unfair - that Indian Muslims sympathise with Pakistan has fed prejudice and discrimination. Pakistani cricket fans celebrating their team's success The pride that almost all Indians and Pakistanis feel about their nation is self-evident. Patriotism is a powerful force in both countries. It is on public display every time they play each other at cricket. But both have been unable to overcome the legacy of the tragedy which accompanied what should have been their finest moment 70 years ago. And the result of their most recent tussle on the cricket pitch? Well, for the record, Pakistan won a surprise - and emphatic - victory. Some in India were gracious in defeat. But on social media, and some sections of India's news media, there was anger and anguish - losing face to your old rival remains, for many, almost too painful to endure. This analysis was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. Dr Andrew Whitehead,externalis a former BBC India correspondent. He is the author of a book about Kashmir in 1947 and is currently honorary professor at the University of Nottingham.

Does Dunkirk ignore the role of the Indian army?,"Dunkirk tells the story of British and Allied troops trapped on a beach surrounded by enemy forces in 1940 Christopher Nolan's epic World War Two film, Dunkirk, which tells the story of the mass evacuation of Allied troops from the northern coast of France in 1940, has been getting glowing reviews in India. But many are glowering over Nolan turning a blind eye to the role of Indian soldiers in the battle.The Times of India,externalwrote that their ""significant contribution"" was missing from Nolan's ""otherwise brilliant"" work. Writing forBloomberg View,external, columnist Mihir Sharma said the film ""adds to the falsehood that plucky Britons stood alone against Nazi Germany once France fell, when, in fact, hundreds of millions of imperial subjects stood, perforce, with them"". Few can deny the role of the subjects. Some five million Commonwealth servicemen joined the military services of the British empire during WW2. Almost half of them were from South Asia. Indian soldiers played a key role in major battles like Tobruk, Monte Cassino, Kohima and Imphal. A multinational force of British, Indian and African units recaptured Burma (Myanmar) for the Allies. What actually happened at Dunkirk? Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk film reviewed Has India's contribution to WW2 been ignored? What happened with the Indian soldiers in Dunkirk is less clear. Yasmin Khan, historian and author of The Raj at War: A People's History of India's Second World War, says she has often wondered why there is very little factual data on their role in the battle, which many say cost Germany the war. What is well known, she told me, is that four companies of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps, including a unit of the Bikaner State forces, served in France during the campaign on the Western Front, and some were evacuated from Dunkirk. Among them were three contingents of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps. One contingent was taken prisoner by German forces. According toone account,external, India also provided more than 2,500 mules - shipped from Bombay (now Mumbai) to Marseilles - to the war effort as the British animal transport companies had been phased out. An Indian soldier, Jemadar Maula Dad Khan, was feted for showing ""magnificent courage, coolness and decision"" in protecting his men and animals when they were shelled from the ground and strafed from the air by the enemy. An Indian soldier who was evacuated from Dunkirk The Indian soldiers and the mules were eventually ordered towards the coast. Many of the men could not take their animals on the retreat and gave them away to local people in France, according to the same account. Historian John Broich says the Indian soldiers in Dunkirk were ""particularly cool under fire and well organised during the retreat"". ""They weren't large in number, maybe a few hundred among hundreds of thousands, but their appearance in the film would have provided a good reminder of how utterly central the role of the Indian Army was in the war,"" he toldSlate,external. ""Their service meant the difference between victory and defeat. In fact, while Britain and other allies were licking their wounds after Dunkirk, the Indian Army picked up the slack in North Africa and the Middle East. To be fair, Nolan has said that he approached the story ""from the point of view of thepure mechanics of survival,externalrather than from the politics of the event"". ""We don't have generals in rooms pushing things around on maps. We don't see Churchill. We barely glimpse the enemy,"" he toldthe Telegraph.,external""It's a survival story."" Historian Joshua Levine, who is also the film's historical consultant, told me that Dunkirk was a work of fiction and ""it isn't a film's job to tell the full story of Dunkirk... and nor, in the time available, could it even try to do so"". ""This film focuses on a few protagonists whose paths cross occasionally, each one of whom experiences just a tiny corner of the whole story. AsHilary Mantel,externalsays about historical fiction, 'The man who is fighting can't see over the hill, out of the trench.' What I'd love to see, though, is an Indian film about Dunkirk, or WW2 generally, and I sincerely hope Indian filmmakers are working on it."" But what about the criticism that the role of Indian and their South Asian counterparts in WW2 has been forgotten? Two Indian soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk arrive in England in June 1940 Yasmin Khan says that their ""sheer scale of the contribution"" has become apparent in Britain in recent years. ""No longer is it simply an island story of heroic, plucky British fighting against Nazi-occupied continental Europe; it has now become increasingly customary for historians to refer to the contribution made by Asian, African and Caribbean servicemen in the 1940s"", she writes in her book. A memorial to honour the role of these soldiers came up on London's Constitution Hill in 2002. There have been museum exhibitions, oral history projects and TV documentaries to ""reveal how crucial they [the soldiers] often were to the action, the sacrifices that they made in the face of terrible odds, and also to divulge individual stories of great bravery and intrepid action"". ""It is no longer true to suggest that this is an entirely forgotten story,""  she says. Meanwhile, Indians are flocking to watch Dunkirk, which opened at 416 screens, including 10 Imax screens, across the country, on Friday. Unlike most Hollywood films, Dunkirk hasn't been dubbed in any Indian language for wider viewership. Still, says Denzil Dias of Warner Brothers (India), the film raked in $2.4m (Â£1.84m) over the weekend. ""This is the biggest opening of an English language-only film in India,"" Mr Dias told me. Clearly, viewers are not fretting about the lack of Indian soldiers in Nolan's tour-de-force.

Are migrants paying price as EU targets Med smugglers?,"This video can not be played The UNHCR calls for $420m to stop people risking their lives crossing the Mediterranean There was a serene, enchanting glow to the view from the Vos Prudence search-and-rescue ship as it slowed to a standstill off the Libyan coast a few hours after sunset. Three bright orange flames from an oil-rig were visible on the horizon. Closer to the ship, a seagull appeared over a moonlit strip of sea, flying so low it almost brushed against the waves. We were on a ship run by the charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res on a mission to rescue migrants in distress at sea. Days and nights passed with nothing in view but the open sea, until suddenly, out of the blue, the people start coming. They are pushed out to sea from the Libyan coast, on unseaworthy boats packed with as many people as they could carry. They come from across North and sub-Saharan Africa, the Horn of Africa, Bangladesh, and Syria. The EU wants to seal off the Central Mediterranean migration route, much as it did with the Aegean route between Turkey and Greece last year. The EU strategy rests on two pillars. In Libya, it is funding and training the Libyan coastguard to stop the migrants before they cross into international waters, and send them back to Libya. The migrants come from a number of countries including Nigeria, Guinea and Ivory Coast Outside Libyan waters, it has deployed military vessels to disrupt the smugglers' business, mainly by burning their boats so they cannot be reused. But increasingly the strategy has come in for criticism. Successive reports have suggested a link between the burning of the boats and the rising death rate on the Central Mediterranean. As the smugglers adapted by using cheaper boats that were more unseaworthy, the crossing became more dangerous for the migrants. And testimony from the migrants themselves suggests the Libyan coast guard could be playing a double game: taking money from the EU to intercept migrants, and money from smugglers to let them pass. A few hours after we arrive in the search and rescue (SAR) zone, the Italian Navy's Maritime Rescue and Co-ordination Centre in Rome calls with news that several boats have set off from Libya. By the time we arrive, the action has already started. Why is Libya so lawless? EU to curb rubber boat sales to Libya Trying to stop ships rescuing migrants When the EU focused on burning boats, the smugglers began using more dangerous dinghies From one side of the deck, there is a plume of thick smoke polluting the clear blue horizon; a smugglers' boat set on fire by an Irish military vessel following a rescue operation. On the other side of the deck, much closer to the ship, an empty wooden boat is being towed away by two men on another boat, presumably to Libya for reuse. This video can not be played Men believed to be migrant smugglers are spotted during a rescue effort in the Mediterranean Since late 2015, the EU has stepped up the destruction of migrant boats after the rescues, aiming to disrupt the business model of smugglers. But there are indications that it is the migrants, not the smugglers, who are paying the price. Smugglers have shifted from using wooden boats to cheaper dinghies The EU's own data has shown that the smugglers quickly adapted by using more rubber boats, as the costlier wooden boats became a ""less economic"" option. And as the EU stepped up its efforts, the death rate was rising. A string of reports, including by Amnesty International andthe UK House of Lords,external, began drawing links between the anti-smuggling operation, the smugglers' deteriorating offer for migrants, and a steadily rising death rate at sea. Soon enough, the lower deck of the Vos Prudence becomes packed with people - 727 men, 53 children, and 97 women - and heads for the Sicilian port of Palermo. Crammed uncomfortably on the lower deck with barely enough space to stretch, they begin to describe the medieval horrors accompanying Libya's descent into lawlessness. The lower deck of the MSF becomes filled with the migrant arrivals Time and again on board the Vos Prudence, we heard of torture in underground prisons, kidnapping for ransom, slavery, and killings on a whim. For many, being forced back to Libya is the worst thing that could happen to them. They give a confusing picture of the coast guard. Abdullah, a Sudanese from Khartoum, told me a friend of his, also from Sudan, got on a boat that was intercepted by the Libyan coastguard and forced back to Libya. He was sold into forced labour on a farm, until he managed to leave again. After rescuing migrants from the sea, the Vos Prudence will take them to port in Italy But Abu Yasser, from the Syrian city of Aleppo, said the coast guard escorted the boat he was on all the way into international waters, then directed it towards an NGO vessel, and away from a military one. ""The real smugglers,"" he told me, ""are the Libyan coast guard."" Husam, from Libya, said smugglers who pay get past. ""There's no coast guard. It's all militias."" But Italy and the EU appear more focused on the search-and-rescue charities than the Libyan coast guard. The Italian government has drafted a code of conduct and has warned NGOs that if they fail to sign it they will be shut out of Italian ports. One of its demands is for charities to co-operate more actively with the anti-smuggling operation, by collecting when possible ""the makeshift boats and the outboard engines used"" by smugglers, and notifying Frontex, the EU's border and coast guard agency. Italy wants its authorities to have the right to board NGO ships Another of the 12 points of the code is for NGOs to increase co-operation with Italian police, allowing them on board upon request to ""conduct preliminary inquiries and investigations"". Both Frontex and MSF have become increasingly aware that the Central Mediterranean route is being used for trafficking in Nigerian girls and women. ""It is of utmost importance to protect them, to identify them early, to separate them from their traffickers before they disappear in the world of abuse,"" Frontex told the BBC in an email, before the code of conduct was delivered to the charities. ""We can do it only if all actors actively cooperate with the police."" Stefan van Diest of MSF told us it was ""not MSF's role to police international waters or to investigate trafficking and smuggling networks"". ""We are doctors, not police and we are present on the Mediterranean to save lives."" Migrant NGOs 'colluding' with smugglers Italy may stop ships unloading migrants NGOs fear that Italy's code of conduct is aimed at limiting the number of people rescued at sea But Mr Van Diest added that MSF was ""acutely aware of the use of this route by traffickers"". ""Potential victims of trafficking are systematically referred to the authorities and appropriate protection agencies during disembarkation."" The code of conduct will make these differences more pressing to resolve. MSF must now consider whether and to what extent to change the way it operates at sea. For now, though, the work continues. After filling up with fuel on the island of Malta, the ship heads back into the search and rescue zone. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Porsche told to recall 22,000 cars","The German government believes Porsche will quickly address the software problem Germany's transport minister has announced a recall of 22,000 Porsche cars to remove what he says is illegal emissions-controlling software. He said that luxury marque Porsche would bear the cost of the recalls of the affected 3-litre Cayenne models. It comes as Porsche's sister firm Volkswagen says it will refit almost a million more diesel cars in Germany. VW admitted in 2015 that some of its diesel cars were fitted with a ""defeat device"" to cheat on emissions tests. Allegations about Porschefirst emergedin German magazine Der Spiegel last month. Itsaid,externalit was told by a source that the Porsche Cayenne had a ""warm up mode"" whose true purpose was to comply with emissions requirements. It said tests showed that once the car was confronted with small bends or a slope it switched to a different mode and emissions were higher. ""There is no explanation why this software was in this vehicle,"" German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said on Thursday. ""These vehicles are equipped with modern emissions-controlling technology so we think these vehicles are technically able to stick to emissions limits and we therefore believe Porsche will quickly be in a position to bring the software into conformity (with the law)."" Meanwhile, VW will ""offer to refit four million vehicles and thereby significantly reduce emissions,"" chief executive Matthias Mueller said on Thursday after meeting Environment Minister Barbara  Hendricks. Some 2.5 million VW cars are already covered by a recall of diesel vehicles introduced after the firm first owned up to cheating regulatory emissions tests. Last week it was announced that VW subsidiary Audi would beoffering a free software upgradefor 850,000 diesel cars across Europe, some 600,000 of them in Germany. That leaves close to a million other cars to be included in the new refit plans. These include models from subsidiary Porsche, VW's Touareg sport utility vehicles, and some of its Transporter vans. Separately, VW has beenforced to defend its recordafter allegations that it teamed up with other German car giants to breach EU cartel rules. VW said it was normal for manufacturers to exchange technical information to speed up innovation. However, it declined to comment on specific allegations that five German carmakers colluded on price and technology. Daimler has also called the allegations speculative. EU and German anti-trust regulators are looking at allegations that BMW, Daimler and VW, including its subsidiaries Audi and Porsche, collaborated for decades on many aspects of development and production, disadvantaging customers and suppliers.

"Girl, 15, raped twice in separate attacks","Police are urging anyone who saw the girls around the time of the attacks to come forward A girl of 15 was raped at a train station in Birmingham before being sexually assaulted by the driver of a car she flagged down to help her. Detectives called the two attacks at Witton station ""horrifying"" and said they were launching a major manhunt. The teenager was with a friend when she was approached by a man who led her to a secluded part of the station and raped her. Shortly after she flagged down a passing car and was assaulted again. British Transport Police and West Midlands Police are treating it as two separate reports of rape. The first attacker is described by police as an Asian man in his early 20s with light skin, brown eyes, skinny build and about 6ft tall. Police said the second man was also Asian and in his early 20s and about 5ft 6in to 5ft 7in tall. He was of a large build, with a beard and wore a blue jumper and black jeans. The attacks happened between 19:00 BST on Tuesday and 02:00 on Wednesday. CCTV has been seized and is being investigated. Det Ch Insp Tony Fitzpatrick said: ""This was a horrifying ordeal for this young girl and we have specially trained officers supporting her. ""It is now vitally important we investigate exactly what happened on Wednesday morning as well as identifying offenders for both of these awful incidents. ""I would be keen to speak with anyone who may have been in the area at the time. If you were passing by the station and saw two girls walking with an older man, then please get in touch immediately. ""Likewise, if you saw any suspicious vehicles close to Witton station close to 2am then please get in touch as soon as possible. Your information could prove vital in our enquiries to identify the perpetrators.""

Free movement 'to end in March 2019',"This video can not be played Amber Rudd on 'implementation phase' Free movement of people between the EU and UK will end in March 2019, UK government ministers have said. From that date EU workers moving to the UK will have to register, at least until a permanent post-Brexit immigration policy is put in place. But Home Secretary Amber Rudd has sought to reassure business there will not be a ""cliff edge"" in terms of employing foreign workers after Brexit. She said policy would be evidence-based and take into account economic impact. The CBI said businesses ""urgently"" needed to know what EU migration would look like, both in any ""transitional"" period after March 2019 and beyond. David Davis plays down trade talks delay claims Reality Check: Migration to the UK All you need to know about Brexit McDonnell not ruling out single market membership UK and EU still split on citizens' rights Immigration was one of the central topics of last year's EU referendum campaign, and ministers have promised to ""take back control"" of the UK's borders as they negotiate Brexit. The UK is currently due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, but there has been increasing talk of a ""transitional"" (or ""implementation"") stage of around two years to smooth the Brexit process. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Home Office minister Brandon Lewis said details of how the government would manage immigration after Brexit would be revealed in a white paper later this year, and that the immigration bill would go through Parliament in 2018. This video can not be played Freedom of movement will end ""in the spring of 2019"", immigration minister Brandon Lewis tells Today Mr Lewis said it was a ""simple matter of fact"" that EU free movement rules would not apply after 2019. More detail of what would happen was later provided by the home secretary, with Ms Rudd, speaking during a visit to Troon, South Ayrshire, saying the ""implementation phase"" would involve new EU workers registering their details when they come to the UK. She also said the government had promised an ""extensive"" consultation to listen to the views of businesses, unions and universities. The Home Office has asked the Migration Advisory Committee to study the ""economic and social costs and benefits of EU migration to the UK economy"", its impact on competitiveness, and whether there would be benefits to focusing migration on high-skilled jobs. It is due to report back by September 2018 - six months before Brexit. The home secretary said: ""We will ensure we continue to attract those who benefit us economically, socially and culturally. ""But, at the same time, our new immigration system will give us control of the volume of people coming here - giving the public confidence we are applying our own rules on who we want to come to the UK and helping us to bring down net migration to sustainable levels."" This video can not be played I'm ""flabbergasted"" it has taken 13 months to ask ""basic questions"" about EU migration, says Yvette Cooper Speaking in Sydney, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was unaware of the report that has been commissioned, adding that immigration had been ""fantastic for the energy and dynamism of the economy"" but ""that doesn't mean that you can't control it"". For Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said there was ""far too much heat and not enough light about immigration, so any truly objective and well-informed analysis must be welcome"". But she raised concerns about the timescale for the Migration Advisory Committee report: ""Six months before Brexit will not be enough time to structure a new immigration system."" Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said the move would ""do nothing to reassure the hospitals that are already seeing record numbers of EU nurses leaving, or the companies struggling to recruit the staff they need"". ""The NHS, businesses and universities that depend on European citizens need answers now, not in another 14 months' time,"" he added. This video can not be played Johnson asked about EU migration study The CBI said commissioning the report was a ""sensible first step"", adding: ""Workers from across Europe strengthen our businesses and help our public services run more smoothly - any new migration system should protect these benefits while restoring public confidence."" But the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, said it was ""staggering"" that it had taken the government a year since the EU referendum to commission it. And property developer Richard Tice, co-chairman of Leave Means Leave, told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""This commission should be reporting by this Christmas, not by next September. It's completely unacceptable for this to drag on ... the government needs to rapidly accelerate this."" Manufacturers' organisation EEF said the migration committee was ""best placed"" to advise on what EU migration should look like after Brexit. Both EEF and the CBI called for an immediate resolution of the question of the status of EU nationals already living in the UK.

Bottle man lands 50 potential dates,"Craig Sullivan cast about 2,000 bottles into the sea and rivers across the UK A man who sparked outrage for his efforts to find love by releasing thousands of messages in bottles at beauty spots across the UK has said he now has dozens of potential dates. Widower Craig Sullivan, who is 49 and originally from North Lanarkshire, set 2,000 bottles adrift last week. However, his efforts resulted in scorn from some who accused him of littering and polluting the environment. Mr Sullivan said that his quest had attracted 50 offers of companionship. He was reported to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) after releasing about 200 of the bottles into the River Cree in Dumfries and Galloway. Sepa said the bottles had since been removed from the river by locals. Mr Sullivan, who runs a website consultancy firm in London, said he embarked upon his plan to release the bottles following the death of his wife Julia from breast cancer 18 months ago. He said he wanted to find someone for companionship and that he had been inspired by The Police song Message in a Bottle. Writing on his blog, he said: ""I decided to do something about it. ""Using any of the normal channels for this sort of thing (dating sites, friends, matchmaking services) seemed clichÃ©d or somehow less elegant, less noble in intentions than my own mind."" Mr Sullivan was reported for placing about 200 bottles in the River Cree in Dumfries and Galloway He added: ""So, armed with maps, tidal tables, a motorhome, 4G data, provisions and a week driving around the UK, âI might just be able to send them to beaches across the world."" One of the spots Mr Sullivan picked for releasing his bottles was the River Cree, near Newton Stewart. That resulted in an angry message from one resident who wrote to him in response: ""Sepa informed of you fly tipping into the river Cree salmon hatchery, your total disregard for our beautiful clean river is palpable. Don't come back to Newton Stewart your [sic] not welcome. Incidentally all bottles recovered from the Cree hatchery."" In a statement, a spokesman for the environment agency said: ""Our officers are comfortable that there is no environmental risk to the River Cree as a result of the bottles being released and, following inquiries, understand almost all of the bottles were contained and removed from the river fairly quickly by local residents."" Mr Sullivan embarked on his week-long journey around the UK on 20 July, stopping in Wales and at Hinkley Point before driving on to Scotland. However, rather than drawing potential partners, his efforts resulted in a backlash, with one woman writing to him: ""Hi Craig, I love how romantic your idea is but please reconsider putting all of these into the sea, lots of us spend hours picking up beach litter. ""How about joining a big beach clean, you may pick up a hobby & meet someone there too? We deserve love & clean beaches! Another person wrote: ""Can we get this half-wit arrested, stopped, educated or something? I simply cannot believe he can put this rubbish in the ocean unpunished."" Mr Sullivan told the BBC that he had stopped releasing the bottles as soon as he became aware of the anger they were causing. Mr Sullivan said he was inspired by the lyrics of the Police song Message in a Bottle He said: ""The abuse was not very good. In several instances it got out of hand. It was never my intent to harm the environment. It was more accident, naivety as well as stupidity in the execution. ""There was the fact that they all washed up on the beach in Wales at the same time or got caught in the net at the river in Scotland. It was just my intention to send a wee love bottle with a message to someone I had not yet met."" Mr Sullivan said that he had since received 50 responses from women who were interested in knowing him, including one from Ireland and another from the west coast of Scotland. He added: ""I am genuinely sorry for upsetting people, but I do not regret what I did."" Sepa said it was satisfied that the issue had been resolved and said that it did not intend to pursue any further action against Mr Sullivan.

BBC women 'let gender pay gap happen',"Emily Maitlis, Victoria Derbyshire, Sue Barker, Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Alex Jones were among BBC stars to sign a letter demanding the BBC take action over the gender pay gap Female staff at the BBC let the gender pay gap happen ""because they weren't doing much about it"", a government adviser on equal pay has said. Businessman Sir Philip Hampton told theEvening Standard newspaper in London that in contrast to men, he had ""never, ever had a woman ask for a pay rise"".,external BBC presenter Jane Garvey said he seemed ""peculiarly out of touch"". The corporation has faced criticism since it revealed last week thatits top earnerswere largely men. The list showed that Chris Evans was the the top-paid male star on between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m, while Claudia Winkleman was the highest-paid female celebrity, earning between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000 last year. How much the BBC pays its stars What will the industry make of star pay? Reality Check : The gender pay gap It also revealed that two-thirds of the 96 presenters and celebrities paid more than Â£150,000 were men, and director general Tony Hall admitted there was ""more to do"" on the gender pay gap. Sir Philip, the co-author of the government'sHampton-Alexander review,externallooking at ways of increasing the number of women in top paid jobs, was asked about the situation by the newspaper. He said: ""How has this situation arisen at the BBC that these intelligent, high-powered, sometimes formidable women have sat in this situation? ""They [the female broadcasters] are all looking at each other now saying: 'How did we let this happen?' I suspect they let it happen because they weren't doing much about it."" Sir Philip, who is chairman of global drugs company GSK, where he earns Â£700,000 a year, added: ""It's just a difference between men and women: men go for promotions and leadership roles, women are less proactive in asking for more money. ""I've had lots of women reporting to me or coming in to talk to me about their careers - either for general guidance or employees of companies where I've been working. I have never, ever had a woman ask for a pay rise. ""There isn't a list long enough for all the men who've asked. Lots of men have trooped into my office saying they are under-paid but no woman has ever done that."" This video can not be played How to ask for a pay rise But Ms Garvey, who presents Radio 4's Woman's Hour and organised a protestletter from the BBC's top female starsto Mr Hall, told the Standard: ""The likes of Sir Philip Hampton can never begin to understand. He seems peculiarly out of touch given the task he has. ""Many women have learnt to question their position in the workplace, partly because of the dominance and success of people like him."" And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson accused him of heaping ""insult on injustice"", adding that his comments were ""at best, astonishingly ill-judged"". ""His remarks that the BBC women 'let this happen' display a worrying lack of understanding of the structural gender, race and class bias across all of society at all levels, including the BBC,"" she added.

Judge writes letter to court battle teen,"A judge has written a personal letter to a 14-year-old boy explaining why he has rejected his request to move with his father to Scandinavia. Mr Justice Jackson said he felt the teenager had brought the case to the High Court ""as a way of showing your dad how much you love him"". He told the boy he was ""doing well in life"" and did not believe that the move abroad would work. He said: ""I am confident that it is the right order for you in the long run."" Mr Justice Jackson, who is based in the Family Division of the High Court in London, wrote the letter to the teenager which laid down his ruling after a hearing in July. Sam, not his real name, had applied for permission to live with his father in a Scandinavian country, which his mother and step-father opposed. The application was later taken over by his dad. In the letter,external, the judge told the boy he believed ""that your feelings are that you love everyone in your family very much, just as they love you"". However, he noted that Sam's parents had ""very different personalities"" and the fact they found it hard to agree was ""stressful for you"". In the letter, the judge said he found Sam's dad to be someone who was ""troubled"" and had a ""lot of influence over you"". ""All fathers influence their sons, but your father goes a lot further than that. I'm quite clear that if he was happy with the present arrangements, you probably would be too. Because he isn't, you aren't."" He questioned whether the idea for the proceedings came from Sam or his dad and said he believed the teenager had ""brought the proceedings mainly as a way of showing your dad how much you love him"". He told the teenager: ""Also, I may be wrong, but when you gave your evidence I didn't get the feeling that you actually see your future in Scandinavia at all. ""Instead, what I saw was you doing your duty by your dad while trying not to be too unfair to your mum. But you still felt you had to boost your dad wherever you could. ""That's how subtle and not-so-subtle pressure works. So I respect your views, but I don't take them at face value because I think they are significantly formed by your loyalty to your father."" The judge said Sam's dad had a ""manipulative side"" and has ""in some ways lost sight of what was best"" for his son. He told the boy he had no confidence that a move to Scandinavia would work and hoped his dad would decide to stay in England ""for your sake"". The judge said the evidence showed Sam was doing well in life in England and that he ""should make the most of the many opportunities that life here has to offer you"". He went on:  ""If, when you finish your A-levels, you want to move to Scandinavia, you will be 18 and an adult - it will be up to you."" Mr Justice Jackson dismissed his dad's application to take Sam to live in Scandinavia and for Sam to apply for citizenship there. He ruled that Sam would have contact with his dad on alternate weekends and any arrangement after he moved to Scandinavia alone would have to be agreed between both parents. In the letter, he added: ""Whatever each of your parents might think about it, I hope they have the dignity not to impose their views on you, so that you can work things out for yourself."" The judge finished by saying he and Sam's dad had enjoyed finding out they loved the film My Cousin Vinny - but for different reasons. ""He mentioned it as an example of a miscarriage of justice, while I remember it for the best courtroom scenes in any film, and the fact that justice was done in the end.""

"Mum jailed for suffocating daughter, 2","Cody-Anne Jackson sent a photo of her daughter Macey Hogan before killing her A mum who suffocated her two-year-old daughter after sending the toddler's father ""one last picture"" of her has been jailed for a minimum of 16 years. Cody-Anne Jackson killed Macey Hogan after texting her ex a message reading: ""Sorry, just thought you deserved one last picture and memory of her."" The 20-year-old, of Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, denied murder but changed her plea part-way through her trial. She was jailed for life at Stafford Crown Court. His Honour Judge Michael Chambers QC told the young mother she had committed a ""wicked and appalling act"". She also tried to take her own life because she was angry and resentful towards Macey's father Paul Hogan after he ended their relationship a week earlier, the court heard. Latest on this and other stories in Stoke and Staffordshire Staffordshire Police released the harrowing 999 call made by Jackson after she smothered the little girl. The little girl's body was found on the floor in a bedroom on the morning of 10 October last year after officers broke into her home. This video can not be played Police were called after the chilling 999 call from the girl's mother Jackson, who was in the same room attempting CPR, was found with ""superficial"" chest, neck and wrist injuries. She had written a suicide note before the killing, stating: ""There's nothing for me or Macey."" Before changing her plea, Jackson claimed she woke up and found Macey's cold body next to her in bed, in between two pillows. Police broke in through the front door at the house in Packett Street, Fenton Judge Chambers, the Recorder of Stafford, told her: ""You have had the courage to plead guilty and recognise the enormity of what you have done. ""I accept that may not have come easy but this remains a very serious case - for a mother to kill her young child, who depends on her for protection above all others, is a wicked and appalling act. ""This is not a case where you suffered from mental illness. The clear inference is that you thought about killing yourself and decided to kill Macey as well to prevent her having a life without a mother. ""That was an expression of utter self-absorption."" Det Insp Dan Ison, of Staffordshire Police, said: ""This was not a killing that occurred due to a struggling single parent, nor was it a killing where in some perverse way it was felt that Macey was being protected from someone or something.

Amazon founder is world's new richest man,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos briefly overtook Bill Gates on Thursday to become the world's richest person, as his worth hit $91.4bn (Â£70bn). A sharp rise in Amazon shares meant Mr Bezos's wealth eclipsed that of the Microsoft co-founder for a timeaccording to Forbes,external. But as Amazon shares fell back, Mr Gates regained the top spot. Mr Bezos, 53, owns about 17% of the shares in Amazon, but also has interests in several other businesses. Recently soaring technology stocks have fuelled huge growth in the worth of entrepreneurs such as Mr Bezos and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, 33, who is number five on Forbes's list. But the last person to steal the lead was Spanish fashion boss Amancio Ortega, founder of Zara's owner Inditex. He wasthe world's richest man for two dayslast September. Amazon's current share price puts Mr Bezos only marginally behind Mr Gates. Here are five things you may not know about Mr Bezos: Earlier this year Mr Bezos paid $23m for an old textile museum in Washington DC. Once it's converted to a family home, the Bezos family will be near neighbours in the exclusive neighbourhood with the Obamas, as well as Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. At least that's what the Washington Post reported, a reliable source presumably since Mr Bezos bought the paper in 2013 with $250m of his own money. The former textile museum in Washington DC bought by Jeff Bezos The Bezos family also has homes in Seattle and Beverly Hills, but expenditure on property pales into insignificance compared to Mr Bezos's foremost passion: rocket science. Mr Bezos says he is selling about $1bn of Amazon stock every year to fund Blue Origin, the project he has founded to develop commercial space travel. It was Mr Bezos's idea to start giving away bananas to passers-by in Amazon's home town of Seattle - a generous gesture, especially since about 4,500 people reportedly take up the offer every day. But when it comes to philanthropy that is still peanuts compared to his peers. While he and his family have given millions to good causes, Mr Bezos has been criticised for not doing enough. He doesn't splash out for non-profits on the scale that Bill Gates, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and others do, and is yet to join the 169 of his wealthy peers who have pledged to give away half their personal fortune. But last month Mr Bezos appeared to be toying with new ideas in the philanthropic sphere. He tweeted a request for suggestions as to how he could give money away that would have an impact ""here and now"" - a kind of next-day-delivery philanthropy. It remains to be seen which proposals - ranging from libraries to tech talent in Africa - have caught his imagination. Good causes are already very much the domain of Jeff's brother Mark Bezos. He switched from a career in advertising to work for the New York based anti-poverty organisation Robin Hood. Mark Bezos is also a volunteer firefighter In a2011 TED talk,externalMark Bezos relates how, attending his first fire as a volunteer, he was keen to show what he was made of. But someone else was asked to brave the smouldering building to rescue the owner's puppy. Mark was given the less glamorous task of finding her a pair of shoes. But she was still extremely grateful. He draws this lesson: if you have something to give, however small, do it now. Any ideas for Jeff? One advantage of being super-rich is that people indulge your fantasies.

Jeff Bezos in full Trekkie alien costume As a child he spent a lot of time with his grandparents on their Texas ranch (learning to vaccinate cattle amongst other vital skills) and his interest in number-crunching was already apparent.

""I expected to be awarded for my cleverness and my arithmetic skills,"" he said. But his grandmother burst into tears.

Grenfell bosses warned charges possible,"Police investigating the Grenfell Tower fire say they have ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect that corporate manslaughter offences may have been committed. It means senior executives from the council and the tenant management organisation that ran the block are likely to be interviewed under caution. A letter from the Met Police to residents said officers had ""seized a huge amount of material"". At least 80 people died in the fire in North Kensington on 14 June. Organisations guilty of the offence of corporate manslaughter are liable to an ""unlimited fine"". Individuals cannot be charged with corporate manslaughter, an offence which is intended to work ""in conjunction"" with other forms of accountability. Work to start on covering Grenfell Tower Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What happened at Grenfell Tower? London fire: Six questions for the investigation The relevant section of the letter says Met Police officers have ""seized a huge amount of material and taken a large number of witness statements"". ""After an initial assessment of that information, the officer leading the investigation has today notified the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenancy Management Organisation that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that each organisation may have committed the offence of corporate manslaughter under the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007,"" it said. This video can not be played New Kensington and Chelsea council leader Elizabeth Campbell: ""I will co-operate in any way I possibly can"" The Met Police also released a statement on Thursday, stating that its investigation into the cause and spread of the fire was a ""complex and far reaching investigation that by its very nature will take a considerable time to complete"". Newly elected council leader Elizabeth Campbell, whowas booed and heckled at a public meeting earlier this month, said residents ""deserve answers"" about the blaze and the ""police investigation will provide these"". ""We fully support the Metropolitan Police investigation and we will co-operate in every way we can,"" Ms Campbell added. ""It would not be appropriate to comment further on matters subject to the police investigation."" BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds says the Met Police has briefed a number of times that corporate manslaughter is a possible offence, along with breaches of health and safety laws. The effect of what the police have said is to put both organisations on notice that their senior executives are likely to be questioned under caution in relation to the fire. This means that evidence can be used against both bodies in a court, our correspondent added. Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, whose friend Khadija Saye died in the fire, said the punishment for corporate manslaughter, a fine, would not ""represent justice for the Grenfell victims and their families"". ""Gross negligence manslaughter carries a punishment of prison time, and I hope that the police and the CPS are considering charges of manslaughter caused by gross negligence,"" he added. Yvette Williams, a co-ordinator at the Justice 4 Grenfell campaign group, said the development would help increase levels of trust between the police and the community. ""However, what we would like to see running alongside that is individuals being prosecuted. We want is individuals named and prosecuted - you can have both, but we don't want corporate manslaughter on its own,"" she added. Kensington and Chelsea Council has been criticised for its response to the Grenfell fire The local authority has been accused ofbeing slow to react to the disaster on the groundand not doing enough to re-house residents of Grenfell Tower. Council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown and his deputy Rock Feilding-Mellen resigned following continued criticism of its response to the tragedy. Robert Black, chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, also stepped down to ""concentrate on assisting with the investigation and inquiry"". The news comes after site manager at the tower block, Michael Lockwood,told a public meeting on Wednesday that the building would be covered in August. He said that he expected the demolition of the tower block would begin ""towards the end of 2018"". Some possessions could be retrieved from 33 of the block's flats, he added. The residents of Grenfell Tower hadreportedly raised fire safety concerns for several yearsbefore the blaze, according to a community action group. A Newsnight investigation has shown that an official test of the types of materials used at Grenfell Tower suggest thatdesigns such as that used in the tower's cladding are fundamentally flawed. Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered a public inquiry into the tower fire, which will be led by retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick. He told survivors at a meeting on Tuesdayhe would ""get to the bottom"" of the tragedybut insisted he had ""no power"" to make arrests over the blaze. What happened at Grenfell Tower?

No transgender policy change 'for now',"This video can not be played Riley Dosh explains why she wants to defend her country Transgender people will not be banned from serving in the US military until the president issues guidance to the Pentagon, military officials say. In a surprise tweet on Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced that the government would not allow them to serve ""in any capacity"". It was not clear whether troops on active service would be forced out. But Gen Joseph Dunford wrote to senior commanders: ""We will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect."" Transgender service members have expressed concern that they will be discharged, or unable to re-enlist after Mr Trump's announcement. Gen Dunford's letter,shared by a CNN correspondent,externalon Twitter, said: ""I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President. ""There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidelines."" It was the Obama administration that allowed transgender people in the military to serve openly for the first time. The change was announced in June 2016 and was meant to come into effect on 1 July 2017 but the Trump administration delayed it by a further six months. Transgender people had to demonstrate they had been stable in their new gender for at least 18 months, and some have come out as transgender in the meantime. Transgender troops react to ban ""The United States government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US military,"" Donald Trump tweeted. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" He added that the decision came ""after consultation with my Generals and military experts"". Some US media outlets have questioned the spending justification. The Washington Post drew attentionto an analysis,externalthat the US military spends almost $42m (Â£32m) a year on the erectile dysfunction medication Viagra - several times the total estimated cost of transgender medical support. Why does the US military buy so much Viagra? James Corden hits out at Trump's trans ban The independent Rand Corporation estimates that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender, although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000. The Obama administration announced last year that transgender people would be allowed to serve openly in the military. Many active duty members came out following the decision. Then-defence secretary Ash Carter also set a deadline of one year for the various branches of the military to begin accepting transgender recruits. The secret life of a transgender airman This video can not be played Being transgender in the US military - Jamie Ewing spoke to the BBC in 2016 However in June, the administration delayed the recruitment provision by six months. The Obama-era policy had included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender. Rand predicted that the inclusion of transgender people in the military would lead to a 0.13% increase in healthcare spending - approximately $8.4m. UK chiefs praise transgender troops Trump revokes transgender toilet rules Transgender troops expressed dismay over the ban.

Charlie Gard hospice move approved,"Charlie has encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome Terminally-ill Charlie Gard will be moved to a hospice and have his life support withdrawn soon after, a High Court judge has decided. Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said it was not in his best interests to spend a long time in a hospice. His parents had wanted a private team to care for Charlie so they could have more time with him. ""GOSH have denied us our final wish,"" his mother said. The judgeapproved a plan,externalthat will see Charlie die shortly after being moved. Mr Justice Francis added that no details about when he would be moved and where could be made public. In a statement, the hospital said it deeply regretted ""that profound and heartfelt differences"" between Charlie's doctors and parents have ""had to be played out in court over such a protracted period"". The story of Charlie Gard Charlie has been in intensive care since October Parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, and GOSH had until 12:00 BST to agree Charlie's end-of-life care. However, an agreementwas not reached by the noon deadline. The parents' lawyer, Grant Armstrong said they wanted to spend days with Charlie at a hospice before his death. But hospital bosses said they could not agree to the arrangement as his parents had not found a paediatric intensive care specialist. Commenting on the decision, Connie said: ""We just want some peace with our son, no hospital, no lawyers, no courts, no media, just quality time with Charlie away from everything, to say goodbye to him in the most loving way. ""Most people won't ever have to go through what we have been through, we've had no control over our son's life and no control over our son's death. ""Despite us and our legal team working tirelessly to arrange this near impossible task, the judge has ordered against what we arranged and has agreed to what GOSH asked. ""This subsequently gives us very little time with our son."" Connie Yates was in court on Wednesday to hear the decision about where her son will spend his final days The hospital said there was ""simply no way that Charlie... can spend any significant time outside of an intensive care environment safely"". It added: ""We will arrange for Charlie to be transferred to a specialist children's hospice... who will do all they can to make these last moments as comfortable and peaceful for Charlie and his loved ones."" GOSH said that ""while we always respect parents' views, we will never do anything that could cause our patients unnecessary and prolonged suffering"". TheHigh Court order,externalsays Charlie will continue to be treated in hospital for a ""period of time"" before being moved to the hospice, which cannot be named for legal reasons. It says doctors can then withdraw ""artificial ventilation"" after a period of time. Everyone involved has agreed that the ""arrangements"" will ""inevitably result in Charlie's death within a short period thereafter"", the order adds.

Working class actors are rising again,"Jim Cartwright (centre) leading an exercise with one of his drama groups From Dame Julie Walters to David Morrissey, many top showbusiness names have voiced concerns about a lack of working class actors. Now leading playwright Jim Cartwright is doing something to fix the problem. There is a ""quiet revolution"" taking place in acting, Cartwright says. And it is happening in a fitness studio above a charity shop on Chorley High Street in Lancashire. This is where Cartwright, whose plays include The Rise and Fall of Little Voice and Road, holds three drama classes every Sunday. On Saturdays, he takes over a room in a Methodist church in Manchester. He started the classes in 2015 after reading comments fromDame Julie,external, who said she would not be able to afford to become an actress if she was starting out again. ""It made me really cross because I'm from a working class background,"" he says. L to R: Tom Hiddleston (Eton), Eddie Redmayne (Eton), Benedict Cumberbatch (Harrow) Reading articles about shrinking opportunities made him ""like a bull with a sore head"", he says. So his wife told him: ""Don't get angry. Do something."" He took her advice and set up the drama studio with the aim of bringing through more working class talent, advertising his services in his local fish and chip shop. ""I got a little card saying 'drama studio' and stuck it on a chippy wall. And I waited. And they came, and they came, and they keep coming."" Two years later, he has five classes in the two locations and has set up a talent agency to represent the budding stars. There is also a youth group. Jolene Rathmill has found it hard to progress in the acting profession The adult class members range from people who have never set foot on stage to jobbing actors who are honing their skills. There are students, retired people, a few teachers, a former policeman, a fireplace salesman. Jolene Rathmill, 38, from Oldham, works for financial advisers and runs confidence and self-esteem workshops in schools. She says: ""When I first started, Jim got me an agent and wrote something about me, saying he's worked with some of the top actresses in the world and that I have the potential to be that. He sees that in me. That's my ambition, 100%."" However, she thinks she is at a disadvantage because she hasn't been to a prestigious drama school. Cartwright's groups are rehearsing for their next showcase in Manchester ""I grew up on a council estate. We had chicken wire between our gardens and a tyre swinging in our back garden,"" she says. ""I feel that having not attended a professional, recognised drama school, initially you're right at the bottom of the hierarchy. There's a hierarchy of agents, and the top agents get the top castings, and further down the line if they want a real working class actor they might call people in. ""But it's very rare, so you're climbing, climbing, climbing"" - she mimes climbing a ladder - ""trying to get there. And it just doesn't happen."" Cartwright's efforts come as privately educated actors like Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston and Damian Lewis seem to have taken over the TV, film and theatre landscape. Cartwright made his name writing Road, which was filmed for the BBC in 1987 Last year,The Sutton Trust found,externalthat 42% of the winners in three main Bafta award categories had gone to people from private schools, while Sky News recently calculatedthat 45% of the BBC's best-paid stars,externalwere also privately educated. Also in 2016,researchers found that,external16% of actors came from working class backgrounds - half the level of the population as a whole - and that the British acting profession was ""heavily skewed towards the privileged."" The Labour Party is now conductingits own investigation,externalinto opportunities for working class actors, with a report due to be published soon. Cartwright has turned drama teacher after more than 30 years asone of the most vital voices in British theatre,external. His debut play Road is currentlyback at the Royal Court,externalin London, where it launched his career in 1986. He has also acted in TV shows like The Village, From Darkness and Coronation Street. Cartwright is an acclaimed writer, actor, director - and now drama teacher With the Cartwright Drama Studio, he hopes to replicate the ""explosion of energy and talent"" that came with theKitchen Sink movement,externalof the 1950s. That was fading by the 1980s, he says, when he noticed ""the floppy fringe coming back"". He says: ""I'd never say it's been an even playing field, but when I started out it was more even. But I've seen it change. I've seen it tilt."" His students come from all sections of society. Some would identify as working class, some wouldn't. But he believes the mindset is what sets his studio apart. ""The working class thing is an attitude. It's a burning, it's a feeling inside,"" Cartwright says. ""That's what came in the '50s. It wasn't just that they were from a particular area or a particular economic strata. ""They carried with them a certain fire. That's what we're building in the classes. We're not just classes - we're a bit of a movement really and we're a quiet revolution. ""And we're coming. If you won't let us through the doors, we're coming over the walls and through the stalls. We're coming in. It's time. And anyone out there who feels the same as I do, join us, because it's time for change in theatre. It really is time for change. ""Not that there's not great work that goes on. There's fantastic work and fantastic people working in this business. But something's died that we're reviving."" Cartwright brings casting directors and agents to see his students perform at regular showcases. Some have won small film and TV roles and are working on their own theatre shows and short films. There are no stars yet - but he is sure some have the talent to go all the way. ""Some of the people who come to these classes are just amazing, and it's criminal that they're not working in the highest levels of this industry,"" he says. The class members includeDarren Scott, 55, who worked as an actor for seven years before the work dried up. So he has spent the past 20 years as a primary school teacher. For him, attending the Cartwright Drama Studio has rekindled his performing career. ""I was in the very first showcase that Jim directed, and through that I got an agent, and I had an audition with Mike Leigh for his new feature film. And after three recalls, I was lucky enough to be offered a part. That's a direct result of coming here and working with Jim."" At the age of 19,Emma Heyeshas studied acting at college and is attending the classes in preparation for auditioning for drama school. In the meantime, she's working on the checkouts at Tesco. She has already had enough acting experience to know her accent puts her at a disadvantage. ""I have to learn accents, otherwise I won't get work,"" she explains. ""I think I've only ever done one play where I've used my actual accent, and I've done a lot of plays. ""I've been into the top drama schools in the UK and they look at you as the novelty northerner in the corner."" As part of the training, Cartwright tasks the group members with writing and performing monologues. He recommends one by 38-year-oldScott Brerton. Brerton reads it and it is a bittersweet tale of trying to remember what happened on a big night out. It is exactly the sharp, funny, full-of-life voice that Cartwright is trying to encourage. Brerton had not acted before he started coming to the classes six months ago. He has now been for his first audition and won his first role, performing in a three-night play in Liverpool last month. ""I don't think I would have been able to do it or have had the confidence to do it without coming here and having that weekly inspiration and driving motivation by Jim,"" he says. It is early days for all concerned, and the ""quiet revolution"" may end with a whimper or a roar. At any rate, Cartwright is on a mission to make it happen. In fact. he's throwing the kitchen sink at it. The next Cartwright Drama Studio showcase is at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, on 31 July. Road runs at the Royal Court in London until 9 September.

Pentagon: No change in transgender policy,"This video can not be played Riley Dosh explains why she wants to defend her country Transgender people will not be banned from serving in the US military until the president issues guidance to the Pentagon, military officials say. In a surprise tweet on Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced that the government would not allow them to serve ""in any capacity"". It was not clear whether troops on active service would be forced out. But Gen Joseph Dunford wrote to senior commanders: ""We will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect."" Transgender service members have expressed concern that they will be discharged, or unable to re-enlist after Mr Trump's announcement. Gen Dunford's letter,shared by a CNN correspondent,externalon Twitter, said: ""I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President. ""There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidelines."" It was the Obama administration that allowed transgender people in the military to serve openly for the first time. The change was announced in June 2016 and was meant to come into effect on 1 July 2017 but the Trump administration delayed it by a further six months. Transgender people had to demonstrate they had been stable in their new gender for at least 18 months, and some have come out as transgender in the meantime. Transgender troops react to ban ""The United States government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US military,"" Donald Trump tweeted. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" He added that the decision came ""after consultation with my Generals and military experts"". Some US media outlets have questioned the spending justification. The Washington Post drew attentionto an analysis,externalthat the US military spends almost $42m (Â£32m) a year on the erectile dysfunction medication Viagra - several times the total estimated cost of transgender medical support. Why does the US military buy so much Viagra? James Corden hits out at Trump's trans ban The independent Rand Corporation estimates that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender, although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000. The Obama administration announced last year that transgender people would be allowed to serve openly in the military. Many active duty members came out following the decision. Then-defence secretary Ash Carter also set a deadline of one year for the various branches of the military to begin accepting transgender recruits. The secret life of a transgender airman This video can not be played Being transgender in the US military - Jamie Ewing spoke to the BBC in 2016 However in June, the administration delayed the recruitment provision by six months. The Obama-era policy had included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender. Rand predicted that the inclusion of transgender people in the military would lead to a 0.13% increase in healthcare spending - approximately $8.4m. UK chiefs praise transgender troops Trump revokes transgender toilet rules Transgender troops expressed dismay over the ban. Army reservist Rudy Akbariantold a news conference: ""The discrimination I'm facing now is from those outside the military - not the people who work with me.""

Punters 'drugged' at lap dancing club,"The council has temporarily suspended the club's licence A lap dancing club allegedly drugged customers and charged thousands of pounds of unauthorised transactions to their credit cards, a report claims. The report, which was compiled by Birmingham City Council's licensing team, contains police allegations that up to Â£93,042 was taken from customers of Legs 11 on Broad Street. The council has suspended the club's alcohol licence, pending a full review. Legs 11 has not responded to a request for a comment. In the council report Supt Andy Parsons said two men had claimed they were drugged, with one testing positive for methadone with a home testing kit. The force is also investigating claims large amounts of money was taken from people's bank accounts without their knowledge. Some customers had paid for dances ""in a private area"" but additional transactions were taking place that they had not authorised, he said. One victim claimed he had lost as much as Â£19,417. ""In this year alone, four fraud offences have been reported totalling Â£23,965 with two of the victims reporting they had been drugged,"" he said. ""One of the victims went as far as getting a home drug test kit which indicated he was under the influence of methadone. This victim had Â£9,000 taken from his credit card."" The club was being investigated over 17 fraud-related allegations since 2013, West Midlands Police said. Supt Parsons added ""intelligence checks"" suggested the club was linked to ""organised crime groups from Albania"". ""These premises are involved in serious criminality and serious offences are being committed at the premises,"" he said. The report also contained details of an undercover trading standards investigation, during which officers were offered sexual services in a locked room for a fee of Â£1,000 and were ""rubbed"" by naked dancers, contravening the club's licence.

Work to start on covering Grenfell Tower,"The deconstruction of the tower is expected to begin towards the end of 2018 Grenfell Tower will be covered in a protective wrap to help with forensic investigations, the site manager says. Michael Lockwood told a public meeting on Wednesday that the charred building, in North Kensington in London, would be covered in August. He said that he expected the demolition of the tower block, where at least 80 people died in the fire on 14 June, would begin ""towards the end of 2018"". He added that some possessions could be retrieved from 33 of the block's flats. Speaking at the Notting Hill Methodist Church, Mr Lockwood said the recovery operation tower block could last until November this year. Grenfell cladding fails official fire test Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Reality Check: What happened to Grenfell donations? Messages from the tower A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower The criminal investigation into the building - which requires material to be collected - could go on until January. The covering of the 24-storey tower block will use scaffolding, which Mr Lockwood said would aid workers in demolishing the building. Workers continue to comb through tonnes of debris from the site for remains and evidence He said: ""I think that to be honest, the building will stay up throughout 2018. ""Then towards the end of 2018, I think we could start to bring it down, if that is what the community wants, and the scaffolding will help us to do that because we can do that within the wrap."" Any decision on what happens to the site after its deconstruction would be made with input from the community, he added. Some flats in the building remain ""completely untouched and in perfect condition"" he said, while others are devastated. There are some 33 flats in the block from which some possessions could be retrieved and returned to residents ""in the next week or so"", he added. Members of various churches attended the memorial service A memorial service for five of the residents who perished in the fire was held at St Helen's Church in North Kensington. The service, attended by the Archbishop of York, remembered artist Khadiya Saye and her mother Mary Mendy, Berktki Haftom and her 12-year-old son Beruk, and a five-year-old boy called Isaac. Meanwhile,experts who recovered remains after the 9/11 attackin New York are helping police investigators comb through debris from the fire.

Missing woman found after bottling scent,"A woman with dementia who went missing in Florida was found by a police dog in a matter of minutes, having bottled her scent in advance. Citrus County Sheriff's Office said the anonymous woman had used a specialist scent preservation kit. It can hold a person's scent for up to seven years. Ina Facebook post,externalpolice said she stored the scent two-and-a-half years ago, and a picture of the jar showed it was dated January 2015. Scent preservation kits involve rubbing a pad on a person's underarm, then sealing it in a sterile jar so police dogs have a reliable scent to smell before looking for a missing person. Manufacturers say they work better and more quickly than articles of clothing, because they are not contaminated by other people's smells or smells from the environment. Dogs have a stronger sense of smell than humans and working police dogs are trained to sniff out drugs, people and in some cases corpses. Some police forces around the world, including in China and Germany, have held scent samples from criminal suspects and crime scenes to help in their investigations. But there are concerns over a high failure rate; in 2006 it was found that only a quarter of people indicated by dogs in New South Wales, Australia, turned out to be carrying drugs when they were searched. In this case, though, the missing person was found and the dog earned a celebratory ice cream.

Charlie's parents want a private medical team to care for their son in a hospice so they can have days with him before his life support ends.

Green backlash against 'progressive alliance',"Left-leaning parties worked together to cut Theresa May's majority at the general election - was it a one-off or is the ""progressive alliance"" here to stay? One of the many surprises on 8 June was how Britain appeared to have turned the clock back to the era of two party politics, with 82% of voters casting their ballot for Labour or the Conservatives. Some of the surge in Labour's support may have been down to tactical voting, with left-leaning voters spooked by the prospect of a huge Conservative majority deciding to back whichever party they believed stood the best chance of beating the Conservatives in their constituency. Which, in most cases, was Labour. But in some parts of the country the choice was made easier for them. Local electoral deals saw some would-be election candidates stand aside to avoid splitting the ""anti-Tory"" vote. But despite warm words from some Labour and Lib Dem MPs, one party ended up doing most of the heavy lifting. Ofthe 41 seats listed by the Progressive Alliance,external, one of the organisations promoting tactical voting and cross-party cooperation, where ""progressive candidates have stood aside to help another progressive candidate defeat the Tories"", 38 of them were Greens, two were Lib Dems and one represented the Women's Equality Party. Not one Labour candidate stood aside, even though it was the Labour Party that got most of the benefit, in terms of extra votes and seats. The Green Party's co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley got behind the idea of electoral alliances as a way of forcing proportional representation on to the political agenda, having spent years getting nowhere with efforts to get candidates that back electoral reform elected through first-past-the-post. Last year's Richmond Park by-election, which saw the Greens stand aside to help Lib Dem Sarah Olney defeat the then (and future) Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, had shown them what was possible and they had the backing of Green party members. But the Labour and Lib Dem leaderships refused to play ball, rejecting their offer of a formal deal at June's snap election out of hand. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC: ""I just think the electorate would be concerned if they thought parties were stitching up elections privately. I don't think that's the way forward. The way forward is to support and vote for the Labour Party."" Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was equally dismissive, despite support for the idea among some in his party, saying the ""only plausible route of any kind towards the Conservatives not winning a majority"" was having a sizable Liberal Democrat group of MPs. It was left to local Green parties to strike their own deals, if they could. It worked in some places, most notably Brighton Pavilion, where Caroline Lucas doubled her majority, after the Lib Dem candidate stood aside, as payback for Green support in Richmond Park. Sarah Olney won the Richmond by-election but lost the seat at the general election But her result was a rare bright spot in a dismal night for the Greens, who failed to gain any of their other target seats, and saw their vote drop from 1.1 million in 2015 to just over 500,000. It was a bad night for smaller parties in general. UKIP saw an even more dramatic collapse in its share of the vote than the Greens. The Lib Dems also saw their vote share squeezed - but only the Greens stood aside in significant numbers to aid other parties. On the day after the election, the Green Party's co-leader Jonathan Bartley hailed the ""brave"" decision by 24 Green candidates in marginal seats to stand aside, which he said had made a ""big difference to the election result"". But that's not how some of the candidates-that-never-were felt. Green Party activist Jill Perry, who opted not to stand in Workington, said she now has ""regrets"" about doing so because she does not think it made any difference to the result, which saw the Labour candidate Sue Hayman retain the seat with a slightly reduced majority. It also deprived local Green members and supporters - including herself - of the opportunity to vote for their party, which on nuclear power, nuclear weapons and airport expansion, to name just a few issues, is diametrically opposed to the official Labour position. ""I voted with a heavy heart because, obviously, I could not vote Green,"" she says. ""It was a very difficult decision. It wasn't a personal decision, it was a group decision, but the group was very divided with strong feelings on both sides. ""Really, I don't think it made any difference where candidates stood down"" because a lot of people voted tactically to prevent the Conservatives getting a ""massive majority"" and, as a result, ""everybody went back into the Conservative and Labour silos"". The local Labour Party appreciated their gesture but Greens had been ""put under an awful lot of pressure"" by Labour activists in areas where they refused to stand aside, she added, and some Labour activists had been ""very aggressive towards them"". ""In solidarity with those groups, I think we should stand next time,"" said Ms Perry. Andy D'Agorne, leader of the Green group on York City Council, told the BBC he does not regret standing aside for Labour at the general election but he would not do it again, unless Labour was committed to proportional representation. A seven way debate preceded a return to two-party politics The Greens have strong support in York, gaining 10% of the vote at the 2015 general election in York Central, but Mr D'Agorne said the unexpected surge in the Labour vote has made it a safe seat for Jeremy Corbyn's party, rendering any future gestures of solidarity unnecessary. Nicole Haydock, co-ordinator of Bury Green Party, which opted not to run candidates in June, said the ""backlash in the party after the election"" was because ""most people thought the progressive alliance meant we are standing down where Labour has a chance of winning"" when it was actually about getting an agreement to back proportional representation. Green activist John Coyne refused to stand aside in Wirral West, despite pressure from local Labour activists and members of Momentum, to help Labour's Margaret Greenwood hang on to the seat she had won from Tory Esther McVey by 417 votes in 2015. The 429 votes Mr Coyne received in June might have made all the difference in another close contest, but Ms Greenwood was returned as Wirral West's MP with a majority of 5,365. Mr Coyne said: ""If Labour said, 'yes we want PR' then that would make a big difference but all that's happened in discussions about alliances is that there has been an attempt to get people switching from Green to Labour, there has been no element of reciprocity at all, in this relationship. ""And for that reason, if no other, I think there is no real future for it."" The BBC understands Liverpool Green Party plans to table a motion at the party's annual conference in October to rule out future alliances unless there is a PR deal on offer. There is also the practical concern that the electoral pacts have hit the Green Party in the wallet, as Short Money is handed out by Parliament in line with the number of votes parties get. In 2016/17 the Green Party of England and Wales got Â£216,994 in Short Money. It will be a lot less this year. The progressive alliance borrowed tactics from Bernie Sanders' campaign Caroline Lucas said it was time for ""reflection and planning"" in the Green Party and has promised to listen to the membership about future electoral deals. She said it was ""clear"" that the local Green activists who stood aside in June ""helped cut down the Conservative majority"". But she added: ""The commitment to forming alliances was always about advancing significant electoral reform to give every voter a voice. ""We want to forge a new kind of politics, and simply tactical voting under first past the post does not even begin to rise to that challenge. ""Sadly there was no leadership from either Labour or the Liberal Democrats to put the urgent need for a fairer voting system at the heart of this election nationally."" Frances Foley, campaign co-ordinator of Compass, the cross-party pressure group that set up the Progressive Alliance website and used tactics and personnel borrowed from Bernie Sanders in the US to promote it around the country, said she could understand how some Greens felt ""chastened"" by the drop in their party's vote share. But, she added, ""despite that there is still a really strong appetite for the progressive alliance in the Green Party"". There was also far more enthusiasm for cross-party cooperation, and proportional representation, among Labour activists than the party leadership, she claimed, and that change would eventually come ""from the ground up"". According to Compass's own research, ""progressive"" candidates performed 5.7% better where there was an electoral deal in place. She said the Labour leadership should view their success on 8 June as a ""shared victory,"" as a handful of Labour MPs, such as Clive Lewis, in Norwich South, and Tulip Siddiq, in Hampstead and Kilburn, had done - and it would be a mistake for them to believe they could win a general election on their own. To supporters like Ms Foley, the progressive alliance holds out the prospect of an end to petty tribal politics, as parties with similar world views - pro-European, anti-austerity, greenish - work together for what they see as the ""common good"". The combined forces of the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Lib Dems, Labour and the Green Party, as well as smaller outfits like the Women's Equality Party and the NHS party, add up to a ""progressive"" majority, they argue. More than enough to beat what they call the ""regressive alliance"" of the Tories, UKIP and the Ulster Unionists. But to have any future it is going to take a major change in attitude at the top of the Labour Party to convince the Greens and other smaller parties it is worth the sacrifice.

'Chances missed' to stop Syria deaths,"Abdullah Deghayes (left) and his brother Jaffar Deghayes died in Syria Opportunities were missed to spot the radicalisation of two teenage British Muslim brothers who died fighting in Syria in 2014, a report has found. Agencies had insufficient knowledge and understanding of minority and faith groups, a serious case review said. Abdullah and Jaffar Deghayes were in a child protection plan before 2010, the report by a senior social worker said. But the review found their radicalisation was a ""total shock and surprise"" to authorities in Brighton. Abdullah, 18, and Jaffar, 17, were both killed having followed their older brother, Amer, to Syria to fight for an Al-Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group. Both boys had suffered bullying and racism, and had reported physical abuse by their father. Who are Britain's jihadists? Live: More on this story and other news from Sussex The report by Edi Carmi said the brothers were taken out of the child protection plan in 2010 because there was professional ""helplessness"" among social workers about what else to do. The report said this was expressed by some workers as having ""no tools in the toolbox"". It concluded that professionals often lack ""effective ways to intervene in families who have suffered long-standing trauma"". Amer Deghayes said he was prepared to suffer the same fate as his brothers In the years that followed the end of the protection plan, Abdullah, Jaffar and Amer showed signs of radicalisation. In early 2013, a school reported concerns about some young people including Jaffar. One of the brothers further came to the attention of social workers over an ""emotional"" comment he made about ""Americans"" after he returned from a trip to his family's home country of Libya. This led to a referral to the ""Channel panel"" - a de-radicalisation process - but it was decided he was ""not at risk of being drawn into terror-related activities"". This video can not be played Graham Bartlett said the report is a ""wake-up call"" Graham Bartlett, independent chair of the Brighton and Hove Local Safeguarding Children Board, said: ""The system as a whole let these young boys down. It's a wake up call. ""This case has had a major impact on our understanding of the risks posed to children of exploitation through radicalisation."" The report identified 13 key findings, including that professional responsibilities springing from the government's counter-terrorism strategy were not fully understood by all staff. It also said professionals had no effective ways to intervene in families who have suffered long-standing trauma, and local statutory agencies had ""insufficient knowledge about, and understanding of, local minority ethnic and faith community groups and how best to work together to safeguard children"". The Safeguarding Children Board said it fully accepted the report's findings. Who are Britainâs jihadists?

Bottle man finds 50 potential dates,"Craig Sullivan cast about 2,000 bottles into the sea and rivers across the UK A man who sparked outrage for his efforts to find love by releasing thousands of messages in bottles at beauty spots across the UK has said he now has dozens of potential dates. Widower Craig Sullivan, who is 49 and originally from North Lanarkshire, set 2,000 bottles adrift last week. However, his efforts resulted in scorn from some who accused him of littering and polluting the environment. Mr Sullivan said that his quest had attracted 50 offers of companionship. He was reported to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) after releasing about 200 of the bottles into the River Cree in Dumfries and Galloway. Sepa said the bottles had since been removed from the river by locals. Mr Sullivan, who runs a website consultancy firm in London, said he embarked upon his plan to release the bottles following the death of his wife Julia from breast cancer 18 months ago. He said he wanted to find someone for companionship and that he had been inspired by The Police song Message in a Bottle. Writing on his blog, he said: ""I decided to do something about it. ""Using any of the normal channels for this sort of thing (dating sites, friends, matchmaking services) seemed clichÃ©d or somehow less elegant, less noble in intentions than my own mind."" Mr Sullivan was reported for placing about 200 bottles in the River Cree in Dumfries and Galloway He added: ""So, armed with maps, tidal tables, a motorhome, 4G data, provisions and a week driving around the UK, âI might just be able to send them to beaches across the world."" One of the spots Mr Sullivan picked for releasing his bottles was the River Cree, near Newton Stewart. That resulted in an angry message from one resident who wrote to him in response: ""Sepa informed of you fly tipping into the river Cree salmon hatchery, your total disregard for our beautiful clean river is palpable. Don't come back to Newton Stewart your [sic] not welcome. Incidentally all bottles recovered from the Cree hatchery."" In a statement, a spokesman for the environment agency said: ""Our officers are comfortable that there is no environmental risk to the River Cree as a result of the bottles being released and, following inquiries, understand almost all of the bottles were contained and removed from the river fairly quickly by local residents."" Mr Sullivan embarked on his week-long journey around the UK on 20 July, stopping in Wales and at Hinkley Point before driving on to Scotland. However, rather than drawing potential partners, his efforts resulted in a backlash, with one woman writing to him: ""Hi Craig, I love how romantic your idea is but please reconsider putting all of these into the sea, lots of us spend hours picking up beach litter. ""How about joining a big beach clean, you may pick up a hobby & meet someone there too? We deserve love & clean beaches! Another person wrote: ""Can we get this half-wit arrested, stopped, educated or something? I simply cannot believe he can put this rubbish in the ocean unpunished."" Mr Sullivan told the BBC that he had stopped releasing the bottles as soon as he became aware of the anger they were causing. Mr Sullivan said he was inspired by the lyrics of the Police song Message in a Bottle He said: ""The abuse was not very good. In several instances it got out of hand. It was never my intent to harm the environment. It was more accident, naivety as well as stupidity in the execution. ""There was the fact that they all washed up on the beach in Wales at the same time or got caught in the net at the river in Scotland. It was just my intention to send a wee love bottle with a message to someone I had not yet met."" Mr Sullivan said that he had since received 50 responses from women who were interested in knowing him, including one from Ireland and another from the west coast of Scotland. He added: ""I am genuinely sorry for upsetting people, but I do not regret what I did."" Sepa said it was satisfied that the issue had been resolved and said that it did not intend to pursue any further action against Mr Sullivan.

Man's romantic bottle gesture backfires,"Craig Sullivan cast about 2,000 bottles into the sea and rivers across the UK A man who sparked outrage for his efforts to find love by releasing thousands of messages in bottles at beauty spots across the UK has said he now has dozens of potential dates. Widower Craig Sullivan, who is 49 and originally from North Lanarkshire, set 2,000 bottles adrift last week. However, his efforts resulted in scorn from some who accused him of littering and polluting the environment. Mr Sullivan said that his quest had attracted 50 offers of companionship. He was reported to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) after releasing about 200 of the bottles into the River Cree in Dumfries and Galloway. Sepa said the bottles had since been removed from the river by locals. Mr Sullivan, who runs a website consultancy firm in London, said he embarked upon his plan to release the bottles following the death of his wife Julia from breast cancer 18 months ago. He said he wanted to find someone for companionship and that he had been inspired by The Police song Message in a Bottle. Writing on his blog, he said: ""I decided to do something about it. ""Using any of the normal channels for this sort of thing (dating sites, friends, matchmaking services) seemed clichÃ©d or somehow less elegant, less noble in intentions than my own mind."" Mr Sullivan was reported for placing about 200 bottles in the River Cree in Dumfries and Galloway He added: ""So, armed with maps, tidal tables, a motorhome, 4G data, provisions and a week driving around the UK, âI might just be able to send them to beaches across the world."" One of the spots Mr Sullivan picked for releasing his bottles was the River Cree, near Newton Stewart. That resulted in an angry message from one resident who wrote to him in response: ""Sepa informed of you fly tipping into the river Cree salmon hatchery, your total disregard for our beautiful clean river is palpable. Don't come back to Newton Stewart your [sic] not welcome. Incidentally all bottles recovered from the Cree hatchery."" In a statement, a spokesman for the environment agency said: ""Our officers are comfortable that there is no environmental risk to the River Cree as a result of the bottles being released and, following inquiries, understand almost all of the bottles were contained and removed from the river fairly quickly by local residents."" Mr Sullivan embarked on his week-long journey around the UK on 20 July, stopping in Wales and at Hinkley Point before driving on to Scotland. However, rather than drawing potential partners, his efforts resulted in a backlash, with one woman writing to him: ""Hi Craig, I love how romantic your idea is but please reconsider putting all of these into the sea, lots of us spend hours picking up beach litter. ""How about joining a big beach clean, you may pick up a hobby & meet someone there too? We deserve love & clean beaches! Another person wrote: ""Can we get this half-wit arrested, stopped, educated or something? I simply cannot believe he can put this rubbish in the ocean unpunished."" Mr Sullivan told the BBC that he had stopped releasing the bottles as soon as he became aware of the anger they were causing. Mr Sullivan said he was inspired by the lyrics of the Police song Message in a Bottle He said: ""The abuse was not very good. In several instances it got out of hand. It was never my intent to harm the environment. It was more accident, naivety as well as stupidity in the execution. ""There was the fact that they all washed up on the beach in Wales at the same time or got caught in the net at the river in Scotland. It was just my intention to send a wee love bottle with a message to someone I had not yet met."" Mr Sullivan said that he had since received 50 responses from women who were interested in knowing him, including one from Ireland and another from the west coast of Scotland. He added: ""I am genuinely sorry for upsetting people, but I do not regret what I did."" Sepa said it was satisfied that the issue had been resolved and said that it did not intend to pursue any further action against Mr Sullivan.

Lloyds in new Â£1bn hit for compensation,"Lloyds Banking Group has set aside another Â£1bn to cover the cost of insurance mis-selling and the treatment of mortgage customers. Of that, Â£700m will cover payment protection insurance (PPI) claims and Â£283m will be used to repay about 590,000 mortgage holders. The bank had already put away an extra Â£350m this year to cover PPI costs. It came as Lloyds posted half-year pre-tax profits,externalof Â£2.5bn, 4% higher than last year. The results are the first since the government sold its stake in the bank. The repayment to mortgage customers comes after they were charged from 2009 to 2016 for going into arrears. The Financial Conduct Authority had been investigating the issue, concluding that the charges should not have been applied as the bank did not always do enough to understand customers' circumstances and check that their arrears payment plans were affordable and sustainable. The FCA says Lloyds will refund all fees charged for arrears management and broken payment arrangements, and it will also pay any litigation fees that were applied unfairly to customers who were involved in related legal action. On top of that, it will also offer payments for potential distress and inconvenience. The bank will itself approach customers to prompt them to make a claim. Lloyds became the UK's biggest force in personal banking as a result of its absorption of HBOS - the former Halifax and Bank of Scotland - at the height of the financial crisis and was bailed out by the government at a cost of about Â£20bn. Lloyds is also having to compensate some of its small business customers, who suffered as a result of widespread fraud at its former HBOS branch in Reading. Victims saw their businesses taken over by so-called specialists recommended by the branch between the years 2003-07. These ""specialists"" destroyed a number of the businesses, squandering the money they made on prostitutes and luxury holidays. Lloyds is in the process of paying compensation to the victims of the fraud, for which it set aside Â£100m in the first quarter. It is also currently undertaking a review of what happened. It is the PPI mis-selling scandal, though, that dwarfs all others. Lloyds has now increased provisions for claims some 17 times. Its chief financial officer, George Culmer, said it was ""disappointing"" to be having to do it again. He also offered no guarantee that there would be no further increases in provisions, although he did say the number ""looked appropriate in terms of covering us between now and August 2019"". Lloyds alone has now set aside Â£18bn. In total, UK lenders have been forced to set aside more than Â£30bn to cover PPI compensation costs. PPI became controversial after it was revealed that many customers had been sold it without understanding that the cost was being added to their loan repayments. PPI claims deadline is announced Lloyds under fire over fraud payouts Lloyds Â£20bn bailout 'has been repaid' The bank's chief executive, Antonio Horta-Osario, said of the various pots of money set aside for customer redress: ""We have a commitment as a management team of putting these legacy charges behind us as soon as possible."" He admitted, though, that there would ""always be redress costs"" when running a banking business. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said that despite the size of the provisions for the various types of misconduct, Lloyds' performance was satisfactory. ""It's a sign of Lloyds' strength that it can shrug off Â£1.6bn of misconduct charges to post a strong rise in profits,"" he said. ""Overall, this is a strong set of numbers from Lloyds, blighted, but not overshadowed, by misconduct costs. The government has exited the bank and is now no longer selling stock in the market, which removes a significant downward pressure on the share price."" The government had been steadily offloading its Lloyds stake, resulting in about Â£21bn being returned to the taxpayer. The government still owns 73% of Royal Bank of Scotland, which was rescued with Â£45.5bn of taxpayers' cash during the crisis in the world's biggest bank bailout.

Madonna accepts damages from Mail,"The article appeared before the adoption process was completed Madonna and her adopted twin daughters have accepted undisclosed damages from Associated Newspapers over a ""serious invasion of privacy"". The singer adopted four-year-old twins Stella and Estere in February. At the time sheasked the mediato ""respect our privacy during this transitional time."" Madonna brought the case at London's High Court over a MailOnline article that caused her ""considerable personal distress"", her solicitor said. The article - which appeared in January, before Madonna had formally adopted the twins - revealed the girls' names, race and age. It also disclosed the fact they lived in an orphanage in Malawi and were the subject of pending applications for adoption by the singer. The singer was pictured this month with the twins and her other children, David and Mercy ""The MailOnline published it at a time when, as the journalist ought to have appreciated, Madonna would be powerless to protect the girls from harm,"" solicitor Jenny Afia told Mrs Justice Nicola Davies on Thursday. ""Their actions could, in her view, have threatened the integrity and/or outcome of the adoption process which would have had potentially life-changing implications for the girls, as well as for Madonna and her family."" ""Many people in Malawi know of Madonna as an individual of fame and financial means,"" she went on. ""In the circumstances, Madonna believes that it would (and should) have been self-evident to the reporter that the protection of the girls' identities pending the decision about their potential adoption was likely to be vital for their safety and welfare."" This video can not be played Madonna recently opened a children's hospital in Malawi After the hearing, Ms Afia said: ""Madonna brought this litigation because the newspaper threatened her girls' safety by naming them before they were adopted. ""She will always take all possible steps to protect her family's well-being."" Ms Afia added that Madonna would donate the damages to The Mercy James Institute for Paediatric Surgery.

'My stomach dropped': Transgender troops hit by ban,"President Trump addresses US military personnel in Italy in May Drill sergeant Kennedy Ochoa was putting on his dress uniform when he heard the news. President Trump had fired off a series of tweets saying the country would no longer ""accept or allow"" transgender Americans to serve in the military, citing ""tremendous medical costs and disruption"". This was not the way it was supposed to go. For more than a year Sergeant Ochoa had served as a man, following an Obama-era policy change that paved the way for transgender troops to serve openly. Announcing the change, then-defence secretary Ash Carter called it ""the right thing to do"" for ""talented Americans who are serving with distinction"". Many transgender troops came out to their commanders and their colleagues and won the support of both. Trump: Transgender people can't serve in military Delays leave transgender military in limbo The secret life of a transgender airman On Wednesday morning, Sergeant Ochoa was proudly putting on his uniform - the male regulation dress blues he has been allowed to wear for a year - and preparing to graduate from a training course that puts him on track for a promotion in September. Then he saw the president's tweets. ""It was heartbreaking, my stomach dropped,"" he said in a phone interview. ""I had to just try and compartmentalise it so I could enjoy today."" Sergeant Ochoa is unwavering in his desire to continue serving his country. In five days he is due to re-enlist. ""Now I don't even know if I can do that,"" he said. ""It just seems like chaos, so many unknowns."" Sergeant Ken Ochoa is due to re-enlist in five days but now does not know if he can It wasn't just service members that were caught by surprise, the timing of the announcement appeared to wrong-foot the military too. A spokeswoman for the Department of Defense (DOD) referred all questions to the White House, saying only that new guidance would be issued soon. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. At a news conference, President Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration would work with the DOD to iron out the details. ""I would imagine the Department of Defense will be the lead on that,"" she said. For some, the fallout from the president's tweets was more certain. Riley Dosh trained for four years at the West Point military academy, graduating in May this year. Ms Dosh came out as transgender while at the academy. She was secure in her decision following the Obama-era policy change and she had the full support of her commanders. Then, earlier this month, she was abruptly told she would not be allowed to commission as an officer alongside her peers. Back at home in Austin, Texas, with no employment and no health insurance, she was awaiting a review of that decision. Now it seems certain that she's headed out of the army for good. ""I was already losing hope that I could commission, now I have absolutely no reason to have any,"" she said. ""It's a final nail in the coffin for my military career."" She would find a Plan B though, she said. The situation was worse for those already in. ""This is an absolute nightmare for my trans brothers and sisters who are serving. They now have absolutely no idea what their future is going to be."" This video can not be played Riley Dosh wanted to defend her country but now can't Mr Trump's tweets may have come out of the blue but they followed aseries of attackson transgender service by Congressional Republicans. Among them, Vicky Hartzler, Republican for Missouri, introduced an amendment to the near-$700bn armed forces funding bill - currently before congress - which sought to bar any military funds from being used for transgender medical care. The amendment narrowly failed, but Mr Trump's tweets echoed Ms Hartzler in citing supposedly burdensome costs of transgender medical care - a concern which has riled Republican lawmakers. An authoritative 2016 study by the Rand Corporation suggests the concern is unfounded. The study estimated that transgender health care costs for the estimated 2,450 active duty transgender troops would increase the health budget by between $2.4m and $8.4m annually - just 0.04% to 0.13% of the overall healthcare budget. By comparison, the Pentagon spends about $84m annually on erectile dysfunction medication, according to aMilitary Times analysis,external- 10 times the upper estimate for transgender related costs. Many active duty service members are already undergoing medical care related to transition. Sergeant Ochoa receives hormone therapy from his army physician, and was anticipating having a hysterectomy to lower the risk of cervical cancer created by testosterone. It was unclear on Wednesday whether he would be able to continue with his treatment through the army, whether he would be forced to revert to female dress regulations, or if he could continue his army career at all. ""The thought of going back to serving as someone I'm not... It's just not something I could do and stay true to my character,"" he said. A military pride parade in San Diego last week LGBT advocacy groups were blindsided, and outraged, by the president's sudden announcement. ""This is a despicable assault on transgender troops who have been serving openly for more than a year,"" said Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Centre, a think tank which studies gender and sexuality in the military. ""You can't force people to go back in the closet, and you can't force them to serve on the basis of a lie if they've already been honest about their identity. It's unworkable for the troops and it's unworkable for the military, and it will compromise military readiness."" Matthew Thorn, executive director of OutServe, warned that discharging thousands of active duty troops would would cause chaos and resentment. ""The most important thing for service members is that the person sitting on their right and their left has their back, particularly in a wartime situation,"" he said. ""When you start stripping away those people, that's what disrupts unit cohesion."" For those actively serving, who came out as transgender with an understanding from their commanders, and from President Obama, that they would no longer be discriminated against, the future is once again clouded by prejudice. For Sergeant Ochoa, the only sensible response was to put on his dress blues, go to his graduation ceremony, and keep doing his job. ""The only thing I can do is carry on as best as I can, continue to be a professional and a drill sergeant to the best of my ability, and do that for as long as I have the opportunity,"" he said.

Speaking of the ""incredibly skilled doctors and paramedics"" he has worked with, the prince said: ""These experiences have instilled in me a profound respect for the men and women who serve in our emergency services, which I hope to continue to champion even as I leave the profession. ""I am hugely grateful for having had this experience."" Pilot William Wales, as he is known at work, receives a salary for his job which he donates in full back to the EAAA charity. The duke said he was ""proud to have served with such an incredible team of people"" Speaking with colleagues about incidents he had attended was the ""best way of dealing"" with the ""dark moments"", Prince William said While on duty, he works as part of a close-knit team of four, on a nine-and-a-half hour shift, attending the worst medical emergencies of the 2,000-plus calls per day the service receives. As a prince and as a future king, William has worn and will wear plenty of uniforms. But the flight suit he'll hang up after his last shift has particular significance. For two years it's been his ""passport"" to a life where, on merit, he helped people save lives. This after all is a man who wishes that when he was younger he could have done more to protect his mother. He has been exposed to the National Health Service in a way that no other senior royal has been or possibly ever will be. It's an experience he is determined will shape his future. The words the East Anglian Air Ambulance has used to describe the pilot prince are warm, not perfunctory. They are losing someone they call ""much-loved"", ""hard-working"" and a ""wonderful character"". William is losing something he's cherished - working in a team. A lonelier destiny, which he's put on hold for so long, now beckons. More from Peter Hunt... The air ambulance charity has attended patients injured by fires, horseback riding accidents, poisoning and road traffic accidents. ""There are some very sad, dark moments. We talk about it a lot, and that's the best way of dealing with some of these situations,"" Prince William revealed in September. He pilots a H-145 helicopter, which has a maximum speed of 145 knots (170mph) and can be on the scene of an incident in East Anglia within a matter of minutes. The prince received a salary for his job which he donated in full back to the EAAA charity William has been an ""integral part"" of the service, Patrick Peal, chief executive of EAAA, said. ""He is not only a fantastic pilot, but a much-loved and valued member of the crew. He will be truly missed by everyone at EAAA. ""William... has been a true professional, delivering our doctors and critical care paramedics to patients under testing conditions,"" he added. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, whose family home has been in Anmer, Norfolk, have taken up residence in Kensington Palace ahead of their eldest child, Prince George, starting school in September. A statement issued in January by the palace, said the pair wanted to increase their official duties on behalf of the Queen and their charity work - which would mean more time in London. ""As I hang up my flight suit, I am proud to have served with such an incredible team of people, who save lives across the region every day,"" Prince William told the EDP.

Football 'in dark ages' over homophobia,"This video can not be played Gareth Thomas tackled homophobia in football in a 2017 investigation for the BBC Football risks ""being left in the dark ages"" unless more is done to tackle homophobia in the game, ex-Wales rugby star Gareth Thomas has said. Thomascame out as gay in 2009,externalafter hiding his sexuality for years. He admittedit almost drove him to suicideafter his wife Jemma left him when he told her the truth. Thomas said unless homophobia in football was ""policed as stringently as racism is policed, then it will always be a problem"". Thursday marks50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexualitybetween men aged 21 and over in England and Wales. Gareth Thomas was capped 100 times for Wales The former Cardiff Blues player looked at the issue in a documentary for BBC Wales. There have been no openly gay professional footballers in the top four divisions since former Norwich striker Justin Fashanu in 1990, who killed himself in 1998. Thomas spoke to Amal Fashanu, Justin's niece,who made a documentary on the issue in 2012. ""In that five years, from talking to her, absolutely nothing has changed,"" he said. A spokesman for the FA said the governing body was ""committed to tackling homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in football at every level of the game"". Robbie Rogers, who plays for LA Galaxy, came out after leaving English football Wales' governing body - the FAW - has been asked for comment. In recent years, ex-Aston Villa midfielderThomas Hitzlspergerand former Leeds United and United States playerRobbie Rogershave revealed they are gay. Hitzlsperger had retired and Rogers plays in the US' Major League Soccer. In 2015, 2% of UK menidentified as gay or bisexual,externalbut none of the approximately 5,000 professional footballers have publicly come out. Thomas said they would be ""walking into the unknown"" as governing bodies had not done enough ""to create an environment for a player to feel like he can be himself"". While great efforts have been made to tackle racism, Thomas said homophobia was not treated as seriously. He spoke to a steward who had thrown out a fan for using racist language and asked him if he would have done the same had he used a gay slur. ""His honest answer, which is the truth of it, was very much the case he doubts it would have been,"" he said. Gareth Thomas is known as Alfie by Welsh rugby fans While those throughout the game have supported efforts to rid football of racism, Thomas said ""you'll struggle to get a single player to openly talk about his support against homophobia because he stands the backlash of guilt by association. ""It does feel like football is not ready for it. If a player is ready it could be a great success or it could be a great disaster. ""I think they need reassurance that everything will be OK and they'll be judged on their footballing ability and not their sexuality."" The FA said it worked with leagues, LGBT clubs and campaign groups to sanction and educate perpetrators of abuse and encouraged ""players to be themselves and support their teammates to do likewise"". Thomas said while there was ""no excuse"" for homophobic language, he thought some fans singing anti-gay chants felt ""they can be somebody who, on the outside of that stadium, would be somebody that they might look down their nose at"". He believes change must come from the top of the game: ""Unless football wants to be left behind in the dark ages then it has to [improve]. ""But until it's policed as stringently as racism is policed, then it will always be a problem."" Alfie v Homophobia: Hate in the beautiful game, BBC One Wales, Thursday, 21:00 BST Sport 'must do more' to fight homophobia Most fans 'would welcome gay players' 'No better time for players to come out' Openly gay players 'would get abuse' At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Tories 'wrong' on gay rights in past - PM,"The Conservative Party has been ""wrong"" on gay rights in the past - but can be proud of the role it has played in recent years, Theresa May has said. Speaking to websitePinknews,externalto mark 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in England and Wales, the PM said she and the party had both ""come a long way"". TheSexual Offences Act was introduced on 27 July 1967,external. It decriminalised homosexual acts in private between men aged 21 and over. Mrs May said: ""I am proud of the role my party has played in recent years in advocating a Britain which seeks to end discrimination on the grounds of sexuality or gender identity, but I acknowledge where we have been wrong on these issues in the past."" Tories won't 'go backwards' on gay rights I was sent for 'gay cure'' Thousands of gay men pardoned in UK As an MP in 1998, Mrs May voted against reducing the age of consent for homosexual acts from 18 to 16 and four years later opposed allowing gay couples to adopt. This video can not be played Comedian and radio presenter Peter Price: I was sent for 'gay cure' Mrs May was also absent for several votes affecting LGBT rights - but in 2004 backed civil partnerships, and as a member of the coalition government supported a succession of measures including same sex-marriages. In a separate article, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Pinknews that the anniversary was a time to ""recognise the great strides towards equality that have been made"". He said: ""I am proud of the role the Labour Party played in these advances... but this progress is not down to MPs in Parliament... these achievements belong first and foremost to the LGBT community who have persevered against prejudice for many years."" Roger Lockyer, who began a gay relationship the year before the law changed, said the reforms offered ""a very limited concession"" but did improve gay men's lives. He told BBC Radio 5Live: ""Initially many of us thought it won't make any difference, but it made an enormous difference. ""It made one feel one was walking tall and that the big barriers that had been there forever were gradually beginning to dissolve."" Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said the 1967 legislation was ""progress"" but the remaining laws, such as gross indecency, were ""policed more aggressively than before"". He said: ""Don't be misled by the celebrations on 27 July... The law continued to discriminate homosexual men post-1967."" The government announced in September 2016 that gay and bisexual men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences in England and Waleswould receive posthumous pardons. It followedthe pardoning of World War Two code-breaker Alan Turingfor gross indecency in 2013. The amendment, dubbed the ""Turing law"", led to about49,000 men being clearedof crimes of which they would be innocent today. Partners Somchai Phukkhlai and George Montague set up a petition for a government apology Thousands more living men who convicted over consensual same-sex relationships are also eligible for the pardon. But some campaigners want an apology from the government, not a pardon. George Montague, convicted in 1974 of gross indecency, said: ""I want an apology to the whole of the gay community for the persecution of us, for so many years. ""The police went out of their way to catch us and persecute and prosecute us. ""What I say is I didn't ask to be gay, I didn't choose to be gay, I was born that way. The law of gross indecency should never have been brought in."" On 27 July 1967, the Sexual Offences Act was passed. It was the first significant liberalisation of gay law in English history. Female homosexuality had never been a criminal offence. The legislation stated that ""a homosexual act in private shall not be an offence provided that the parties consent thereto and have attained the age of 21 years"". It has been called the decriminalisation of homosexuality, although many more changes have been made since to improve gay men's rights. Scotland passed similar reforms in 1980, with Northern Ireland the last country in the United Kingdom to do so in 1982.

Fatal ride accident at Ohio State Fair,"This video can not be played Riders were catapulted into the air, witnesses said One person has been killed and several injured after an accident on a ride at the Ohio State Fair. Fire chief Steve Martin told local media outlets that victims were thrown from the ""fireball"" spinning pendulum ride in the city of Columbus. Three of the injured are in a critical condition, officials said. State Governor John Kasich confirmed at least one death, and said he had ordered all fair rides shut until safety inspections were carried out. He also said a full investigation would be carried out. The fireball ride swings from side to side while simultaneously spinning passengers in circles at high speed. It is known by the name ""afterburner"" in European markets. Speaking to reporters, a doctor treating some victims said: ""Passengers were ejected at high speed with high energy, many feet - at least 20 or 30, if not more - into the air, and then crashed at a significant distance from the ride."" He said the speed of the impact could be similar to a vehicle crash. A video circulating online appeared to show one passenger carriage breaking loose near the bottom of its pendulum swing, tossing passengers into the air as it rose again. The video has not been independently verified. The state fair confirmed on Twitter that there was ""a report of a ride incident"" but provided no further details. Local NBC affiliate WCMH reported that one of the injured is a 13-year-old child. Multiple local news outlets have said the deceased is an 18-year-old. The accident took place on Wednesday evening, the opening day of the fair. TheColumbus Dispatch reported,externalthat safety inspections of the rides had taken place earlier in the week. Chief inspector Mike Vartorella said: ""My grandchildren ride this equipmentâ¦ our guys do not rush through this stuff. We look at it, we take care of it, we pretend it's our own."" He said the ride was inspected ""three or four times"" in the past two days by both his own inspectors and a ""third party"".

Teenager found 'electrocuted' on tracks,"Taiyah Peebles was with friends just before she died A 16-year-old girl has been found dead on the tracks at a railway station. Officers said Taiyah Peebles was with friends near Herne Bay station in Kent shortly before 23:00 BST on Tuesday. The teenager was injured between then and 07:00 on Wednesday, when she was confirmed dead by emergency crews. She is believed to have been electrocuted, but Detective Chief Inspector Paul Langley from British Transport Police said her family were desperate for answers. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of this young girl as they try to come to terms with this awful news. ""We have deployed specially trained officers to the family to provide them with support."" More on this story and other news from Kent Tributes have been left at Herne Bay station He added: ""Understandably the family are now desperate for answers and my officers are focused on understanding how this girl came to be on the tracks."" Taiyah's death is being treated as unexplained while officers look into the circumstances, he said. A post-mortem examination is due to take place on Friday but police said Taiyah suffered serious injuries, believed to have been caused by electrocution.

Grenfell Tower to be covered up,"The deconstruction of the tower is expected to begin towards the end of 2018 Grenfell Tower will be covered in a protective wrap to help with forensic investigations, the site manager says. Michael Lockwood told a public meeting on Wednesday that the charred building, in North Kensington in London, would be covered in August. He said that he expected the demolition of the tower block, where at least 80 people died in the fire on 14 June, would begin ""towards the end of 2018"". He added that some possessions could be retrieved from 33 of the block's flats. Speaking at the Notting Hill Methodist Church, Mr Lockwood said the recovery operation tower block could last until November this year. Grenfell cladding fails official fire test Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Reality Check: What happened to Grenfell donations? Messages from the tower A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower The criminal investigation into the building - which requires material to be collected - could go on until January. The covering of the 24-storey tower block will use scaffolding, which Mr Lockwood said would aid workers in demolishing the building. Workers continue to comb through tonnes of debris from the site for remains and evidence He said: ""I think that to be honest, the building will stay up throughout 2018. ""Then towards the end of 2018, I think we could start to bring it down, if that is what the community wants, and the scaffolding will help us to do that because we can do that within the wrap."" Any decision on what happens to the site after its deconstruction would be made with input from the community, he added. Some flats in the building remain ""completely untouched and in perfect condition"" he said, while others are devastated. There are some 33 flats in the block from which some possessions could be retrieved and returned to residents ""in the next week or so"", he added. Members of various churches attended the memorial service A memorial service for five of the residents who perished in the fire was held at St Helen's Church in North Kensington. The service, attended by the Archbishop of York, remembered artist Khadiya Saye and her mother Mary Mendy, Berktki Haftom and her 12-year-old son Beruk, and a five-year-old boy called Isaac. Meanwhile,experts who recovered remains after the 9/11 attackin New York are helping police investigators comb through debris from the fire.

Confusion over Trump's transgender ban,"This video can not be played Riley Dosh explains why she wants to defend her country The White House has not yet decided how it will implement the president's ban on transgender people serving in the US military. Mr Trump's surprise Twitter announcement on Wednesday has been met with criticism from rights groups. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration would work alongside the Pentagon to decide how to proceed. It is not yet clear how the announcement will affect current transgender service personnel. Transgender service members have expressed concern that they will be discharged, or unable to re-enlist. The timing also appears to have caught defence officials by surprise. ""The United States government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US military,"" Donald Trump tweeted. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" He added that the decision came ""after consultation with my Generals and military experts"". Some US media outlets have questioned the spending justification. The Washington Post drew attentionto an analysis,externalthat the US military spends almost $42m (Â£32m) a year on the erectile dysfunction medication Viagra - several times the total estimated cost of transgender medical support. Asked at a press briefing if troops on battlefields would be immediately sent back, Ms Huckabee Sanders said the policy had yet to be worked out. ""The decision is based on a military decision. It's not meant to be anything more than that,"" she said. On Wednesday, the defence department referred all queries to the White House. Defence Secretary James Mattis was only told of the decision after Mr Trump made his announcement. However, Ms Huckabee Sanders said: ""This was something that was the product of consultation."" Transgender troops react to ban Why does the US military buy so much Viagra? Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America Reporter Different stance - on the campaign trail last year The timing of this transgender ban is almost as interesting as the move itself. Why now? With the Trump administration being buffeted by the Jeff Sessions political death watch, the ongoing multi-prong investigation into the Trump campaign, the healthcare drama in the Senate and the impending Russian sanctions bill, perhaps the administration decided this was a good time to change the subject and rally conservative forces to his side. Republicans have long used cultural issues as a wedge to divide Democrats and energise evangelicals. While Mr Trump campaigned as sympathetic to LGBT rights, he needs the traditional religious conservatives to stay loyal to him now, more than ever. The independent Rand Corporation estimates that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender, although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000. The Obama administration announced last year that transgender people would be allowed to serve openly in the military. Many active duty members came out following the decision. Then-defence secretary Ash Carter also set a deadline of one year for the various branches of the military to begin accepting transgender recruits. The secret life of a transgender airman This video can not be played Being transgender in the US military - Jamie Ewing spoke to the BBC in 2016 However in June, Mr Mattis agreed to a further six-month delay. The Obama-era policy had included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender. Rand predicted that the inclusion of transgender people in the military would lead to a 0.13% increase in healthcare spending - approximately $8.4m. UK chiefs praise transgender troops Trump revokes transgender toilet rules Transgender troops expressed dismay over the ban. Army reservist Rudy Akbariantold a news conference: ""The discrimination I'm facing now is from those outside the military - not the people who work with me."" He said that ""not everyone responded well after learning I was transitioning. But after spending time on missions and realising we all share the same love for the country, we worked together and got the job done."" Meanwhile,Kristin Beck,a retired elite Navy SEAL,told Business Insider,externalthat ""being transgender doesn't affect anyone else"" and that during her decorated military career, she had been ""defending individual liberty"". ""If you can't defend that for everyone that's an American citizen, that's not right."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Several defence professionals also questioned the decision. Former Defence Secretary Ash Cartersaid: ""To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military."" Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,Republican John McCain,said: ""Any American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving."" Several British military generals condemned Mr Trump's decision, including the commander of the UK Maritime Forces,Rear Admiral Alex Burton, who said: ""We have a justifiably rigorous selection process but it doesn't include discrimination and we're a better fighting force for it"". However, supporters said the cost of transgender surgeries should not be funded by the military. ""Each dollar needs to be spent to address threats facing our nation,""Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, a long-time opponent of the Obama administration's position, said. Trump supporter andpolitical commentator Scott Preslersaid he disagreed with the ban but had confidence in the advice Mr Trump had received from generals, adding: ""I don't think for a second he's prejudiced.""

The plant, to be located in Wisconsin, is expected to make LCD panels and employ 3,000 people initially. President Donald Trump, claimed credit for Foxconn's ""incredible investment"" which he said would not have happened if he had not been elected. Foxconn has been promised $3bn in subsidies which would come from the state of Wisconsin. The firm's chief executive, Terry Gou, made the announcement at the White House in Washington on Wednesday. However he did not give details of when construction would begin or identify where the site would be precisely. President Trump, who met Mr Gou to discuss the subject and suggested Wisconsin as a location, took credit for the investment during a press conference. ""To make such an incredible investment, Chairman Gou put his faith and confidence in the future of the American economy,"" the President said. ""In other words, if I didn't get elected, he definitely would not be spending $10 billion."" During the election campaign Donald Trump focused much of his rhetoric on reviving the US manufacturing sector and ""making America great again"". Foxconn is part of Hon Hai Precision Industry, one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, with about 1 million employees globally and revenue of more than $100 billion in 2016. The firm has invested heavily in automating its production and works with a variety of companies, including Apple, Tesla and BMW. Foxconn said it employs about 3,000 people in the US currently, including at sites in Indiana and Virginia. But a big investment announced in Pennsylvania has not materialised. The Wisconsin facility, which Foxconn said could be the first of many investments, marks its biggest expansion into the US yet. But some observers questioned the business rationale. ""This is clearly a response by Foxconn to pressure from the administration,"" said Willy Shih, a professor at the Harvard Business School. Mr Shih said even with the subsidies, the firm faces a challenge since additional supply will keep pressure on prices and many of the other parts required for the screens and factory aren't made in the US. ""Can they make it work? I'm sure they can... The question is, what do the economics looks like? How much money are they willing to lose getting there?"" At the press conference Mr Gou said his goal is to jumpstart a new manufacturing ecosystem in the US. The  liquid crystal display panels could be used for televisions, self-driving cars and other products. Foxconn earlier this year said it was exploring possible locations for an investment, sparking fierce competition among different states to win the facility. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said his state is preparing a package worth $3bn to secure Foxconn's commitment. Further details were not immediately available, but the scale of the incentives has raised eyebrows locally. Governor Walker said the promise of the campus, which could one day employ as many as 13,000 people and cover 20 million square feet, was worth it. ""This is exciting and transformational,"" he said. The plant is planned for south eastern Wisconsin, a part of the state not far from Chicago and Milwaukee. The state, which has historically leaned Democratic, is politically important for President Trump. He won the state by less than 25,000 votes in the 2016 election. Republican Paul Ryan, who leads his party in the House of Representatives, represents the area. Other members of the White House also have ties. The state has seen the number of manufacturing jobs shrink by almost a quarter since 2000, but its economy has remained strong. Wisconsin's unemployment rate is estimated at 3.1%, lower than the US average. ""All of those locations are bouncing back and having Foxconn in the midst of that â¦ is really going to be helpful,"" said Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council. ""This helps round out the story.""

Grenfell cladding fails official fire test,"An official test of the types of materials used at Grenfell Tower suggest that designs like that used in the tower's cladding are fundamentally flawed, Newsnight can reveal. A so-called ""fire test"" is intended to establish whether a design would withstand fire if installed perfectly. The Grenfell cladding has been blamed for the fire's rapid spread. The local government department stated they aimed to ""publish results as soon as possible"". This test is the first full-scale test of the combination of insulation and cladding of the types used at Grenfell. The test involves setting a fire underneath a large-scale mock-up of the insulation system in a fire laboratory. Previous tests have only sought to establish what types of materials have been installed on high-rises across England. This test is the first in a series that is intended to work out which combinations of materials can safely be installed together and which cannot. This video can not be played Chris Cook: ""The test was an absolute failure"" The test result makes it more likely that the choice of materials in use at Grenfell Tower, rather than poor installation of the cladding, was to blame for the fire's spread across the face of the building. People familiar with the results stated that it also supports the conclusion that the cladding was the critical component that spread the fire. This test, conducted by the Building Research Establishment near Watford, will be followed by five others, each of which will use a differentcombination of insulation and exterior aluminiumpanelling. This first test used a so-called PIR plastic foam, a type of combustible insulation, and aluminium panels with a combustible polyethylene plastic core. This is the most flammable of the six combinations of insulation and exterior cladding that will be tested. While other buildings with this combination have been identified,  this specific combination of PIR foam and polyethylene-core cladding is not currently believed to be in widespread use. Most buildings that have been found to have suspect cladding will not be installed with this combination of materials. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""We've already issued practical advice so that landlords can make properties safe for residents, and our priority now is informing landlords of the latest results so that they can take any further actions that are necessary."" The test rig at the BRE before the alumnium cladding was installed, showing the interior design of the cladding. The silver foil covers the insulation. The vertical yellow stripes are firebreaks intended to stop the fire moving horizontally. The black stripes are firebreaks designed to stop vertical fire spread This test result, however, raises major questions about why this combination of materials was actually signed off by building control officers. The fire test conducted by the BRE is a standard test which is designed to establish whether a specific combination of materials, installed in a specified fashion, will be safe during a fire. If developers wish to use combustible material on the exterior of tall buildings, it is supposed to be on the basis of data from such a test. Newsnight has, however, previously revealed how developers have installed combustible elements on tall buildings without having tested the components. They cancommission engineers to write reportsarguing that the material is functionally similar to material that has already been tested. Or, in one case, Newsnight found building inspectors willing to sign off material of the same combustibility as at Grenfellwithout even that level of evidence. The publication of this test makes it impossible for this design and combination of materials to be used in future without it passing a further test. Fire test rig used at the BRE, with reporter for scale Newsnight has also previously revealed concerns about the adequacy of the testing regime - not least becausetest data is usually confidentialand therefore difficult for fire safety officials to scrutinise. The test is also conducted on a test bed which has been installed slowly by cladding engineers over several days. In reality,material may be installed hastily, and may be damaged in installation or use in ways that reduce their fire safety. Newsnight has also revealed that the government has begun work on a review of building standards. The decision reflects official alarm at the state of building safety in the wake of last month's Grenfell Tower fire, in which at least 80 people died. As results of checks on tall buildings have come in, civil servants have expressed shock at how the official rulebooks have been interpreted. They remain unclear whether the problem is the rules or their enforcement.

Government looks at post-Brexit migration,"This video can not be played Amber Rudd on 'implementation phase' Free movement of people between the EU and UK will end in March 2019, UK government ministers have said. From that date EU workers moving to the UK will have to register, at least until a permanent post-Brexit immigration policy is put in place. But Home Secretary Amber Rudd has sought to reassure business there will not be a ""cliff edge"" in terms of employing foreign workers after Brexit. She said policy would be evidence-based and take into account economic impact. The CBI said businesses ""urgently"" needed to know what EU migration would look like, both in any ""transitional"" period after March 2019 and beyond. David Davis plays down trade talks delay claims Reality Check: Migration to the UK All you need to know about Brexit McDonnell not ruling out single market membership UK and EU still split on citizens' rights Immigration was one of the central topics of last year's EU referendum campaign, and ministers have promised to ""take back control"" of the UK's borders as they negotiate Brexit. The UK is currently due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, but there has been increasing talk of a ""transitional"" (or ""implementation"") stage of around two years to smooth the Brexit process. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Home Office minister Brandon Lewis said details of how the government would manage immigration after Brexit would be revealed in a white paper later this year, and that the immigration bill would go through Parliament in 2018. This video can not be played Freedom of movement will end ""in the spring of 2019"", immigration minister Brandon Lewis tells Today Mr Lewis said it was a ""simple matter of fact"" that EU free movement rules would not apply after 2019. More detail of what would happen was later provided by the home secretary, with Ms Rudd, speaking during a visit to Troon, South Ayrshire, saying the ""implementation phase"" would involve new EU workers registering their details when they come to the UK. She also said the government had promised an ""extensive"" consultation to listen to the views of businesses, unions and universities. The Home Office has asked the Migration Advisory Committee to study the ""economic and social costs and benefits of EU migration to the UK economy"", its impact on competitiveness, and whether there would be benefits to focusing migration on high-skilled jobs. It is due to report back by September 2018 - six months before Brexit. The home secretary said: ""We will ensure we continue to attract those who benefit us economically, socially and culturally. ""But, at the same time, our new immigration system will give us control of the volume of people coming here - giving the public confidence we are applying our own rules on who we want to come to the UK and helping us to bring down net migration to sustainable levels."" This video can not be played I'm ""flabbergasted"" it has taken 13 months to ask ""basic questions"" about EU migration, says Yvette Cooper Speaking in Sydney, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was unaware of the report that has been commissioned, adding that immigration had been ""fantastic for the energy and dynamism of the economy"" but ""that doesn't mean that you can't control it"". For Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said there was ""far too much heat and not enough light about immigration, so any truly objective and well-informed analysis must be welcome"". But she raised concerns about the timescale for the Migration Advisory Committee report: ""Six months before Brexit will not be enough time to structure a new immigration system."" Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said the move would ""do nothing to reassure the hospitals that are already seeing record numbers of EU nurses leaving, or the companies struggling to recruit the staff they need"". ""The NHS, businesses and universities that depend on European citizens need answers now, not in another 14 months' time,"" he added. This video can not be played Johnson asked about EU migration study The CBI said commissioning the report was a ""sensible first step"", adding: ""Workers from across Europe strengthen our businesses and help our public services run more smoothly - any new migration system should protect these benefits while restoring public confidence."" But the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, said it was ""staggering"" that it had taken the government a year since the EU referendum to commission it. And property developer Richard Tice, co-chairman of Leave Means Leave, told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""This commission should be reporting by this Christmas, not by next September. It's completely unacceptable for this to drag on ... the government needs to rapidly accelerate this."" Manufacturers' organisation EEF said the migration committee was ""best placed"" to advise on what EU migration should look like after Brexit. Both EEF and the CBI called for an immediate resolution of the question of the status of EU nationals already living in the UK.

Lloyds sets aside another Â£700m for PPI,"Lloyds Banking Group has set aside another Â£1bn to cover the cost of insurance mis-selling and the treatment of mortgage customers. Of that, Â£700m will cover payment protection insurance (PPI) claims and Â£283m will be used to repay about 590,000 mortgage holders. The bank had already put away an extra Â£350m this year to cover PPI costs. It came as Lloyds posted half-year pre-tax profits,externalof Â£2.5bn, 4% higher than last year. The results are the first since the government sold its stake in the bank. The repayment to mortgage customers comes after they were charged from 2009 to 2016 for going into arrears. The Financial Conduct Authority had been investigating the issue, concluding that the charges should not have been applied as the bank did not always do enough to understand customers' circumstances and check that their arrears payment plans were affordable and sustainable. The FCA says Lloyds will refund all fees charged for arrears management and broken payment arrangements, and it will also pay any litigation fees that were applied unfairly to customers who were involved in related legal action. On top of that, it will also offer payments for potential distress and inconvenience. The bank will itself approach customers to prompt them to make a claim. Lloyds became the UK's biggest force in personal banking as a result of its absorption of HBOS - the former Halifax and Bank of Scotland - at the height of the financial crisis and was bailed out by the government at a cost of about Â£20bn. Lloyds is also having to compensate some of its small business customers, who suffered as a result of widespread fraud at its former HBOS branch in Reading. Victims saw their businesses taken over by so-called specialists recommended by the branch between the years 2003-07. These ""specialists"" destroyed a number of the businesses, squandering the money they made on prostitutes and luxury holidays. Lloyds is in the process of paying compensation to the victims of the fraud, for which it set aside Â£100m in the first quarter. It is also currently undertaking a review of what happened. It is the PPI mis-selling scandal, though, that dwarfs all others. Lloyds has now increased provisions for claims some 17 times. Its chief financial officer, George Culmer, said it was ""disappointing"" to be having to do it again. He also offered no guarantee that there would be no further increases in provisions, although he did say the number ""looked appropriate in terms of covering us between now and August 2019"". Lloyds alone has now set aside Â£18bn. In total, UK lenders have been forced to set aside more than Â£30bn to cover PPI compensation costs. PPI became controversial after it was revealed that many customers had been sold it without understanding that the cost was being added to their loan repayments. PPI claims deadline is announced Lloyds under fire over fraud payouts Lloyds Â£20bn bailout 'has been repaid' The bank's chief executive, Antonio Horta-Osario, said of the various pots of money set aside for customer redress: ""We have a commitment as a management team of putting these legacy charges behind us as soon as possible."" He admitted, though, that there would ""always be redress costs"" when running a banking business. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said that despite the size of the provisions for the various types of misconduct, Lloyds' performance was satisfactory. ""It's a sign of Lloyds' strength that it can shrug off Â£1.6bn of misconduct charges to post a strong rise in profits,"" he said. ""Overall, this is a strong set of numbers from Lloyds, blighted, but not overshadowed, by misconduct costs. The government has exited the bank and is now no longer selling stock in the market, which removes a significant downward pressure on the share price."" The government had been steadily offloading its Lloyds stake, resulting in about Â£21bn being returned to the taxpayer. The government still owns 73% of Royal Bank of Scotland, which was rescued with Â£45.5bn of taxpayers' cash during the crisis in the world's biggest bank bailout.

Hospital missed diet pill overdose,"This video can not be played Bethany Shipsey's mother is critical of the hospital care the 21-year-old received A young woman who had taken slimming drug DNP died after an ""overwhelmed"" hospital department failed to spot the ""potentially fatal overdose"". Bethany Shipsey, 21, was being treated at Worcestershire Royal Hospital when there were delays recognising her condition, a report has found.

Trump takes credit for Foxxconn investment,"Foxconn said it will invest $10bn over the next four years to build a new manufacturing facility in Wisconsin Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn announced plans to invest $10bn (Â£7.6bn) in a new factory in the US. The plant, to be located in Wisconsin, is expected to make LCD panels and employ 3,000 people initially. President Donald Trump, claimed credit for Foxconn's ""incredible investment"" which he said would not have happened if he had not been elected. Foxconn has been promised $3bn in subsidies which would come from the state of Wisconsin. The firm's chief executive, Terry Gou, made the announcement at the White House in Washington on Wednesday. However he did not give details of when construction would begin or identify where the site would be precisely. President Trump, who met Mr Gou to discuss the subject and suggested Wisconsin as a location, took credit for the investment during a press conference. ""To make such an incredible investment, Chairman Gou put his faith and confidence in the future of the American economy,"" the President said. ""In other words, if I didn't get elected, he definitely would not be spending $10 billion."" During the election campaign Donald Trump focused much of his rhetoric on reviving the US manufacturing sector and ""making America great again"". Foxconn is part of Hon Hai Precision Industry, one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, with about 1 million employees globally and revenue of more than $100 billion in 2016. The firm has invested heavily in automating its production and works with a variety of companies, including Apple, Tesla and BMW. Foxconn said it employs about 3,000 people in the US currently, including at sites in Indiana and Virginia. But a big investment announced in Pennsylvania has not materialised. The Wisconsin facility, which Foxconn said could be the first of many investments, marks its biggest expansion into the US yet. But some observers questioned the business rationale. ""This is clearly a response by Foxconn to pressure from the administration,"" said Willy Shih, a professor at the Harvard Business School. Mr Shih said even with the subsidies, the firm faces a challenge since additional supply will keep pressure on prices and many of the other parts required for the screens and factory aren't made in the US. ""Can they make it work? I'm sure they can... The question is, what do the economics looks like? How much money are they willing to lose getting there?"" At the press conference Mr Gou said his goal is to jumpstart a new manufacturing ecosystem in the US. The  liquid crystal display panels could be used for televisions, self-driving cars and other products. Foxconn earlier this year said it was exploring possible locations for an investment, sparking fierce competition among different states to win the facility. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said his state is preparing a package worth $3bn to secure Foxconn's commitment. Further details were not immediately available, but the scale of the incentives has raised eyebrows locally. Governor Walker said the promise of the campus, which could one day employ as many as 13,000 people and cover 20 million square feet, was worth it. ""This is exciting and transformational,"" he said. The plant is planned for south eastern Wisconsin, a part of the state not far from Chicago and Milwaukee. The state, which has historically leaned Democratic, is politically important for President Trump. He won the state by less than 25,000 votes in the 2016 election. Republican Paul Ryan, who leads his party in the House of Representatives, represents the area. Other members of the White House also have ties. The state has seen the number of manufacturing jobs shrink by almost a quarter since 2000, but its economy has remained strong. Wisconsin's unemployment rate is estimated at 3.1%, lower than the US average.

Trump welcomes 'incredible investment',"Foxconn said it will invest $10bn over the next four years to build a new manufacturing facility in Wisconsin Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn announced plans to invest $10bn (Â£7.6bn) in a new factory in the US.

Residents angry over 'crazy' drive fines,"Cars are receiving fines for parking more than 50cm from the edge of their drives Residents in a London street have criticised the council for issuing their cars with ""crazy fines"" when they are parked on private drives. Vehicles parked on drives in Roll Gardens, Gants Hill, have been ticketed as they ""slightly obstruct the road's pavement"". The short drives, built in the 1940s, mean most modern cars overhang the pavement. Redbridge Council said some residents are ""clearly obstructing the pavement"". Catherine Meletiou, a resident on the street, said the fines were ""crazy"". She added: ""It's absolute madness. If the car is not small it's going to come over the driveway and onto the footpath, there's no allowances for that."" Irshad Nabee said there had never been a problem in the area in 40 years Irshad Nabee, Roll Gardens Neighbourhood Association chairman, said: ""For the greater part of 40 years, this has not been a problem. ""But since July, we have seen a spate of parking fines. I don't know where the council expect us to park."" Local councillor Karen Packer said the residents had no warning or consultation about the issue. She suggested a potential solution was to introduce a residents only permit scheme or a temporary suspension of all ticketing in the area. ""These are hard working people and one ticket is hard for some to fit in their weekly financial budget, let alone two, three or even four in some cases."" Linda Horwood, who has lived on the street for 45 years, said she received a fine of Â£110 for the first time since moving to the area. ""It's totally unfair, and to make sure I'm not overhanging too much I'm parking my car so close to my house that I'm bashing it every time I park."" Redbridge Council said tickets could be issued for parking ""more than 50cm from the edge of the carriageway and not within a designated parking space"". A spokesman said the majority of residents in Gants Hill were ""making every effort to use the driveway space available to them and parking without causing an issue"". ""Residents have told us they are confused about the parking guidelines and we will be working with them to offer advice to avoid them receiving future fines.""

Government looks at the future of migration,"This video can not be played Amber Rudd on 'implementation phase' Free movement of people between the EU and UK will end in March 2019, UK government ministers have said. From that date EU workers moving to the UK will have to register, at least until a permanent post-Brexit immigration policy is put in place. But Home Secretary Amber Rudd has sought to reassure business there will not be a ""cliff edge"" in terms of employing foreign workers after Brexit. She said policy would be evidence-based and take into account economic impact. The CBI said businesses ""urgently"" needed to know what EU migration would look like, both in any ""transitional"" period after March 2019 and beyond. David Davis plays down trade talks delay claims Reality Check: Migration to the UK All you need to know about Brexit McDonnell not ruling out single market membership UK and EU still split on citizens' rights Immigration was one of the central topics of last year's EU referendum campaign, and ministers have promised to ""take back control"" of the UK's borders as they negotiate Brexit. The UK is currently due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, but there has been increasing talk of a ""transitional"" (or ""implementation"") stage of around two years to smooth the Brexit process. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Home Office minister Brandon Lewis said details of how the government would manage immigration after Brexit would be revealed in a white paper later this year, and that the immigration bill would go through Parliament in 2018. This video can not be played Freedom of movement will end ""in the spring of 2019"", immigration minister Brandon Lewis tells Today Mr Lewis said it was a ""simple matter of fact"" that EU free movement rules would not apply after 2019. More detail of what would happen was later provided by the home secretary, with Ms Rudd, speaking during a visit to Troon, South Ayrshire, saying the ""implementation phase"" would involve new EU workers registering their details when they come to the UK. She also said the government had promised an ""extensive"" consultation to listen to the views of businesses, unions and universities. The Home Office has asked the Migration Advisory Committee to study the ""economic and social costs and benefits of EU migration to the UK economy"", its impact on competitiveness, and whether there would be benefits to focusing migration on high-skilled jobs. It is due to report back by September 2018 - six months before Brexit. The home secretary said: ""We will ensure we continue to attract those who benefit us economically, socially and culturally. ""But, at the same time, our new immigration system will give us control of the volume of people coming here - giving the public confidence we are applying our own rules on who we want to come to the UK and helping us to bring down net migration to sustainable levels."" This video can not be played I'm ""flabbergasted"" it has taken 13 months to ask ""basic questions"" about EU migration, says Yvette Cooper Speaking in Sydney, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was unaware of the report that has been commissioned, adding that immigration had been ""fantastic for the energy and dynamism of the economy"" but ""that doesn't mean that you can't control it"". For Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said there was ""far too much heat and not enough light about immigration, so any truly objective and well-informed analysis must be welcome"". But she raised concerns about the timescale for the Migration Advisory Committee report: ""Six months before Brexit will not be enough time to structure a new immigration system."" Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said the move would ""do nothing to reassure the hospitals that are already seeing record numbers of EU nurses leaving, or the companies struggling to recruit the staff they need"". ""The NHS, businesses and universities that depend on European citizens need answers now, not in another 14 months' time,"" he added. This video can not be played Johnson asked about EU migration study The CBI said commissioning the report was a ""sensible first step"", adding: ""Workers from across Europe strengthen our businesses and help our public services run more smoothly - any new migration system should protect these benefits while restoring public confidence."" But the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, said it was ""staggering"" that it had taken the government a year since the EU referendum to commission it.

It's completely unacceptable for this to drag on ... the government needs to rapidly accelerate this.""

Why you can't fly direct from Delhi to Islamabad,"As India and Pakistan celebrate 70 years of independence, Andrew Whitehead looks at the lasting legacy of the Partition of British India, and the turmoil and trauma which marred the birth of the two nations. It's about 700km (430 miles) from Delhi to Islamabad - less than the distance between London and Geneva. A short hop in aviation terms. But you can't fly non-stop from the Indian capital to the Pakistani capital. There are no direct flights at all. It is only one of the legacies of seven decades of mutual suspicion and tension. Take another example: cricket. India and Pakistan played each other a few weeks ago inthe final of the Champions' Trophy.Both countries are cricket crazy. Perhaps the biggest movement of people in history, outside war and famine. Two newly-independent states were created - India and Pakistan. About 12 million people became refugees. Between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence. Tens of thousands of women were abducted. This article is the first in a BBC series looking at Partition 70 years on. Read more:Special report on partition However, the game was played not in South Asia, but in London. India and Pakistan don't play cricket in each other's countries any more, although they have met in one-day matches around the world, including in countries in their region like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It's almost 10 years since India and Pakistan played a Test match on South Asian soil But it is almost 10 years since they faced each other on South Asian soil in a Test match. Despite a lot of shared culture and history,they are not simply rivals, but more like enemies. In the 70 years since India and Pakistan gained independence, they have fought three wars. Some would say four, although when their armies last fought in 1999, there was no formal declaration of war. The simmering tension between India and Pakistan is one of the world's most enduring geopolitical fault lines. It has prompted both countries to develop their own nuclear weapons. So the uneasy stand-off is much more than a regional dispute: it is fraught with wider danger. Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru (l), Viceroy of India Lord Louis Mountbatten (c) and the president of the All-India Muslim League Muhammad Ali Jinnah (r) discuss Partition in 1947 India and Pakistan gained their independence at the same moment. British rule over India, by far its biggest colony, ended on 15 August 1947. After months of political deadlock, Britain agreed to divide the country in two. A separate and mainly Muslim nation, Pakistan, was createdto meet concerns that the large Muslim minority would be at a disadvantage inHindu-majority India. This involved partitioning two of India's biggest provinces, Punjab and Bengal. The details of where the new international boundary would lie were made public only two days after independence. Partition triggered one of the great calamities of the modern era, perhaps the biggest movement of people - outside war and famine - that the world has ever seen. No one knows the precise numbers, but about 12 million people became refugees as they sought desperately to move from one newly independent nation to another. Muslim women board a train in Delhi to travel to Pakistan on 7 August 1947 Amid a terrible slaughter in which all main communities were both aggressors and victims, somewhere between half a million and a million people were killed. Tens of thousands of women were abducted, usually by men of a different religion. In Punjab in particular, where Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs had lived together for generations and spoke the same language, a stark segregation was brought about as Muslims headed west to Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs fled east to India. Amritsar saw violent clashes in March 1947 between the city's Muslims, who wanted to be part of Pakistan, and its Sikh and Hindu population, who wanted to stay in India This was not a civil war with battle lines and rival armies - but nor was it simply spontaneous violence. On all sides, local militias and armed gangs planned how to inflict the greatest harm on those they had come to see as their enemies. An estimated 2,000 were killed, and more than 4,000 injured in communal riots ahead of Partition in Kolkata (Calcutta) in 1946 Those wounds have been left to fester. No one has been held to account - there's been no reconciliation process - and for a long time, the full story of what happened has been smothered in silence. Literature and cinema found ways of representing the horror of what happened. Historians initially focused on the politics of Partition. It took them much longer to turn their attention to the lived experience of this profound rupture. How a jacket and a briefcase shaped a Partition love story How India's 'Flying Sikh' went from Partition orphan to gold medallist Big oral history projects have got under way only in the last few years, as the number of survivors dwindles. There are no towering memorials to the Partition dead. The first museum devoted to Partition opened in 2016 in Amritsar in Indian Punjab. Partition poisoned relations between India and Pakistan, and has shaped - many would say distorted - the geopolitics of South Asia as a whole. Pakistan initially consisted of two wings 2,000km (1,240 miles) apart, but in 1971, East Pakistan gained its independence, with Indian military support.Another new nation, Bangladesh, was born. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both claim in full but control in part Among the loose ends of the independence arrangement was the future ofKashmir, a princely state in the foothills of the Himalayaswhich had a largely Muslim population. The maharaja, a Hindu, decided his state should become part of India. Within months, Indian and Pakistani troops were fighting each other for control of Kashmir. Thecomplex conflict remains unresolvedand, more than any other issue, has bedevilled relations between the two countries. Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it India also accuses Pakistan of supporting militant organisations which have carried out terrorist-style attacks in Indian cities. Pakistan says India colludes with breakaway movements in areas such as Balochistan. The political leaders of the two countries have met from time to time. There have been occasional hopes of a breakthrough in relations but, at the moment, relations are distinctly frosty. Activists burn a poster showing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during Mr Modi's visit to Pakistan in December 2015 The consequences have been far-reaching. India has much more trade with countries such as Nigeria, Belgium or South Africa than with its neighbour to the west. Although India's phenomenally successful Hindi-language film industry - known as Bollywood - is hugely popular in Pakistan, and Pakistan's TV soaps are eagerly watched in India, cultural links are fragile. When tensions rise, which they do regularly, every aspect of relations suffers. After a backlash against his film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (Difficulties of the heart), Indian director Karan Johar pledged not to use Pakistani actors Just a few months ago, one of India's leading film directorsKaran Johar felt obliged to promise that he would never again cast a Pakistani actorin one of his movies. The two countries are not well informed about what is happening on the other side of the border. No major Indian or Pakistani news organisation currently has a correspondent in the other country's capital. For both Indians and Pakistanis, travelling to the other country is not easy - even if it is to visit family. It is not the difficulty of getting a visa or the lack of direct flights between the two capital cities. There are very few air links between the two countries at all. The elaborate daily closing ceremony at the India-Pakistan Wagah border crossing near Amritsar attracts many spectators on both sides Despite a lengthy shared border, India and Pakistan have hardly any border crossings. In Pakistan, the army and its intelligence wing are by far the most powerful institutions - and the country has had repeated spells of military rule. The abiding sense of a military threat from its much larger neighbour has - many feel - boosted the power of the armed forces and hindered the development of a mature democracy. Pakistan has a population of about 200 million - mostly Muslims. India has almost 1,300 million citizens and about one in seven follow Islam. There are almost as many Indian Muslims as Pakistani Muslims. One projection suggests that by 2050, India will overtake Indonesia to become the country with the world's biggest Muslim population. But Muslims are under-represented in India's parliament and many other areas of public life. Some observers believe the perception - however unfair - that Indian Muslims sympathise with Pakistan has fed prejudice and discrimination. Pakistani cricket fans celebrating their team's success The pride that almost all Indians and Pakistanis feel about their nation is self-evident. Patriotism is a powerful force in both countries. It is on public display every time they play each other at cricket. But both have been unable to overcome the legacy of the tragedy which accompanied what should have been their finest moment 70 years ago. And the result of their most recent tussle on the cricket pitch? Well, for the record, Pakistan won a surprise - and emphatic - victory. Some in India were gracious in defeat. But on social media, and some sections of India's news media, there was anger and anguish - losing face to your old rival remains, for many, almost too painful to endure.

British tourists describe French wildfires,"Wildfires burn in France overnight British holidaymakers have described a sky lit up ""like Dante's inferno"" as wildfires continue to burn in south-eastern France. More than 10,000 people have been evacuated, according to officials. Hundreds of firefighters have beentackling the blazes. But British tourists in the area have told the BBC that a change in the wind direction has seen flames continue to spread. Many are now anxiously waiting for further instructions. Rob Huckle, 18, is on holiday with his family in Port de Bormes, east of Toulon. ""It's really taking a nasty turn now,"" he told the BBC. ""It kind of died down in the morning, but the wind has changed direction so [the fire has] blown onto new areas of unburned forest."" Rob Huckle, 18, is on holiday with his family Mr Huckle, who lives close to Cambridge, said the fire was now as big as he had seen it. From the apartment where he is staying he saw ""thousands"" of people being evacuated throughout the night. ""The apartment we're in looks out on to Camp du Domaine,"" he said. ""People were evacuated from there and from the hillside. ""There were thousands of people on the beach."" Among those evacuated from the Camp du Domaine campsite was Lisa Minot, a travel editor at the Sun newspaper. She told the BBC: ""At 01:00 (local time), what we could see was the orange burning on the horizon, and by 02:00 the campsite decided they had to evacuate us. ""The childrenâ¦ were being pulled down onto the beach by their parents. This video can not be played ""We're still not out of the woods yet"" - Lisa Minot, travel editor of the Sun newspaper ""We have a pitch that is right on the beach so we were there and we took in as many of these families as we could, with very young children. ""They are very tired and very, very upset kids now."" Chris Wright is on holiday with his family at the Camp du Domaine campsite Chris Wright is also holidaying in the Camp du Domaine campsite. ""We were asleep last night and there was a knock on the door,"" he told the BBC. ""A friend said, 'I don't want to worry you, but you might have to pack a bag to evacuate.' ""We couldn't see anything at first, but as we walked to reception we could see the flames. ""There must have been a thousand people on the beach."" John Grant, on holiday near Bormes-les-Mimosas, told the BBC the night sky was lit up ""like Dante's inferno"". ""It was scary,"" he said. ""We are regulars to the area and are used to the odd fire but this was certainly larger than anything we had seen previously."" Catherine Prentis told the BBC that people had been instructed to collect valuables and flee Holidaymakers in Cavalaire-sur-Mer look on as fires continue to burn Writing on Instagram,externalon Wednesday, Ms Minot said that some tourists were uncertain as to their next movements. ""[The] fire is getting fierce,"" she said. ""We are packed but don't know what to do."" Catherine Prentis, on holiday with her children, was evacuated from the campsite for a second time on Wednesday. ""They're telling us on the Camp du Domaine website to stay away,"" she said. ""The last update we had was that the flames were near the gates of the site. ""We don't know what to do. Our campsite is about a mile away from where we are now. ""People here are windsurfing, swimming, having fun - but if you look behind you, there's a cloud of smoke covering the campsite."" She said planes collecting water to fight the fires were ""having to dodge the windsurfers"". ""They've not really realised the carnage that's going on.""

Why Swedish government is on the brink,"Infrastructure Minister Anna Johansson and Interior Minister Anders Ygeman lost their jobs Sweden's Prime Minister, Stefan Lofven, says his minority government will not resign despite a security crisis over the handling of sensitive public data. He said two ministers would leave their posts, rejecting calls for a snap election. Citing Brexit and security he said ""I won't put Sweden in political crisis."" Meanwhile, the main opposition bloc said a vote of no confidence in a third minister would go ahead after the parliament recess. For weeks, the government has been dogged by revelations of a glaring security breach involving an IT contract. Mr Lofven himself said earlier this week: ""This is a disaster. This has exposed Sweden and Swedish citizens to risks."" He said two ministers were stepping down - Anna Johansson (Infrastructure) and Anders Ygeman (Interior). But Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist, who was also under pressure, has survived. The four parties that make up the opposition Alliance bloc said they would press ahead with a vote of no confidence in Mr Hultqvist, but would not seek an emergency recall of parliament from its summer recess. The crisis dates back two years to an IT contract that left public data in foreign hands but only this month has mushroomed into a security debacle with serious questions about the role of high-profile ministers. Alliance bloc leaders said the call for a vote of no confidence still stood but that they would wait In 2015, Sweden's Transport Agency, Transportstyrelsen, awarded its IT maintenance contract to IBM, which then gave the work to subcontractors in the Czech Republic and Serbia. It was a scandal that involved ""giving away the keys to the kingdom"", in the words of a Transport Agency IT worker when interviewed by Sweden's Sapo security service. The decision was made by the agency's then director general, Maria Agren, even though Sapo had advised her not to.  She ignored three key security laws - the National Security Act, the Personal Data Act and the Publicity and Privacy Act. Sweden data leak 'a disaster', says PM The security service says it meant foreign nationals without proper security clearance had access to data about Swedish driving licences as well as the country's transport infrastructure. The Swedish prime minister said he did not want to spark a political crisis IBM Sweden has declined to comment but there is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the company. The first indication to the public that something had gone wrong came only in January 2017. Maria Agren was sacked and later fined a reported 70,000 Swedish kronor ($8,000; Â£6,000) for her conduct. But the reason for her losing her job has only recently emerged. Swedish reports said it was for gross negligence for handing over confidential information to foreign sources and risking Sweden's security. It is not really clear, as Sapo has not said. But the reports are worrying and there are claims the security of the nation was placed in jeopardy. One report said three Czech IT workers had access to two police databases used for checking driving licence applications. That data may have included details of suspected criminals, witnesses in sensitive criminal cases, and women living under the threat of death from a former partner. It may also have included details of military and police vehicles. The Transport Agency has admitted holding information about people with ""protected identities"" but insists it does not hold a register of military pilots, airports or aircraft. It has also said: ""We have no indications indicating that data was disseminated improperly, so we do not see any direct cause for concern."" Maddy Savage, Stockholm After weeks of political upset, with ministers and opposition leaders dramatically recalled from their long holidays, the prime minister has sought to salvage his government, rather than call a snap election or allow the nation's opposition parties to put together an alternative. Defence Minister Hultqvist is staying in his job despite calls from the opposition to stand down Mr Lofven says the government has to stay focused on core issues, in the aftermath of April's truck attack in Stockholm, and as the UK leaves the European Union. Some here see it as a shrewd move that will reassure voters while offering an olive branch to the opposition by removing two of the three ministers linked to the IT scandal. Others see a government clinging on to power by a very weak thread that could yet break before elections due in September 2018. Either way, the biggest government security breach in years is a major embarrassment for Sweden, which is has a reputation as one of the world's most digital and tech-savvy nations.
