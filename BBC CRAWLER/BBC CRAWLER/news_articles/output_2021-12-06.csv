"Drugs plan aims to help 300,000 problem drug users","This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson sets out plans to clamp down on county lines gangs The government says it is to provide rehabilitation for 300,000 drug users who carry out half of all shop thefts, robberies and burglaries. Ministers have announced that a 10-year drugs strategy will allocate Â£780m in funding for the drug treatment system in England. It also includes Â£300m for combating more than 2,000 county lines gangs. The government says that in some cases casual drug users may lose their driving licences or passports. Labour said reforms were ""long overdue"" and cuts to police budgets had allowed gangs to grow. Announcing its new drug strategy,externalon Monday, the government said all local authorities in England will receive new money for treatment and recovery - with the 50 councils where there is most need receiving the funds first. The strategy, say ministers, will treat addiction as a chronic health condition in order to reduce stigma, save lives and break the cycle of crime fuelled by addiction. 'Stop saying junkie' plea to end addiction stigma UK drug strategy overhaul to focus on recovery not prison Review urges more funding for addiction treatments in England Drug and alcohol treatment sees rise in deaths This will include delivering treatment and recovery services through rebuilding the workforce, council-led substance misuse services and ensuring support is more integrated to cater for users' physical and mental health needs. The government will also look to improve access to accommodation and treatment for people at risk of sleeping rough as well as boosting employment opportunities. It plans to roll out individual employment support across all local authorities in England by 2025 to help those in recovery to secure work. It will also aim to increase the number of referrals for treatment from within the criminal justice system and improve the engagement of prisoners with treatment after their release. Judges will also be given the power to order testing on anyone serving a community sentence for drug-related offences and those who test positive could be jailed. It is almost as though the government wanted to hide what it is doing to tackle drug use - spending more than twice as much on treatment and recovery than on criminal interventions. There are some who point out that the new money does not make up for all the cuts to drugs services in England over the last decade. But few had expected the Treasury and Number 10 to agree to go further even than the recommendations of the independent review of drugs commissioned by the Home Office and published last summer. The money should mark a new era for drug treatment and recovery in England, but such is the concern that voters will want politicians to sound and act tough, that ministers would rather focus on police bashing in doors than the quiet work to help those with an addiction get their lives back on track. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said the strategy would save lives and help ""level-up the country"" with ""record"" investment in treatment services to ""break the cycle of drug use"" and help communities by cutting drug-related crime. Meanwhile, Â£300m will spent on cracking down on supply chains and the criminals profiting from illegal drugs in England and Wales, including: dismantling more than 2,000 county lines gangs - which see urban drug dealers use children to courier drugs to smaller towns and rural areas some Â£145m going into the County Lines Programme to target road and rail networks used by gangs carrying out 6,400 disruptions against the activities of organised criminals As part of efforts to stem the demand for drugs, Â£9m will be invested in the so-called Tough Consequences out-of-court disposals scheme to bring in a ""relevant and proportionate consequence"" for casual users. The government said potential punishments could include fines, curfews, or in the most exceptional cases, the temporary removal of driving licences or passports. Other plans to discourage people from buying illegal drugs will include police using dealers' seized phones to message their clients to direct them to support and discourage use - a move the government says will help ensure no-one feels anonymous when buying drugs. There are also plans to pilot a behaviour change campaign on university campuses to understand what messages discourage drug misuse at an early stage. Further actions will also include a Â£15m investment over three years to roll out drug testing on arrest across police forces in England and Wales. By the end of 2024/25, the government's strategy aims to have: prevented nearly 1,000 drug-related deaths - reversing the rising trend in fatalities for the first time in a decade delivered at least 54,000 new high-quality treatment places helped prevent 750,000 drug-related crimes Closed more than 2,000 more county lines Crime and Policing minister Kit Malthouse told the House of Commons the strategy was a ""blueprint for driving drugs out of our cities, towns and villages"" and ensuring those affected had they needed with a collective effort across government. Labour's shadow Home Office minister Sarah Jones accused the Conservatives of dropping ""the ball on drugs"" and on crime. She said there had been no recognition of the damage caused by previous Conservative government policies, which had left ""communities of good people with hopes and dreams invaded by serious organised crime trashing our streets, preying on our young, offering false hope of money and a future...[and] thousands of children at risk of abuse"". Mr Malthouse refused to accept that, saying Labour should accept ""some culpability for the financial situation"" the Conservatives inherited ""well over a decade ago"". Drug deaths in England and Wales are at their highest level since records began in 1993, with 4,561 people dying last year. The Home Office said crimes associated with drugs cost society nearly Â£20bn a year in England alone. It said that included the burglaries, robberies and shoplifting carried out by more than 300,000 heroin and crack addicts in England and as well as nearly half of all homicides, which are driven by drugs. The drug strategy follows a government-commissioned review of drug policy by Dame Carol Black that found spending on treatment for drug abuse fell by 17% in the four years up to 2018-19, with a 28% cut for young people's services. Her report said provision for treatment ""urgently needs repair"", and recommended funding be increased by Â£552m by year five. Dame Carol, who will monitor and advise on the strategy's progress and produce an annual update, said she was ""delighted"" the government was making ""this very significant investment in drug treatment and recovery services, alongside the funding allocated to tackle drug supply"". She said money to improve housing support and employment opportunities was also critical because people ""need hope, purpose and practical steps to help them achieve a better future"". Prof Alex Stevens, a former drugs advisor to the government, told the BBC that the previous two drugs strategies had been accompanied with ""lots of promises, but no cash"" so it made a ""welcome change"" that the latest one was ""backed up with the cash that is needed to invest in effective drug treatments services"".

Coastal areas braced for Storm Barra impact,"Storm Barra is set to hit early on Tuesday, just 10 days after Storm Arwen caused havoc in parts of the UK and Ireland Coastal areas across the UK are braced for the impact of Storm Barra later, while a rare red alert has been issued in the Republic of Ireland. The highest level of Irish weather service Met Ãireann'swarning affects counties Clare, Cork and Kerry,external, and schools are to close in 12 counties. It warns of severe and damaging gusts of more than 130km/h (80mph). Disruptive wind and some snow are expected in parts of northern England and Scotland, said the Met Office. Some flights have been cancelled, driving conditions are set to be difficult and there are fears of damage to buildings, power cuts and flooding. The second named storm this season, Storm Barra comes just 10 days after Storm Arwen struck on 26 November,causing disruption and three fatalities across the UK. Met Ãireann has warned Storm Barra will likely cause coastal flooding along parts of the south and western Irish coast, while disruption to power and travel is also likely. With a status orange warning - the second-highest level - in place for Clare, Limerick and Galway, and a yellow warning for all other counties, it has urged people to take action to protect themselves and their homes.

A Met Office yellow warning for Northern Ireland has been issued from 06:00 GMT on Tuesday to 09:00 on Wednesday. The strongest gusts will affect exposed and coastal areas, with potentially damaging and disruptive winds up to 80km/h (50mph) expected widely. The Met Office says winds are likely to be strongest in the region along the coasts of counties Down and Antrim where large waves could cause disruption. This video can not be played Storm Barra: Severe weather warnings issued across Northern Ireland Gusts around the coast could reach speeds of 120km/h (75 mph). Heavy and persistent rain on Tuesday morning will be followed by frequent and heavy showers into Wednesday. Up to 30mm of rain is forecast quite widely, while higher ground could get as much as 50mm. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has appealed for people to stay well back from the water's edge due to the risk of large waves, and in any coastal emergency to dial 999 for the coastguard. The Irish Department of Education has advised that all schools covered by an orange or red warning should shut on Tuesday - which covers 12 counties. Schools in other areas should keep up-to-date with weather warnings for any changes, the department said. University College Cork will also be closed as will the Covid-19 vaccination clinic at Cork City Hall. An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police) are advising people to avoid all unnecessary travel where red and orange warnings are in place. Allow Twitter content?

PCs jailed for sharing photos of murdered sisters,"Bibaa Henry (left) and Nicole Smallman were found in bushes at Fryent Country Park in Wembley A pair of Met Police constables who took photos of two murdered sisters and shared the images on WhatsApp groups have each been jailed for 33 months. PCs Deniz Jaffer and Jamie Lewis were sent to guard the scene where the bodies of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry were found in June 2020. While at Fryent Country Park, they left their post to take photos of the women. What the men did was a ""betrayal of catastrophic proportions"", the sisters' mother said in an impact statement. Ms Henry, 46, and Ms Smallman, 27, had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday at the park in Wembley, north-west London, when they were repeatedly stabbed by Danyal Hussein. Hussain, 19, from Blackheath, was found guilty of murdering them andjailed for a minimum of 35 yearsin October. Deniz Jaffer (left) and Jamie Lewis had undermined trust and faith in the police, a judge at the Old Bailey said At the sentencing hearing - both men had previously admitted misconduct in a public office - Judge Mark Lucraft QC rejected an appeal for the officers to be spared custody and condemned their ""appalling and inexplicable conduct"". The men disregarded the victims' privacy for ""a cheap thrill"" or ""some form of bragging rights"", which undermined trust and faith in the police, the judge said. In victim impact statements read out at the Old Bailey, family members described the defendants as a ""disgrace"" to the police family and to mankind. The women's mother, Mina Smallman, said the pair's behaviour amounted to a ""sacrilegious act"". This video can not be played Murdered sisters' mother Mina Smallman: ""We are part of the change that's going to come in the police force"" Last month, a Met Police tribunal heard Jaffer and Lewis had described the sisters as ""dead birds"". During the night of 8 June, Jaffer took four pictures of their bodies in situ and Lewis took two, and superimposed his face on to one of them to create a ""selfie-style"" image. Jaffer sent an inexperienced officer photographs of the sisters' bodies as they lay intertwined in the bushes. He then showed images to two other officers, including a probationary officer he was supposed to be mentoring. This video can not be played Mina Smallman says there is ""no peace"" without her daughters, Nicole and Bibaa, who were murdered last year On 19 June 2020, an anonymous tip-off about Lewis was given to the police watchdog. Jaffer was arrested three days later. The defendants were members of a WhatsApp group called A Team, comprised of 41 Met officers. Bibaa and Nicole: The life after death of two sisters Met PCs sacked over 'dead birds' messages Jaffer was also in a WhatsApp group with nine people who were not in the force. Shortly after arriving on the scene, Lewis posted to the A Team group an article about the discovery of the bodies, saying he and his colleagues were ""living the Wembley dream"". Lewis wrote: ""Unfortunately I'm sat next to two dead birds full of stab wounds."" Ms Henry and Ms Smallman had been celebrating the older sister's birthday on the night they were killed Jaffer posted on the smaller WhatsApp group: ""I have pictures of the two dead victims. Let me know who doesn't want to see."" Jaffer also sent a photo of the bodies to a former colleague with the message: ""This is what I have to deal with,"" while Lewis sent WhatsApp messages about the sisters to seven people who were not police officers. Both men have already been sacked by the Met Police. The life after death of two sisters Mum of murdered sisters voices anger.

More Tesco workers support pre-Christmas strikes,"Tesco is facing potential disruption ahead of the key Christmas period at more than half of its 22 UK distribution centres, unless an agreement is reached with its staff. The union Usdaw said 5,000 of its members had rejected a proposed 4% annual pay rise. They will join Unite union members in taking industrial action at a total of 13 of the supermarket chain's distribution centres. Tesco said the pay offer was fair. A spokeswoman from the supermarket said it would mitigate any disruption caused by industrial action in the run up to Christmas. The Usdaw action would affect nine Tesco distribution sites. But it follows a warning from 1,200 Tesco staff represented by the Unite union, who said they would also take industrial action at up to five distribution centres before Christmas. Unite said the 4% pay rise amounted to a ""real terms pay cut"" due to inflation. The cost of living rose by 4.2% in October, its highest rate in almost 10 years. Tesco offers Â£1,000 joining bonus for lorry drivers Tesco to recycle pet food pouches and crisp bags Former Tesco boss to advise on supply chain crisis Tesco is the UK's largest supermarket, with a consistent share of more than 25% of the market. The workers represented by Unite, including warehouse staff and HGV drivers, are based at sites in Antrim, Belfast, Didcot and Doncaster. Usdaw said its members had voted to take action at sites in Daventry, Goole, Hinckley, Lichfield, Livingston, Magor in south Wales (two sites), Peterborough and Southampton. Joanne McGuinness, national officer of Usdaw, said members had ""sent a clear message"". ""We hope that the company is listening and that they will return to the negotiating table with a better deal that is acceptable to our members"". ""Industrial action and possible stock shortages in stores in the week before Christmas can be avoided. It needs the company to engage positively in talks with Usdaw and we stand ready to reopen negotiations."" she said. On Sunday, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Our members have gone above and beyond the call of duty to keep Tesco's shelves filled throughout the pandemic. At the very least the UK's largest and wealthiest retailer should be making our members a decent pay offer."" She warned the strikes could lead to shortages of some goods, at a time when supermarkets are already struggling to source what they need amid supply chain issues. According to Unite: The Didcot and Doncaster sites will see an initial 48 hour stoppage beginning at 06:00 on 16 December. This will be followed by a further five-day stoppage beginning on 20 December. There will be a further a 48-hour stoppage beginning on 30 December and a three-day stoppage beginning on 5 January 2022 at Doncaster and Didcot. Unite members at the Antrim and Belfast Tesco distribution centres will begin an all-out continuous strike from 07:00 on 16 December. Unite said the pay rise offered by the firm was ""well below"" the current retail price index rate, another measurement of inflation, which is at 6%. It is also balloting its members for pre-Christmas strike action at Tesco's distribution centre in Livingston. The ballot closes on Monday. A Tesco spokeswoman said that customers could be confident it would fulfil it plans over the Christmas period. ""Our distribution colleagues have worked tirelessly through the pandemic in order to keep products moving for customers. The pay offer we have made is a fair recognition of this,"" she said. The spokeswoman added that the pay offer is one of the highest made within Tesco's distribution business in the last 25 years.

US boss fires 900 employees over Zoom,"This video can not be played Former Better.com employee, Christian Chapman described the Zoom call as ""excruciating"" The boss of a US firm has been criticised after he fired around 900 of his staff on a single Zoom call. ""If you're on this call you're part of the unlucky group being laid off,"" said Vishal Garg, chief executive of mortgage firm Better.com, on the call, later uploaded to social media. Comments on social media said it was ""cold"", ""harsh"" and ""a horrible move"", especially in the run up to Christmas. ""Last time I did [this] I cried,"" Mr Garg told the staff on the call. ""I wish the news were different. I wish we were thriving,"" he said. This time his tone was measured and he referred to notes on the desk in front of him. 'My billion pound company has no HR department' The big company Christmas party is off this year Apple employees make US labour watchdog complaints Mr Garg said staff performance and productivity, and market changes lay behind the mass-firing of what he said was 15% of Better.com's workforce. He did not mention the $750m (Â£565m) cash infusion Better.com received from Softbank, the Japanese firm and key investor, last week. Better.com's chief finance officer, Kevin Ryan, told the BBC: ""Having to conduct layoffs is gut-wrenching, especially this time of year."" He added, however, that having ""a fortress balance sheet and a reduced and focused workforce"" was necessary to take on the ""radically evolving homeownership market"". ""Hi everyone, thank you for joining. I come to you with not great news. The market has changed, as you know, and we have to move with it in order to survive so that hopefully we can continue to thrive and deliver on our mission. ""This isn't news that you're going to want to hear but ultimately it was my decision and I wanted you to hear it from me. It's been a really, really challenging decision to make. This is the second time in my career that I'm doing this and I do not want to do this. The last time I did it I cried. This time I hope to be stronger. But we are laying off about 15% of the company for [a number of] reasons: the market, efficiency and performances and productivity. ""If you're on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is terminated. Effective immediately."" Ann Francke, chief executive of the UK's Chartered Management Institute, criticised the way in which the staff were fired. ""Bad managers will fire people badly whether virtually or in person,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""But the callous manner in which this was conducted was just magnified by the fact that it was done in this sort of virtual and quite callous style. ""What we know in the pandemic is that empathy matters."" Better.com, which aims to use technology to make the housebuying process ""faster and more efficient"", confirmed earlier this year that it plans to float the company on the stock market. A deal is likely to value the business - which Mr Garg founded in 2015 - at between $6.9bn (Â£5.2bn) and $7.7bn. Ms Francke suggested the way in which Mr Garg fired his staff could have an effect on Better.com's future business. ""This is a customer-facing business, they are trying to provide people with mortgages. I'm sure many customers or potential customers are thinking: 'Gee whizz, if they treat their employees this way I wonder how they treat their customers?'."" After the firing,Fortune magazine said,externalthat Mr Garg was the author of a previously written anonymous blog post in which he accused sacked staff at his firm of ""stealing"" from their colleagues and customers by being unproductive and only working two hours a day, while claiming for eight or more. Mr Garg's management style has also been criticised before, after anemail that he sent to staff that was obtained by Forbes last year.,external In the email, Mr Garg wrote: ""You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS... SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME."" Business Insider reported,externalthat after firing 900 staff, Mr Garg held a subsequent ""town hall"" meeting with remaining workers. Better.com had recruited high numbers of staff during the pandemic. But Mr Garg reportedly told his staff: ""Today, we acknowledge that we overhired and hired the wrong people, and in doing that, we failed. ""I failed. I was not disciplined over the last 18 months."" ""Organisations do have to make job cuts sometimes, it is a hard reality,"" says Rachel Suff, senior policy adviser on employee relations at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. ""But how they go about it and the humanity they approach it with can have a fundamental impact on how people deal with that shocking news."" Ms Suff points out that the situation facing Better.com's staff in the US would not happen in the UK. Legally, UK employers have to enter a consultation period with workers of at least 30 days, or 45 days if more than 100 people are being made redundant. During that period ""people should be given the right phrasing, eased into it, given warning, prepared for the news and explained the reasons why"", she says. UK employers also have to look for alternative roles for workers. ""An employer really needs to tell people that they've exhausted every possible alternative, it is the last thing they wanted to do - it is about being able to leave with your dignity and respect intact."" Ms Suff adds that while a lot of focus regarding Better.com has been about Mr Garg using Zoom to fire staff, the approach is incredibly important. ""If you notice as well [Mr Garg] talks about the impact on himself. He says: 'I cried the last time'. But who's losing their job here? It was very rich, talking about the impact on himself - what about them?"" Gemma Dale, lecturer in employment law and business studies at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, said this was ""no way to lead an organisation"". A mass-firing like this would not be legal in the UK, she said. ""Just because you can do this in America, doesn't mean you should,"" she added. ""There are ways to do these things which, even in difficult conditions, are empathetic and decent."" It could harm the firm as well as its staff she said as ""existing employees will look to how the company treats people as a signal to how it will treat them in the future"".

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes review to begin next week,"Arthur Labinjo-Hughes died in June 2020 A national investigation into the death of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes will begin next week, the education secretary has said. The government had already pledgeda reviewover the boy, six, tortured and killed by his father and stepmother. Speaking in the House of Commons, Nadhim Zahawi said the whole nation was distraught at Arthur's death. He said he was determined to uncover what went wrong and take action to protect children. Mr Zahawi said while the review proper would be under way next week, with terms of reference and timelines to follow, weekend efforts had allowed its immediate planning. Emma Tustin delivered a fatal head injury to Arthur at her home in Solihull, West Midlands, during lockdown in June last year. On Friday, she wasjailed for 29 years for murder, while Arthur's father, Thomas Hughes, was jailed for 21 for manslaughter.The pair were also convicted of various counts of child cruelty against the boy, who had more than 130 bruises and was emaciated when he died. Mr Zahawi said: ""We across this House and across this country find it impossible to imagine how any adult could commit such evil acts against a child."" He confirmed both a national review and ""targeted area"" inspection to assess why things went ""horrifyingly wrong and what more could be done to prevent abuse such as this happening again"". This video can not be played The education secretary says ""we must do more"" to stop child abuse after the murder of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes The area inspection, to involve Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, plus other agencies, will mean they can ""truly look at where improvements are needed"" by all parties ""tasked with protecting children in the Solihull area"", Mr Zahawi explained. It emerged during Tustin and Hughes's trial that Arthur had been seen by social workers just two months before he died, but they concluded there were ""no safeguarding concerns"". The jury also heard the schoolboy had eaten meals that Tustin laced with salt and that he endured beatings from both adults. Meals and drinks were also withheld from him. As he lay fatally injured, Tustin, 32 - who used to force Arthur to stand alone for hours in a hallway - took a photo of him and sent it to Hughes, 29. Their sentences are set to be reviewedby the Attorney General's Office. Mr Zahawi told MPs: ""Since the horrendous deaths of Peter Connelly, Daniel Pelka and, sadly, others, the government has established stronger multi-agency working, putting a shared and equal duty on police, councils and health in local areas to work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, alongside a role for schools. ""I am sure members across the House will recognise that improvements have been made from previous reviews, but the question now is whether that is enough."" Emma Tustin was convicted of Arthur's murder while his father, Thomas Hughes, was found guilty of his manslaughter Mr Zahawi added: ""No government anywhere in the world can legislate for evil, but we will take action wherever we can to stop it from happening again because we must do more.""

Take Covid test every time you leave home - Swinney,"The Scottish government is encouraging people to take a test before they meet people from outside their household People should take a lateral flow test for Covid every time they leave home, according to the deputy first minister. John Swinney urged everyone to take the tests more frequently than twice a week as previously suggested. He was speaking as new rules come into place meaning people can show a negative Covid test result to get into clubs, concerts or large events. A text or email showing a negative test result will be accepted as an alternative to a vaccine passport. Previously, people were only allowed into large events or nightclubs if they could provide proof of vaccination. Some businesses said the earlier scheme was ""disproportionate"" but ministers said it allowed ""higher risk settings"" to operate more safely. First MinisterNicola Sturgeon announced the change to the scheme about two weeks ago,before the emergence of the Omicron variant. Since then48 people have tested positive for the new Covid strainwhich is beginning to be spread through the community. How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Why was the vaccine passport expansion dropped? It has led to ministers urging people to take more regular lateral flow (LFD) tests over the Christmas season and before mixing with other households. Mr Swinney told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme there was now a ""high level of vaccination in society"" meaning there can be more flexibility around the rules for entry into places like nightclubs. He said: ""We want people to increase the frequency of the use of lateral flow tests, away from the two times per week to much more frequently when they are socialising and interacting with others. ""Personally, I am now doing a lateral flow test every day I am going out with the prospect of meeting other members of the public outside my household. ""I would encourage others to do exactly the same, because that gives me confidence I'm protecting my household and it gives me confidence I'm protecting other people."" Policy makers face a real dilemma on what to do about Omicron. On one hand, to limit the spread of the new variant the public health advice would be to go quickly and decisively.  That could mean tough decisions to limit mass gatherings and-high risk settings. But the government response has to be proportionate and, as yet, there is no clear evidence that Omicron will lead to more people becoming seriously ill and hospitals struggling to find enough beds for Covid patients. If the worst-case scenario were to play out, then a spike in cases will hit the NHS just as it is dealing with things like flu and other winter pressures. Remember, the knock-on effects are already being felt as waiting lists for other treatments continue to grow. But if vaccines continue to be effective, and enough people get a booster jag, then the hope is that it will be enough to avert a significant new wave.  It will likely be a few more weeks before scientists can say for certain what we can expect. The deputy first minister also confirmed details of the booster vaccination will be included on Covid passports for international travel from 9 December. He said that it will be expanded for domestic certification - and could eventually become a requirement for entry into clubs, concerts and large events. A negative lateral flow test result will now be accepted as an alternative to a vaccine passport Mr Swinney said: ""That's a separate issue that we will come on to, but the vaccine certification app will enable us to do that. ""There are certain timescale issues (regarding) when people will be eligible for a booster vaccination, based on when they have had their second jag. ""So we've got to make sure we've got a reasonable and proportionate approach to that. ""These are questions we will consider as we look at the further rollout of any measures on vaccine certification."" Mr Swinney previously said there had been increase in demand for the rapid tests. ""Covid certification is playing a positive role in reducing the risk of transmission of Covid-19,"" he said. ""It is also allowing higher risk settings to continue to operate more safely. This change makes it possible for people to show proof of a negative test as an alternative to proof of vaccination."" Evidence of a negative lateral flow test will enable concert-goers to get into venues He asked people to ""significantly step up and increase compliance with public health measures"" during the Christmas party season. ""This includes using LFD testing more regularly as well as getting vaccinated, wearing face coverings and working from home where possible,"" he added. ""I have been heartened to see that there has been a significant increase in demand for tests recently, and would encourage all households to have and use a regular supply of the tests."" late night premises with music, which serve alcohol at any time between midnight and 05:00 and have a designated place for dancing for customers indoor events (unseated) with 500 or more people outdoor events (unseated) with 4,000 or more people any event with 10,000 or more people Under the new rules, people must show their vaccine passport or evidence of a negative PCR or LFD test result taken within the previous 24 hours to gain entry to specific events LFD test kit instructions include details about how to register a test result online or by phone. Once it is registered, an email and text is issued to confirm the result and that can be used to gain entry. Tests can be ordered online or collected from a pharmacy or test site. Work is also under way to make them more widely available, including at shopping centres, supermarkets, garden centres, sports grounds and transport hubs. Evidence of a negative test will be accepted as an alternative to a vaccine passport Negative test results were not included in the original vaccine passport plan because ministers wanted to use the scheme to drive up vaccine uptake. Announcing the change in parliament in November, Ms Sturgeon said high uptake rates meant testing could now be included as an alternative. Earlier this year the vaccine passport scheme was challenged by the nightclub industry in court. They claimed it was ""discriminatory"" and ""disproportionate"" but thejudge ruled in favour of the government, saying it was an attempt to address ""legitimate issues"" in a ""balanced way"".

Sainsbury's asks staff to delay Christmas parties,"Sainsbury's has asked workers to postpone their Christmas parties until the new year following the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. The supermarket said the situation was ""very delicate"", adding ""we need to do everything we can to make Christmas safe"" for staff and customers. Postponing parties would help protect food supply chains, the firm said. Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts said the firm ""will make sure no-one is out of pocket as a result of this decision"". Other businesses arechoosing to scale back festive gatheringsthis year. It follows uncertainty over the new Omicron strain of Covid which has stoked safety concerns over large parties this Christmas. Covid: Is it safe to hit the office Christmas party? Last week, Science Minister George Freeman told the BBC it was up to individual businesses to decide whether to hold a Christmas celebration. ""Some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide, this year, is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are"", he said. There are concerns that the emergence of the new Covid variant could lead to higher staff absences over Sainsbury's busy festive period. ""The industry issues on labour and recruitment are well known and are ongoing and we are doing everything we can to avoid increased absence,"" said Sainsbury's, which also owns Argos and Habitat. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently announced that even those who have been fully vaccinated must self-isolate if they come into contact with someone who has the Omicron variant of Covid. Sainsbury's was among a number of supermarkets in the UK who fell foul of the so-called ""pingdemic"" in the summer. Hundreds of thousands of people who used the NHS Test and Trace app in England and Wales were forced to self-isolate if they came into contact with someone with Covid, even if they had received both vaccine jabs. It led to worker shortages and empty shelves. The rule was changed on 16 August to allow fully vaccinated people to keep working, but if Omicron proves to be more easily transmissible than other variants it could place more pressure on retailers and other businesses during the busiest time of the year. Sainsbury's said it took the decision to delay Christmas parties after discussions with its store employee representative group. Mr Roberts said: ""We are doing everything we can to protect Christmas for our colleagues and our customers and keep everyone safe. ""As government guidance on face coverings changed on Tuesday (30 November), we have gone above and beyond to put safety first and have asked all of our colleagues to wear a face covering both on the shop floor and in all colleague areas.""

"Trains fundamentally safe, says rail boss","This video can not be played Trains to improve gradually, says minister Despite complaints of overcrowding during the pandemic, trains are ""fundamentally safe"", Transport for Wales has said. Chief executive James Price said he was ""not happy"" with some commuters' experiences but new trains would help. One commuter said trains were ""pretty dreadful"", delayed and overcrowded. The Welsh Conservatives' transport spokeswoman Natasha Asghar MS said passengers were being ""rammed into trains like sardines"". Formal social distancing rules came to an end in Wales on 7 August but TfW has asked passengers to keep ""a respectful distance from others,externalif you can"". Face masksmust be worn in most public placesincluding public transport. James Price says trains are ""fundamentally a safe place to be"" Mr Price said regular cleaning of trains was one of the measures which meant coronavirus had not been detected on any of its services. Rugby fans complain of more packed trains Climate change: What's the impact on rail? Toddler placed on tracks among 'dangerous' selfies ""I appreciate it doesn't feel right to be on a crowded train in the middle of Covid, butall the tests that we have doneand our colleagues in the rest of the UK have done about Covid on trains has not picked up any Covid on train services,"" he said. ""So we believe that with all the mitigations we're putting in place, trains are fundamentally a safe place to be in comparison to other places that people are going. But we want to do better."" Lee Waters MS defended arriving at the event by car, saying: ""My current job is not a normal job"" Meanwhile, Wales' Deputy Minister for Climate Change Lee Waters MS defended using a car to attend the launch of a new train. Following the unveiling of the first of 70 new trains that will form part of the South Wales Metro , he said: ""When I had a normal job I would travel everywhere by bike and train. ""My current job is not a normal job so it's unrepresentative, and it's an easy point to make, to say I'm a hypocrite about that."" He said most people's journeys were ""simple, repetitive, everyday journeys"" and the public transport system was ""designed to help most people make those journeys by public transport rather than by car"". ""You can always pick on someone and say it won't work for them- but that's a false parallel,"" he said. The new trains - 35 Class 231 FLIRT - will form part of the South Wales Metro and will be introduced next year. They were built by Stadler in Switzerland. Other metro trains are being made by CAF in Newport. Mr Waters said he hoped the new trains would ""change people's perceptions of what public transport is like"". TfW said it hoped new rolling stock would be in use by customers from next year. The Â£750m metro system is expected to be completed by 2023. Once completed, passengers will be able to use the same ticket to travel on trains, trams and buses across south Wales. TfW said it had been delayed by ""months not years"" due to the coronavirus pandemic, with work running broadly on schedule to upgrade tracks and build a metro headquarters at Taff's Well. Transport bosses hope new trains will address current levels of dissatisfaction with rail services in Wales. A recent YouGov poll suggested 22% of people in Wales think rail provision in their area is bad, with 11% saying they do not have any local train services at all. A further 22% of people polled said their rail services were good. Mr Price said its own customer approval score was far higher, but that he ""deeply"" understood customers' concerns. Commuter Ashley Caldwell says travelling by train ""doesn't feel worth it"" Ashley Caldwell, an artist from Caerphilly, commutes by train regularly to Cardiff. He said when travelling to the capital to view an exhibition earlier this week, the train there was on time with plenty of free seats, but on the way home it was delayed, pretty full and ""doesn't feel worth it"". ""Pretty dreadful experience really - 22 minutes late, a packed train"" he said. ""It doesn't feel like it's a service you can rely on at all, particularly in rush hour. ""I just can't understand how this kind of experience keeps happening. ""It seems to be the same trains, the same times that are delayed or cancelled. ""Surely if you know there's going to be issues the company should be fixing it, but I guess we'll never find out"". Natasha Asghar MS says passengers are being ""rammed into trains like sardines"" Conservatives shadow transport minister Natasha Asghar said she wanted ministers to address the ""horrifying"" experiences of her constituents. ""Quite frankly the reaction from my constituents has been horrifying. They are absolutely disgusted,"" she said. ""Many of them love to attend various sporting events that take place in Cardiff and over the past few weekends, whenever there has been a sporting event, my inbox has been inundated with people who are absolutely furious. ""Not only are they rammed into trains like sardines, but there is no sense of social distancing.""

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes review to begin immediately,"Arthur Labinjo-Hughes died in June 2020 A national investigation into the death of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes will begin next week, the education secretary has said. The government had already pledgeda reviewover the boy, six, tortured and killed by his father and stepmother. Speaking in the House of Commons, Nadhim Zahawi said the whole nation was distraught at Arthur's death. He said he was determined to uncover what went wrong and take action to protect children. Mr Zahawi said while the review proper would be under way next week, with terms of reference and timelines to follow, weekend efforts had allowed its immediate planning. Emma Tustin delivered a fatal head injury to Arthur at her home in Solihull, West Midlands, during lockdown in June last year. On Friday, she wasjailed for 29 years for murder, while Arthur's father, Thomas Hughes, was jailed for 21 for manslaughter.The pair were also convicted of various counts of child cruelty against the boy, who had more than 130 bruises and was emaciated when he died. Mr Zahawi said: ""We across this House and across this country find it impossible to imagine how any adult could commit such evil acts against a child."" He confirmed both a national review and ""targeted area"" inspection to assess why things went ""horrifyingly wrong and what more could be done to prevent abuse such as this happening again"". This video can not be played The education secretary says ""we must do more"" to stop child abuse after the murder of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes The area inspection, to involve Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, plus other agencies, will mean they can ""truly look at where improvements are needed"" by all parties ""tasked with protecting children in the Solihull area"", Mr Zahawi explained. It emerged during Tustin and Hughes's trial that Arthur had been seen by social workers just two months before he died, but they concluded there were ""no safeguarding concerns"". The jury also heard the schoolboy had eaten meals that Tustin laced with salt and that he endured beatings from both adults. Meals and drinks were also withheld from him.

Warnings Covid travel test prices are misleading,"The government's website to find Covid travel tests ""is not serving its purpose"", a trade body says, amid warnings about misleading prices. Companies with misleading prices are ""constantly reappearing"" on thewebsite,external, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation (LTIO) said. Travellers are also being ""exposed to extortionate prices"", according to consumer group Which?. The government said it monitored issues raised about testing firms. The LTIO, which works with the government to ensure the UK testing industry has high ethical and professional standards, said the government had failed to ""enforce accuracy"" on its providers list. ""The advantage of displaying prices on the gov.uk site is to help consumers make an informed choice when purchasing a test, [but] the website is not serving its purpose,"" said the trade body, which represents testing companies and laboratories. ""The LTIO believes passengers would be better off if the pricing function was removed entirely. This would put a stop to misleading companies constantly reappearing on the site with incorrect prices."" What are the UK's new travel rules? Concerns about test prices have re-emerged after the government announced that all travellers to the UK would need to take a PCR test within two days of arrival - on top of a pre-flight test. The Department for Health said the average price of PCR tests from the 400-plus firms listed was ""now under Â£45 with many available for Â£20"". However, the BBC found that although PCR tests can be bought for between Â£15 and Â£20 via the government website, people often have to travel to a specific location, which could be many miles away, to take one. The majority of postal service and home-testing kits currently cost between Â£59 to Â£79. Several companies advertising cheaper tests on the government's website show increased rates after clicking through. Some other providers advertise tests at Â£20 on the government's list, but do not appear to exist at all on their own websites. It is understood some firms advertising tests for as low as Â£1 have also been struck off the site. In August, Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) responded by making recommendations, which included that the government should to set up a monitoring and enforcement programme for test providers. The watchdog also said rules should be put in place to prohibiting the advertising of ""limited quantity"" prices, to address so-called ""bait pricing"", as well as making sure firms include all unavoidable costs such as delivery or administration charges. The government has not responded to the BBC when asked what recommendations have been adopted. By offering very cheap tests, providers can get to the top of the government's list. Their websites are the ones many customers will click on first, and they may end up getting more business as a result. But if you actually want a Day 2 PCR test for Â£15-20, you're likely to be disappointed. They will only be available at a single specific location, you may struggle to get an appointment, and some of the cheap rates do not seem to exist at all. I looked for tests in the south east of England. But to get the cheapest ones, I would have had to travel to places like East Kilbride (400 miles away), or Bolton (230 miles away). A couple offered tests in London, but they were booked up for weeks to come. The reality is that most passengers will end up paying the rates you see when you actually go to a provider's website - with most headlining prices between Â£59 and Â£79 for a test delivered and returned by post. The government's claim that tests are available for Â£20 isn't untrue - but it certainly doesn't tell the whole story. Which? told the BBC that travellers were being ""badly let down by a dysfunctional PCR testing market"", which had left them ""exposed to extortionate prices and unreliable providers"". Travel editor, Rory Boland, said: ""The official list of providers still features companies promoting misleading prices and we are yet to see the government take any meaningful action following the CMA's audit of the private testing system."" He urged the government to implement the CMA's recommendations to ""ensure safe, reliable and affordable tests are available for all travellers"". He also encouraged passengers to check reviews of providers and ""only book with those that have a good record of providing test kits and processing results on time"". The Labour Party has also demanded the government takes action to tackle ""eye-watering"" prices for test, and to consider a price cap on tests, following France and Belgium. Louise Haigh, shadow transport secretary, called the testing costs for people flying home for Christmas ""scandalous"" ""Ministers are sitting on their hands while people who want to do the right thing are paying the price for this broken market,"" she added. A statement from the Department for Health said it would continue to work with the UK Health Security Agency to ""monitor issues raised by the public and take rapid action if appropriate, including striking companies from the list"". ""We've been clear that it is unacceptable for any private testing company to take advantage of holidaymakers,"" it added. ""The government has taken action to drive down the cost of tests for international travel, with the average price of a Day 2 test now under Â£45 with many available for Â£20.""

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes probe to begin immediatelyThe review focuses on the six-year-old tortured and killed by his father and stepmother.Birmingham & Black Country,"Arthur Labinjo-Hughes died in June 2020 A national investigation into the death of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes will begin next week, the education secretary has said. The government had already pledgeda reviewover the boy, six, tortured and killed by his father and stepmother. Speaking in the House of Commons, Nadhim Zahawi said the whole nation was distraught at Arthur's death. He said he was determined to uncover what went wrong and take action to protect children. Mr Zahawi said while the review proper would be under way next week, with terms of reference and timelines to follow, weekend efforts had allowed its immediate planning. Emma Tustin delivered a fatal head injury to Arthur at her home in Solihull, West Midlands, during lockdown in June last year. On Friday, she wasjailed for 29 years for murder, while Arthur's father, Thomas Hughes, was jailed for 21 for manslaughter.The pair were also convicted of various counts of child cruelty against the boy, who had more than 130 bruises and was emaciated when he died. Mr Zahawi said: ""We across this House and across this country find it impossible to imagine how any adult could commit such evil acts against a child."" He confirmed both a national review and ""targeted area"" inspection to assess why things went ""horrifyingly wrong and what more could be done to prevent abuse such as this happening again"". This video can not be played The education secretary says ""we must do more"" to stop child abuse after the murder of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes The area inspection, to involve Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, plus other agencies, will mean they can ""truly look at where improvements are needed"" by all parties ""tasked with protecting children in the Solihull area"", Mr Zahawi explained. It emerged during Tustin and Hughes's trial that Arthur had been seen by social workers just two months before he died, but they concluded there were ""no safeguarding concerns"". The jury also heard the schoolboy had eaten meals that Tustin laced with salt and that he endured beatings from both adults. Meals and drinks were also withheld from him. As he lay fatally injured, Tustin, 32 - who used to force Arthur to stand alone for hours in a hallway - took a photo of him and sent it to Hughes, 29. Their sentences are set to be reviewedby the Attorney General's Office. Mr Zahawi told MPs: ""Since the horrendous deaths of Peter Connelly, Daniel Pelka and, sadly, others, the government has established stronger multi-agency working, putting a shared and equal duty on police, councils and health in local areas to work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, alongside a role for schools. ""I am sure members across the House will recognise that improvements have been made from previous reviews, but the question now is whether that is enough."" Emma Tustin was convicted of Arthur's murder while his father, Thomas Hughes, was found guilty of his manslaughter Mr Zahawi added: ""No government anywhere in the world can legislate for evil, but we will take action wherever we can to stop it from happening again because we must do more."" Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said Labour welcomed Mr Zahawi's ""clear determination to get to the bottom of what has happened"". ""Searching questions must be asked about the way in which services operated locally, but questions must also be asked nationally,"" she said. What happened to Arthur Labinjo-Hughes? Review of tortured boy's killing 'owes it to him' Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: A life cut short by cruelty Julian Knight, the Conservative MP for Solihull, asked Mr Zahawi to confirm the investigation would ""proceed without fear nor favour and that at the end of it we will know clearly and publicly who failed Arthur and how he was failed"". Urging the education secretary to look at any breakdown in partnership between social services, police and educators, Mr Knight said: ""At the very least, we owe it to Arthur that every lesson from this horrific tragedy is learned and no town has its heart broken like Solihull's heart."" Mr Zahawi assured Mr Knight both reviews ""will be able to go wherever they need to"". Saqib Bhatti, Conservative MP for Meriden, which lies between Solihull and Coventry, welcomed the investigations, adding: ""I completely also agree on the Attorney General's review of the sentencing and I have to admit many times over the last few days I've thought they should lock them up and throw away the key."" Earlier on Monday, crime and policing minister Kit Malthousesaid authorities owed it to not only Arthur but all childrento understand events leading up to the killing. He said investigations would examine whether Arthur was the victim of systemic failings or those of individuals. The British Association of Social Workers said: ""We hope this review explores the increasing challenges facing a dedicated... workforce. ""We need to urgently address the recruitment problems in social work, encourage more people into social work from a diverse range of backgrounds, and improve working conditions, so that good, experienced social workers stay in post."" The group added: ""We are hopeful that the review does not repeat the mistakes from the past where we narrow the scope to blaming individuals and fan the flames of public vilification. That approach does not protect children."" On Sunday,hundreds of people gathered on Cranmore Road, Solihull, where Arthur was fatally injured, to pay their respects to him.

"We'll tackle 300,000 problem drug users, PM says","This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson sets out plans to clamp down on county lines gangs The government says it is to provide rehabilitation for 300,000 drug users who carry out half of all shop thefts, robberies and burglaries. Ministers have announced that a 10-year drugs strategy will allocate Â£780m in funding for the drug treatment system in England. It also includes Â£300m for combating more than 2,000 county lines gangs. The government says that in some cases casual drug users may lose their driving licences or passports. Labour said reforms were ""long overdue"" and cuts to police budgets had allowed gangs to grow. Announcing its new drug strategy,externalon Monday, the government said all local authorities in England will receive new money for treatment and recovery - with the 50 councils where there is most need receiving the funds first. The strategy, say ministers, will treat addiction as a chronic health condition in order to reduce stigma, save lives and break the cycle of crime fuelled by addiction. 'Stop saying junkie' plea to end addiction stigma UK drug strategy overhaul to focus on recovery not prison Review urges more funding for addiction treatments in England Drug and alcohol treatment sees rise in deaths This will include delivering treatment and recovery services through rebuilding the workforce, council-led substance misuse services and ensuring support is more integrated to cater for users' physical and mental health needs. The government will also look to improve access to accommodation and treatment for people at risk of sleeping rough as well as boosting employment opportunities. It plans to roll out individual employment support across all local authorities in England by 2025 to help those in recovery to secure work. It will also aim to increase the number of referrals for treatment from within the criminal justice system and improve the engagement of prisoners with treatment after their release. Judges will also be given the power to order testing on anyone serving a community sentence for drug-related offences and those who test positive could be jailed. It is almost as though the government wanted to hide what it is doing to tackle drug use - spending more than twice as much on treatment and recovery than on criminal interventions. There are some who point out that the new money does not make up for all the cuts to drugs services in England over the last decade. But few had expected the Treasury and Number 10 to agree to go further even than the recommendations of the independent review of drugs commissioned by the Home Office and published last summer. The money should mark a new era for drug treatment and recovery in England, but such is the concern that voters will want politicians to sound and act tough, that ministers would rather focus on police bashing in doors than the quiet work to help those with an addiction get their lives back on track. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said the strategy would save lives and help ""level-up the country"" with ""record"" investment in treatment services to ""break the cycle of drug use"" and help communities by cutting drug-related crime. Meanwhile, Â£300m will spent on cracking down on supply chains and the criminals profiting from illegal drugs in England and Wales, including: dismantling more than 2,000 county lines gangs - which see urban drug dealers use children to courier drugs to smaller towns and rural areas some Â£145m going into the County Lines Programme to target road and rail networks used by gangs carrying out 6,400 disruptions against the activities of organised criminals As part of efforts to stem the demand for drugs, Â£9m will be invested in the so-called Tough Consequences out-of-court disposals scheme to bring in a ""relevant and proportionate consequence"" for casual users. The government said potential punishments could include fines, curfews, or in the most exceptional cases, the temporary removal of driving licences or passports. Other plans to discourage people from buying illegal drugs will include police using dealers' seized phones to message their clients to direct them to support and discourage use - a move the government says will help ensure no-one feels anonymous when buying drugs. There are also plans to pilot a behaviour change campaign on university campuses to understand what messages discourage drug misuse at an early stage. Further actions will also include a Â£15m investment over three years to roll out drug testing on arrest across police forces in England and Wales. By the end of 2024/25, the government's strategy aims to have: prevented nearly 1,000 drug-related deaths - reversing the rising trend in fatalities for the first time in a decade delivered at least 54,000 new high-quality treatment places helped prevent 750,000 drug-related crimes Closed more than 2,000 more county lines Crime and Policing minister Kit Malthouse told the House of Commons the strategy was a ""blueprint for driving drugs out of our cities, towns and villages"" and ensuring those affected had they needed with a collective effort across government. Labour's shadow Home Office minister Sarah Jones accused the Conservatives of dropping ""the ball on drugs"" and on crime. She said there had been no recognition of the damage caused by previous Conservative government policies, which had left ""communities of good people with hopes and dreams invaded by serious organised crime trashing our streets, preying on our young, offering false hope of money and a future...[and] thousands of children at risk of abuse"". Mr Malthouse refused to accept that, saying Labour should accept ""some culpability for the financial situation"" the Conservatives inherited ""well over a decade ago"". Drug deaths in England and Wales are at their highest level since records began in 1993, with 4,561 people dying last year. The Home Office said crimes associated with drugs cost society nearly Â£20bn a year in England alone. It said that included the burglaries, robberies and shoplifting carried out by more than 300,000 heroin and crack addicts in England and as well as nearly half of all homicides, which are driven by drugs. The drug strategy follows a government-commissioned review of drug policy by Dame Carol Black that found spending on treatment for drug abuse fell by 17% in the four years up to 2018-19, with a 28% cut for young people's services. Her report said provision for treatment ""urgently needs repair"", and recommended funding be increased by Â£552m by year five. Dame Carol, who will monitor and advise on the strategy's progress and produce an annual update, said she was ""delighted"" the government was making ""this very significant investment in drug treatment and recovery services, alongside the funding allocated to tackle drug supply"". She said money to improve housing support and employment opportunities was also critical because people ""need hope, purpose and practical steps to help them achieve a better future"". Prof Alex Stevens, a former drugs advisor to the government, told the BBC that the previous two drugs strategies had been accompanied with ""lots of promises, but no cash"" so it made a ""welcome change"" that the latest one was ""backed up with the cash that is needed to invest in effective drug treatments services"".

Rare red alert issued in Ireland for Storm Barra,"Storm Barra is set to hit early on Tuesday, just 10 days after Storm Arwen caused havoc in parts of the UK and Ireland Coastal areas across the UK are braced for the impact of Storm Barra later, while a rare red alert has been issued in the Republic of Ireland. The highest level of Irish weather service Met Ãireann'swarning affects counties Clare, Cork and Kerry,external, and schools are to close in 12 counties. It warns of severe and damaging gusts of more than 130km/h (80mph). Disruptive wind and some snow are expected in parts of northern England and Scotland, said the Met Office. Some flights have been cancelled, driving conditions are set to be difficult and there are fears of damage to buildings, power cuts and flooding. The second named storm this season, Storm Barra comes just 10 days after Storm Arwen struck on 26 November,causing disruption and three fatalities across the UK. Met Ãireann has warned Storm Barra will likely cause coastal flooding along parts of the south and western Irish coast, while disruption to power and travel is also likely. With a status orange warning - the second-highest level - in place for Clare, Limerick and Galway, and a yellow warning for all other counties, it has urged people to take action to protect themselves and their homes.

Covid travel test prices misleading - trade body,"The government's website to find Covid travel tests ""is not serving its purpose"", a trade body says, amid warnings about misleading prices. Companies with misleading prices are ""constantly reappearing"" on thewebsite,external, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation (LTIO) said. Travellers are also being ""exposed to extortionate prices"", according to consumer group Which?. The government said it monitored issues raised about testing firms. The LTIO, which works with the government to ensure the UK testing industry has high ethical and professional standards, said the government had failed to ""enforce accuracy"" on its providers list. ""The advantage of displaying prices on the gov.uk site is to help consumers make an informed choice when purchasing a test, [but] the website is not serving its purpose,"" said the trade body, which represents testing companies and laboratories. ""The LTIO believes passengers would be better off if the pricing function was removed entirely. This would put a stop to misleading companies constantly reappearing on the site with incorrect prices."" What are the UK's new travel rules? Concerns about test prices have re-emerged after the government announced that all travellers to the UK would need to take a PCR test within two days of arrival - on top of a pre-flight test. The Department for Health said the average price of PCR tests from the 400-plus firms listed was ""now under Â£45 with many available for Â£20"". However, the BBC found that although PCR tests can be bought for between Â£15 and Â£20 via the government website, people often have to travel to a specific location, which could be many miles away, to take one. The majority of postal service and home-testing kits currently cost between Â£59 to Â£79. Several companies advertising cheaper tests on the government's website show increased rates after clicking through. Some other providers advertise tests at Â£20 on the government's list, but do not appear to exist at all on their own websites. It is understood some firms advertising tests for as low as Â£1 have also been struck off the site. In August, Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) responded by making recommendations, which included that the government should to set up a monitoring and enforcement programme for test providers. The watchdog also said rules should be put in place to prohibiting the advertising of ""limited quantity"" prices, to address so-called ""bait pricing"", as well as making sure firms include all unavoidable costs such as delivery or administration charges. The government has not responded to the BBC when asked what recommendations have been adopted. By offering very cheap tests, providers can get to the top of the government's list. Their websites are the ones many customers will click on first, and they may end up getting more business as a result. But if you actually want a Day 2 PCR test for Â£15-20, you're likely to be disappointed. They will only be available at a single specific location, you may struggle to get an appointment, and some of the cheap rates do not seem to exist at all. I looked for tests in the south east of England. But to get the cheapest ones, I would have had to travel to places like East Kilbride (400 miles away), or Bolton (230 miles away). A couple offered tests in London, but they were booked up for weeks to come. The reality is that most passengers will end up paying the rates you see when you actually go to a provider's website - with most headlining prices between Â£59 and Â£79 for a test delivered and returned by post. The government's claim that tests are available for Â£20 isn't untrue - but it certainly doesn't tell the whole story. Which? told the BBC that travellers were being ""badly let down by a dysfunctional PCR testing market"", which had left them ""exposed to extortionate prices and unreliable providers"". Travel editor, Rory Boland, said: ""The official list of providers still features companies promoting misleading prices and we are yet to see the government take any meaningful action following the CMA's audit of the private testing system."" He urged the government to implement the CMA's recommendations to ""ensure safe, reliable and affordable tests are available for all travellers"". He also encouraged passengers to check reviews of providers and ""only book with those that have a good record of providing test kits and processing results on time"". The Labour Party has also demanded the government takes action to tackle ""eye-watering"" prices for test, and to consider a price cap on tests, following France and Belgium. Louise Haigh, shadow transport secretary, called the testing costs for people flying home for Christmas ""scandalous"" ""Ministers are sitting on their hands while people who want to do the right thing are paying the price for this broken market,"" she added. A statement from the Department for Health said it would continue to work with the UK Health Security Agency to ""monitor issues raised by the public and take rapid action if appropriate, including striking companies from the list"". ""We've been clear that it is unacceptable for any private testing company to take advantage of holidaymakers,"" it added. ""The government has taken action to drive down the cost of tests for international travel, with the average price of a Day 2 test now under Â£45 with many available for Â£20.""

"UK Covid red list criticised as 'travel apartheid'Nigeria - which was added to the red list on Monday - describes the restrictions as ""selective"".Africa","Nigeria was added to the UK red list on Monday Nigeria has criticised the UK's travel restrictions after it was placed on the red list amid fears over the Omicron Covid-19 variant. ""What is expected is a global approach, not selective,"" Sarafa Tunji Isola, Nigeria's high commissioner to the UK, told the BBC on Monday. He also echoed comments made by the UN's chief, who described restrictions imposed on some southern African countries as ""travel apartheid"". New rules came into force at 04:00 GMT. It means travellers arriving from Nigeria will be required to enter hotel quarantine - at their own expense - and isolate for 10 days. ""The travel ban is apartheid in the sense that we are not dealing with an endemic,"" Mr Isola told the Today programme. ""We are dealing with a pandemic. Whenever we have a challenge there must be collaboration."" UK government minister Kit Malthouse, meanwhile, said the wording ""travel apartheid"" was ""very unfortunate language"". ""We understand the difficulties that's created by these travel restrictions, but we're trying to buy a little bit of time so that our scientists can work on the virus and assess how difficult it's going to be"" he told the BBC. The UK's Department of Health and Social Care said all countries collect data differently, meaning it is hard to directly compare the information. It said the government would continue to keep the data under review. Nigeria became the 11th country to go on the UK's red list for international travel on Monday. All nations currently on that list are African. The only people allowed to enter the UK from these countries are UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents. They will have to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked government-approved hotel for 10 days. Has Nigeria been put on the red list unfairly? Do travel bans work against Covid? Where are cases highest around the world? Nigerians in the UK have expressed shock at the new restrictions. Olufemi Awokoya told the BBC he was trying to raise money for his wife's quarantine, as she is due to return from a trip to attend her mother's memorial service. ""She is being punished and our household is put in financial hardship. She is an NHS worker and tripled-jabbed, and we can't afford the Â£2,280 ($3,024) hotel bill,"" he said. ""I think the government's decision... is wicked, unfair and a heavy financial burden."" Dozens of countries have imposed restrictions on travel from southern Africa, and Canada and Hong Kong have included Nigeria on their lists. South Korea has also detected the Omicron variant in fully vaccinated travellers arriving from Nigeria. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres first used the term ""travel apartheid"" on Wednesday, telling reporters in New York that bans ""are not only deeply unfair and punitive, they are ineffective"". The World Health Organization (WHO) saysblanket travel bans will not stop the spread of variants,external, and can potentially discourage countries from reporting and sharing important data. Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo has also condemned the restrictions on African countries, describing them at a press conference last week as ""instruments of immigration control"". A UK government statement on Saturday,externalannouncing Nigeria's addition to the red list said the ""vast majority"" of Omicron variant cases in the UK ""have clear links to overseas travel from South Africa and Nigeria"". In the last week 21 Omicron infections had been reported in England that ""originated from Nigeria"", it said. The Centre for Disease Control in the Nigerian capital Abuja says it has only identified three cases of the variant so far, all of them passengers with a history of travel to South Africa. In total, the country has reported 214,622 cases of coronavirus since the pandemic began,according to John Hopkins University data,external. The new variant was first detected in South Africa in November. Little is yet known about it, but there are concerns it could be more transmissible, with early data suggesting it may evade some of our immunity to Covid. On Friday, WHO top scientist Soumya Swaminathan saidOmicron could become the dominant strain worldwide, although she cautioned that this is hard to predict and urged people not to panic. European Union health ministers will meet on Tuesdayto determine whether travel restrictions in response to the spread of Omicron should be changed,external, Bloomberg reported. One of the options to be considered is a PCR test for non-EU nationals travelling from affected countries, which may allow travel bans to be eased or lifted, the network quoted an unnamed diplomat as saying. But Reuters quoted EU officials as saying no decision to lift the bans was expected at the meeting. This video can not be played What do we know about the Omicron variant?

Sainsbury's asks staff to delay Christmas partiesThe supermarket will reimburse workers for postponed parties amid emergence of the Omicron variant.Business,"Sainsbury's has asked workers to postpone their Christmas parties until the new year following the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. The supermarket said the situation was ""very delicate"", adding ""we need to do everything we can to make Christmas safe"" for staff and customers. Postponing parties would help protect food supply chains, the firm said. Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts said the firm ""will make sure no-one is out of pocket as a result of this decision"". Other businesses arechoosing to scale back festive gatheringsthis year. It follows uncertainty over the new Omicron strain of Covid which has stoked safety concerns over large parties this Christmas. Covid: Is it safe to hit the office Christmas party? Last week, Science Minister George Freeman told the BBC it was up to individual businesses to decide whether to hold a Christmas celebration. ""Some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide, this year, is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are"", he said. There are concerns that the emergence of the new Covid variant could lead to higher staff absences over Sainsbury's busy festive period. ""The industry issues on labour and recruitment are well known and are ongoing and we are doing everything we can to avoid increased absence,"" said Sainsbury's, which also owns Argos and Habitat. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently announced that even those who have been fully vaccinated must self-isolate if they come into contact with someone who has the Omicron variant of Covid. Sainsbury's was among a number of supermarkets in the UK who fell foul of the so-called ""pingdemic"" in the summer. Hundreds of thousands of people who used the NHS Test and Trace app in England and Wales were forced to self-isolate if they came into contact with someone with Covid, even if they had received both vaccine jabs. It led to worker shortages and empty shelves. The rule was changed on 16 August to allow fully vaccinated people to keep working, but if Omicron proves to be more easily transmissible than other variants it could place more pressure on retailers and other businesses during the busiest time of the year. Sainsbury's said it took the decision to delay Christmas parties after discussions with its store employee representative group. Mr Roberts said: ""We are doing everything we can to protect Christmas for our colleagues and our customers and keep everyone safe. ""As government guidance on face coverings changed on Tuesday (30 November), we have gone above and beyond to put safety first and have asked all of our colleagues to wear a face covering both on the shop floor and in all colleague areas.""

Tesco depot workers to strike ahead of Christmas,"Up to 1,200 workers at Tesco distribution centres across the UK are set to strike in the run-up to Christmas, the Unite union says. The workers, including warehouse staff and HGV drivers, are based at sites in Antrim, Belfast, Didcot and Doncaster. It comes after the supermarket offered a 4% pay rise which Unite said amounted to a ""real terms pay cut"" due to inflation. Tesco said the deal was fair and that it would mitigate any disruption. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Our members have gone above and beyond the call of duty to keep Tesco's shelves filled throughout the pandemic. At the very least the UK's largest and wealthiest retailer should be making our members a decent pay offer."" Tesco offers Â£1,000 joining bonus for lorry drivers She warned the strikes could lead to shortages of some goods, at a time when supermarkets are already struggling to source what they need amid supply chain issues. According to Unite: The Didcot and Doncaster sites will see an initial 48 hour stoppage beginning at 06:00 on 16 December. This will be followed by a further five day pre-Christmas stoppage beginning on 20 December. There will be a further a 48-hour stoppage beginning on 30 December and a three-day stoppage beginning on 5 January 2022 at Doncaster and Didcot. Unite members at the Antrim and Belfast Tesco distribution centres will begin an all-out continuous strike from 07:00 on 16 December. Unite said the pay rise offered by the firm was ""well below"" the current retail price index rate of inflation which is 6%. It is also balloting its members for pre-Christmas strike action at Tesco's distribution centre in Livingston. The ballot closes on Monday. A Tesco spokeswoman said that customers could be confident it would fulfil it plans over the Christmas period. ""Our distribution colleagues have worked tirelessly through the pandemic in order to keep products moving for customers. The pay offer we have made is a fair recognition of this,"" she said. ""We welcome the decision by our colleagues at the sites who have voted against industrial action. We are disappointed that some have voted to proceed, and we have contingency plans in place to help mitigate any impacts.""

Travel changes 'too late',"The latest travel rule changes are ""a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted,"" a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Mark Woolhouse said the new rules had come ""too late"" to make a ""material difference"" to a potential wave of the Omicron variant in the UK. The changes include pre-departure tests for people arriving in the UK and Nigeria going on the travel red list. No 10 said the changes were due to a rise in travel-linked Omicron cases. From 04:00 GMT on Tuesday travellers aged 12 and over will be required to show proof of a negative PCR or lateral flow test taken no earlier than 48 hours before departure. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the measures were temporary. Nigeria will also be added to the travel red list of countries from Monday, which means UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents returning from the country must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. But the latest changes have been described by the travel industry as a ""hammer blow"", with the Business Travel Association warning livelihoods would be ""devastated"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab accepted the latest measures might ""upset or disrupt"" some people, but insisted it was right for ministers to take ""incremental steps"" early to avoid ""bigger disruption"" to travel and the economy. What are the UK's new travel rules? Is Omicron more harmful than other Covid variants? First data points to Omicron re-infection risk Wales 'braced' for 'thousands' more variant cases Prof Woolhouse, a member of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), told the BBC's Andrew Marr that while imported cases of the Omicron variant were ""important"", community transmission of the variant would be the driver of a next wave. He added the numbers of UK Omicron cases were currently ""quite small"" and he strongly suspected the absolute number was ""more in the hundreds than the thousands"". But he warned Omicron was ""spreading pretty rapidly"" in the UK, and if current trends here and in South Africa continued in the coming weeks and months, it could even replace the Delta variant around the world. Asked about Prof Woolhouse's comment the new restrictions had come too late, Mr Raab said there would always be ""Goldilocks criticism that we've done too much or we've done too little"". He said ministers would stay ""eternally vigilant"" to the risks associated with the Omicron variant and that measures, including adding countries to the travel red list, were intended to prevent its ""reseeding"" in the UK. Citingthis week's drop in the number of Covid hospital admissions and deathsand the ""success"" of the vaccination rollout, he said: ""We have steadily and steadfastly created the resilient defences which means we can enjoy Christmas."" But Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said hospitals were already struggling to cope because of winter pressures, and warned the NHS would be in a ""very, very difficult position"" if the new variant led to a surge in hospital admissions. This video can not be played Professor Willem Hanekom: ""Travel bans will do very little to stop the spread of Omicron"" It comes as the UK Health Security Agency reported on Sundaya further 86 cases of the Omicron variant across the UK,external, taking the total so far to 246. Scientists have raised concerns the heavily-mutated variant may be more transmissible than the dominant Delta strain and be able to escape immunity from vaccines. Ten southern African countries had already been added to the UK's travel red list,because of fears about Omicron - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. Dennis Mclean and his partner Janet on a previous holiday Denis Mclean has booked a holiday to Tenerife leaving on 27 January but he's thinking about cancelling because of the new rules. ""When they announced we'd have to have a PCR test on the way back within two days, I thought that's manageable. ""But now they want you to do another one 48 hours before you return and it's just the extra cost."" He says he's worried about the rules changing again if they do actually go, but also concerned about rebooking for a later date due to the uncertainty. ""We've waited over two years to have another holiday, and I know there are more important things in life but we gave them up in the pandemic because that's what you had to do,"" he says. ""Sure, variants come along and we've got to tackle that, but I don't think people have certainty any more and it's a shame."" Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for a new global set of travel rules to encourage countries to continue sequencing Covid variants without fear of facing a travel blacklist. He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""What you will find is as this proceeds, and as we realise that you're going to have to have proof of vaccination that's credible and authentic, if you don't have agreed set of standards and agreed sharing of data, it's going to be much, much harder to get the global economy moving again."" Travel industry bosses said they had not been given sufficient warning of the travel rule changes. Clive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, said: ""The introduction of pre-departure testing with little warning is a hammer blow to the business travel industry."" ""Public safety is a priority, but businesses will fail, travellers will be stranded and livelihoods devastated by the lack of coherent plans from government,"" he added. Airlines UK said the change was a ""premature"" move that would ""hit industry and passengers before we see the full data"" on the effect of the Omicron variant. The trade body added that previous experiences showed ""blanket restrictions do not stop the importation of variants"", adding the variant was ""already here"". Travel association Abta called for the government ""to step up to save jobs and businesses"" and for the cost of PCR tests to be reduced. Currently, travellers need to self-isolate until they test negative within two days of arriving into the country. The government has said the change to the rules followed new analysis from the UK Health and Security Agency that indicated the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron variant. This increases the effectiveness of pre-departure testing as it is more likely to identify positive cases before travel, the government added. Covid cases have been rising in the UK since the beginning of November, with 43,992 recorded on Sunday. However, deaths and hospital admissions are falling. The UK recorded 54 deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Sunday, although the number of deaths recorded over the weekend tend to be lower because of reporting delays.

County lines gang crackdown in drug policy overhaul,"This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson sets out plans to clamp down on county lines gangs The government says it is to provide rehabilitation for 300,000 drug users who carry out half of all shop thefts, robberies and burglaries. Ministers have announced that a 10-year drugs strategy will allocate Â£780m in funding for the drug treatment system in England. It also includes Â£300m for combating more than 2,000 county lines gangs. The government says that in some cases casual drug users may lose their driving licences or passports. Labour said reforms were ""long overdue"" and cuts to police budgets had allowed gangs to grow. Announcing its new drug strategy,externalon Monday, the government said all local authorities in England will receive new money for treatment and recovery - with the 50 councils where there is most need receiving the funds first. The strategy, say ministers, will treat addiction as a chronic health condition in order to reduce stigma, save lives and break the cycle of crime fuelled by addiction. 'Stop saying junkie' plea to end addiction stigma UK drug strategy overhaul to focus on recovery not prison Review urges more funding for addiction treatments in England Drug and alcohol treatment sees rise in deaths This will include delivering treatment and recovery services through rebuilding the workforce, council-led substance misuse services and ensuring support is more integrated to cater for users' physical and mental health needs. The government will also look to improve access to accommodation and treatment for people at risk of sleeping rough as well as boosting employment opportunities. It plans to roll out individual employment support across all local authorities in England by 2025 to help those in recovery to secure work. It will also aim to increase the number of referrals for treatment from within the criminal justice system and improve the engagement of prisoners with treatment after their release. Judges will also be given the power to order testing on anyone serving a community sentence for drug-related offences and those who test positive could be jailed. It is almost as though the government wanted to hide what it is doing to tackle drug use - spending more than twice as much on treatment and recovery than on criminal interventions. There are some who point out that the new money does not make up for all the cuts to drugs services in England over the last decade. But few had expected the Treasury and Number 10 to agree to go further even than the recommendations of the independent review of drugs commissioned by the Home Office and published last summer. The money should mark a new era for drug treatment and recovery in England, but such is the concern that voters will want politicians to sound and act tough, that ministers would rather focus on police bashing in doors than the quiet work to help those with an addiction get their lives back on track. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said the strategy would save lives and help ""level-up the country"" with ""record"" investment in treatment services to ""break the cycle of drug use"" and help communities by cutting drug-related crime. Meanwhile, Â£300m will spent on cracking down on supply chains and the criminals profiting from illegal drugs in England and Wales, including: dismantling more than 2,000 county lines gangs - which see urban drug dealers use children to courier drugs to smaller towns and rural areas some Â£145m going into the County Lines Programme to target road and rail networks used by gangs carrying out 6,400 disruptions against the activities of organised criminals As part of efforts to stem the demand for drugs, Â£9m will be invested in the so-called Tough Consequences out-of-court disposals scheme to bring in a ""relevant and proportionate consequence"" for casual users. The government said potential punishments could include fines, curfews, or in the most exceptional cases, the temporary removal of driving licences or passports. Other plans to discourage people from buying illegal drugs will include police using dealers' seized phones to message their clients to direct them to support and discourage use - a move the government says will help ensure no-one feels anonymous when buying drugs. There are also plans to pilot a behaviour change campaign on university campuses to understand what messages discourage drug misuse at an early stage. Further actions will also include a Â£15m investment over three years to roll out drug testing on arrest across police forces in England and Wales. By the end of 2024/25, the government's strategy aims to have: prevented nearly 1,000 drug-related deaths - reversing the rising trend in fatalities for the first time in a decade delivered at least 54,000 new high-quality treatment places helped prevent 750,000 drug-related crimes Closed more than 2,000 more county lines Crime and Policing minister Kit Malthouse told the House of Commons the strategy was a ""blueprint for driving drugs out of our cities, towns and villages"" and ensuring those affected had they needed with a collective effort across government. Labour's shadow Home Office minister Sarah Jones accused the Conservatives of dropping ""the ball on drugs"" and on crime. She said there had been no recognition of the damage caused by previous Conservative government policies, which had left ""communities of good people with hopes and dreams invaded by serious organised crime trashing our streets, preying on our young, offering false hope of money and a future...[and] thousands of children at risk of abuse"". Mr Malthouse refused to accept that, saying Labour should accept ""some culpability for the financial situation"" the Conservatives inherited ""well over a decade ago"". Drug deaths in England and Wales are at their highest level since records began in 1993, with 4,561 people dying last year. The Home Office said crimes associated with drugs cost society nearly Â£20bn a year in England alone. It said that included the burglaries, robberies and shoplifting carried out by more than 300,000 heroin and crack addicts in England and as well as nearly half of all homicides, which are driven by drugs. The drug strategy follows a government-commissioned review of drug policy by Dame Carol Black that found spending on treatment for drug abuse fell by 17% in the four years up to 2018-19, with a 28% cut for young people's services. Her report said provision for treatment ""urgently needs repair"", and recommended funding be increased by Â£552m by year five. Dame Carol, who will monitor and advise on the strategy's progress and produce an annual update, said she was ""delighted"" the government was making ""this very significant investment in drug treatment and recovery services, alongside the funding allocated to tackle drug supply"". She said money to improve housing support and employment opportunities was also critical because people ""need hope, purpose and practical steps to help them achieve a better future"". Prof Alex Stevens, a former drugs advisor to the government, told the BBC that the previous two drugs strategies had been accompanied with ""lots of promises, but no cash"" so it made a ""welcome change"" that the latest one was ""backed up with the cash that is needed to invest in effective drug treatments services"".

Signs HGV driver shortage will ease - trade group,"There are early signs the shortage of lorry drivers will improve, a trade association has said. Logistics UK, which represents freight and haulage businesses, said the number of drivers leaving the profession had begun to ease. The group also highlighted more trainees coming through the testing system as a cause for optimism. However, it said more action was needed by the government and industry to make the sector attractive to new recruits. Many UK sectors, from petrol stations to supermarkets, have experienced problems with deliveries due to thechronic shortage of lorry drivers. HGV and climate worries drive rail freight growth Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Family spending predicted to rise Â£1,700 a year The shortage of drivers is one of the reasons retailers have warned that consumers will have a reduced choice of food and drink at Christmas. Logistics UK's report said that by early autumn there were 44,000 fewer HGV drivers compared to the same time in 2019. But there has been a 25.6% increase in HGV driver tests from the July to September 2019 period compared to the same period in 2021 and a three-fold increase in applications for vocational provisional licences. Average driver pay increased by 10% in the nine months to October 2021, the trade body said. Elizabeth de Jong, policy director at Logistics UK, said the sector was seeing ""green shoots"" of recovery, and that in a few months, with more drivers trained, there will be an improvement in overall numbers. ""It is still a challenging time, there is still an acute shortage of drivers certainly but there a number of signs of improvement that could be coming,"" she said. ""We're seeing hope that more people are beginning to enter the industry, but we've got to keep attracting them by really improving the facilities."" She said that a lack of roadside facilities may be one of the reasons the industry is ""seeing higher proportions of young people leaving"". Ms de Jong said there had not yet been an increase in the number of drivers employed, which would be the most important indicator that the situation had improved. She also said she expects to see fewer deliveries due to the continuing shortage of drivers and other logistics workers, which could result in smaller ranges of products and difficulties restocking. HGV driver Marc Hanks, from Reading, said the pay is still not enough for many workers. Though he said he loved the job, he explained that a factor for those leaving is that some companies expect drivers to work maximum hours, with pay ""not in proportion"". Marc Hanks from Reading drives an HGV ""Then there's the facilities and people's attitude towards drivers - you get abused on a regular basis,"" he explained. ""Lots of places don't allow you to use their facilities, like coffee and tea, even the loos in some places."" In a past job where Mr Hanks used to sleep in the truck every night, he also found roadside facilities could be dirty. This report doesn't suggest the driver shortage is anywhere near being solved, having been years in the making. There's no quick fix when it comes to reversing the decline in the workforce. But the report does identify early signs of progress. Speaking to haulage companies this week, some said they were doing OK. Although they had increased pay, in line with the market. Some are coming up with their own initiatives in a bid to attract and train new drivers. Others were still feeling extremely stretched and worried, as they battled recruitment difficulties and, in some cases, Covid-related absences. One pointed out that even if more people are now entering the industry and passing their test, a newly-qualified driver can take months to properly get on the road. Drivers say roadside conditions are a particular problem. Government and industry both say they're putting effort into addressing this. In response to the report, a government spokesperson said: ""We are pleased that Logistics UK is seeing early signs that the shortage of HGV drivers is improving."" Previously the governmentannounced a string of measuresto address the shortage this year, including new skills bootcamps and temporary visas. ""These measures - combined with a deserved improvement in pay and conditions - are working, with a huge increase seen in vocational licences issued and HGV tests conducted compared to before the pandemic, and there is now spare capacity in the testing system,"" the spokesperson added. However, L Hunt & Sons, a Basingstoke-based family-run haulage business, told the BBC it had seen ""no benefit"" from government measures. ""We have been struggling to recruit since Covid started.  We are a small family business and can't complete with the sky high incentives being offered by supply chains and supermarkets,"" said company director Derrick Hunt. He said that conditions had not ""improved at all for us"".

"Trains fundamentally safe, says rail bossPassengers are being ""rammed into trains like sardines,"" one politician claims.Wales","This video can not be played Trains to improve gradually, says minister Despite complaints of overcrowding during the pandemic, trains are ""fundamentally safe"", Transport for Wales has said. Chief executive James Price said he was ""not happy"" with some commuters' experiences but new trains would help. One commuter said trains were ""pretty dreadful"", delayed and overcrowded. The Welsh Conservatives' transport spokeswoman Natasha Asghar MS said passengers were being ""rammed into trains like sardines"". Formal social distancing rules came to an end in Wales on 7 August but TfW has asked passengers to keep ""a respectful distance from others,externalif you can"". Face masksmust be worn in most public placesincluding public transport. James Price says trains are ""fundamentally a safe place to be"" Mr Price said regular cleaning of trains was one of the measures which meant coronavirus had not been detected on any of its services. Rugby fans complain of more packed trains Climate change: What's the impact on rail? Toddler placed on tracks among 'dangerous' selfies ""I appreciate it doesn't feel right to be on a crowded train in the middle of Covid, butall the tests that we have doneand our colleagues in the rest of the UK have done about Covid on trains has not picked up any Covid on train services,"" he said. ""So we believe that with all the mitigations we're putting in place, trains are fundamentally a safe place to be in comparison to other places that people are going. But we want to do better."" Lee Waters MS defended arriving at the event by car, saying: ""My current job is not a normal job"" Meanwhile, Wales' Deputy Minister for Climate Change Lee Waters MS defended using a car to attend the launch of a new train. Following the unveiling of the first of 70 new trains that will form part of the South Wales Metro , he said: ""When I had a normal job I would travel everywhere by bike and train. ""My current job is not a normal job so it's unrepresentative, and it's an easy point to make, to say I'm a hypocrite about that."" He said most people's journeys were ""simple, repetitive, everyday journeys"" and the public transport system was ""designed to help most people make those journeys by public transport rather than by car"". ""You can always pick on someone and say it won't work for them- but that's a false parallel,"" he said. The new trains - 35 Class 231 FLIRT - will form part of the South Wales Metro and will be introduced next year. They were built by Stadler in Switzerland. Other metro trains are being made by CAF in Newport. Mr Waters said he hoped the new trains would ""change people's perceptions of what public transport is like"". TfW said it hoped new rolling stock would be in use by customers from next year. The Â£750m metro system is expected to be completed by 2023. Once completed, passengers will be able to use the same ticket to travel on trains, trams and buses across south Wales. TfW said it had been delayed by ""months not years"" due to the coronavirus pandemic, with work running broadly on schedule to upgrade tracks and build a metro headquarters at Taff's Well. Transport bosses hope new trains will address current levels of dissatisfaction with rail services in Wales. A recent YouGov poll suggested 22% of people in Wales think rail provision in their area is bad, with 11% saying they do not have any local train services at all. A further 22% of people polled said their rail services were good. Mr Price said its own customer approval score was far higher, but that he ""deeply"" understood customers' concerns. Commuter Ashley Caldwell says travelling by train ""doesn't feel worth it"" Ashley Caldwell, an artist from Caerphilly, commutes by train regularly to Cardiff. He said when travelling to the capital to view an exhibition earlier this week, the train there was on time with plenty of free seats, but on the way home it was delayed, pretty full and ""doesn't feel worth it"". ""Pretty dreadful experience really - 22 minutes late, a packed train"" he said. ""It doesn't feel like it's a service you can rely on at all, particularly in rush hour. ""I just can't understand how this kind of experience keeps happening. ""It seems to be the same trains, the same times that are delayed or cancelled. ""Surely if you know there's going to be issues the company should be fixing it, but I guess we'll never find out"". Natasha Asghar MS says passengers are being ""rammed into trains like sardines"" Conservatives shadow transport minister Natasha Asghar said she wanted ministers to address the ""horrifying"" experiences of her constituents. ""Quite frankly the reaction from my constituents has been horrifying. They are absolutely disgusted,"" she said. ""Many of them love to attend various sporting events that take place in Cardiff and over the past few weekends, whenever there has been a sporting event, my inbox has been inundated with people who are absolutely furious.

"Negative test to get into clubs, gigs and eventsEvidence of a negative test for Covid-19 can now be used an alternative to a vaccine passport in Scotland.Scotland","The Scottish government is encouraging people to take a test before they meet people from outside their household People should take a lateral flow test for Covid every time they leave home, according to the deputy first minister. John Swinney urged everyone to take the tests more frequently than twice a week as previously suggested. He was speaking as new rules come into place meaning people can show a negative Covid test result to get into clubs, concerts or large events. A text or email showing a negative test result will be accepted as an alternative to a vaccine passport. Previously, people were only allowed into large events or nightclubs if they could provide proof of vaccination. Some businesses said the earlier scheme was ""disproportionate"" but ministers said it allowed ""higher risk settings"" to operate more safely. First MinisterNicola Sturgeon announced the change to the scheme about two weeks ago,before the emergence of the Omicron variant. Since then48 people have tested positive for the new Covid strainwhich is beginning to be spread through the community. How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Why was the vaccine passport expansion dropped? It has led to ministers urging people to take more regular lateral flow (LFD) tests over the Christmas season and before mixing with other households. Mr Swinney told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme there was now a ""high level of vaccination in society"" meaning there can be more flexibility around the rules for entry into places like nightclubs. He said: ""We want people to increase the frequency of the use of lateral flow tests, away from the two times per week to much more frequently when they are socialising and interacting with others. ""Personally, I am now doing a lateral flow test every day I am going out with the prospect of meeting other members of the public outside my household. ""I would encourage others to do exactly the same, because that gives me confidence I'm protecting my household and it gives me confidence I'm protecting other people."" Policy makers face a real dilemma on what to do about Omicron. On one hand, to limit the spread of the new variant the public health advice would be to go quickly and decisively.  That could mean tough decisions to limit mass gatherings and-high risk settings. But the government response has to be proportionate and, as yet, there is no clear evidence that Omicron will lead to more people becoming seriously ill and hospitals struggling to find enough beds for Covid patients. If the worst-case scenario were to play out, then a spike in cases will hit the NHS just as it is dealing with things like flu and other winter pressures. Remember, the knock-on effects are already being felt as waiting lists for other treatments continue to grow. But if vaccines continue to be effective, and enough people get a booster jag, then the hope is that it will be enough to avert a significant new wave.  It will likely be a few more weeks before scientists can say for certain what we can expect. The deputy first minister also confirmed details of the booster vaccination will be included on Covid passports for international travel from 9 December. He said that it will be expanded for domestic certification - and could eventually become a requirement for entry into clubs, concerts and large events. A negative lateral flow test result will now be accepted as an alternative to a vaccine passport Mr Swinney said: ""That's a separate issue that we will come on to, but the vaccine certification app will enable us to do that. ""There are certain timescale issues (regarding) when people will be eligible for a booster vaccination, based on when they have had their second jag. ""So we've got to make sure we've got a reasonable and proportionate approach to that. ""These are questions we will consider as we look at the further rollout of any measures on vaccine certification."" Mr Swinney previously said there had been increase in demand for the rapid tests. ""Covid certification is playing a positive role in reducing the risk of transmission of Covid-19,"" he said. ""It is also allowing higher risk settings to continue to operate more safely. This change makes it possible for people to show proof of a negative test as an alternative to proof of vaccination."" Evidence of a negative lateral flow test will enable concert-goers to get into venues He asked people to ""significantly step up and increase compliance with public health measures"" during the Christmas party season. ""This includes using LFD testing more regularly as well as getting vaccinated, wearing face coverings and working from home where possible,"" he added. ""I have been heartened to see that there has been a significant increase in demand for tests recently, and would encourage all households to have and use a regular supply of the tests."" late night premises with music, which serve alcohol at any time between midnight and 05:00 and have a designated place for dancing for customers indoor events (unseated) with 500 or more people outdoor events (unseated) with 4,000 or more people any event with 10,000 or more people Under the new rules, people must show their vaccine passport or evidence of a negative PCR or LFD test result taken within the previous 24 hours to gain entry to specific events LFD test kit instructions include details about how to register a test result online or by phone. Once it is registered, an email and text is issued to confirm the result and that can be used to gain entry. Tests can be ordered online or collected from a pharmacy or test site. Work is also under way to make them more widely available, including at shopping centres, supermarkets, garden centres, sports grounds and transport hubs. Evidence of a negative test will be accepted as an alternative to a vaccine passport Negative test results were not included in the original vaccine passport plan because ministers wanted to use the scheme to drive up vaccine uptake. Announcing the change in parliament in November, Ms Sturgeon said high uptake rates meant testing could now be included as an alternative. Earlier this year the vaccine passport scheme was challenged by the nightclub industry in court. They claimed it was ""discriminatory"" and ""disproportionate"" but thejudge ruled in favour of the government, saying it was an attempt to address ""legitimate issues"" in a ""balanced way"".

Travel changes too late to stop Omicron - scientist,"The latest travel rule changes are ""a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted,"" a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Mark Woolhouse said the new rules had come ""too late"" to make a ""material difference"" to a potential wave of the Omicron variant in the UK. The changes include pre-departure tests for people arriving in the UK and Nigeria going on the travel red list. No 10 said the changes were due to a rise in travel-linked Omicron cases. From 04:00 GMT on Tuesday travellers aged 12 and over will be required to show proof of a negative PCR or lateral flow test taken no earlier than 48 hours before departure. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the measures were temporary. Nigeria will also be added to the travel red list of countries from Monday, which means UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents returning from the country must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. But the latest changes have been described by the travel industry as a ""hammer blow"", with the Business Travel Association warning livelihoods would be ""devastated"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab accepted the latest measures might ""upset or disrupt"" some people, but insisted it was right for ministers to take ""incremental steps"" early to avoid ""bigger disruption"" to travel and the economy. What are the UK's new travel rules? Is Omicron more harmful than other Covid variants? First data points to Omicron re-infection risk Wales 'braced' for 'thousands' more variant cases Prof Woolhouse, a member of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), told the BBC's Andrew Marr that while imported cases of the Omicron variant were ""important"", community transmission of the variant would be the driver of a next wave. He added the numbers of UK Omicron cases were currently ""quite small"" and he strongly suspected the absolute number was ""more in the hundreds than the thousands"". But he warned Omicron was ""spreading pretty rapidly"" in the UK, and if current trends here and in South Africa continued in the coming weeks and months, it could even replace the Delta variant around the world. Asked about Prof Woolhouse's comment the new restrictions had come too late, Mr Raab said there would always be ""Goldilocks criticism that we've done too much or we've done too little"". He said ministers would stay ""eternally vigilant"" to the risks associated with the Omicron variant and that measures, including adding countries to the travel red list, were intended to prevent its ""reseeding"" in the UK. Citingthis week's drop in the number of Covid hospital admissions and deathsand the ""success"" of the vaccination rollout, he said: ""We have steadily and steadfastly created the resilient defences which means we can enjoy Christmas."" But Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said hospitals were already struggling to cope because of winter pressures, and warned the NHS would be in a ""very, very difficult position"" if the new variant led to a surge in hospital admissions. This video can not be played Professor Willem Hanekom: ""Travel bans will do very little to stop the spread of Omicron"" It comes as the UK Health Security Agency reported on Sundaya further 86 cases of the Omicron variant across the UK,external, taking the total so far to 246. Scientists have raised concerns the heavily-mutated variant may be more transmissible than the dominant Delta strain and be able to escape immunity from vaccines. Ten southern African countries had already been added to the UK's travel red list,because of fears about Omicron - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. Dennis Mclean and his partner Janet on a previous holiday Denis Mclean has booked a holiday to Tenerife leaving on 27 January but he's thinking about cancelling because of the new rules. ""When they announced we'd have to have a PCR test on the way back within two days, I thought that's manageable. ""But now they want you to do another one 48 hours before you return and it's just the extra cost."" He says he's worried about the rules changing again if they do actually go, but also concerned about rebooking for a later date due to the uncertainty. ""We've waited over two years to have another holiday, and I know there are more important things in life but we gave them up in the pandemic because that's what you had to do,"" he says. ""Sure, variants come along and we've got to tackle that, but I don't think people have certainty any more and it's a shame."" Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for a new global set of travel rules to encourage countries to continue sequencing Covid variants without fear of facing a travel blacklist. He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""What you will find is as this proceeds, and as we realise that you're going to have to have proof of vaccination that's credible and authentic, if you don't have agreed set of standards and agreed sharing of data, it's going to be much, much harder to get the global economy moving again."" Travel industry bosses said they had not been given sufficient warning of the travel rule changes. Clive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, said: ""The introduction of pre-departure testing with little warning is a hammer blow to the business travel industry."" ""Public safety is a priority, but businesses will fail, travellers will be stranded and livelihoods devastated by the lack of coherent plans from government,"" he added. Airlines UK said the change was a ""premature"" move that would ""hit industry and passengers before we see the full data"" on the effect of the Omicron variant. The trade body added that previous experiences showed ""blanket restrictions do not stop the importation of variants"", adding the variant was ""already here"". Travel association Abta called for the government ""to step up to save jobs and businesses"" and for the cost of PCR tests to be reduced. Currently, travellers need to self-isolate until they test negative within two days of arriving into the country. The government has said the change to the rules followed new analysis from the UK Health and Security Agency that indicated the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron variant. This increases the effectiveness of pre-departure testing as it is more likely to identify positive cases before travel, the government added. Covid cases have been rising in the UK since the beginning of November, with 43,992 recorded on Sunday. However, deaths and hospital admissions are falling. The UK recorded 54 deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Sunday, although the number of deaths recorded over the weekend tend to be lower because of reporting delays.

Severe weather warnings ahead of Storm BarraThe Met Office says the Atlantic system will bring the bad weather to Northern Ireland on Tuesday.,"Storm Barra is set to hit early on Tuesday, just 10 days after Storm Arwen caused havoc in parts of the UK and Ireland Coastal areas across the UK are braced for the impact of Storm Barra later, while a rare red alert has been issued in the Republic of Ireland. The highest level of Irish weather service Met Ãireann'swarning affects counties Clare, Cork and Kerry,external, and schools are to close in 12 counties. It warns of severe and damaging gusts of more than 130km/h (80mph). Disruptive wind and some snow are expected in parts of northern England and Scotland, said the Met Office. Some flights have been cancelled, driving conditions are set to be difficult and there are fears of damage to buildings, power cuts and flooding. The second named storm this season, Storm Barra comes just 10 days after Storm Arwen struck on 26 November,causing disruption and three fatalities across the UK. Met Ãireann has warned Storm Barra will likely cause coastal flooding along parts of the south and western Irish coast, while disruption to power and travel is also likely. With a status orange warning - the second-highest level - in place for Clare, Limerick and Galway, and a yellow warning for all other counties, it has urged people to take action to protect themselves and their homes.

Trump social media firm says it has raised $1bnThe former US president is working to launch a social media app called Truth Social early next year.Business,"Donald Trump's new social media firm says it has entered into agreements to raise $1bn (Â£755m) from investors ahead of a planned stock market listing. The Trump Media & Technology Group is working to launch a social media app called Truth Social early next year. It comes as Mr Trump remains banned from Twitter and Facebook following the attack on the US Capitol in January. ""$1bn sends an important message to Big Tech that censorship and political discrimination must end,"" he said. ""As our balance sheet expands, Trump Media & Technology Group will be in a stronger position to fight back against the tyranny of Big Tech."" Mr Trump announced plans to launch Truth Social earlier this year, saying it would allow conversation ""without discrimination on the basis of political ideology"". Michael Jackson imitator charged over Capitol riot Steve Bannon pleads not guilty to contempt charge The Trump Media & Technology Group has partnered on the project with Digital World Acquisition, a so called special purpose acquisition company (Spac) or ""blank cheque company"". Spacs, which became a major story in the US stock market at the start of this year, are shell companies that are set up with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. However, they have lost much of their lustre after some of the companies that merged with them failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections. On Saturday, Mr Trump's firm said it had secured the $1bn from from ""a diverse group of institutional investors"" without revealing who they were. According to reports, the social media venture is now valued at almost $4bn. It would appear to underscore the former US president's ability to attract strong financial backing despite the controversy surrounding his time in charge. Protestors storming the US Capitol in January Mr Trump was banned from top social media platforms after the 6 January attack by his supporters on the US Capitol in Washington DC amid concerns the then-president would inspire further violence. It came after Mr Trump made claims, without evidence, of widespread fraud in last year's presidential election. Many Wall Street firms snubbed the opportunity to invest in the former president's new venture, according to Reuters. But some hedge funds, family investment firms and high net-worth individuals have backed it. Mr Trump had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook and 24.5 million on Instagram at the time he was blocked, according to a presentation on his company's website. He has also repeatedly dropped hints that he might seek the presidency again in 2024. However, there have been questions about the state of the former president's finances. Last month a congressional committee found he had""grossly exaggerated"" the profitability of his Washington DC hotel- claims the Trump Organization called ""misleading"". Trump Media & Technology Group's partnership with Digital World Acquisition has already attracted scrutiny. Last month Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the planned merger for potential violations of securities laws. The SEC has declined to comment on whether it plans any action. Truth Social is scheduled for a full rollout in the first quarter of 2022. It is the first of three stages in the Trump Media plan, followed by a subscription video-on-demand service called TMTG+ that will feature entertainment, news and podcasts, according to the news release. In a slide deck on its website, the company envisions eventually competing against Amazon.com's AWS cloud service and Google Cloud.
