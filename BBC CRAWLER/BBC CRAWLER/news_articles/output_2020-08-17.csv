Council has 'no capacity for more child migrants',"The number of children crossing the Channel in dinghies is rising, Kent County Council says A council says it cannot safely care for any more child migrants amid a rise in the number arriving alone in Kent. Kent County Council said it does not have the capacity for additional unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. More than 400 children, most of whom arriving in Dover across the English Channel by small boat, have entered the authority's care so far this year. Responsibility lies across England, the council says, while the government says the authority has had extra support. Under-18s arriving in the county alone are passed into the care of the local authority, with a small number later transferred to other councils that volunteer to help. More than 400 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children went into council care in Kent this year County council leader Roger Gough said he warned the Home Office his authority ""expected to reach safe capacity to meet its statutory duty of care this weekend"". The arrival of 13 more children in the past two days had ""tipped the balance and the council simply cannot safely accommodate any more new arrivals,"" he added. It is unclear what will happen should more children arrive in the coming days. ""That is clearly unacceptable and needs to be resolved immediately,"" said Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, which supports unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and refugees. ""Our main priority is to ensure that vulnerable children are properly cared for and we urge the government to urgently work with Kent County Council to find a way forward,"" she added. In May, the government increased the amount given to councils to care for asylum-seeking children after Mr Gough warned social services in Kent wereat risk of being overwhelmed. ""This is an unprecedented situation and we have been working incredibly closely with Kent County Council to urgently address their concerns,"" the Home Office said. ""We continue to provide Kent County Council with a high level of support, such as significantly increasing funding and reducing pressure on their services through a national transfer scheme. ""We are also providing extra support with children's services and we continue to work across the local government network on their provision for unaccompanied minors."" But Sue Chandler, cabinet member for children's services, said the voluntary national transfer scheme needed to be made mandatory. While some children had been moved to other areas in recent months, ""due to the continued high level of arrivals, it has not been enough to make a real difference to the numbers in Kent,"" she said. Mr Gough has said the reduced amount of freight crossing the Channel due to coronavirus has led to an increase in the number of asylum-seeking children arriving in Kent by boat. Last week,23 lone migrant childrenwere taken into the council's care in a single day. More than 4,800 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats this year.

China defends detention of Uighur model,"This video can not be played The video Uighur model Merdan Ghappar filmed inside China's detention system, published two weeks ago by the BBC A Uighur fashion model who filmed himself handcuffed to a bed in an epidemic prevention centre in Xinjiang was lawfully detained, Chinese officials have said. Merdan Ghappar sent video of himself, and a series of accompanying text messages, to his family in February. They were passed to the BBC and published earlier this month. The messages offered a rare, detailed account from inside Xinjiang's highly secure and secretive detention system. In his account, Mr Ghappar described 18 days spent shackled and hooded with over 50 others in a jail. He said he was then isolated in an epidemic prevention centre, where he filmed the video. Relatives say the 31-year-old was forcibly transported back to the far-western region of Xinjiang in January after completing a 16-month sentence for a drugs offence in the southern Chinese city of Foshan, where he'd been living and working. This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" Now, more than two weeks after the BBC sent a list of questions to Chinese authorities, a response has come in the form of a written statement by the Xinjiang government press office. ""According to article 37 of the Prison Law of the People's Republic of China, the people's government shall help released prisoners to resettle,"" it says. ""During the transfer, Merdan Ghappar committed acts of self-harm and excessive acts against the police."" It continues: ""They took legal measures to stop him, and lifted those measures once his mood had stabilised."" Who are the Uighurs? Uighurs in 'forced labour for Western brands' Although Mr Ghappar had spent years in Foshan - where friends and relatives say he made good money modelling clothes - he was taken back to his city of birth of Kucha in Xinjiang. We showed the Chinese government statement to Merdan Ghappar's uncle, Abdulhakim Ghappar, who now lives in the Netherlands after leaving Xinjiang in 2011. ""If the police wanted to arrange help to get him resettled for work or something, they should have helped him in Foshan because he is working there, he has a house there,"" he told me. ""So, he shouldn't have been sent back to Kucha by force."" Xinjiang's camps are officially known as a ""vocational skills education centres"" In addition, Abdulhakim said, no mention of ""resettlement"" was made to the family when Mr Ghappar was taken away in January. The BBC has been shown evidence that the authorities were saying instead that ""he may need to do a few days of education at his local community"". The family believe that ""education"" is a clear euphemism for the network ofhighly secure re-education campswhere more than one million mostly Muslim Uighurs have been detained in recent years - and whichChina insists,externalare voluntary schools for anti-extremism training. Thousands of children have beenseparated from their parentsand, recent research shows, women have beenforcibly subjected to methods of birth control. This video can not be played Many Uighurs living in the London and the UK have been cut off from their families The government statement does not address Mr Ghappar's allegations of mistreatment which, along with the shackling and hooding, included hearing sounds of torture from elsewhere in the police jail. ""One time I heard a man screaming from morning until evening,"" he wrote in one of his text messages. Nor does the statement refer to his self-shot video showing him sitting in silence in the epidemic control centre, with dirty clothes and his left wrist clearly handcuffed to the bed. Instead, it lists a range of behaviours, from violence to self-harm, implying that his treatment was proportionate and lawful. ""He resisted epidemic prevention staff when they tried to take his temperature, verbally insulted them and beat them up,"" the statement says. ""As these behaviours placed him under suspicion of committing a crime, the police have subjected him to forcible measures."" His case ""remains in process"", it adds. James Millward from Georgetown University, an expert on China's policies in Xinjiang,provided a translation and analysis of Mr Ghappar's text messages,externalalongside the original BBC article. ""It's interesting that nothing in the Xinjiang government's response addresses the description of conditions in the Kucha local police station; the overcrowding, the beatings, the unsanitary conditions, the sharing of eight sets of eating utensils by 50-60 people,"" he told me. ""Regardless of why Merdan was put in detention in Kucha, his description of those conditions, especially during the pandemic, are very disturbing."" UK accuses China of 'gross' abuses against Uighurs 'Forced labour' Chinese hair imports seized by US Darren Byler is an anthropologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who has written and researched extensively about the Uighurs. ""This message from the Chinese state authorities reflects the type of victim blaming that is often used by the police when caught using excessive force,"" he said after being shown a copy of the statement. ""Since the re-education campaign began in 2017, detainees have not been permitted to protest their internment. Instead they're required to maintain a 'good attitude' and admit their guilt under threat of beating and torture."" The Chinese government statement also makes no mention of how Merdan Ghappar was able to send out the video of himself handcuffed to the bed, along with his description of a detention system that China works hard to keep secret. This video can not be played Since 2017, thousands of Kazakh Muslims have been detained in Chinaâs infamous re-education camps Family members have previously told the BBC that, unknown to his guards, he was able to retrieve his phone when reunited with some of his personal belongings in the epidemic prevention centre. The 4 minutes 38 seconds of footage is the last the family have seen of him. ""The Chinese police have a long history of abusing restraints as a means of torture,"" Senior China Researcher at Human Rights Watch, Maya Wang, told me. ""They have also been persecuting Xinjiang's Muslims,"" she added. ""Taken together, I don't think the authorities' explanation concerning Merdan Ghappar is convincing. If the Chinese government has nothing to hide, it should give independent observers, including UN experts, unfettered access to Xinjiang."" The statement leaves a number of the BBC's questions unanswered - was Mr Ghappar, as alleged, kept shackled with a sack on his head? Has his uncle Abdulhakim - who believes he is wanted in China as a result of what he says is his peaceful activism - been charged with any offence? For the family though it is at least, they say, the first official notification they have received confirming that Mr Ghappar is being detained. After a few brief days of communication, the text messages fell silent in early March, just as suddenly as they had begun. ""I know him very well,"" Abdulhakim told me. ""I don't believe he harmed himself, I think China harmed him and now I think they want to find an excuse for what they did to him. ""Please show me he is alive and well, otherwise I won't believe a word of this statement.""

Portuguese president helps in sea rescue,"Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa (left) was pictured helping two women after their kayak capsized Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has helped rescue two women who came into difficulty at an Algarve beach when their kayak capsized. The president, 71, was pictured on Saturday swimming over to the kayakers who were struggling in the water. He later told reporters that the women had been swept by currents from a neighbouring beach into the bay. President Rebelo de Sousa is currently on holiday in the Algarve in a bid to promote tourism there. Portugal's economy relies heavily on its tourism industry, which has been hugely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Portugal criticises England quarantine-free plan You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? The president had just spoken to journalists at Praia do Alvor beach when he noticed the women struggling. Video footage caught the moment he swam into the sea to assist them. Another man was already there, trying to help turn the kayak over while a person on a jet ski also approached to offer help. The man on the jet ski then managed to tow the kayak back to the shore. After assisting the women, President Rebelo de Sousa told journalists thatthe women had come from another beach,external. ""As there is a very large west current, they were dragged out, turned around, swallowed a lot of water and were not even able to turn [the kayak], nor to climb [on it], or swim, such is the strength of the current,"" he told local media. The president said he was helped by another ""patriot"" on the jet ski. He warned that the women should be careful in future. The president is currently holidaying in various regions of the country in a bid to promote tourism According to broadcaster 20 Minutos, the president is spending his holidays visiting different areas of the countryto promote tourism,external. Portugal remains off the list of countries that the UK government has exempted from quarantine restrictions. The country is incredibly popular with British holidaymakers, with almost three million UK visitors a year. More tourists from the UK head to the Algarve each summer than from any other country.

'Highest temperature on Earth' recorded in US,"The potentially record-breaking temperature was recorded in Death Valley, California What could be the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth - 130F (54.4C) - may have been reached in Death Valley National Park, California. The recording is being verified by the US National Weather Service. It comes amid a heatwave on the US's west coast, where temperatures are forecast to rise further this week. The scorching conditions have led to two days of blackouts in California, after a power plant malfunctioned on Saturday. ""It's an oppressive heat and it's in your face,"" Brandi Stewart, who works at Death Valley National Park, told the BBC. Ms Stewart has lived and worked at the national park on and off for five years. She spends a lot of her time indoors in August because it's simply too uncomfortable to be outside. ""When you walk outside it's like being hit in the face with a bunch of hairdryers,"" she said. ""You feel the heat and it's like walking into an oven and the heat is just all around you."" Sunday's reading was recorded in Furnace Creek in Death Valley. Before this, the highest temperature reliably recorded on Earth was 129.2F (54C) - also in Death Valley in 2013. A higher reading of 134F, or 56.6C a century earlier, also in Death Valley, is disputed. It is believed by some modern weather experts to have been erroneous, along with several other searing temperatures recorded that summer. Dangerous heat wave forecast for south-west US Summers could become 'too hot for humans' Last decade confirmed as hottest on record According to a 2016 analysis from weather historian Christopher Burt, other temperatures in the region recorded in 1913 do not corroborate the Death Valley reading. Another record temperature for the planet - 131F, or 55C - was recorded in Tunisia in 1931, but Mr Burt said this reading, as well as others recorded in Africa during the colonial era, had ""serious credibility issues"". The current heatwave stretches from Arizona in the south-west, up the coast to Washington state in the north-west. It is expected to hit its peak on Monday and Tuesday, before temperatures start to drop later in the week. However, the sweltering heat will continue for at least another 10 days. As temperatures soared in California, a large ""firenado"" was observed on Saturday in Lassen County. The ""firenado"" was seen on Saturday California's Independent System Operator (CISO), which manages the state's power, has declared a Stage 3 Emergency, meaning ""when demand [for electricity] begins to outpace supply"". Because so much of the region's power relies on solar and wind energy, and because people use their electricity for air conditioning, during heatwaves the power grid becomes strained and is at risk of completely malfunctioning. In order to manage the state's demand for power and prevent a complete shutdown, officials are using scheduled rolling blackouts to control and conserve energy. Officials define extreme heat as a period of two to three days of high heat and humidity, with temperatures above 90F (32C). US public health body the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says heatwaves have killed more people on average than any other extreme weather event in the country. The immediate effects of heatwaves on the human body are heat cramps, dehydration and even potentially fatal heat strokes. However, extreme heat can also exacerbate pre-existing health conditions, including respiratory diseases, heart conditions and kidney disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. How to look after yourself in hot weather It can affect infrastructure, too. As well as straining power grids and causing blackouts, extreme heat can ground planes, melt roads, and cause the inside of cars to overheat to dangerous levels. Heatwaves can also have a severe impact on agriculture - either by causing vegetables to wilt and die, or by encouraging the spread of plant diseases.

'99% of Victoria virus cases linked to quarantine',"Strict restrictions were put in place in the city of Melbourne on 2 August for six weeks The Australian state of Victoria has recorded its lowest rise in Covid-19 infections for a month, raising hopes it is gaining control of an outbreak. The state capital, Melbourne, has been in lockdown for over a month, but even stricter measures including a night-time curfew were imposed on 3 August. The state still has 7,274 active cases and remains Australia's worst concern. But despite reporting its deadliest day on Monday, Victoria has seen new infections decline in recent days. Tuesday's increase of 222 was the lowest daily total since 18 July. There were 17 more deaths, taking Australia's tally to 438 since the pandemic began. ""I would hope that we're in the hundreds [of new cases] - not in the 200s - next week,"" said Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton. ""But again it all depends on everyone doing the right thing, which includes stepping up for testing."" Australia's most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), recorded three new cases on Tuesday, its fewest in 47 days. At the end of March, Australia's federal government said everyone returning to the country from abroad would need to enter mandatory quarantine programmes, which would be run by individual states. Almost all current cases in Victoria can be linked to returned travellers quarantined in the state, an inquiry has heard this week. ""It is likely that a high proportion - approximately 99% of current cases of Covid-19 in Victoria - have arisen from Rydges or Stamford,"" said state epidemiologist Charles Alpren, referring to two specific hotels. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE BODY?Doctors on the front line explain STRESS:How to look after your mental health Genomic sequencing data had made experts ""incredibly confident about the accuracy of that clustering"", added Prof Ben Howden, director of the Melbourne-based infectious diseases centre Doherty Institute. Dr Alpren said evidence showed nine in 10 current cases could be traced to one family of four specifically. The inquiry also heard guards at quarantine hotels were given ""inappropriate"" training advice. Australian media report that guards were told masks and other protection would not be necessary, as long as they adhered to 1.5m social distancing. Why has Melbourne's virus outbreak worsened? Australia records deadliest day of the pandemic Australia to close Victoria-New South Wales border Barrister Tony Neal QC said the inquiry would aim to determine how the programme was structured and who was ultimately responsible for running it, as well as what improvements could be made for future quarantine programmes. The quarantine programme ""fell short of its goal"" of preventing the spread of Covid-19, and for some people in quarantine it was ""not clear who was in overall command of the operation"", Mr Neal said. On Tuesday, NSW said it was also investigating how a security guard contracted the virus at a hotel in Sydney. Why has Melbourne's virus outbreak worsened?

House party links to two Covid clusters,"Some of the eight positive cases are pupils at Bannerman High School Covid-19 clusters in Glasgow and Lanarkshire have been linked to house parties. A joint statement from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire said the two boards were working together on the outbreak. A total of 14 linked Covid cases have been identified in north-east Glasgow in addition to eight North Lanarkshire cases. Meanwhile, a pupil at a primary school in Paisley has also tested positive. A contact tracing operation is now under way at Todholm Primary school. Renfrewshire council said there was no current evidence the virus had been transmitted inside the school and it remained safe for pupils and staff to attend. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire confirmed on Monday that the cases in their areas were linked. They also said that evidence of social gatherings with no social distancing was a factor in their investigation. A spokesman for both organisations said: ""We can confirm there are links to cases across both health boards. We work closely on cross-board issues on a regular basis, including on the current clusters, where investigations are ongoing. ""There is currently no evidence of transmission in the schools. ""There is evidence that mixing socially, particularly around social gatherings in houses, without maintaining physical distancing measures can transmit the virus and is a factor in this investigation."" Health officials say there is no evidence to suggest the virus is being spread at Caldervale High School Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch warned that ""unregulated"" house parties were a ""real concern"". He said young people were meeting in numbers beyond what was allowed and with no physical distancing. ""This our first real palpable example of [house parties] giving people positive infections of a virus that can make us very sick,"" he said. Mr Leitch toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programmecommunication was a difficulty and said ""influencers"" and teachers should be used to help get the message across to young people that house parties were helping spread the infection. It emerged on Sunday that a pupil at Bannerman High in Baillieston, who had attended classes when the school reopened last week, had tested positive for the virus. Several other pupils at Bannerman High had previously tested positive,but began self-isolating prior to the return to class last week. Five pupils at nearby schools in North Lanarkshirehave tested positive in recent days, including: Three pupils from St Ambrose High School in Coatbridge One pupil from St Andrew's High School in Coatbridge One pupil from Caldervale High School in Airdrie There are also three further linked cases who are not pupils or staff at the schools. Test and Protect is now tracing those who were in contact with the pupil at Bannerman High and Glasgow City Council has written to parents. Fifth pupil tests positive in Lanarkshire cluster Pupils from two Coatbridge schools test positive for Covid-19 Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Parents of a senior pupil at one of the affected schools in North Lanarkshire told the BBC they were ""disappointed"" their son had to self-isolate after ""the selfish actions of others"". They did not want to be identified, but said they were informed their son was sitting close enough to one of the positive cases for more than 15 minutes and had to self-isolate. His mother said: ""We've done everything we can to protect our children during lockdown. So we are really disappointed that the actions of others has resulted in this. ""We got a phone call on Sunday night and our world turned upside down. Test and trace phoned to advise that our teenage son had been identified as a contact of a positive pupil at Caldervale High. ""Our son had already seen it via social media, he knew who the boy was and had sat next to him in a class. And because he had sat next to him for over 15 minutes he has to get contacted by Test and Protect."" Teenagers from schools in Lanarkshire and Glasgow have had to be tested and will have to self-isolate She added: ""He has to isolate until 27 August. He's now missing school because of selfish actions of people having house parties. ""We believe this has all stemmed from a house party at Coatbridge involving a large number of kids. People who are encouraging young people to get involved in parties do not understand the implications on others."" The child's father said he had to take his son to be tested at Ravenscraig on Monday morning. He added: ""there were three cars in front and we had to do the test ourselves in the car. By the time we had finished there were another 10-15 cars with kids in them doing tests."" Nicola Sturgeon said the outbreak was a community outbreak involving school pupils During the Scottish government coronavirus briefing on Monday, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I am concerned about what appears to be a rising number or cases, albeit that many of these new cases we are seeing are linked to known clusters and outbreaks. ""But nevertheless it's a really sharp reminder for us that the threat of the virus has not gone away. ""All of us need to be really, really careful, ultra-careful when it comes to abiding by all of the public health advice."" She said people must be careful about the school connection as they are community outbreaks that involve school pupils but are not school outbreaks. Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, assistant professor in infection and immunity at Edinburgh University told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programmeshe would not be surprised if young people meeting socially were spreading the virus. She said: ""Kids are kids and they like to gather with each other and as we know from studies that came out from Public Health England last week that secondary school pupils actually shed the virus in similar amounts to adults. The virus is going to spread and transmit in these gatherings. ""The pupils themselves are at very low risk of severe disease but on the other hand, they are probably quite asymptomatic and can carry the virus into their families."" Under the current Scottish government rules no more than eight people from a maximum of three households are allowed to gather indoors. Social distancing applies to anyone from separate households, unless they are under the age of 12. CASES:Where are the latest cases? DEATHS:Who is dying and where?

Teacher estimates to be used for Welsh exam grades,"This video can not be played Emily Mundy will now be able to study medicine in Manchester A-level and GCSE students will be awarded the grades estimated for them by their teachers, the Welsh Government has announced. Last week's A-level results were criticised after 42% of grades were lower than teacher assessments. It came after they had been processed by an algorithm. Students inEnglandandNorthern Irelandwill also have their results based on teacher estimates, in decisions taken on Monday. Pupils inScotlandhad their exam results upgraded last week after an outcry. Despite the U-turn, on Monday Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford defended the original process. Exams were cancelled across the UK after schools shut in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week's results in Wales were produced by a system known as standardisation - designed to ensure grades were ""as fair as possible"" and consistent with previous years. But it was criticised by students and politicians for producing unfair grades for individual students. Student tells minister: 'You've ruined my life' 'Unfair' A-level results claim as grades lowered 'Huge mess' as English exams appeal guidance withdrawn The U-turn also affects AS-levels, skills challenge certificates and the Welsh Baccalaureate. But students who received higher grades than those predicted by teachers will keep them. GCSE results in Wales are due to be published on Thursday. Students protested outside the Senedd at the weekend to call for the change Emily Mundy, 18, from Anglesey, had faced losing her medical school place at either Manchester or Birmingham, after her chemistry exam was downgraded from A to B. She said she felt ""overwhelmed and excited"" following the Welsh Government's U-turn. ""I got excited and I quickly rang Manchester University. They said I need to send the [teacher- assessed] grades to UCAS and I should be accepted,"" she said. ""I couldn't really believe it. It's felt like a long time since Thursday where I thought I was going to have to do something else. It means that I'll be able to get the career I wanted and the opportunity to help people."" David Mazoya said he would have been assessed on other people's results under the algorhithm David Mazoya, a 16-year-old GCSE student at Newport's Llanwern High School, was relieved: ""It felt at first like we would be assessed on how other people had done in the past and our school average. ""It wasn't really our work, it wasn't really my grade either."" But Scott Gilmour, an A-level student at Llanfair Caereinion school in Welshpool, said he feels ""nobody has a result that means anything"". He received two A*s and two As through the original algorithm method, and is going to Durham to study Law. This video can not be played Exams had been scrapped because of the coronavirus lockdown ""This U-turn by the government strips the results we've had of any value and credibility. It now means the national average for A-level results this year will be way above previous years,"" he said. In an interview with BBC Wales Mr Drakeford said the original process, was ""fairer"" than that used elsewhere in the UK, and was ""more based on evidence"". But he said the decision to award estimated grades instead was taken because ""we heard early in the day that things were moving elsewhere"" in the United Kingdom. ""We were determined that we would have a level playing field where our young people were not disadvantaged,"" he said. Education Minister Kirsty Williams, pictured right-of-centre, said the balance of fairness lies with awarding grades He said the system used to calculate results published last week ""would have delivered the best A-level results ever [with] more young people going to university in Wales than ever before"". UK government education minister Gavin Williamson apologised on Monday for the ""distress"" caused by the exams process in England. Asked if he would apologise to students, Mr Drakeford said he was ""sorry for those young people who've had to live through such an uncertain period"". His comments echoed those of the Education Minister Kirsty Williams, a Liberal Democrat politician in the Labour-led Welsh Government. Promising an independent review, she said ""the balance of fairness now lies with awarding centre assessment grades to students, despite the strengths of the system in Wales"". The announcement followed calls for predicted grades to be honoured fromLabour politicians in the Welsh Parliament, as well as Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. A-Level students recieved their results last Thursday Cardiff University vice-chancellor Colin Riordan said the move ends uncertainty and students ""who have been in limbo"" would get in if they got the grades they needed. ""If we make an offer to an applicant and they achieve the grades we asked for, we will give them a place,"" he said. The algorithms that make decisions about your life BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' ""The only issue is there are areas like medicine and dentistry where places are limited and it may be that if the numbers rise too much, we may have to ask people to see whether they'd like to accept an offer for the following year. ""But I think the applicants who have got the grades through this process now will get a place, for sure."" Universities Wales, which represents institutions in Wales, said: ""Admissions approaches will inevitably vary by institution, however, learners can be assured that every effort will be made by universities to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by this year's processes.""Â Exam watchdog Qualifications Wales, which oversaw the grade standardisation process that led to last week's results, said it was ""working through the details and impacts of this announcement"". ""We know that this is an extraordinarily difficult and upsetting time for learners, parents and their teachers, and there are many questions that we do not currently have answers to,"" it said in a statement. Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the announcement was ""seriously overdue"" and called for a ""full investigation into this debacle"". ""The Welsh Government should apologise to students, teachers and schools for what they've put them through over the past few weeks,"" she said. Suzy Davies, education spokeswoman for Welsh Conservatives, welcomed the education minister's review. ""It is reassuring that the minister has listened to the Welsh Conservatives and other parties in the Welsh Parliament, but especially pleasing that she heard the voices of young people up and down the country,"" she added. The momentum building against the A-level grading mechanism made this climbdown look inevitable even before it was announced. So why did it take ministers so long to get there? Kirsty Williams and other cabinet colleagues had nailed their colours to the ""robustness"" of the system in Wales - the implication being that it was more credible than other parts of Britain because actual exam results (the AS levels) were factored in here, unlike elsewhere. But as the inboxes of members of the Senedd filled with tales of individual injustices against students who will have the vote for the first time in next year's Senedd elections, that position became unsustainable - especially with GCSE results looming fast.

In a tweet,external, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had been ""forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion"". He criticised Downing Street's handling of students' results as ""a complete fiasco"" and said its about-face was a ""victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week"". A-level students held protests across the UK in response to grades they said were unfairly awarded. For the past decade, Ofqual has held the line against exam grade inflation like a knight of the realm - often using some quite controversial statistical techniques. But in the case of the class of Covid-19, it could be said the government's desire to maintain standards came at too high a price. In commissioning the exams regulator to take out an insurance policy in the form of its ill-fated algorithm, that policy arguably went too far, despite ministers' best intentions. When First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reinstated estimated grades for students in Scotland, it was only a matter of time before the other nations followed suit. Cue Northern Ireland, then Wales and finally England. These students are all competing for the same university places, and in the same jobs market after all. It was only when Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and his deputy Nick Gibb saw how inconsistent the results were that they were forced to relent. However, the crisis is far from resolved, with tens of thousands of students who thought they had lost their university places likely to get the grades they need after all. Universities say they will do their best to accommodate them, but it is going to be a tough ask. After the algorithm - what happens next? Ofqual chair Mr Taylor apologised for the ""difficulty"" caused to students over its grading system. He told the BBC: ""I would like to say sorry. We have recognised the difficulty that young people have faced coping with the receipt of grades that they were unable to understand the basis on which they had been awarded."" This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""Incredibly sorry for all those students who have been through this"" He added the regulator realised it had taken ""the wrong road"" and decided to ""change course"" after seeing the ""anxiety"" it had caused to young people and the added ""administrative burden on teachers at a time when they need to be preparing for the new school term"". A-level student Jess Johnson, who stood to lose out on a Â£16,000 scholarship, said she was ""thankful"" and ""excited"" about the change to results. The 18-year-old needed an A in English to earn a place at St Andrews, along with a Â£4,000-a-year scholarship, but she was downgraded from her predicted A to a B and was initially told she had been rejected. That downgrading is now set to be reversed. Ms Johnson, who studied at Ashton Sixth Form College in Greater Manchester, said: ""I think it would have been unfair if (Northern) Ireland, Scotland and Wales made the change and we didn't, so I'm very glad."" However, she questioned why it had taken so long to make the change, after A-level results came out on Thursday, saying ""a lot of stress and anxiety"" had been caused as a result of the wait. Alaa Muhammad faced missing out on her dream of studying medicine after her A-level results were downgraded. On hearing the news of the U-turn, she said: ""I am ecstatic, I am so so happy. I was so hopeless a couple of days ago and now I feel like I can finally breathe again."" Ms Muhammad, from south-east England, had seen her grades fall from a predicted AAB to EED. She said she had paid more than Â£2,000 to take re-sits at a private college after her studies in year 12 and 13 were disrupted. She now hopes she will be able to study medicine at a top university in Pakistan.

He called on the government to ""step up and support universities"", adding that Universities UK was seeking ""urgent clarification"" on a number of issues. In a statement, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said about 69% of 18-year old applicants across the UK were currently placed with their first-choice university, which it said was ""higher than at the same point last year"". It said students who did not have places at their first or insurance choice of university did not need to make their decision immediately. Ucas said it would be issuing new advice for students and schools, which would be sent directly to students, as soon as they were able to take a decision.

Covid test boss is interim head of new health body,"The health secretary said there was huge global demand for protective equipment Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed Public Health England will be replaced by a new body focused on preparing for external threats like pandemics. Baroness Dido Harding, who runs NHS Test and Trace in England, will be the interim chief of the new National Institute for Health Protection (NIHP). PHE has come under intense scrutiny of its coronavirus response. Ministers have been accused of using PHE as a scapegoat for failings. Government has been criticised for the controversial decision in March to halt community testing and tracing of contacts. The new institute will begin work with immediate effect and will bring together Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace, as well as the analytical capability of the Joint Biosecurity Centre under a single leadership team, to ""strengthen"" public health. Matt Hancock said it would have a ""single and relentless mission"" of protecting people from external health threats including pandemics, biological weapons and infections diseases ""To give ourselves the best chance of beating this virus once and for all - and of spotting and being ready to respond to other health threats, now and in the future, we are creating a brand new organisation to provide a new approach to public health protection and resilience. ""My single biggest fear is a novel flu, or another major health alert, hitting us right now in the middle of this battle against coronavirus. ""Even once this crisis has passed - and it will pass - we need a disease control infrastructure that gives us the permanent, standing capacity to respond as a nation and the ability to scale up at pace."" Public Health England 'to be replaced' Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number The new health protection agency for England will, we are told, be modelled on Germany's Robert Koch Institute which combats infectious diseases. Expertise from Public Health England and the Test and Trace network will be pooled to form an organisation focussed on tackling the coronavirus threat and future pandemics.  And therein lies the historic problem. PHE was formed as part of Government health reforms in 2012 with an ungainly merger of health protection and prevention initiatives such as obesity strategies. It was pulled in different directions and had to get by with successive annual budget cuts. PHE has been blamed for the suspension of community testing and tracing in March but senior sources say it was not set up to run a mass diagnostic testing system and any decisions made then were in partnership with Government advisers. The centrepiece of the reforms is the creation of the new agency but there are still big questions over what will happen to PHE's vital work on prevention of ill health and tackling health inequalities. The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) questioned the timing of an announcement on the scrapping of a national public health agency in the midst of a global pandemic. RSPH chief executive Christina Marriott said: ""We recognise that there have been some serious challenges in terms of our response to Covid-19, including the timing of the lockdown, the ongoing ineffectiveness of Tier 2 Track and Trace and postcode-level data previously not being available to directors of public health."" But she said ""multiple lessons"" needed to be learned ""before solutions can be in place in advance of the winter"", adding: ""to do otherwise risks avoidable mistakes in subsequent waves of the pandemic which will only harm the public's health further."" Prof Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology at Imperial College London, defended PHE as an ""assembly of some of the wisest and most committed microbiologists and epidemiologists you could hope for anywhere"". He criticised what he called the ""persistent meddling from on-high"", which he said had ""disenfranchised and fractured"" staff ""to the great detriment of the UK as a whole"". Prof Tedder warned the plans to merge existing laboratory staff with NHS Test and Trace were ""misplaced"" and would ""further dismantle"" the ""irreplaceable"" expertise that exists within PHE. Liberal Democrat Health spokesperson Munira Wilson told the BBC News Channel it was ""quite clear"" that ministers were trying to deflect responsibility from some of the ""terrible decisions"" taken, ""from the provision of protective equipment, test and trace and the tracing app being botched and a whole series of other blunders through this crisis"" then trying to scapegoat PHE as a result. She said they should be going forward with an independent inquiry so lessons learned could be used in any second wave of the pandemic. Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said in a tweetthat there had been ""no transparency or accountability"" in Baroness Harding's appointment,external.

Matt Hancock said it would have a ""single and relentless mission"" of protecting people from external health threats including pandemics, biological weapons and infections diseases ""To give ourselves the best chance of beating this virus once and for all - and of spotting and being ready to respond to other health threats, now and in the future, we are creating a brand new organisation to provide a new approach to public health protection and resilience. ""My single biggest fear is a novel flu, or another major health alert, hitting us right now in the middle of this battle against coronavirus. ""Even once this crisis has passed - and it will pass - we need a disease control infrastructure that gives us the permanent, standing capacity to respond as a nation and the ability to scale up at pace."" Public Health England 'to be replaced' Contact tracers in England cut by 6,000 Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number The new health protection agency for England will, we are told, be modelled on Germany's Robert Koch Institute which combats infectious diseases. Expertise from Public Health England and the Test and Trace network will be pooled to form an organisation focussed on tackling the coronavirus threat and future pandemics.  And therein lies the historic problem. PHE was formed as part of Government health reforms in 2012 with an ungainly merger of health protection and prevention initiatives such as obesity strategies. It was pulled in different directions and had to get by with successive annual budget cuts. PHE has been blamed for the suspension of community testing and tracing in March but senior sources say it was not set up to run a mass diagnostic testing system and any decisions made then were in partnership with Government advisers. The centrepiece of the reforms is the creation of the new agency but there are still big questions over what will happen to PHE's vital work on prevention of ill health and tackling health inequalities. The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) questioned the timing of an announcement on the scrapping of a national public health agency in the midst of a global pandemic. RSPH chief executive Christina Marriott said: ""We recognise that there have been some serious challenges in terms of our response to Covid-19, including the timing of the lockdown, the ongoing ineffectiveness of Tier 2 Track and Trace and postcode-level data previously not being available to directors of public health."" But she said ""multiple lessons"" needed to be learned ""before solutions can be in place in advance of the winter"", adding: ""to do otherwise risks avoidable mistakes in subsequent waves of the pandemic which will only harm the public's health further."" Prof Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology at Imperial College London, defended PHE as an ""assembly of some of the wisest and most committed microbiologists and epidemiologists you could hope for anywhere"". He criticised what he called the ""persistent meddling from on-high"", which he said had ""disenfranchised and fractured"" staff ""to the great detriment of the UK as a whole"". Prof Tedder warned the plans to merge existing laboratory staff with NHS Test and Trace were ""misplaced"" and would ""further dismantle"" the ""irreplaceable"" expertise that exists within PHE. Liberal Democrat Health spokesperson Munira Wilson told the BBC News Channel it was ""quite clear"" that ministers were trying to deflect responsibility from some of the ""terrible decisions"" taken, ""from the provision of protective equipment, test and trace and the tracing app being botched and a whole series of other blunders through this crisis"" then trying to scapegoat PHE as a result. She said they should be going forward with an independent inquiry so lessons learned could be used in any second wave of the pandemic. Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said in a tweetthat there had been ""no transparency or accountability"" in Baroness Harding's appointment,external.

From hospital security guard to medical student,"A former security guard has returned to the hospital where he used to work, but this time as a medical student. Eleven years ago, Russell Ledet, 34, was a security guard at Baton Rouge General Medical Center, studying chemistry on flashcards on his shift. Now, the ex-Navy non-commissioned officer has a PhD and is working towards a joint MD/MBA at Tulane University in his home-state of Louisiana. ""It's a dream come true,"" he said. His story of full-circle success has been making headlines, about a year after he rose to national attention for organisinga photo of 15 black med students,externalin front of the former slave quarters at the Whitney Plantation, a slavery museum in Louisiana. The photograph went viral, and since then he has co-founded a company called The 15 White Coats, whose mission is to raise money for minority medical students. They also sent poster-sized copies of the photograph to schools across the US to inspire the next generation of black doctors. ""When you go ask a black kid right now what does a doctor look like, they're going to tell you a white male. In order to change that, they got to see imagery that aligns with reality,"" Mr Ledet told the BBC. A photograph of 15 black med students in front of the former slave quarters at the Whitney Plantation went viral Growing up in Lake Charles, Louisiana with a single mother, Mr Ledet never thought he would go to university, let alone earn a PhD in molecular oncology or go to medical school. As a child, he remembers combing through dumpsters with his sister to find dinner. ""I thought growing up only rich people go to college,"" he says. He enrolled in the Navy after high school because it was ""a way out"". It was in the military where he says he started meeting people who showed him that success was possible - first in Washington, DC and then in Pensacola, Florida, where he studied to be a military cryptologic technician. ""I started to realise that the world was more than where I was from,"" he says. In Pensacola he met his wife, who he says was instrumental in encouraging him to get an education. ""My wife was like 'you're smart as hell you just don't know it yet',"" he remembers. After several tours overseas, he left the Navy so that he and his wife could settle down and start a family. They moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 2009, where he enrolled to study at Southern University and A&M College, a historically black college. Although he had a full scholarship, he still had to work full time to make ends meet, so he started working as a security guard at Baton Rouge General Medical Center. He would attend classes during the day, and work from late afternoon to midnight, using any downtime to do his homework. On Saturdays after finishing his shift, he would drive all night to Pensacola, where he was stationed as a reservist. The awkward questions about slavery from tourists in US South In the midst of it all, his first daughter was born, putting extra pressure on him to finish his degree and get a better-paying job. He went on to earn a PhD at New York University in molecular oncology. ""I had accomplished all this stuff, and I thought: I can do anything. The world became my oyster,"" he says. His second daughter was born on 20 February, 2018 - the same day he got the news that he was accepted to Tulane University School of Medicine with a full scholarship. This video can not be played Young figure skater goes viral performing at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington DC Since returning to Baton Rouge General Medical Center in July as a medical student, he has reconnected with his old boss, who Mr Ledet says helped him by not firing him when he was caught studying organic chemistry during his shift. Mr Ledet says that after medical school he wants to work in paediatrics and psychiatry, so that he can help increase access to mental-health care in poor communities. He hopes his success will inspire other young African Americans. ""Coming from where I come from, nobody tells you that you can do things in the world, you can make an impact,"" he says. ""If nobody tells you, you don't know. But now that I know I can tell the kids."" BLM 'not just a fleeting moment' Why are African Americans hit so hard by virus?

Workers boo Belarus president as protests spread,"This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been heckled by workers on a visit to a factory as anger mounts over his disputed re-election. Workers chanted ""leave"" and booed the long-time leader of the ex-Soviet state as he insisted he would not allow a new vote after allegations of ballot fraud. Strike action spread to state TV, with staff walking out on Monday. Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has suggested she could act as an interim leader. Police violence towards opposition supporters, as well as the alleged poll-rigging in the 9 August vote, fuelled a big protest rally in the capital Minsk on Sunday. Mr Lukashenko has led Belarus since 1994, maintaining close relations with neighbouring Russia, on which Belarus heavily relies for energy supplies. 'The people will not forgive this' In pictures: Striking images from Belarus protests 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change According to local, independent news site Tut.by, Sunday's opposition rally in Minsk was ""the largest in the history of independent Belarus"". A wave of anger has been rising since the Central Election Commission said Mr Lukashenko had won 80.1% of the vote and Ms Tikhanovskaya - 10.12%. Striking workers gathered outside the Minsk tractor factory on Monday Hundreds of protesters have been wounded and two have died in clashes with police over the past week. Some 6,700 people have been arrested, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of security forces. On a visit to a Minsk tractor plant on Monday, Mr Lukashenko sought to defend his disputed victory, telling workers: ""We held the election. Until you kill me, there will be no other election."" 'If you croak we don't care': brutality in Belarus However he said he was willing to hold a referendum and ""hand over my authority in accordance with the constitution - but not under pressure and not via street protests"". As Mr Lukashenko spoke at the factory, workers booed him and chanted ""leave"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Last week, workers at state-run factories walked out in solidarity with the protesters, and more strikes are planned for this week, increasing the pressure on Mr Lukashenko. At state TV, staff walked out in protest against censorship and the election results. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who left for Lithuania after denouncing the results, insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. In a video message released on Monday, she said she was ready to become a ""national leader"" in order to restore calm and normality, freeing political prisoners and preparing for new elections. This video can not be played Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and President Lukashenko give very different messages Russian TV news bulletins have been making ominous parallels between Belarus 2020 and Ukraine 2014. Ukraine's pro-Western revolution led to Moscow sending in its special operations forces to annex Crimea and Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Six years on, could Russia's military intervene in Belarus? On paper, at least, such a move would appear counter-productive. The opposition movement in Belarus is not anti-Russia/pro-Europe - it is anti-Lukashenko. If Russia were to send in troops to shore up the Belarusian leader, it risks alienating the Belarusian people and creating anti-Moscow sentiment. True, Moscow is determined to keep Belarus within what it sees as Russia's sphere of influence. The Kremlin's ultimate goal is deeper integration with its neighbour - a fully-fledged union state (with Vladimir Putin at the helm). It could still achieve this through political leverage. The Kremlin has a pathological fear of ""coloured revolution"" on its doorstep. But Minsk 2020 is not Kyiv 2014. Belarus is not choosing between East and West. The Belarusian people are outraged by the brutality of their security forces. So much so that even Mr Lukashenko's traditional base - including the state factory workers - are deserting him. Rival rallies were held in the capital, with the opposition event appearing to attract much higher numbers. An official report said 65,000 people had attended the presidential rally but unofficial estimates were as low as 10,000. Unofficial estimates for the opposition gathering ranged between 100,000 and 220,000. Mr Lukashenko described the opposition as rats There were reports of state sector workers being forced to attend Mr Lukashenko's rally or face the threat of losing their jobs. What's happening in Belarus? Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile As the president spoke, the anti-Lukashenko protesters gathered for a peaceful rally near a war memorial in the centre of Minsk. A number of officials, as well as current and former police officers, have resigned. Protesters were out in force in Minsk on Sunday The Belarusian ambassador to Slovakia, Igor Leshchenya, declared his solidarity with the protesters.  He told the BBC: ""I represent Belarus and the Belarusian people, which according to our constitution is the only source of power."" EU leaders are to hold an emergency video summit on Wednesday.EU foreign ministers agreed last week to prepare new sanctions,externalagainst Belarusian officials responsible for ""violence, repression and the falsification of election results"". The UK said on Monday it did not accept the results of the ""fraudulent"" election. ""The world has watched with horror at the violence used by the Belarusian authorities,"" saidForeign Secretary Dominic Raab,external. Also on Monday, US President Donald Trump said his administration was following the ""terrible situation"" in Belarus closely. President Lukashenko has sought Russian help, saying President Vladimir Putin has promised to provide comprehensive assistance in the event of any external military threat. In a conversation on Sunday, the two men discussed ""the situation in Belarus, taking into consideration the pressure the republic was being put under from outside"", the Kremlin said.

Student foresaw exam crisis in winning story,"Jessica Johnson won an Orwell Youth Prize last year for her story A Band Apart An award-winning writer whose dystopian fiction about an algorithm that sorts students into bands based on class says she has ""fallen into my own story"". Jessica Johnson, 18, said the University of St Andrews had initially rejected her after her English A-level was downgraded from an A to B. Exams this year were cancelled due to Covid and gradesbased on an algorithm. Ms Johnson said it was ""ironic to become a victim like one of her characters"". Her piece, A Band Apart, won an Orwell Youth Prize Senior award in 2019. ""I wrote about the inequality in the education system,"" the Ashton Sixth Form College student said. ""I wrote about the myth of meritocracy and it was about an algorithm that split people into bands based on the class that they were from. ""I feel like that is quite ironic, I've literally fallen into my own story."" ""I feel a victim of it,"" she added. There have been a number of protests over A-level grades after exams were cancelled due to the pandemic Ms Johnson, of Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, needed an A in English Literature for a place at St Andrews and a Â£16,000 scholarship. ""I've done a lot of extra-curricular work and I've been given that scholarship on the basis of my achievements and it just felt like all of that [has] been taken away from me because of the place I live and the college I attend,"" she said. About 40% of A-level results - published on Thursday - were downgraded from teachers' assessments by exams regulator Ofqual, which used a formula based on schools' prior grades. Following protests, the government has now saidteacher estimates will be usedand Ms Johnson is hoping she will get in at St Andrews. She said she was ""thankful"" and ""excited"" about the government's U-turn but felt it should have been done sooner. ""It's caused a lot of stress and anxiety that it didn't need to by making us wait,"" she said. Professor Jean Seaton, director of the Orwell Foundation, praised Ms Johnson's ""prescient story"". She said the teenager ""saw into the heart of what the system represents and her story demonstrates the human ability which exams only exist to uncover"". Why did the A-level algorithm say no?

Premature baby 'helps' with marriage proposal,"Nurses helped to organise the unusual proposal The father of a premature baby surprised his partner by proposing to her with a little help from his two-day old son. John Sellors' son Cobie was being cared for at King's Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire when Mr Sellors came up with the idea. He organised for a ring to be placed in Cobie's incubator and a sign asking ""will you marry my daddy"". Cobie was welcomed into the world 10 weeks early Sian Stafford, 26, said the gesture came as a shock but her answer was yes. The couple, from Pinxton in Derbyshire, welcomed their son into the world 10 weeks early at the start of August. Cobie was taken to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit and weighed 3lb 9oz (1.36kg) at the time of the proposal. The couple have been together for eight years Mr Sellors said: ""I'm not usually the romantic type, but I really wanted to do something to lift Sian's spirits and she'd been dropping hints for a while about wanting to get married. ""The nurses were great and really helped. They told me to take Sian for a coffee and they'd sort it out for when we got back. ""When we got back the message and ring were there and it was such a lovely moment, I can't thank them enough."" Miss Stafford said: ""I was so shocked. I really didn't expect it and I was really overwhelmed. ""When we got back on to the unit, the nurses told me that Cobie had been taken off his breathing machine, so I needed to go and look, as I'd be able to see his face more. ""I was concentrating so much on Cobie that I didn't even notice the note and ring at first. ""Then John said, 'look, I think Cobie wants to know something'. I read the note and it was such a surreal but happy moment."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The couple, who have been together for eight years and already have a daughter, said they would start wedding planning at a later date.

Walker.  People in Melbourne, Victoria, are allowed one hour of exercise under current restrictions Nearly all current cases of coronavirus in the Australian state of Victoria can be linked to returned travellers who have been quarantined in hotels, an inquiry has heard. The inquiry into Victoria's hotel quarantine system was told that data suggested at least 99% of cases at the end of July could be traced to people who had returned after travelling abroad. The quarantine programme ""fell short of its goal"" of preventing the spread of Covid-19, Barrister Tony Neal QC said. For some people in quarantine it was ""not clear who was in overall command of the operation"", he added. Victoria is currently in lockdown because of a second wave of infections.

The Czech Republic has gradually relaxed the wearing of masks The Czech Republic will reinstate the mandatory wearing of face masks on public transport and in shops from 1 September following a resurgence of cases. Authorities say the measure is preventative to coincide with the start of the school year. Masks will also be mandatory in schools but not in classrooms themselves. The country was one of the first in Europe
to make the wearing of masks mandatory in most public places in March but gradually lifted the requirement as infections fell. ""We consider this to be a preventative measure given that we are probably facing a complicated autumn, especially after September
1 when there will be high social interaction,"" said Health Minister Adam Vojtech. The Czech Republic has reported around 20,000 Covid-19 cases but only 399 deaths. It is currently dealing with 5,816 active cases, the highest number so far. We earlier told you about Zainab Ali, 18, from London, who had lost her place to study psychology at Queen Mary University of London after her A-level results were downgraded. Even though today's U-turn by the exam regulator meant she had achieved the required results after all, she had been told the course had filled up. After speaking to the BBC, Zainab says Queen Mary decided to offer her a place after all. The university said on Monday evening that it was ""deeply sympathetic"" to all students affected by the U-turn, and that applicants with revised grades will be guaranteed a place if they meet the terms of their original offer. Although she is now likely to get her first choice of university after all, Zainab says the past week has been an ""awful"" and ""confusing"" experience. ""I felt like I've been really let down. Now [after the U-turn] it's a bit different, but I still feel a bit let down after all of that. It was really, really stressful."" The number of people in India who have died after testing positive for Covid-19 has now passed 50,000.

 

The world's second most populous country has recorded more than 2.5 million cases so far and has been averaging around 60,000 new infections every day. Meanwhile, Latin America remains the epicentre of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization. Brazil has the second highest number of cases, after the US, and has recorded nearly 108,000 deaths. Mexico has the second-highest death toll in the region with more than 56,000 deaths. Outside Latin America, cases in Iran are on the rise again, The official death toll there is nearly at 20,000 but documents leaked to theBBC Persian service suggest the real number is more than double that. Indonesia reported 1,821 new
infections on Monday, bringing its total to
141,370. View more charts tracking the global pandemicin the latest guide from the BBC News Visual and Data Journalism Team. US actor Sharon Stone has blasted ""non-mask wearers"" in a post on Instagram revealing that her sister is in hospital ""fighting for her life"" with Covid-19. She says her sister was already vulnerable with lupus. ""The only place she went was the pharmacy,"" Stone wrote. Her brother-in-law is also in hospital, she explained in a video that criticised the lack of testing in Montana state where they live. âMy grandmother died of Covid and my godmother died of Covid,â said Stone. Mask-wearing varies across the US, but in many places it is not mandatory and has become a divisive issue. ""Wear a mask! For yourself and others. Please,"" Stone said. Allow Instagram content?

Some of the eight positive cases are pupils at Bannerman High School Dozens of students are self-isolating as Covid-19 clusters in Glasgow and Lanarkshire have been linked to house parties. A joint statement from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire said the two boards were working together on the outbreak. A total of 14 linked Covid cases have been identified in north-east Glasgow in addition to eight North Lanarkshire cases. The health boards confirmed on Monday that the cases were linked. They also said that evidence of social gatherings with no social distancing was a factor in their investigation. The number of new confirmed cases in Scotland has slowed drastically over the last few weeks, but localised outbreaks are still occurring. Over the past 14 days there have been 641 cases detected following a test, with 26 confirmed on Monday. Read more here.

The historical themed park in Vendee, western France was allowed to re-open in June The French government has defended the decision to allow a gathering of 9,000 people to go ahead at a medieval-themed park in western France. The current limit on gatherings is 5,000. But the Puy du Fou park in VendÃ©e was given permission by local authorities to stage its CinÃ©scÃ©nie show at the weekend, despite concerns about a rise of infections in the country. The history-themed performance involves fireworks and hundreds of actors and horses. Critics pointed out that other summer festivals had been prevented from going ahead and suggested it was irresponsible. But local officials said the open-air event was permitted with mask-wearing and strict social distancing. The US Democratic convention kicks off later, but will largely be held online because of the coronavirus. Presidential candidate Joe Biden and his choice for Vice-President Kamala Harris will address party supporters by video conference. The Democratic Party's social media channels will stream the sessions and they will be broadcast on most US news channels each evening until Thursday. In other US news: The U-turns on exam grades in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, of course, comes after A-level and GCSE tests were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Other Covid-related news today from the UK included an announcement that more than 100,000 people have signed up to take part in future NHS trials of a vaccine. And the government also said that as of 09:00 BST on Monday, there had been another 713 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus. Overall, a total of 319,197 cases have been confirmed in the UK, and there have been 41,369.deaths We're going to bring you a few more updates from around the world now. There has already been some response by UK universities, following this afternoon's U-turn on A-level results and the removal of caps on university places across England. Queen Mary University of Londonsaid in a tweet,externalit was ""deeply sympathetic"" to affected students, and that it would guarantee a place to any students who had originally missed but now met the terms of their offer. And the University of Glasgow saidit will ""honour"",externalplaces for those students who have firm acceptances and were successful in meeting its entry requirements. Meanwhile, Cambridge University has responded by saying it willbe in touch,externalwith all students who held an offer at the university ""to offer further advice"".  England's education secretary Gavin Williamson ""must go"", the Liberal Democrats' education spokesperson has said, after the UK government changed its stance on the process for awarding A-level and GCSE grades in England. Speaking to the BBC, Layla Moran, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, said the government had been ""dragged, kicking and screaming to this position"". Ms Moran, who is running to be leader of her
party, added: ""I don't understand why Boris Johnson has not offered a
personal, heartfelt apology...for the mess this government has created."" She stressed that this was ""always the right thing to do"", but said now ""universities are scrambling"" to accommodate the changes. Ms Moran has called for the government to support universities and ""foot the bill for
any of the financial costs that universities are going to bear because of the
botched job"".  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent The next part of the A-level U-turn jigsaw is that the government
is allowing universities in England to add more places - to meet the extra
demand from young people who have had their results upgraded. These were already set to be the highest ever A-level results in
almost 70 years, but the latest upgrades will mean that about 38% of entries
will be A*s or As - an unprecedented number and likely to mean more young
people looking for university places. Students who thought they had missed out on university places will
now have the grades they need and will be asking for a second chance. To increase capacity, the government in England will lift the
âstudent number controlsâ which would have capped places. It means universities can recruit more students to relieve the
pressure. But that still depends on it being possible - they will still need
to have enough spare space, teaching staff and accommodation, along with the
pressures of Covid-19 social distancing measures. Universities might say they are already full up and any extra
students will have to be deferred until next year. And there might be some more
questions about whether students who have accepted their second choice might
now be able to revert to their top pick. There will be some irony that this surge in student numbers
follows the government attacking the idea that 50% of young people should go to
university. The fall-out from the A-level u-turn will almost certainly see
more than that number in university this year. Let's return to the education secretary's defence of the governmentâs
handling of A-level results in England. Gavin Williamson told reporters the extent of issues only became clear at
the weekend. Evidence from external
experts and regulator Ofqual showed âthere were real concerns about what a
large number of students were getting and whether that was a proper and fair
reflectionâ, he added, âIt became apparent to me over the weekend that we needed to
do more and I made the recommendation that we needed to move to teacher
grades."" Mr Williamson insisted he had challenged Ofqual âat every
stageâ and âhad consistent reassurancesâ the system was fair. He said he had been assured there were âsufficient
differencesâ with the Scottish system â which was abandoned last week. He added: âAs someone who went to a comp, went to a college,
I know how important is it to eradicate injusticesâ. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said he hopes BTecs in England will be subject to teacher assessments in the same way as A-levels and GCSEs. It comes after some Tory MPs
raised concerns they would not be included in the system announced this
afternoon. âWe're very much hoping that this will be encompassing BTecs
- we're just working with the awarding authorities to make sure that that's the
case,"" Mr Williamson said. He added: âThere's got to be
absolute parity in fairness right across the spectrumâ. BTecs are taken at many schools and further education colleges as an alternative to A-levels. Students in Wales have been reacting to the Welsh Government announcement that A-level and GCSE students there will also be awarded the grades estimated for them by their teachers. Last week's A-level results were criticised after 42% of grades were lower than teacher assessments. Emily Mundy, 18, from Anglesey, had faced losing her medical school place at either Manchester or Birmingham, after her chemistry exam was downgraded from A to B. She said she felt ""overwhelmed and excited"" following the Welsh Government's U-turn. ""I got excited and I quickly rang Manchester University. They said I need to send the [teacher- assessed] grades to UCAS and I should be accepted,"" she said.  Emily Mundy had been rejected to study medicine after her grades were downgraded David Mazoya, a 16-year-old GCSE student at Newport's Llanwern High School, was relieved: ""It felt at first like we would be assessed on how other people had done in the past and our school average. ""It wasn't really our work, it wasn't really my grade either."" But Scott Gilmour, an A-level student at Llanfair Caereinion school in Welshpool, said he feels ""nobody has a result that means anything"". He received two A*s and two As through the original algorithm method, and is going to Durham to study law. ""This U-turn by the government strips the results we've had of any value and credibility. It now means the national average for A-level results this year will be way above previous years,"" he said. Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford told the BBC he was âsorry for those young people whoâve had to live through such an uncertain periodâ. He insisted that the Welsh system for standardising grades was âfairerâ than
that used in other parts of the UK but said the decision was taken because âwe heard early in the day that things were moving elsewhereâ  and ministers wanted to ensure ""our young people
were not disadvantaged compared to others"".  Read more here. Alice EvansBBC News ""I'm relieved but quite frustrated at the same time. It's too late,"" says Zainab Ali, 18, from London. Zainab's predicted grades were an A* in history, an A in psychology, and a C in chemistry. But after she was given an A, B and a D on results day last week, she lost her place to study psychology at Queen Mary University, and the course is now full. ""I'm facing the consequences for the indecisiveness of people who are in charge,"" Zainab says. She's come to terms with the fact that she's going to her second choice, the University of Westminster, instead - but still feels frustrated because she had ""always wanted"" to go to Queen Mary's since being a child. Read more students' stories here.  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has confirmed that he will remove caps on university places across England, so that universities could âflex and expandâ the number of students able to attend and would not be fined for breaching the original cap. He said that students who would now see their grades go up, would be able to ask their first-choice university if their place could be reinstated. 

But he said âit is ultimately the universities that control their own admissions policies.â Mr Williamson also declined to award himself a grade for his management of the process.

âI always say, best not to grade yourself, itâs for other people to mark your homework.â Earlier, Mr Williamson said he was 'incredibly sorry"" for the ""unfairness"" on students. This video can not be played GCSE and A-level exams: Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exams model Hannah RichardsonBBC News education and social affairs reporter Students outside the Department for Education in London celebrated after the U-turn was announced For the past decade, Ofqual has
held the line against exam grade inflation like a knight of the realm - often
using some quite controversial statistical techniques. But in the case of the class of
Covid, it could be said the government's desire to maintain standards came at
too high a price. In commissioning the exams
regulator to take out an insurance policy in the form of its ill-fated
algorithm, that policy arguably went too far, despite ministers' best
intentions. When First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon reinstated estimated grades for students in Scotland, it was only a
matter of time before the other nations followed suit. Cue Northern Ireland,
then Wales and finally England. These students are all competing
for the same university places, and in the same jobs market after all. It was only when Education
Secretary Gavin Williamson and his deputy Nick Gibb saw how inconsistent the
results were that they were forced to relent. However, the crisis is far from
resolved, with tens of thousands of students who thought they had lost
their university places likely to get the grades they need after all. Universities say they will do
their best to accommodate them, but it is going to be a tough ask. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Poor pupils face 'two-year catch up after lockdown',"This video can not be played Parents and children from a school in St Helens told the BBC about their educational struggles during lockdown Lockdown widened learning gaps between richer and poorer primary school children, an analysis of thousands of families in England suggests. Children from poorer families did at least one hour less learning a day compared with those in richer families, the Institute of Fiscal Studies found. One head teacher says it could take up to two years to bring some children back to their correct attainment level. The government said a Â£350m tutoring scheme would help disadvantaged pupils. The IFS surveyed the parents of 5,500 school-aged children in England during lockdown. It compared the richest 20% of pupils with the poorest 20%. In May, the IFS saidchildren from wealthier families were spending more time studyingduring the pandemic than poorer children. And in its latest research, the think tank gives a more detailed picture of how coronavirus has widened the gap between the richest and poorest primary school children. Its findings suggest richer primary school children spent 75 minutes a day more on educational activities, compared with those in poorer families during lockdown. Data from five years ago suggested there was no gap in learning time among primary school pupils. Kirsty Tennyson says some of her children now have a ""mountain to climb"" Resources provided by schools are also unequally distributed, the IFS suggested. Around 42% of poorer primary-aged children received some sort of online lesson, conference call or support from their school, compared to 58% of richer children. And the IFS said it found evidence suggesting children who have had better access to learning resources are also more likely to spend more time learning than children who do not. Richer children were (37%) more likely to have their own space to study than their poorer counterparts. And although a large majority of children from all backgrounds had access to a computer or tablet, richer children were also more likely to have access to a computer or tablet. School catch up: No such thing as a free launch How will pupils catch up? A third of pupils 'not engaging with set work' What are the risks of opening schools? Kirsty Tennyson is Executive Principal of the Three Saints Academy Trust and one of her schools is St Mary and St Thomas C of E in St Helens. More than 60% of the children are on free school meals and nearly half have a special need. ""In a deprived area there is already a gap that we're striving to close - to narrow and ultimately to close [the gap],"" she says. ""Children who have not got that support at home and have not been able to access that learning - that gap will have grown hugely."" Ms Tennyson says her schools have detailed plans for the start of term to help the children catch up, but she admits there is a ""mountain to climb"". ""This is going to take into this academic year and the one after to really get those children back to where they need to be and for some children it will take longer.""

Morrisons considers ditching all 'bags for life',"The supermarket chain Morrisons is starting trials which could see it ditch all its plastic bags for life. From Monday it will offer strong paper bags instead of reusable plastic ones in eight stores, and, if customers seem happy, offer them at all 494 stores. Morrisons says the paper bags can carry up to 16kg, have handles and can carry up to 13 bottles of wine - as much as the plastic counterparts. All leading supermarkets are trying to cut plastics use. Waitrose said it was planning its own trial to remove bags for life later this year. But while two of the biggest, Tesco and Sainsbury, have both taken steps to curb plastic use around its stores, they defended the use of bags for life. Tesco said its were made from 100% recycled and fully recyclable plastic. It recently stopped using plastic bags to deliver online groceries following a successful trial last year. Sainsbury gave the same details for its bags, and said it was trialling a return to bagless deliveries, which were temporarily stopped amid the pandemic. Morrisons said there was evidence bags for life are being used once before being binned. It said a full replacement of its bags for life would save 90 million plastic bags being used each year, the equivalent of 3,510 tonnes of plastic per year. Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: ""We believe customers are ready to stop using plastic carrier bags as they want to reduce the amount of plastic they have in their lives and keep it out of the environment. ""We know that many are taking reusable bags back to store and, if they forget these, we have paper bags that are tough, convenient and a re-useable alternative."" Half of the stores involved in the trial are in Yorkshire with the other four in Cambridgeshire, Bristol, Abergavenny and Paisley. This video can not be played How plastic bags were supposed to help the planet Supermarkets began charging for plastic bags in England in 2015, after the government introduced a charge of 5p for single-use ones to cut their use. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland run their own schemes to reduce plastic bag use. In 2014,7.6 billion bags were handed out in England alone,,externalaround 140 per person a year,according to the environment department, Defra,external.

Ryanair cuts flights as EU virus rates hit bookings,"Ryanair has said it will cut capacity by 20% in September and October following ""notably weakened"" bookings in recent days. The airline said,externalthe drop was driven by ""uncertainty over recent Covid case rates in some EU countries"". It said cuts will mostly be in flight numbers as opposed to route closures. Ryanair said they will be ""heavily focused"" on countries where virus rates have led to the UK and Ireland re-imposing travel restrictions. The UK has re-imposed 14-day quarantines on travellers coming from countries including Spain, France and Sweden. Ireland has similar travel restrictions for countries including Germany and the UK. Ryanair had increased flights to 60% of its normal schedule this month after resuming services in July. But on Monday a spokesman for Ryanair said: ""These capacity cuts and frequency reductions for the months of September and October are unavoidable given the recent weakness in forward bookings due to Covid restrictions in a number of EU countries. ""Any affected passengers in September received email notification earlier today advising them of their options."" These include passengers being able to move flights, and get cash or voucher refunds, as set out under EU regulations. Meanwhile, rival airline Easyjet has confirmed that it will close bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle, with the loss of 670 jobs. There could be up to about 1,200 further UK job losses as Easyjet works through plans to cut staff due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airlinesaid in May that it wanted to cut 4,500 jobs. It has yet to begin consultations with its staff in other European countries. Easyjet began consultations on its plans to close the hubs in June after an announcement that it would cut staff numbers. The majority of crew at those bases have opted for voluntary redundancy, and that process will start for pilots this week, a spokesperson said. Out of the total number of all crew who have been at risk of redundancy, 93% have opted to take the voluntary package, which is ""enhanced"" - that is, they get more money than through compulsory redundancy. Johan Lundgren, Easyjet chief executive, said in a statement that the decision to close the bases had been ""very difficult"", and that it was taken due to the ""unprecedented impact of the pandemic and related travel restrictions"". This has been compounded by quarantine measures in the UK hitting demand for travel, he added. Ryanair cabin crew agree to pay cut to keep jobs British Airways: 'I felt forced into redundancy' Emirates set to cut 9,000 jobs, citing pandemic The aviation industry has been hit hard by coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions. In July, Ryanair's UK cabin crew and pilots agreed to temporary pay cuts to reduce job losses. In Germany, however, the airline said it would shut its base at Frankfurt Hahn airport after German pilots rejected pay cuts. British Airways wants to axe up to 12,000 jobs from its workforce of 42,000, and has said 6,000 have volunteered for redundancy. In July, Dubai-based airline Emirates said that as many as 9,000 could go. And planemaker Airbus announcedplans to cut 15,000 jobsin June, while aero-engine manufacturer Rolls Roycewill axe 8,000 roles. How are travel rules being relaxed?

'Highest temperature on Earth' recorded in USA reading of 130F (54.4C) recorded in Death Valley could be the highest reliable recording ever.US & Canada,"The potentially record-breaking temperature was recorded in Death Valley, California What could be the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth - 130F (54.4C) - may have been reached in Death Valley National Park, California. The recording is being verified by the US National Weather Service. It comes amid a heatwave on the US's west coast, where temperatures are forecast to rise further this week. The scorching conditions have led to two days of blackouts in California, after a power plant malfunctioned on Saturday. ""It's an oppressive heat and it's in your face,"" Brandi Stewart, who works at Death Valley National Park, told the BBC. Ms Stewart has lived and worked at the national park on and off for five years. She spends a lot of her time indoors in August because it's simply too uncomfortable to be outside. ""When you walk outside it's like being hit in the face with a bunch of hairdryers,"" she said. ""You feel the heat and it's like walking into an oven and the heat is just all around you."" Sunday's reading was recorded in Furnace Creek in Death Valley. Before this, the highest temperature reliably recorded on Earth was 129.2F (54C) - also in Death Valley in 2013. A higher reading of 134F, or 56.6C a century earlier, also in Death Valley, is disputed. It is believed by some modern weather experts to have been erroneous, along with several other searing temperatures recorded that summer. Dangerous heat wave forecast for south-west US Summers could become 'too hot for humans' Last decade confirmed as hottest on record According to a 2016 analysis from weather historian Christopher Burt, other temperatures in the region recorded in 1913 do not corroborate the Death Valley reading. Another record temperature for the planet - 131F, or 55C - was recorded in Tunisia in 1931, but Mr Burt said this reading, as well as others recorded in Africa during the colonial era, had ""serious credibility issues"". The current heatwave stretches from Arizona in the south-west, up the coast to Washington state in the north-west. It is expected to hit its peak on Monday and Tuesday, before temperatures start to drop later in the week. However, the sweltering heat will continue for at least another 10 days. As temperatures soared in California, a large ""firenado"" was observed on Saturday in Lassen County. The ""firenado"" was seen on Saturday California's Independent System Operator (CISO), which manages the state's power, has declared a Stage 3 Emergency, meaning ""when demand [for electricity] begins to outpace supply"". Because so much of the region's power relies on solar and wind energy, and because people use their electricity for air conditioning, during heatwaves the power grid becomes strained and is at risk of completely malfunctioning. In order to manage the state's demand for power and prevent a complete shutdown, officials are using scheduled rolling blackouts to control and conserve energy. Officials define extreme heat as a period of two to three days of high heat and humidity, with temperatures above 90F (32C). US public health body the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says heatwaves have killed more people on average than any other extreme weather event in the country. The immediate effects of heatwaves on the human body are heat cramps, dehydration and even potentially fatal heat strokes. However, extreme heat can also exacerbate pre-existing health conditions, including respiratory diseases, heart conditions and kidney disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. How to look after yourself in hot weather It can affect infrastructure, too. As well as straining power grids and causing blackouts, extreme heat can ground planes, melt roads, and cause the inside of cars to overheat to dangerous levels. Heatwaves can also have a severe impact on agriculture - either by causing vegetables to wilt and die, or by encouraging the spread of plant diseases.

"Wedding party of 100 'significant Covid breach'Police say the gathering at Waheed's Buffet and Banqueting Hall was a ""clear breach"" of restrictions.","The gathering at Waheed's Buffet and Banqueting Hall on Sunday was dispersed by police A wedding reception of more than 100 guests has been broken up by police in Blackburn. Blackburn with Darwenbrought in extra measureson 14 July after a spike in Covid-19 cases to try to avoid a Leicester-style local lockdown. Police said the event at Waheed's Buffet and Banqueting Hall in Randal Street was a ""significant breach"" of restrictions putting people ""at risk"". Police in Manchester also attended a wedding in a marquee with 50 guests. The organiser of the wedding in Whalley Range in the city was given a fixed penalty notice. The gathering in Blackburn on Sunday was dispersed and no further action was taken. Lancashire Police's Deputy Chief Constable Terry Woods said there were between 100 and 120 people at the venue. He said: ""The vast bulk of those people were asked to leave, they were very compliant, but in effect that wedding reception was closed down and what remained was a small number of people ""Today future action is going to be considered with the local authority to see what we can do with that premises to stop it happening again. ""For businesses we know it's hard but we will name and shame places that flout the regulations to this extent and there will be consequences."" Blackburn with Darwen brought in new measures in July after a spike in Covid-19 cases In a statement on Sunday police said: ""Disappointing incident in Blackburn this evening. ""Officers have attended a report of a significant breach of Covid restrictions, and found over 100 guests at a wedding reception. ""This is a clear breach of both local and national restrictions that puts everyone attending at risk. ""Officers have engaged with the attendees and at police instruction the gathering was dispersed without further issue. ""Please work with us to help keep everyone safe by following the guidelines and restrictions."" By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit A month on since tighter restrictions were introduced in Blackburn with Darwen, compared with most of the rest of England, the area still has one of the highest rates of new cases of coronavirus. In the week to 12 August there were 141 new cases recorded, 20 more than the week before. It works out at about 94 cases per 100,000 residents in the latest week. The official data for England released on Sunday shows only Northampton, which recorded hundreds of cases following an outbreak at a sandwich factory, and Oldham currently have higher rates of new infections than Blackburn with Darwen. The borough's director of public health Dominic Harrison said: ""It's not fair to the majority of the population who are sticking by the guidance we've put out. ""Many people have made sacrifices and for them, something like this is not fair. ""We as a council, with the police, are going to be looking to take stronger action than we have up to now on events like this over the coming weeks."" He said the area's coronavirus rates were currently ""high but contained, but they are not yet coming down as fast as we hoped"". Both Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire have local restrictions in place to prevent people socialising with other households. Police say they are also concerned that responses to emergencies are being delayed because of the number of 999 calls about social distancing breaches.

"A-level results U-turn: 'It's too late for me'University hopefuls say they feel ""let down"" and will still struggle to find places - after their grades are bumped up.UK","A-level students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm,after a government U-turn. Here are some reactions from those who, amid the confusion, still don't know if they have lost their university places. Emily Kingdoesn't feel much better about the government's decision, because ""not that much has changed"". The 18-year-old from Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, says being downgraded from a C to a U in A-level biology last week ""really knocked my confidence"" - and meant she was rejected from the University of Lincoln, where she had an offer to study midwifery. Emily has emailed the university since the government announcement, but still doesn't know if she's in or not. She's got no other offers so will face a year out and will apply again next year if Lincoln say no. ""I'd have to re-do that whole interview process again, which takes up a lot of time and a lot of money,"" she says. Emily says she's not found much comfort in the idea of being awarded her predicted grades. ""I'll always know that I was given a U. And I know that I didn't deserve that grade,"" she says. ""I'm pretty happy [about the U-turn] but also a bit annoyed. This should have happened last week. Or even a month ago."" Like Emily,Josh Reidis also repeatedly refreshing his inbox for email confirmation - he says he has been told there will be a place for him to study theology at Oxford University's Regent's Park College - in line with his initial offer - once he's sent over his teacher assessed grades. ""I'm just completely over the moon. It's been just an utterly horrific few days in terms of stress and anxiety, just trying to get this all sorted. Just to finally have confirmation that our grades will be changed - it's such a relief,"" he says. The 19-year-old, from Woking, says it was ""frustrating"" and ""heart-breaking"" to be downgraded last week. ""I was so furious that I was getting these grades that in no way shape or form represented any of the work I had done over the past two years."" Although his place is more or less secure, Josh's anger hasn't abated. He says the government has had months to come up with an alternative way of grading students whose exams were cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""They've had five or six months to do it, and to get it so wrong - it just puts so much stress on students. And [the confusion] really just showed that, for whatever reason, the students weren't the priority."" ""I'm relieved but quite frustrated at the same time. It's too late,"" saysZainab Ali, 18, from London, minutes after hearing about the U-turn. Zainab's predicted grades were an A* in history, an A in psychology, and a C in chemistry. But after she was given an A, B and a D on results day last week, she lost her place to study psychology at Queen Mary University of London - and was told the course had filled up. ""I'm facing the consequences for the indecisiveness of people who are in charge,"" Zainab says. She'd come to terms with the fact that she's going to her second choice, the University of Westminster, instead - but still feels frustrated because she had ""always wanted"" to go to Queen Mary's since being a child. ""It's just a very vibrant environment and I really had admired that. I just automatically fell in love,"" she says. After first speaking to the BBC, Zainab says Queen Mary decided to offer her a place. The university said on Monday evening that it was ""deeply sympathetic"" to all students affected by the U-turn, and that applicants with revised grades will be guaranteed a place if they meet the terms of their original offer. Although she is now likely to get her first choice of university after all, Zainab says the past week has been an ""awful"" and ""confusing"" experience. ""I felt like I've been really let down. Now [after the U-turn] it's a bit different, but I still feel a bit let down after all of that. It was really, really stressful."" Connor Bragger, 18, from Redditch, was given BCD last Thursday, and needed a BBB to get into a journalism course at Sheffield. He was predicted ABB so should, theoretically, be allowed to go now. But tonight, he's disappointed to find the phone lines for the University of Sheffield's admissions office are closed for the day - so despite the announcement, he doesn't yet know if he'll be heading there in September. ""Results day is [supposed to be] when you get answers - not more questions,"" Connor says. His second choice is the University of Gloucestershire, where he has an unconditional offer. But now he's got the grades for Sheffield, he hopes he can go there. Connor is trying to stay positive, and says he's pleased with the U-turn. ""There were two boxes that I was annoyed about not meeting, which was getting into my first choice, and getting grades I felt like I had earned. So even if I'm unable to get into my first choice, I feel as though I've now got results that I earned from my hard work all year. So if it doesn't all go to plan, I can still keep my head up a little bit higher."" This video can not be played A-level student Nina welcomes the government's U-turn which means she can train to become a vet Kath Burbidge's sonSam Thieris working a shift at B&Q near his home in Willsbridge, Bristol. At the same time, the 18-year-old is on the phone waiting his turn to speak to Cardiff University. He wants to see if they'll make space for him on the dentistry course he initially had an offer for, but was rejected last week as his predicted grades of A*AA were downgraded to BBB. ""I cried for 48 hours and didn't sleep after Thursday. I just feel so sorry for him,"" Kath says. ""He's worked so hard on everything."" Sam's A* in chemistry meant Cardiff offered him a place on their chemistry Masters course. He'd just decided to accept it - and therefore handed in his notice at B&Q - when the news came through that his grades would be bumped up. As she receives updates by text from Sam (he's now 20th in the queue), Kath wonders if he might take the chemistry offer instead. ""He's trying to just make the best of an awful, awful job that just never should have happened. Will he think 'I'll go and do chemistry now', just because he's fed up with the whole thing?""

Radio host James Whale reveals cancer diagnosisThe veteran presenter had kidney cancer 20 years ago but now the disease has returned.Entertainment & Arts,"Whale has been absent from his nightly TalkRadio show for the past month Veteran radio DJ James Whale has revealed he has cancer in his kidney, spine, brain and lungs. The 69-year-oldtold The Sun,externalhe received the diagnosis two weeks ago. It comes 20 years after he had one kidney removed because of a tumour. ""It's in my remaining kidney,"" he said. ""I've got a couple of small lesions in my lungs. I've got it in my spine. I've got it in my brain."" Whale has hosted a nightly evening phone-in show on TalkRadio since 2016. But the often controversial and confrontational host has been absent for the past month. He told The Sun he went to the doctor when he started forgetting names on air. ""The woman looked worried and she said, 'I'm so sorry. I've got really, really bad news for you. I'm afraid 20 years ago you had kidney cancer. Well, it looks like it's probably come back. You've got a tumour on your kidney.' ""And I thought, 'OK, well, 20 years later I'll have to do all over again.' And then she said, 'I'm sorry. Sadly it's spread. You've got small lesions in your brain and your lung, in your spine, in your pituitary gland.'"" He said he already had the tumour in his pituitary gland. He has been on immunotherapy and hormone replacement treatment, and is already feeling the benefits. ""I haven't got a proper prognosis yet because it's very early days, but this immunotherapy is a very new way of treating cancer - it gets the immune system to attack the tumours,"" he said. ""I'm probably going to be on tablets for the rest of my life but I've gone from being like a little shrunken, old man in the chair who's not eating and could hardly walk up the stairs, to where I can run upstairs."" TV hosts Piers Morgan and Charlotte Hawkins, fellow TalkRadio presenters Julia Hartley-Brewer and Ian Collins, and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage were among those sending well wishes. After his initial experience of cancer, Whale set up the James Whale Fund for Kidney Cancer in 2006, which merged with Kidney Cancer UK in 2015. Whale's wife Melinda died of lung cancer two years ago. The host came to prominence in the late 1980s as the host of The James Whale Radio Show, which was simultaneously broadcast on radio and TV, becoming a Friday night fixture on ITV until the mid-1990s. In 1995, he moved to radio station TalkSport, but was fired in 2008 after calling on his listeners to vote for Boris Johnson in the London mayoral election. Regulator Ofcom ruled that was a serious breach of impartiality rules, and fined the station Â£20,000. He then hosted the drivetime show for LBC and the breakfast show on BBC Essex, and took part in the 18th series of Celebrity Big Brother in 2016 alongside Christopher Biggins and Frankie Grande. He joined TalkRadio three months later, being suspended for a spell in 2018 after an interview with a rape victim which the station said ""completely lacked sensitivity"".

U-turn on A-levels and GCSE as teacher grades used,"This video can not be played A-level student Nina welcomes the government's U-turn which means she can train to become a vet A-level and GCSE students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, after a government U-turn. It follows uproar after about 40% of A-level results were downgraded by exams regulator Ofqual, which used a formula based on schools' prior grades. GCSE results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland come out on Thursday. Ofqual chair Roger Taylor and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson apologised for the ""distress"" caused. Teachers' estimates will be awarded to students unless the computer algorithm gave a higher grade. Mr Williamson said the results of mock exams - which critics said can be inconsistent across different schools - will now not be a key part of the appeals process. He said students and parents had been affected by ""significant inconsistencies"" with the grading process. In a statement, he acknowledged the ""extraordinarily difficult"" year for students, after exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the Department for Education had worked with Ofqual to design ""the fairest possible model"" but it had become clear that the process of awarding grades had resulted in ""more significant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process"". ""I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve,"" said Mr Williamson. Can I accept a degree place and sit the exam? And other questions How did the A-level algorithm work? A-level results U-turn is 'too late' for students BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' The education secretary told reporters No 10 does not get ""any of the detailed data before schools do"" but when it saw these ""quite concerning outliers"" they asked questions. Mr Williamson said he hoped BTecs would be subject to teacher-assessed grades, and that the government was working with the ""awarding authorities"" to ensure this happened. He also revealed the temporary cap on the number of places that universities can offer to students would be lifted. In a tweet,external, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had been ""forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion"". He criticised Downing Street's handling of students' results as ""a complete fiasco"" and said its about-face was a ""victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week"". A-level students held protests across the UK in response to grades they said were unfairly awarded. For the past decade, Ofqual has held the line against exam grade inflation like a knight of the realm - often using some quite controversial statistical techniques. But in the case of the class of Covid-19, it could be said the government's desire to maintain standards came at too high a price. In commissioning the exams regulator to take out an insurance policy in the form of its ill-fated algorithm, that policy arguably went too far, despite ministers' best intentions. When First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reinstated estimated grades for students in Scotland, it was only a matter of time before the other nations followed suit. Cue Northern Ireland, then Wales and finally England. These students are all competing for the same university places, and in the same jobs market after all. It was only when Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and his deputy Nick Gibb saw how inconsistent the results were that they were forced to relent. However, the crisis is far from resolved, with tens of thousands of students who thought they had lost their university places likely to get the grades they need after all. Universities say they will do their best to accommodate them, but it is going to be a tough ask. After the algorithm - what happens next? Ofqual chair Mr Taylor apologised for the ""difficulty"" caused to students over its grading system. He told the BBC: ""I would like to say sorry. We have recognised the difficulty that young people have faced coping with the receipt of grades that they were unable to understand the basis on which they had been awarded."" This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""Incredibly sorry for all those students who have been through this"" He added the regulator realised it had taken ""the wrong road"" and decided to ""change course"" after seeing the ""anxiety"" it had caused to young people and the added ""administrative burden on teachers at a time when they need to be preparing for the new school term"". A-level student Jess Johnson, who stood to lose out on a Â£16,000 scholarship, said she was ""thankful"" and ""excited"" about the change to results. The 18-year-old needed an A in English to earn a place at St Andrews, along with a Â£4,000-a-year scholarship, but she was downgraded from her predicted A to a B and was initially told she had been rejected. That downgrading is now set to be reversed. Ms Johnson, who studied at Ashton Sixth Form College in Greater Manchester, said: ""I think it would have been unfair if (Northern) Ireland, Scotland and Wales made the change and we didn't, so I'm very glad."" However, she questioned why it had taken so long to make the change, after A-level results came out on Thursday, saying ""a lot of stress and anxiety"" had been caused as a result of the wait. Alaa Muhammad faced missing out on her dream of studying medicine after her A-level results were downgraded. On hearing the news of the U-turn, she said: ""I am ecstatic, I am so so happy. I was so hopeless a couple of days ago and now I feel like I can finally breathe again."" Ms Muhammad, from south-east England, had seen her grades fall from a predicted AAB to EED. She said she had paid more than Â£2,000 to take re-sits at a private college after her studies in year 12 and 13 were disrupted. She now hopes she will be able to study medicine at a top university in Pakistan. NI education minister in U-turn on A-level grades Estimated results to be used for Welsh exam grades Scottish school pupils have results upgraded Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), welcomed the decision ""to put an end to the grading fiasco"". He added the move would mean there was grade inflation, but he said this was a ""small price to pay for remedying the manifest injustices"" caused by the algorithm. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said universities were being ""as flexible as possible with applicants"" but that the ""late policy change"" has created ""challenges"". He called on the government to ""step up and support universities"", adding that Universities UK was seeking ""urgent clarification"" on a number of issues. In a statement, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said about 69% of 18-year old applicants across the UK were currently placed with their first-choice university, which it said was ""higher than at the same point last year"". It said students who did not have places at their first or insurance choice of university did not need to make their decision immediately. Ucas said it would be issuing new advice for students and schools, which would be sent directly to students, as soon as they were able to take a decision. The government's handling of exam results has also been criticised by opposition parties and Conservative MPs. Robert Halfon, the Tory chairman of the commons education select committee, said the government had ""serious questions"" to answer. Speaking to the BBC's PM programme, he said he'd hoped No 10 would have developed with Ofqual a ""clear, easy to understand [and] fair"" system which allowed every pupil to appeal via their head teacher if they believed their grade was unfair. He said he also hoped that Ofqual would explain its standardisation process to schools; but ""none of this had happened"" and there were now ""serious questions about what on earth has gone on"". Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesperson, said that No 10 had been ""dragged, kicking and screaming to this position"" and that Mr Williamson ""must go.""

Premature baby 'helps' with marriage proposalJohn Sellors asked his partner to marry him by having a sign put in his new son Cobie's incubator.Nottingham,"Nurses helped to organise the unusual proposal The father of a premature baby surprised his partner by proposing to her with a little help from his two-day old son. John Sellors' son Cobie was being cared for at King's Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire when Mr Sellors came up with the idea. He organised for a ring to be placed in Cobie's incubator and a sign asking ""will you marry my daddy"". Cobie was welcomed into the world 10 weeks early Sian Stafford, 26, said the gesture came as a shock but her answer was yes. The couple, from Pinxton in Derbyshire, welcomed their son into the world 10 weeks early at the start of August. Cobie was taken to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit and weighed 3lb 9oz (1.36kg) at the time of the proposal. The couple have been together for eight years Mr Sellors said: ""I'm not usually the romantic type, but I really wanted to do something to lift Sian's spirits and she'd been dropping hints for a while about wanting to get married. ""The nurses were great and really helped. They told me to take Sian for a coffee and they'd sort it out for when we got back. ""When we got back the message and ring were there and it was such a lovely moment, I can't thank them enough."" Miss Stafford said: ""I was so shocked. I really didn't expect it and I was really overwhelmed. ""When we got back on to the unit, the nurses told me that Cobie had been taken off his breathing machine, so I needed to go and look, as I'd be able to see his face more. ""I was concentrating so much on Cobie that I didn't even notice the note and ring at first. ""Then John said, 'look, I think Cobie wants to know something'. I read the note and it was such a surreal but happy moment."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The couple, who have been together for eight years and already have a daughter, said they would start wedding planning at a later date. They said Cobie was still in intensive care but was doing well and they hoped to bring him home in the coming weeks.

Why did the A-level algorithm say no?,"A protest over A-level results gathered in Westminster Accusations of unfairness over this year's A-level results in England have focused on an ""algorithm"" for deciding results of exams cancelled by the pandemic. This makes it sound Machiavellian and complicated, when perhaps its problems are really being too simplistic. There have been two key pieces of information used to produce estimated grades: how students have been ranked in ability and how well their school or college has performed in exams in recent years. So the results were produced by combining the ranking of pupils with the share of grades expected in their school. There were other minor adjustments, but those were the shaping factors. Labour calls for teachers' predictions in A-levels Anger from head teachers over 'unfair' A-levels What's next in arguments over A-levels It meant that at a national level there would be continuity - with this year's estimated results effectively mirroring the positions of recent years. But it locks in all the advantages and disadvantages - and means that the talented outlier, such as the bright child in the low-achieving school, or the school that is rapidly improving, could be delivered an injustice. The independent schools and the high-achieving state schools with strongest track records of exams were always going to collect the winners' medals, because it was an action replay of the last few years' races. And those in struggling schools were going to see their potential grades capped once again by the underachievement of previous years. In Scotland the accusations of unfairness prompted a switch to using teachers' predicted grades. These predictions were collected in England too - but were discounted as being the deciding factor, because they were so generous that it would have meant a huge increase in top grades, up to 38%. Students have challenged the fairness of estimated grades There were also doubts about the consistency and fairness of predictions and whether the cautious and realistic could have lost out to the ambitiously optimistic. As a consequence, while teachers might have decided the ranking order of pupils, their predictions have mostly been sidelined. And the ""downgrading"" of almost 40% of results has reflected the lowering of teachers' predictions back to the levels that previous history suggests would have been achieved. There have been calls to use teachers' predicted grades instead If these predictions had not been gathered there would not have been any ""downgrading"" - and perhaps the stories would have been about the overall results being the highest ever - with more top grades than in almost 70 years of A-levels. Instead there has been uncertainty and distrust. What has troubled and angered schools has been that while the averages have been protected, individuals could be losing out. They say the lowering of grades seems sometimes inconsistent and unfair and they are frustrated at the inability to refine what has seemed a clumsy process. For instance, there was no direct connection between an individual's prior achievement and their predicted grade. So if someone got all top grades at GCSE and then moved to a low-performing school for A-level, they might find themselves locked out of getting the grades they might have got if they'd gone to a different high-achieving school. Schools working hard to make rapid improvements in tough circumstances feel themselves boxed in and that their young people have missed out on opportunities in university. The problems of social mobility and regional inequalities are not hard to see. But it's going to be harder to unpick what has happened. The appeals system could be swamped by angry schools and their pupils wanting to challenge results. Will there be whole-school changes to grades which were decided at a whole-school level? No one knows yet how appeals over mock exams might work. It was such a last-minute addition that it was announced before the regulator could decide any rules for it. The ""algorithm"" also suggests the sense of powerlessness felt by those students disappointed by their results. It was a ""computer says 'no'"" way of missing out. Now ministers and exam regulators will have to find a human way back.

How did the A-level algorithm work?,"GCSE students in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are receiving results based on teacher assessments, after a last-minute change to the system. They were originally due to receive marks worked out in a mathematical model, or algorithm, but this was abandoned following an uproar over last week's A-level results. It followsa similar change in Scotland. Students in the UK did not sit exams this year because schools were closed following the coronavirus lockdown. In England, they were given grades by the official exam regulator, Ofqual. Teachers were asked to supply for each pupil for every subject: An estimated grade A ranking compared with every other pupil at the school within that same estimated grade These were put through an algorithm, which also factored in the school's performances in each subject over the previous three years. The idea was that the grades this year - even without exams - would be consistent with how schools had done in the past. The teachers' rankings would decide which pupils received the top grades in their particular school. Video: What on earth is an algorithm anyway? What are BTec Nationals and how do they work? Can I accept a degree place and sit the exam? And other questions Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Ofqual said this was a more accurate way of awarding grades than simply relying on teachers' assessments. It argued that teachers were likely to be more generous in assigning an estimated mark, and this might lead to grade inflation - a much higher number of pupils getting the top grades. Similar algorithms were applied for pupils in Wales and Northern Ireland. They were also used in Scotland for the Scottish Higher qualification, which is broadly comparable with A-levels. When A-level grades were announced in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 August, nearly 40% were lower than teachers' assessments. There were similar issues in Scotland. In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers recommended and 3% were down two grades. What's more, the downgrading affected state schools much more than the private sector. The prime minister defended the system as ""robust"", but there was widespread criticism from schools and colleges, as well as from the opposition and some Conservative MPs. Ofqual said thatits objective for A-level results,externalwas to ensure that national results were ""broadly similar to previous years"". However, by basing it so much around previous school performance, a bright student from an underperforming school was likely to have their results downgraded through no fault of their own. Likewise, a school which was in the process of rapid improvement would not have seen this progress reflected in results. In Scotland, figures showed that the Scottish Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds was reduced by 15.2 percentage points, compared with only 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. Private schools are usually selective - and better-funded - and in most years will perform well in terms of exam results. An algorithm based on past performance will put students from these schools at an advantage compared with their state-educated equivalents. There was a further factor at workaccording to statisticians Philip Nye and Dave Thompson of FFT Education Datalab.,externalThey said class sizes in independent schools are usually significantly smaller than in state schools. Where there were fewer than five pupils studying a subject at a school, their grades were decided only on the basis of teachers' estimates. Where there were between five and 15 entrants for a subject, teachers' assessments would still be given more weight. On 17 August, the government announced thatA-level results would be changedto reflect the original teachers' estimates - the so-called centre assessed grade or CAG - rather than the result produced by the algorithm. The only exception would be if a student had received a higher grade from the algorithm than the CAG. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson acknowledged ""significant inconsistencies"" in the grading process and apologised for the ""distress"" caused. He also announced that GCSE results would be decided according to teacher assessments. This year has seen a considerable amount of grade inflation as a result of the last week's events. Universities now have to deal with a rush for places by students who had previously been downgraded. Alistair Jarvis, the head of the university body Universities UK, says there are ""challenges"" ahead, such as capacity, staffing and facilities. What's happening with university admissions? Many universities will be able to accept extra students, particularly now the government has withdrawn its cap on the numbers each institution can admit. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that the government is""absolutely looking at""also lifting the cap on the number of places to study medicine. But there could be logistical problems for some oversubscribed universities or courses. Durham University, for example, isoffering financial incentivesto students who defer entry until 2021.

Spain's ex-king Juan Carlos confirmed to be in UAE,"Juan Carlos is under investigation in Spain, as well as in Switzerland Spain's former king Juan Carlos has been living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since 3 August, the Spanish royal palace has confirmed, putting an end to speculation over his whereabouts. On 3 August,the ex-king made the shock announcement that he was leaving Spainamid a corruption investigation. The 82-year-old travelled to the UAE on 3 August ""and he remains there"", a spokesman said, giving no more details. The ex-king's finances are under scrutiny in a major corruption probe. He denies any wrongdoing and has said he is available if prosecutors need to interview him. Spain's monarchy shaken by ex-king's Swiss fortune Earlier this month, he announced the move in a letter to his son, Felipe, to whom he handed the throne six years ago. He said at the time was making the decision ""in the face of the public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are generating"" and in the hope of allowing his son to carry out his functions as king with ""tranquillity"". It was first reported that he had travelled to the Dominican Republic, but Spanish media later said he had arrived in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. However until now, neither the palace nor the government had confirmed his whereabouts. The former king is said to have travelled to the UAE on several occasions since his abdication in 2014. He is reported to be close to a number of key figures including the UAE's de facto leader, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 after close to 40 years in power and handed power to his son Felipe. His decision to give up the throne came after a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband and a controversial elephant hunting trip the monarch took during Spain's financial crisis. The controversies however did not stop there. In June this year, Spain's Supreme Court launched an investigation into Juan Carlos's alleged involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after the ex-king lost his immunity from prosecution following his abdication.

Exam results: Your questions answered,"A-level and GCSE students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, after a government U-turn. Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at theAssociation of Colleges,,externalare answering your questions. Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used How have exam results been decided this year? Catherine Sezen and Eddie Playfair offer personalised advice on what to do next Now that we know that the grades predicted by teachers - also known as centre assessment grades, or CAGs for short - will stand, this means that there will be a five-point increase in A* grades and a 10-point increase in A grades or above. University courses may well be able to manage the increased demand for high tariff courses, particularly if there is a relaxation of the cap on growth - called the student number controls. Health Secretary Matthew Hancock has saidthe government is also considering lifting the cap on medical places. I'm so sorry you missed your firm offer. First of all it may be worth revisiting this with Durham in case the position has changed. Universities are working hard to honour the offers they've made, whether UK or international, and Covid-19 has disrupted education for students across the world. UK and international applicants are not really competing for the same places though, as the admissions and funding systems are different. For example, the removal of Student Number Controls means that many universities could now offer more places to their UK students, and this does not apply to international students. I'm afraid the triple lock system has been overtaken by events and your son's D will stand, since it is higher than the CAG. There may be some grounds for an appeal and it's worth discussing this with his college or school. There's no reason to expect that this year's higher-than-usual grades will impact the opportunities for next year's students. Universities will be aware of the different grade profiles in different years and are likely to adjust their offers and decision-making accordingly. If your daughter's offer has been confirmed this shouldn't be withdrawn. Students may have some opportunity to change their minds but confirmed offers should stand. The government's announcement thatit is considering lifting the cap on the number of medical student placesmay also help. As far we are aware, students awaiting their GCSE grades on Thursday will receive their CAG from their school or college - and students who received their A or AS-level results last Thursday will be reissued their CAG. If students' calculated grades were higher than the CAG, their calculated grade will stand. If you received results last Thursday, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. If you are expecting results this week, your school or college should confirm the process. Schools and colleges have very thorough quality assurance systems in place to ensure that results are not biased. The grades given by teachers are moderated at department and centre level to ensure that they are as fair as possible. Pupils protesting outside Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's constituency office BTecs are structured very differently to A-levels, and so the approach to awarding them is also different. BTecs were not subject to the same statistical moderation process as A-levels. They comprise modular units that students complete and are assessed at regular stages during their course of study, so prior to March 2020, students had already ""banked"" graded units for their qualification. These formed part of the evidence used to award grades for the externally assessed units and the final overall qualification grade. If you have individual concerns about BTec or other technical and vocational qualifications, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. Universities are used to dealing with fluctuations in numbers between years but at this stage it's impossible to tell whether the number of university places in 2021 will be affected at all. Students taking exams next summer will certainly have been impacted by the disruption this year - and of course further disruption can't be ruled out. There have been some adaptations made to assessment and content for 2021 but the assumption is that public exams will go ahead next summer - the public health situation permitting. If exams take place next year, the grading system should be more like a normal year, but there will be a case for some ""leniency"" to allow for disruption. You are absolutely right - this summer's Centre Assessed Grades are separate from the predicted grades used for UCAS or other purposes and they may not be the same. The process for producing CAGs was careful and rigorous, and was subjected to internal moderation. It is these CAGs and rankings which were submitted to awarding organisations as part of this summer's process. The ""calculated"" grades which were issued last week had been statistically adjusted resulting in 39% of them being downgraded. These have now mostly been superseded by the original CAGs where they are higher. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster - but no one will have lower A-level grades than they got last week and many will have higher grades. If your son has accepted this place and is happy with it he doesn't need to do anything more except perhaps confirm that decision with the university concerned. We can't give a legal opinion on that, but universities are doing their best to honour all the offers they made - including where a student's grade has now changed. They will need a few days to sort this out but they will have been helped by the lifting of student number controls which would have limited how many places they could fill. As far as we know, the autumn series is still going ahead so students will have the opportunity to take exams this autumn as well as next summer - so the ""resit"" option is still available where it makes sense. These are questions which should be raised directly with the IB Organisation. We know that Ofqual has asked it to scrutinise the grades awarded this summer to ensure they have been delivered in line with Ofqual's new process. I'm sure that receiving universities will want to be as flexible and helpful in responding to candidates with IB Diplomas as they were with A-level candidates. We gather that there have been some delays with some BTec awards and we know that Pearson - the company which runs BTecs - is working to resolve this. We think that only 0.5% of BTec centre assessed grades were adjusted downwards and it's not clear whether they will now be moved up. Will BTec students have their grades changed? Ofqual has just published an update on vocational and technical qualifications. Although calculated results have been issued for many vocational and technical qualifications, in only a very few cases has the same kind of statistical standardisation process of CAGs been used and so Monday's announcement shouldn't impact on the majority of vocational qualifications. You can findmore information on the Ofqual website.,externalIf you still have any questions about your result I would suggest that you speak to your school or college. It's possible that more students with Scottish Highers might have a small impact on places available in English universities, but the difference in scale between the two countries probably means this will not be significant overall. I am sure universities will want to honour the offers they've made. This was the year of the results without any exams being taken It's been clear from the start that unfortunately some private candidates would not be able to receive CAGs, and this is obviously far from ideal. It may be possible for them to progress on to the course they want if they can be assessed by the institution they wish to join. There is also the option of taking exams in the autumn which will result in grades which can be used for progression. You will need to discuss this with both your firm and insurance universities as soon as possible, now that you know that your CAG will be your final grade. Now that your son knows what his final grade is, he should discuss this with both his first choice university and also with the university he applied to through clearing. Calculated grades were higher than CAGs for 2.3% of all entries, and these will be honoured. Yes, it is possible to accept an offer and take the exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the best option. If your son or daughter is 18 then the college cannot share information with you unless your child agrees, as they are now classified as an adult. They should be able to tell you how results will be sent out, or whether your son or daughter can collect them from the college. The college will be able to provide information, advice and guidance to your son or daughter to help them think about next steps. This might help as the basis of a chat with your child. The best thing to do is to ask the university how long they will keep the place open while you weigh up the options. Universities are being very flexible this year. The alternative offer from your firm choice, including a foundation year, is of course an extra year. If you really want to go to that university it is a good option, but the other university course may also be right for you. Give the university a call and then you will know how long you have got to consider both. Your daughter might get results if the school or college that was going to enter her had sufficient evidence (course work for example) to give her a centre assessed grade. If not there will be an opportunity for your daughter to take an exam in the autumn. The school or college will have more details about that. You need to discuss this with the college or school you attended in 2019-20 to consider the various options open to you. Simply repeating a year is not generally recommended unless there are exceptional circumstances - but of course 2020 has been pretty exceptional! If you have the possibility of progressing to a higher level - for example university - that might be the best option, but don't make any final decisions without getting support and advice from your college or school first. When producing CAGs, centres will have predicted how a student would have performed assuming they had received all the additional support and access arrangements which they require because of a disability. Hopefully, any mock processes would also have included that additional support and this is definitely worth discussing with your centre. The system this year was designed to make sure that the class of 2020 was not disadvantaged, and to produce outcomes which are broadly similar to previous years. So we expect the national grade profile to reflect this. This should provide reassurance for employers, universities and colleges that this year's grades have an equivalent value to those of previous years. How can I find a new job? The autumn exams are an opportunity for students entered this summer to take an exam. The grade they are awarded will have equal value and so this can inform any applications they are making to university in 2021. The current plan is for exams next summer to go ahead as normal, with a few alterations, and they should be seen as equivalent to any other year. In the future this is certainly worth exploring, but given the timeframe this year it would have been very difficult to ensure that all students would have been adequately prepared to undertake exams online. Not all students will have had appropriate equipment or spaces to undertake exams. Do you have a question about your exam results? Use the form to send it to us.

Victoria Derbyshire: My violent father & fear for lockdown victims,"Growing up, I remember my whole body tensing every time I heard my father's key in the back door. What mood would he be in when he came home from work? Would he provoke an argument? Would it lead to him hitting me, whipping me with his belt or just slapping me round the back of my head? I was fortunate I could escape sometimes to my best friend's house down the road to get out of his way. And the next day my father would go to work again, and I'd go to school, which meant respite from the disruptive shouting and cruel violence. The love in our lives came from my amazing mum who did everything she could to make up for his failings. This article contains descriptions of violence some readers may find disturbing. Me as a child growing up in Lancashire When the prime minister told us all to stay at home because of coronavirus, one of my first thoughts was for those living in abusive households - women, men and children, essentially trapped, forced to stay inside week after week. What would happen to them? Spending the last few months finding out about the reality of domestic abuse under lockdown has been shocking - but I've also met women who've courageously escaped during the most challenging circumstances. I've spent time inside refuges which were full, meeting support workers on the ground who were under pressure, and talking to people who were subjected to levels of abuse they often hadn't experienced before. Jess* had been with her violent husband for many years. During their relationship he'd assaulted her multiple times - punching her, strangling her, controlling what she wore and how she styled her hair. She says she had to ask his permission to make a cup of tea and even go to the loo. But when lockdown was imposed, the violence escalated to more extreme levels. Like most of us, Jess and her husband were watching Boris Johnson as he instructed the nation to stay at home to stop the spread of Covid-19. It was then that he turned to her and said chillingly, 'Let the games begin'. Her story is one of the most brutal I've ever heard. She told me he raped her more than a hundred times. ""Curtains would get closed, TV would be up loud, front door would be locked, music would be turned up so nobody could hear me screaming,"" she recalls. He burned the top of her legs with cigarettes 'so no-one would ever want her'. BBC Panorama has learned the intensity of abuse escalated in lockdown - offences included poisoning and strangulation. Women's Aid has been working on the first in-depth research project about the effect confinement had on domestic abuse. Of the people they spoke to, almost two-thirds of those living with their abuser said the violence got worse, and three-quarters said lockdown had made it harder for them to escape. Meanwhile, calls to the Respect Men's Advice Line for male victims increased by 65% during the first three months of restrictions. For some, the pandemic was used by their abuser as a form of control. When I asked Jess what the 'stay at home' message meant to her, she simply said: ""Death."" Three weeks into lockdown her husband declared 'today will be the last day you see daylight'. She knew she had to get out or she feared she'd be leaving her home ""in a wooden box"". For me school was a respite from my father's violence When I was around 12 years old, I remember running to the police station after my father locked my mum in their bedroom and began beating her up. I was scared he was going to kill her. Our phone had been cut off because he hadn't paid the bill - another way of trying to isolate us from friends and family. I ran as fast as I could the mile or so to the station and, out of breath, pleaded with the officer behind the desk to come and help. But in lockdown, some of those in violent relationships struggled to even pick up the phone to dial 999, let alone run for help, because their abuser was at home 24/7. Jess knew she had to get through to the police somehow in order to save her life, but she couldn't alert her husband. While he slept on the sofa, she googled 'how to contact the police without calling them', terrified he would wake up. After texting REGISTER to 999 and receiving an initial response, she sent them her address. Officers arrived within minutes. Panorama has found in the first seven weeks of UK lockdown someone called police for help about domestic abuse every 30 seconds - that's both female and male victims. This video can not be played I returned to the house where I grew up, for the first time in 35 years, for BBC Panorama It took the Westminster government 19 days after imposing restrictions to announce a social media campaign to encourage people to report domestic abuse, as well as an extra Â£2m for domestic abuse helplines. Fiona Dwyer, chief executive of Solace, one of the biggest providers of refuge spaces told me, ""the government's inaction and slowness to respond made an incredibly challenging period even more challenging"". ""If you look at who was in the Cabinet, it's a lot of very privileged men. So maybe it's not an issue they think about,"" she says. I haven't met one survivor, charity worker or domestic abuse advocate in the last few months who said they had seen any evidence the government in England had considered the effect lockdown would have on those living in an abusive household. But safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins denied they were too slow to act. The government was ""alive to the risks of domestic abuse"", was talking to charities in the early days and ""very much responding"" she told me. Women told me Covid-19 had been used against them as a form of control In the nearly three weeks between the introduction of lockdown and the government launching its You Are Not Alone campaign, 11 women, two children and one man were killed in alleged domestic abuse cases. Responsibility for those deaths lies with the perpetrators, but could lives have been saved had the government acted more quickly? ""There will be time to reflect on lessons to be learned across the pandemic"", Ms Atkins told me. She said she was working to scrap the October deadline requiring charities to spend the emergency government funding they received. Stopping lockdown domestic abuse on my street Domestic abuse victims to get better protection in family courts Jess had to leave her home and her only option was to try to find a place in a refuge. Her life since she arrived at one in Wales run by the charity Llamau has been transformed - thanks to support from the dedicated staff and caring fellow survivors. The UK potentially faces a further coronavirus spike and more local lockdowns as we head towards winter. Solace's Fiona Dwyer said the UK government has to make sure there is ""robust sustainable funding for future services"". My parents got divorced when I was 16 and that's when we escaped the violence. But not all domestic abuse survivors leave their home. Why should they have to? Others can't because they are terrified their abuser will come after them; many simply can't afford to go because they aren't financially independent. For those like Jess who did take that step during lockdown, it has been liberating. ""I feel safe. I don't feel threatened. I can go to bed at night knowing nothing's going to happen to me."" If you've been affected by domestic violence you can get help by calling the National Domestic Abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247 and in Scotland 0800 027 1234. There is also the Respect Men's Advice Line on 0808 801 0327. *Not her real name You can watch BBC Panorama 'Escaping my Abuser' on BBC One at 19:30 BST and on BBC iPlayer.

House party links to two Covid clustersDozens of students are self-isolating as cases in north east Glasgow and Lanarkshire are officially linked.,"Some of the eight positive cases are pupils at Bannerman High School Covid-19 clusters in Glasgow and Lanarkshire have been linked to house parties. A joint statement from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire said the two boards were working together on the outbreak. A total of 14 linked Covid cases have been identified in north-east Glasgow in addition to eight North Lanarkshire cases. Meanwhile, a pupil at a primary school in Paisley has also tested positive. A contact tracing operation is now under way at Todholm Primary school. Renfrewshire council said there was no current evidence the virus had been transmitted inside the school and it remained safe for pupils and staff to attend. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire confirmed on Monday that the cases in their areas were linked. They also said that evidence of social gatherings with no social distancing was a factor in their investigation. A spokesman for both organisations said: ""We can confirm there are links to cases across both health boards. We work closely on cross-board issues on a regular basis, including on the current clusters, where investigations are ongoing. ""There is currently no evidence of transmission in the schools. ""There is evidence that mixing socially, particularly around social gatherings in houses, without maintaining physical distancing measures can transmit the virus and is a factor in this investigation."" Health officials say there is no evidence to suggest the virus is being spread at Caldervale High School Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch warned that ""unregulated"" house parties were a ""real concern"". He said young people were meeting in numbers beyond what was allowed and with no physical distancing. ""This our first real palpable example of [house parties] giving people positive infections of a virus that can make us very sick,"" he said. Mr Leitch toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programmecommunication was a difficulty and said ""influencers"" and teachers should be used to help get the message across to young people that house parties were helping spread the infection. It emerged on Sunday that a pupil at Bannerman High in Baillieston, who had attended classes when the school reopened last week, had tested positive for the virus. Several other pupils at Bannerman High had previously tested positive,but began self-isolating prior to the return to class last week. Five pupils at nearby schools in North Lanarkshirehave tested positive in recent days, including: Three pupils from St Ambrose High School in Coatbridge One pupil from St Andrew's High School in Coatbridge One pupil from Caldervale High School in Airdrie There are also three further linked cases who are not pupils or staff at the schools. Test and Protect is now tracing those who were in contact with the pupil at Bannerman High and Glasgow City Council has written to parents. Fifth pupil tests positive in Lanarkshire cluster Pupils from two Coatbridge schools test positive for Covid-19 Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Parents of a senior pupil at one of the affected schools in North Lanarkshire told the BBC they were ""disappointed"" their son had to self-isolate after ""the selfish actions of others"". They did not want to be identified, but said they were informed their son was sitting close enough to one of the positive cases for more than 15 minutes and had to self-isolate. His mother said: ""We've done everything we can to protect our children during lockdown. So we are really disappointed that the actions of others has resulted in this. ""We got a phone call on Sunday night and our world turned upside down. Test and trace phoned to advise that our teenage son had been identified as a contact of a positive pupil at Caldervale High. ""Our son had already seen it via social media, he knew who the boy was and had sat next to him in a class. And because he had sat next to him for over 15 minutes he has to get contacted by Test and Protect."" Teenagers from schools in Lanarkshire and Glasgow have had to be tested and will have to self-isolate She added: ""He has to isolate until 27 August. He's now missing school because of selfish actions of people having house parties. ""We believe this has all stemmed from a house party at Coatbridge involving a large number of kids. People who are encouraging young people to get involved in parties do not understand the implications on others."" The child's father said he had to take his son to be tested at Ravenscraig on Monday morning. He added: ""there were three cars in front and we had to do the test ourselves in the car. By the time we had finished there were another 10-15 cars with kids in them doing tests."" Nicola Sturgeon said the outbreak was a community outbreak involving school pupils During the Scottish government coronavirus briefing on Monday, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I am concerned about what appears to be a rising number or cases, albeit that many of these new cases we are seeing are linked to known clusters and outbreaks. ""But nevertheless it's a really sharp reminder for us that the threat of the virus has not gone away. ""All of us need to be really, really careful, ultra-careful when it comes to abiding by all of the public health advice."" She said people must be careful about the school connection as they are community outbreaks that involve school pupils but are not school outbreaks. Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, assistant professor in infection and immunity at Edinburgh University told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programmeshe would not be surprised if young people meeting socially were spreading the virus. She said: ""Kids are kids and they like to gather with each other and as we know from studies that came out from Public Health England last week that secondary school pupils actually shed the virus in similar amounts to adults. The virus is going to spread and transmit in these gatherings. ""The pupils themselves are at very low risk of severe disease but on the other hand, they are probably quite asymptomatic and can carry the virus into their families."" Under the current Scottish government rules no more than eight people from a maximum of three households are allowed to gather indoors. Social distancing applies to anyone from separate households, unless they are under the age of 12. CASES:Where are the latest cases? DEATHS:Who is dying and where?

Radio host James Whale reveals cancer diagnosis,"Whale has been absent from his nightly TalkRadio show for the past month Veteran radio DJ James Whale has revealed he has cancer in his kidney, spine, brain and lungs. The 69-year-oldtold The Sun,externalhe received the diagnosis two weeks ago. It comes 20 years after he had one kidney removed because of a tumour. ""It's in my remaining kidney,"" he said. ""I've got a couple of small lesions in my lungs. I've got it in my spine. I've got it in my brain."" Whale has hosted a nightly evening phone-in show on TalkRadio since 2016. But the often controversial and confrontational host has been absent for the past month. He told The Sun he went to the doctor when he started forgetting names on air. ""The woman looked worried and she said, 'I'm so sorry. I've got really, really bad news for you. I'm afraid 20 years ago you had kidney cancer. Well, it looks like it's probably come back. You've got a tumour on your kidney.' ""And I thought, 'OK, well, 20 years later I'll have to do all over again.' And then she said, 'I'm sorry. Sadly it's spread. You've got small lesions in your brain and your lung, in your spine, in your pituitary gland.'"" He said he already had the tumour in his pituitary gland. He has been on immunotherapy and hormone replacement treatment, and is already feeling the benefits. ""I haven't got a proper prognosis yet because it's very early days, but this immunotherapy is a very new way of treating cancer - it gets the immune system to attack the tumours,"" he said. ""I'm probably going to be on tablets for the rest of my life but I've gone from being like a little shrunken, old man in the chair who's not eating and could hardly walk up the stairs, to where I can run upstairs."" TV hosts Piers Morgan and Charlotte Hawkins, fellow TalkRadio presenters Julia Hartley-Brewer and Ian Collins, and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage were among those sending well wishes. After his initial experience of cancer, Whale set up the James Whale Fund for Kidney Cancer in 2006, which merged with Kidney Cancer UK in 2015. Whale's wife Melinda died of lung cancer two years ago. The host came to prominence in the late 1980s as the host of The James Whale Radio Show, which was simultaneously broadcast on radio and TV, becoming a Friday night fixture on ITV until the mid-1990s. In 1995, he moved to radio station TalkSport, but was fired in 2008 after calling on his listeners to vote for Boris Johnson in the London mayoral election. Regulator Ofcom ruled that was a serious breach of impartiality rules, and fined the station Â£20,000. He then hosted the drivetime show for LBC and the breakfast show on BBC Essex, and took part in the 18th series of Celebrity Big Brother in 2016 alongside Christopher Biggins and Frankie Grande. He joined TalkRadio three months later, being suspended for a spell in 2018 after an interview with a rape victim which the station said ""completely lacked sensitivity"".

Breaking|Breaking newsU-turn over A-level and GCSE resultsA-level and GCSE students in England will have their results based on teacher assessments after U-turnUK,"This video can not be played A-level student Nina welcomes the government's U-turn which means she can train to become a vet A-level and GCSE students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, after a government U-turn. It follows uproar after about 40% of A-level results were downgraded by exams regulator Ofqual, which used a formula based on schools' prior grades. GCSE results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland come out on Thursday. Ofqual chair Roger Taylor and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson apologised for the ""distress"" caused. Teachers' estimates will be awarded to students unless the computer algorithm gave a higher grade. Mr Williamson said the results of mock exams - which critics said can be inconsistent across different schools - will now not be a key part of the appeals process. He said students and parents had been affected by ""significant inconsistencies"" with the grading process. In a statement, he acknowledged the ""extraordinarily difficult"" year for students, after exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the Department for Education had worked with Ofqual to design ""the fairest possible model"" but it had become clear that the process of awarding grades had resulted in ""more significant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process"". ""I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve,"" said Mr Williamson. Can I accept a degree place and sit the exam? And other questions How did the A-level algorithm work? A-level results U-turn is 'too late' for students BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' The education secretary told reporters No 10 does not get ""any of the detailed data before schools do"" but when it saw these ""quite concerning outliers"" they asked questions. Mr Williamson said he hoped BTecs would be subject to teacher-assessed grades, and that the government was working with the ""awarding authorities"" to ensure this happened. He also revealed the temporary cap on the number of places that universities can offer to students would be lifted. In a tweet,external, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had been ""forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion"". He criticised Downing Street's handling of students' results as ""a complete fiasco"" and said its about-face was a ""victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week"". A-level students held protests across the UK in response to grades they said were unfairly awarded. For the past decade, Ofqual has held the line against exam grade inflation like a knight of the realm - often using some quite controversial statistical techniques. But in the case of the class of Covid-19, it could be said the government's desire to maintain standards came at too high a price. In commissioning the exams regulator to take out an insurance policy in the form of its ill-fated algorithm, that policy arguably went too far, despite ministers' best intentions. When First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reinstated estimated grades for students in Scotland, it was only a matter of time before the other nations followed suit. Cue Northern Ireland, then Wales and finally England. These students are all competing for the same university places, and in the same jobs market after all. It was only when Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and his deputy Nick Gibb saw how inconsistent the results were that they were forced to relent. However, the crisis is far from resolved, with tens of thousands of students who thought they had lost their university places likely to get the grades they need after all. Universities say they will do their best to accommodate them, but it is going to be a tough ask. After the algorithm - what happens next? Ofqual chair Mr Taylor apologised for the ""difficulty"" caused to students over its grading system. He told the BBC: ""I would like to say sorry. We have recognised the difficulty that young people have faced coping with the receipt of grades that they were unable to understand the basis on which they had been awarded."" This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""Incredibly sorry for all those students who have been through this"" He added the regulator realised it had taken ""the wrong road"" and decided to ""change course"" after seeing the ""anxiety"" it had caused to young people and the added ""administrative burden on teachers at a time when they need to be preparing for the new school term"". A-level student Jess Johnson, who stood to lose out on a Â£16,000 scholarship, said she was ""thankful"" and ""excited"" about the change to results. The 18-year-old needed an A in English to earn a place at St Andrews, along with a Â£4,000-a-year scholarship, but she was downgraded from her predicted A to a B and was initially told she had been rejected. That downgrading is now set to be reversed. Ms Johnson, who studied at Ashton Sixth Form College in Greater Manchester, said: ""I think it would have been unfair if (Northern) Ireland, Scotland and Wales made the change and we didn't, so I'm very glad."" However, she questioned why it had taken so long to make the change, after A-level results came out on Thursday, saying ""a lot of stress and anxiety"" had been caused as a result of the wait. Alaa Muhammad faced missing out on her dream of studying medicine after her A-level results were downgraded. On hearing the news of the U-turn, she said: ""I am ecstatic, I am so so happy. I was so hopeless a couple of days ago and now I feel like I can finally breathe again."" Ms Muhammad, from south-east England, had seen her grades fall from a predicted AAB to EED. She said she had paid more than Â£2,000 to take re-sits at a private college after her studies in year 12 and 13 were disrupted. She now hopes she will be able to study medicine at a top university in Pakistan. NI education minister in U-turn on A-level grades Estimated results to be used for Welsh exam grades Scottish school pupils have results upgraded Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), welcomed the decision ""to put an end to the grading fiasco"". He added the move would mean there was grade inflation, but he said this was a ""small price to pay for remedying the manifest injustices"" caused by the algorithm. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said universities were being ""as flexible as possible with applicants"" but that the ""late policy change"" has created ""challenges"". He called on the government to ""step up and support universities"", adding that Universities UK was seeking ""urgent clarification"" on a number of issues. In a statement, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said about 69% of 18-year old applicants across the UK were currently placed with their first-choice university, which it said was ""higher than at the same point last year"". It said students who did not have places at their first or insurance choice of university did not need to make their decision immediately. Ucas said it would be issuing new advice for students and schools, which would be sent directly to students, as soon as they were able to take a decision. The government's handling of exam results has also been criticised by opposition parties and Conservative MPs. Robert Halfon, the Tory chairman of the commons education select committee, said the government had ""serious questions"" to answer. Speaking to the BBC's PM programme, he said he'd hoped No 10 would have developed with Ofqual a ""clear, easy to understand [and] fair"" system which allowed every pupil to appeal via their head teacher if they believed their grade was unfair. He said he also hoped that Ofqual would explain its standardisation process to schools; but ""none of this had happened"" and there were now ""serious questions about what on earth has gone on"". Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesperson, said that No 10 had been ""dragged, kicking and screaming to this position"" and that Mr Williamson ""must go.""

Workers boo Belarus president as protests spreadA factory photo op for Alexander Lukashenko backfires when workers demand his resignation.Europe,"This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been heckled by workers on a visit to a factory as anger mounts over his disputed re-election. Workers chanted ""leave"" and booed the long-time leader of the ex-Soviet state as he insisted he would not allow a new vote after allegations of ballot fraud. Strike action spread to state TV, with staff walking out on Monday. Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has suggested she could act as an interim leader. Police violence towards opposition supporters, as well as the alleged poll-rigging in the 9 August vote, fuelled a big protest rally in the capital Minsk on Sunday. Mr Lukashenko has led Belarus since 1994, maintaining close relations with neighbouring Russia, on which Belarus heavily relies for energy supplies. 'The people will not forgive this' In pictures: Striking images from Belarus protests 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change According to local, independent news site Tut.by, Sunday's opposition rally in Minsk was ""the largest in the history of independent Belarus"". A wave of anger has been rising since the Central Election Commission said Mr Lukashenko had won 80.1% of the vote and Ms Tikhanovskaya - 10.12%. Striking workers gathered outside the Minsk tractor factory on Monday Hundreds of protesters have been wounded and two have died in clashes with police over the past week. Some 6,700 people have been arrested, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of security forces. On a visit to a Minsk tractor plant on Monday, Mr Lukashenko sought to defend his disputed victory, telling workers: ""We held the election. Until you kill me, there will be no other election."" 'If you croak we don't care': brutality in Belarus However he said he was willing to hold a referendum and ""hand over my authority in accordance with the constitution - but not under pressure and not via street protests"". As Mr Lukashenko spoke at the factory, workers booed him and chanted ""leave"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Last week, workers at state-run factories walked out in solidarity with the protesters, and more strikes are planned for this week, increasing the pressure on Mr Lukashenko. At state TV, staff walked out in protest against censorship and the election results. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who left for Lithuania after denouncing the results, insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. In a video message released on Monday, she said she was ready to become a ""national leader"" in order to restore calm and normality, freeing political prisoners and preparing for new elections. This video can not be played Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and President Lukashenko give very different messages Russian TV news bulletins have been making ominous parallels between Belarus 2020 and Ukraine 2014. Ukraine's pro-Western revolution led to Moscow sending in its special operations forces to annex Crimea and Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Six years on, could Russia's military intervene in Belarus? On paper, at least, such a move would appear counter-productive. The opposition movement in Belarus is not anti-Russia/pro-Europe - it is anti-Lukashenko. If Russia were to send in troops to shore up the Belarusian leader, it risks alienating the Belarusian people and creating anti-Moscow sentiment. True, Moscow is determined to keep Belarus within what it sees as Russia's sphere of influence. The Kremlin's ultimate goal is deeper integration with its neighbour - a fully-fledged union state (with Vladimir Putin at the helm). It could still achieve this through political leverage. The Kremlin has a pathological fear of ""coloured revolution"" on its doorstep. But Minsk 2020 is not Kyiv 2014. Belarus is not choosing between East and West. The Belarusian people are outraged by the brutality of their security forces. So much so that even Mr Lukashenko's traditional base - including the state factory workers - are deserting him. Rival rallies were held in the capital, with the opposition event appearing to attract much higher numbers. An official report said 65,000 people had attended the presidential rally but unofficial estimates were as low as 10,000. Unofficial estimates for the opposition gathering ranged between 100,000 and 220,000. Mr Lukashenko described the opposition as rats There were reports of state sector workers being forced to attend Mr Lukashenko's rally or face the threat of losing their jobs. What's happening in Belarus? Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile As the president spoke, the anti-Lukashenko protesters gathered for a peaceful rally near a war memorial in the centre of Minsk. A number of officials, as well as current and former police officers, have resigned. Protesters were out in force in Minsk on Sunday The Belarusian ambassador to Slovakia, Igor Leshchenya, declared his solidarity with the protesters.  He told the BBC: ""I represent Belarus and the Belarusian people, which according to our constitution is the only source of power."" EU leaders are to hold an emergency video summit on Wednesday.EU foreign ministers agreed last week to prepare new sanctions,externalagainst Belarusian officials responsible for ""violence, repression and the falsification of election results"". The UK said on Monday it did not accept the results of the ""fraudulent"" election. ""The world has watched with horror at the violence used by the Belarusian authorities,"" saidForeign Secretary Dominic Raab,external. Also on Monday, US President Donald Trump said his administration was following the ""terrible situation"" in Belarus closely. President Lukashenko has sought Russian help, saying President Vladimir Putin has promised to provide comprehensive assistance in the event of any external military threat. In a conversation on Sunday, the two men discussed ""the situation in Belarus, taking into consideration the pressure the republic was being put under from outside"", the Kremlin said.

"Ministers urged to avoid exams chaos hitting GCSEsAs pressure mounts over the exams crisis, ministers in England and Wales are set to make an announcement.Family & Education","Pupils protested outside the Staffordshire constituency office of Education Secretary Gavin Williamson Pressure is mounting on ministers to let teacher-assessed grades stand in England to avoid a second wave of exams chaos hitting GCSE results this week. About 40% of A-Level results were downgraded after the exams regulator Ofqual used an algorithm based on schools' previous results. The government is set to make an announcement on this issue this afternoon. Northern Ireland's government said it would use teachers' grades for GCSEs. The Welsh Government has announced thatteachers' grades will now be awarded to A-level and GCSE students. It will also affect AS-levels, skills challenge certificates and the Welsh Baccalaureate. Speculation is growing that a similar move will be made in England, bringing all four nations in line with each other. Scotland already said students' teacher-assessed grades would stand after a huge outcry over unfairness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, currently on holiday, spoke to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and his senior officials earlier on Monday to discuss the growing outcry over results. The Department for Education and Ofqual are now expected to address the issue for England in a statement this afternoon, but it is understood they will hold off from delaying GCSE exam results. Some 700,000 pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive results for GCSEs they never sat this week. And there is concern that the anomalies and unexpected results tied to Ofqual's algorithm will hit GCSE candidates harder. Last week in England, 280,000 A-level results were downgraded from teachers' assessments, almost 40% of the total. In Wales, it was 42% of A-level papers. Asked repeatedly about a possible U-turn on the results system, the prime minister's spokesman would only say the government continued to work to come up with the fairest possible system. ""We recognise that many people are concerned and anxious about the exam grading system,"" he said, adding: ""We will not be delaying GCSE results."" The spokesman went on to say that the PM had confidence in Mr Williamson and the head of Ofqual, Sally Collier. There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the 'calculated' results Mary Curnock-Cook, former head of the university admissions service Ucas, said a switch back to teacher-assessed grades at A-level could mean the some 55,000 students who had missed out on university places could be in a position to go back and ask for their place to be reinstated. The government has been facing a growing backlash from Conservative backbenchers, with at least 17 MPs criticising the system. The list includes former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt, who said she would be seeking meetings with the Department for Education on this issue. Ms Mordaunt said: ""This group of young people have lost out so much already, we must ensure that bright, capable students can progress on their next step."" Head teachers called last week's A-level results ""unfair and unfathomable"", with many gifted pupils losing top university places and pupils in sixth forms and further education colleges particularly badly hit by the algorithm. Why did the A-level algorithm say no? 'Huge mess' as exams appeal guidance withdrawn Anger over 'unfair' A-level results Kate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the government had had weeks to resolve the matter. ""Here we are just two or three days away from GCSE results and the government still hasn't got a grip on the problem."" Labour has called for teacher-assessed grades to be used for A-levels in England, adding the should remain open for GCSEs. This video can not be played Demonstrating students said they feel ""very let down"" and that the grading is unfair On Twitter, BBC Newsnight's Lewis Goodall said he had received scores of messages from downgraded students. One of these, David from Gateshead, was meant to be the first of his family to go to university with an offer from Cambridge to read engineering. His teachers estimated A*AA but the algorithm allocated him A*AB because his FE college had never had such good grades in maths before - and now his place is on hold. With his ""dream for years"" shattered David said: ""It doesn't feel real. ""The college thought it would be the best year we've ever had - but the algorithm says it's not allowed."" Pembroke College will have to wait as David's results were downgraded Private school pupil Abby from Bosworth also got in touch. She had offers from Lancaster and York to do geography. She needed ABB but got ABU. The U grade in maths, for which she was expecting a B or a C, means her chances of a university place are very limited. ""It's not been great to be honest. ""I cried the whole day yesterday and the day before. ""It's not justice. It's immoral."" Former Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said it was ""inevitable"" that the government would have to accept the grades estimated by teachers. ""The great danger for Gavin Williamson now is he's losing the confidence of head teachers around the country,"" he said, adding that ""he is losing the dressing room"". The Grammar School Heads Association and the private schools' body, the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), also back a switch to teacher-assessed grades, as do the teaching unions and many prominent education academics. Many students are expected to appeal, although there has been confusion over the appeals process afterOfqual withdrew its guidance for challenging resultshours after publishing it on Saturday. New guidelines was still being drawn up by Ofqual, the Department for Education said on Sunday evening. A Department for Education spokesman said hundreds of thousands of students had received a calculated grade to ""enable them to progress"" and that the department aimed ""to build as much fairness into the appeals system as possible"". On Sunday, hundreds of students held protests against grades they believe were unfairly awarded. Students warned 'your algorithm doesn't know me' during protests in London Meanwhile, analysis by the Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) looked at 65,000 exam entries in 41 subjects in its member colleges and found that grades were 20% lower than historic performances for similar students in those colleges. The SFCA said it had not found a single one where the results were above the three-year average. Ofqual says that itsobjective for A-level results,externalthis year has been to ensure ""national results are broadly similar to previous years"". The research showed that Ofqual ""not only failed to produce broadly similar results, but has in fact produced worse results in every single subject"", the SFCA said. Dr Mark Fenton, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, said the results had also been unfair to some of its students. He told the BBC that ""a great injustice has been done"" with ""utterly baffling"" results for some students with the ""only fair outcome"" being to accept grades predicted by teachers. Three of Oxford University's colleges -Worcester, Wadham and St Edmund Hall - have confirmed that all places offered to UK students will be secured irrespective of their A-level results. Ahead of GCSE results due to be released on Thursday, former Conservative Education Secretary Lord Kenneth Baker urged the government to delay the publication of grades until the situation surrounding A-levels had been resolved. ""If you are in a hole, stop digging,"" Lord Baker said.

Premature baby 'helps' with marriage proposalJohn Sellors asked his partner to marry him by having a sign put in his new son Cobie's incubator.,"Nurses helped to organise the unusual proposal The father of a premature baby surprised his partner by proposing to her with a little help from his two-day old son. John Sellors' son Cobie was being cared for at King's Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire when Mr Sellors came up with the idea. He organised for a ring to be placed in Cobie's incubator and a sign asking ""will you marry my daddy"". Cobie was welcomed into the world 10 weeks early Sian Stafford, 26, said the gesture came as a shock but her answer was yes. The couple, from Pinxton in Derbyshire, welcomed their son into the world 10 weeks early at the start of August. Cobie was taken to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit and weighed 3lb 9oz (1.36kg) at the time of the proposal. The couple have been together for eight years Mr Sellors said: ""I'm not usually the romantic type, but I really wanted to do something to lift Sian's spirits and she'd been dropping hints for a while about wanting to get married. ""The nurses were great and really helped. They told me to take Sian for a coffee and they'd sort it out for when we got back. ""When we got back the message and ring were there and it was such a lovely moment, I can't thank them enough."" Miss Stafford said: ""I was so shocked. I really didn't expect it and I was really overwhelmed. ""When we got back on to the unit, the nurses told me that Cobie had been taken off his breathing machine, so I needed to go and look, as I'd be able to see his face more. ""I was concentrating so much on Cobie that I didn't even notice the note and ring at first. ""Then John said, 'look, I think Cobie wants to know something'. I read the note and it was such a surreal but happy moment."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The couple, who have been together for eight years and already have a daughter, said they would start wedding planning at a later date.

She needed ABB but got ABU. The U grade in maths, for which she was expecting a B or a C, means her chances of a university place are very limited. ""It's not been great to be honest. ""I cried the whole day yesterday and the day before. ""It's not justice. It's immoral."" Former Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said it was ""inevitable"" that the government would have to accept the grades estimated by teachers. ""The great danger for Gavin Williamson now is he's losing the confidence of head teachers around the country,"" he said, adding that ""he is losing the dressing room"". The Grammar School Heads Association and the private schools' body, the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), also back a switch to teacher-assessed grades, as do the teaching unions and many prominent education academics. Many students are expected to appeal, although there has been confusion over the appeals process afterOfqual withdrew its guidance for challenging resultshours after publishing it on Saturday. New guidelines was still being drawn up by Ofqual, the Department for Education said on Sunday evening. A Department for Education spokesman said hundreds of thousands of students had received a calculated grade to ""enable them to progress"" and that the department aimed ""to build as much fairness into the appeals system as possible"". On Sunday, hundreds of students held protests against grades they believe were unfairly awarded. Students warned 'your algorithm doesn't know me' during protests in London Meanwhile, analysis by the Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) looked at 65,000 exam entries in 41 subjects in its member colleges and found that grades were 20% lower than historic performances for similar students in those colleges. The SFCA said it had not found a single one where the results were above the three-year average. Ofqual says that itsobjective for A-level results,externalthis year has been to ensure ""national results are broadly similar to previous years"". The research showed that Ofqual ""not only failed to produce broadly similar results, but has in fact produced worse results in every single subject"", the SFCA said. Dr Mark Fenton, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, said the results had also been unfair to some of its students. He told the BBC that ""a great injustice has been done"" with ""utterly baffling"" results for some students with the ""only fair outcome"" being to accept grades predicted by teachers. Three of Oxford University's colleges -Worcester, Wadham and St Edmund Hall - have confirmed that all places offered to UK students will be secured irrespective of their A-level results. Ahead of GCSE results due to be released on Thursday, former Conservative Education Secretary Lord Kenneth Baker urged the government to delay the publication of grades until the situation surrounding A-levels had been resolved. ""If you are in a hole, stop digging,"" Lord Baker said.

Breaking|Breaking newsPredicted results to be used for Welsh exam gradesA-level and GCSE students will now be given the grades predicted by their teachers.Wales,"This video can not be played Emily Mundy will now be able to study medicine in Manchester A-level and GCSE students will be awarded the grades estimated for them by their teachers, the Welsh Government has announced. Last week's A-level results were criticised after 42% of grades were lower than teacher assessments. It came after they had been processed by an algorithm. Students inEnglandandNorthern Irelandwill also have their results based on teacher estimates, in decisions taken on Monday. Pupils inScotlandhad their exam results upgraded last week after an outcry. Despite the U-turn, on Monday Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford defended the original process. Exams were cancelled across the UK after schools shut in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week's results in Wales were produced by a system known as standardisation - designed to ensure grades were ""as fair as possible"" and consistent with previous years. But it was criticised by students and politicians for producing unfair grades for individual students. Student tells minister: 'You've ruined my life' 'Unfair' A-level results claim as grades lowered 'Huge mess' as English exams appeal guidance withdrawn The U-turn also affects AS-levels, skills challenge certificates and the Welsh Baccalaureate. But students who received higher grades than those predicted by teachers will keep them. GCSE results in Wales are due to be published on Thursday. Students protested outside the Senedd at the weekend to call for the change Emily Mundy, 18, from Anglesey, had faced losing her medical school place at either Manchester or Birmingham, after her chemistry exam was downgraded from A to B. She said she felt ""overwhelmed and excited"" following the Welsh Government's U-turn. ""I got excited and I quickly rang Manchester University. They said I need to send the [teacher- assessed] grades to UCAS and I should be accepted,"" she said. ""I couldn't really believe it. It's felt like a long time since Thursday where I thought I was going to have to do something else. It means that I'll be able to get the career I wanted and the opportunity to help people."" David Mazoya said he would have been assessed on other people's results under the algorhithm David Mazoya, a 16-year-old GCSE student at Newport's Llanwern High School, was relieved: ""It felt at first like we would be assessed on how other people had done in the past and our school average. ""It wasn't really our work, it wasn't really my grade either."" But Scott Gilmour, an A-level student at Llanfair Caereinion school in Welshpool, said he feels ""nobody has a result that means anything"". He received two A*s and two As through the original algorithm method, and is going to Durham to study Law. This video can not be played Exams had been scrapped because of the coronavirus lockdown ""This U-turn by the government strips the results we've had of any value and credibility. It now means the national average for A-level results this year will be way above previous years,"" he said. In an interview with BBC Wales Mr Drakeford said the original process, was ""fairer"" than that used elsewhere in the UK, and was ""more based on evidence"". But he said the decision to award estimated grades instead was taken because ""we heard early in the day that things were moving elsewhere"" in the United Kingdom. ""We were determined that we would have a level playing field where our young people were not disadvantaged,"" he said. Education Minister Kirsty Williams, pictured right-of-centre, said the balance of fairness lies with awarding grades He said the system used to calculate results published last week ""would have delivered the best A-level results ever [with] more young people going to university in Wales than ever before"". UK government education minister Gavin Williamson apologised on Monday for the ""distress"" caused by the exams process in England. Asked if he would apologise to students, Mr Drakeford said he was ""sorry for those young people who've had to live through such an uncertain period"". His comments echoed those of the Education Minister Kirsty Williams, a Liberal Democrat politician in the Labour-led Welsh Government. Promising an independent review, she said ""the balance of fairness now lies with awarding centre assessment grades to students, despite the strengths of the system in Wales"". The announcement followed calls for predicted grades to be honoured fromLabour politicians in the Welsh Parliament, as well as Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. A-Level students recieved their results last Thursday Cardiff University vice-chancellor Colin Riordan said the move ends uncertainty and students ""who have been in limbo"" would get in if they got the grades they needed. ""If we make an offer to an applicant and they achieve the grades we asked for, we will give them a place,"" he said. The algorithms that make decisions about your life BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' ""The only issue is there are areas like medicine and dentistry where places are limited and it may be that if the numbers rise too much, we may have to ask people to see whether they'd like to accept an offer for the following year. ""But I think the applicants who have got the grades through this process now will get a place, for sure."" Universities Wales, which represents institutions in Wales, said: ""Admissions approaches will inevitably vary by institution, however, learners can be assured that every effort will be made by universities to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by this year's processes.""Â Exam watchdog Qualifications Wales, which oversaw the grade standardisation process that led to last week's results, said it was ""working through the details and impacts of this announcement"". ""We know that this is an extraordinarily difficult and upsetting time for learners, parents and their teachers, and there are many questions that we do not currently have answers to,"" it said in a statement. Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the announcement was ""seriously overdue"" and called for a ""full investigation into this debacle"". ""The Welsh Government should apologise to students, teachers and schools for what they've put them through over the past few weeks,"" she said. Suzy Davies, education spokeswoman for Welsh Conservatives, welcomed the education minister's review. ""It is reassuring that the minister has listened to the Welsh Conservatives and other parties in the Welsh Parliament, but especially pleasing that she heard the voices of young people up and down the country,"" she added. The momentum building against the A-level grading mechanism made this climbdown look inevitable even before it was announced. So why did it take ministers so long to get there? Kirsty Williams and other cabinet colleagues had nailed their colours to the ""robustness"" of the system in Wales - the implication being that it was more credible than other parts of Britain because actual exam results (the AS levels) were factored in here, unlike elsewhere. But as the inboxes of members of the Senedd filled with tales of individual injustices against students who will have the vote for the first time in next year's Senedd elections, that position became unsustainable - especially with GCSE results looming fast.

More coronavirus-vaccine volunteers needed,"More than 100,000 people have signed up to take part in future NHS trials of a coronavirus vaccine - but more volunteers are needed, researchers say. They want as many people as possible to enrol, to speed up their efforts to find a safe and effective jab. And they are particularly looking for more volunteers from the ""high-priority groups"" disproportionately affected by the virus  - those belonging to ethnic minorities or aged over 65.

Pressure grows on ministers on A-level grades,"Students gathered outside the Senedd at the weekend to protest against the grading system First Minister Mark Drakeford will face his own Labour backbenchers later as criticism grows over last week's A-levels results. A total of 42% of grades predicted by teachers were lowered. Welsh Labour group chairman Vikki Howells and the Welsh Tories joined Plaid Cymru in calling for students to be honoured their predicted grades. Education Minister Kirsty Williams has allowed appeals if ""there is evidence"" pupils should have had higher grades. But pressure is growing on the Welsh Government to honour's students predicted grades. Meanwhile six Welsh council education cabinet members say they have  ""no confidence"" in the system which has allocated this year's A-level results. Happy students in Swansea on Thursday - but not all A-level pupils got the grades they expected Ms Howells, Welsh Labour Senedd group chairman and member of the Senedd (MS) for Cynon Valley, said the algorithm used to assess grades after A-Level exams were cancelled ""unjustly caused problems and considerable stress for students whose futures may depend on fair and accurate results"". She called for predicted grades to be used instead. Caerphilly Labour MS Hefin David said the appeals process ""will overwhelm any manageable system and students can't wait for it"". ""We need to move to teacher assessed grades now. In the longer term we need a standardised system of moderation across Wales and put the trust in teachers to manage the local moderation of grades."" A-levels: 22,000 sign grade change petition Lost school time 'will hurt economy for 65 years' Should I go to university this year? 'We feel so lost' - Young face job despair Suzy Davies, Welsh Conservative spokeswoman,tweeted,externalthat an appeals process ""will just add"" to the ""misery caused"" by A-level grading. She described A-level results that have come out as ""unfair"" and said guarantees over the appeals process must be given in the next 24 to 48 hours or there should be no alternative than to use teachers' predicted grades. ""The process promised to bring fairness,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastwith Claire Summers. ""But it hasn't. If there is no prompt guarantee (over appeals), confidence in that will dissolve as well."" Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland also said she could now see no alternative but to switch to using predicted grades. She called it an ""exceptional year"", adding: ""Grade inflation is not the worst thing that could happen but these young people are having their dreams shattered and being left with a complete lack of faith in our system."" Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian called for the grade standardisation process to be dropped ahead of GCSE results later this week,in line with Northern Ireland. A Senedd committee is being recalled on Tuesday during the summer recess to discuss the grades She said that would ""provide fairness and justice to its young people who have worked so hard, and have faced an unprecedentedly difficult and confusing time"". ""The Welsh Government should be doing all it can to alleviate stress for this cohort which is likely to face many more challenges from the fallout of the pandemic in the coming years, rather than putting further barriers in their path."" Ms Gwenllian added that the assessment grades given by schools and and colleges should ""replace the flawed system adopted by Welsh Government and an announcement to that effect needs to be made"" on Monday. Suzy Davies calls for guarantees to be given over appeals A letter, signed by senior councillors and officers at Anglesey, Gwynedd, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham councils, called on Ms Williams to undertake an ""urgent review"" of the situation. ""We do not feel that the process has been fair and robust especially to vulnerable learners who have been Welsh Government priority during this term,"" the letter said. ""It is quite clear that the A-level brand has been protected at the expense of individual learners who have missed out on forecasted grades when national distribution has reached school level,"" it added. It said in some schools nearly 70% of grades had been downgraded - withthe number of signatures on a petitionstarted on the weekend now standing at 26,000. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price was one of the speakers at Sunday's protest on the Senedd steps ""This has resulted in individual pupils being awarded grades by WJEC where schools can't explain the rationale behind the awarding,"" the letter said. ""Too many pupils in north Wales are at a significant risk of being disadvantaged and missing out on opportunities to the future employment pathways of their choice when compared to their peers in other countries in the UK, especially Scotland. ""Schools report that they have no confidence in the present appeal process."" It also expresses concern the same will happen when GCSE results are revealed on Thursday. Emily Mundy has been rejected to study medicine after her grades were downgraded Emily Mundy, from Anglesey, was offered places at Manchester and Birmingham to train for her dream job as a doctor. During lockdown the 18-year-old volunteered three times a week at Ysbyty Gwynedd on wards, handing out teas and coffees and chatting to patients. But after getting a B in chemistry, despite being predicted an A, she was rejected from all the universities she put as her choices and may now have to wait a year before she can go to university. ""I was pretty hopeful I would get in, I was pretty hopeful I would get the grades I wanted seeing as I did pretty well in my GCSEs,"" she said. ""They have told me that the best thing I can do is to appeal because the centre grade was an A. If I get the appeal result by 7 September, then they will be able to get me in. ""If I don't then I will have to resit the exam, or I will even have to do it next year, or I will have to go to university next year."" When Emily took part in a UCAS test, she was in the top 10% in the UK. Pupils want to be given the grades their teachers predicted for them The Welsh Parliament is on its summer break, but the Children, Young People and Education Committee has been recalled and will meet on Tuesday. The exam board WJEC is set to outline further details on the process to submit appeals early in the week. The Welsh Government said more than 4,000 students would benefit from the guarantee that no final grade would be lower than an AS grade. ""This is around 15% of all A-level students and makes a significant difference to the overall impact of variations between final grades and centre assessed grades,"" said a spokesperson. ""Even before the AS floor, 94% of the grades are the same as or within one grade of the centre assessed grades."" A spokesperson said Qualification Wales and the WJEC would share the full details but appeals could now be made where there was evidence of internal assessments judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the grade awarded.

Ministers urged to avoid exams chaos hitting GCSEs,"Pupils protested outside the Staffordshire constituency office of Education Secretary Gavin Williamson Pressure is mounting on ministers to let teacher-assessed grades stand in England to avoid a second wave of exams chaos hitting GCSE results this week. About 40% of A-Level results were downgraded after the exams regulator Ofqual used an algorithm based on schools' previous results. The government is set to make an announcement on this issue this afternoon. Northern Ireland's government said it would use teachers' grades for GCSEs. The Welsh Government has announced thatteachers' grades will now be awarded to A-level and GCSE students. It will also affect AS-levels, skills challenge certificates and the Welsh Baccalaureate. Speculation is growing that a similar move will be made in England, bringing all four nations in line with each other. Scotland already said students' teacher-assessed grades would stand after a huge outcry over unfairness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, currently on holiday, spoke to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and his senior officials earlier on Monday to discuss the growing outcry over results. The Department for Education and Ofqual are now expected to address the issue for England in a statement this afternoon, but it is understood they will hold off from delaying GCSE exam results. Some 700,000 pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive results for GCSEs they never sat this week. And there is concern that the anomalies and unexpected results tied to Ofqual's algorithm will hit GCSE candidates harder. Last week in England, 280,000 A-level results were downgraded from teachers' assessments, almost 40% of the total. In Wales, it was 42% of A-level papers. Asked repeatedly about a possible U-turn on the results system, the prime minister's spokesman would only say the government continued to work to come up with the fairest possible system. ""We recognise that many people are concerned and anxious about the exam grading system,"" he said, adding: ""We will not be delaying GCSE results."" The spokesman went on to say that the PM had confidence in Mr Williamson and the head of Ofqual, Sally Collier. There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the 'calculated' results Mary Curnock-Cook, former head of the university admissions service Ucas, said a switch back to teacher-assessed grades at A-level could mean the some 55,000 students who had missed out on university places could be in a position to go back and ask for their place to be reinstated. The government has been facing a growing backlash from Conservative backbenchers, with at least 17 MPs criticising the system. The list includes former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt, who said she would be seeking meetings with the Department for Education on this issue. Ms Mordaunt said: ""This group of young people have lost out so much already, we must ensure that bright, capable students can progress on their next step."" Head teachers called last week's A-level results ""unfair and unfathomable"", with many gifted pupils losing top university places and pupils in sixth forms and further education colleges particularly badly hit by the algorithm. Why did the A-level algorithm say no? 'Huge mess' as exams appeal guidance withdrawn Anger over 'unfair' A-level results Kate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the government had had weeks to resolve the matter. ""Here we are just two or three days away from GCSE results and the government still hasn't got a grip on the problem."" Labour has called for teacher-assessed grades to be used for A-levels in England, adding the should remain open for GCSEs. This video can not be played Demonstrating students said they feel ""very let down"" and that the grading is unfair On Twitter, BBC Newsnight's Lewis Goodall said he had received scores of messages from downgraded students. One of these, David from Gateshead, was meant to be the first of his family to go to university with an offer from Cambridge to read engineering. His teachers estimated A*AA but the algorithm allocated him A*AB because his FE college had never had such good grades in maths before - and now his place is on hold. With his ""dream for years"" shattered David said: ""It doesn't feel real. ""The college thought it would be the best year we've ever had - but the algorithm says it's not allowed."" Pembroke College will have to wait as David's results were downgraded Private school pupil Abby from Bosworth also got in touch. She had offers from Lancaster and York to do geography. She needed ABB but got ABU. The U grade in maths, for which she was expecting a B or a C, means her chances of a university place are very limited. ""It's not been great to be honest. ""I cried the whole day yesterday and the day before. ""It's not justice. It's immoral."" Former Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said it was ""inevitable"" that the government would have to accept the grades estimated by teachers. ""The great danger for Gavin Williamson now is he's losing the confidence of head teachers around the country,"" he said, adding that ""he is losing the dressing room"". The Grammar School Heads Association and the private schools' body, the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), also back a switch to teacher-assessed grades, as do the teaching unions and many prominent education academics. Many students are expected to appeal, although there has been confusion over the appeals process afterOfqual withdrew its guidance for challenging resultshours after publishing it on Saturday. New guidelines was still being drawn up by Ofqual, the Department for Education said on Sunday evening. A Department for Education spokesman said hundreds of thousands of students had received a calculated grade to ""enable them to progress"" and that the department aimed ""to build as much fairness into the appeals system as possible"". On Sunday, hundreds of students held protests against grades they believe were unfairly awarded. Students warned 'your algorithm doesn't know me' during protests in London Meanwhile, analysis by the Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) looked at 65,000 exam entries in 41 subjects in its member colleges and found that grades were 20% lower than historic performances for similar students in those colleges. The SFCA said it had not found a single one where the results were above the three-year average. Ofqual says that itsobjective for A-level results,externalthis year has been to ensure ""national results are broadly similar to previous years"". The research showed that Ofqual ""not only failed to produce broadly similar results, but has in fact produced worse results in every single subject"", the SFCA said. Dr Mark Fenton, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, said the results had also been unfair to some of its students. He told the BBC that ""a great injustice has been done"" with ""utterly baffling"" results for some students with the ""only fair outcome"" being to accept grades predicted by teachers. Three of Oxford University's colleges -Worcester, Wadham and St Edmund Hall - have confirmed that all places offered to UK students will be secured irrespective of their A-level results. Ahead of GCSE results due to be released on Thursday, former Conservative Education Secretary Lord Kenneth Baker urged the government to delay the publication of grades until the situation surrounding A-levels had been resolved.

Pelosi to recall House to 'save' the post office,"Speaker Nancy Pelosi will call on the House of Representatives to return to session in the coming days to vote on a bill to protect the US Postal Service. In a letter released on Sunday,Ms Pelosi accused President Trump of a ""campaign to sabotage the election"",external. It comes after the USPS warned that millions of mail ballots may not arrive in time to be counted in the election. Critics blamed the new USPS head - a loyal supporter of the president - for a slowdown in deliveries. A record number of people are expected to vote by mail ahead of the 3 November presidential election due to the pandemic. The president has repeatedly said mail-in ballots will lead to voting fraud and give a boost to his rival, Democrat Joe Biden. However, experts say the mail-in voting system, which Mr Trump himself uses, is safe from tampering. Trump blocks postal funds to stymie mail-in voting Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Democrats call for probe into US postal service In a letter released on Sunday, Ms Pelosi criticised plans by the new head of the USPS, Louis DeJoy, which she said would ""degrade postal service, delay the mail, and - according to the Postal Service itself - threaten to deny the ability of eligible Americans to cast their votes through the mail in the upcoming elections in a timely fashion"". ""Lives, livelihoods and the life of our American Democracy are under threat from the president,"" she added. Ms Pelosi said she would call on House representatives to vote on a new bill to prohibit the USPS from introducing any changes to the service or operations it provided at the beginning of this year in the coming week. A date for the vote has not yet been announced. She also joined a number of Democrats in calling on Mr DeJoy and another senior USPS figure to testify at an ""urgent"" hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on 24 August. Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, have accused Mr Trump of attacking postal voting and the USPS in a bid to ""undermine the election"". President Trump has previously told Fox News he was blocking additional funding for the financially troubled agency, because he opposes mail-in voting. ""Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,"" he said. ""Now, if we don't make a deal, that means they don't get the money. That means they can't have universal mail-in voting, they just can't have it."" Does US postal voting lead to fraud?

'Hottest temperature on Earth' recorded in US,"The potentially record-breaking temperature was recorded in Death Valley, California What could be the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth - 130F (54.4C) - may have been reached in Death Valley National Park, California. The recording is being verified by the US National Weather Service. It comes amid a heatwave on the US's west coast, where temperatures are forecast to rise further this week. The scorching conditions have led to two days of blackouts in California, after a power plant malfunctioned on Saturday. ""It's an oppressive heat and it's in your face,"" Brandi Stewart, who works at Death Valley National Park, told the BBC. Ms Stewart has lived and worked at the national park on and off for five years. She spends a lot of her time indoors in August because it's simply too uncomfortable to be outside. ""When you walk outside it's like being hit in the face with a bunch of hairdryers,"" she said. ""You feel the heat and it's like walking into an oven and the heat is just all around you."" Sunday's reading was recorded in Furnace Creek in Death Valley. Before this, the highest temperature reliably recorded on Earth was 129.2F (54C) - also in Death Valley in 2013. A higher reading of 134F, or 56.6C a century earlier, also in Death Valley, is disputed. It is believed by some modern weather experts to have been erroneous, along with several other searing temperatures recorded that summer. Dangerous heat wave forecast for south-west US Summers could become 'too hot for humans' Last decade confirmed as hottest on record According to a 2016 analysis from weather historian Christopher Burt, other temperatures in the region recorded in 1913 do not corroborate the Death Valley reading. Another record temperature for the planet - 131F, or 55C - was recorded in Tunisia in 1931, but Mr Burt said this reading, as well as others recorded in Africa during the colonial era, had ""serious credibility issues"". The current heatwave stretches from Arizona in the south-west, up the coast to Washington state in the north-west. It is expected to hit its peak on Monday and Tuesday, before temperatures start to drop later in the week. However, the sweltering heat will continue for at least another 10 days. As temperatures soared in California, a large ""firenado"" was observed on Saturday in Lassen County. The ""firenado"" was seen on Saturday California's Independent System Operator (CISO), which manages the state's power, has declared a Stage 3 Emergency, meaning ""when demand [for electricity] begins to outpace supply"". Because so much of the region's power relies on solar and wind energy, and because people use their electricity for air conditioning, during heatwaves the power grid becomes strained and is at risk of completely malfunctioning. In order to manage the state's demand for power and prevent a complete shutdown, officials are using scheduled rolling blackouts to control and conserve energy. Officials define extreme heat as a period of two to three days of high heat and humidity, with temperatures above 90F (32C). US public health body the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says heatwaves have killed more people on average than any other extreme weather event in the country. The immediate effects of heatwaves on the human body are heat cramps, dehydration and even potentially fatal heat strokes. However, extreme heat can also exacerbate pre-existing health conditions, including respiratory diseases, heart conditions and kidney disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. How to look after yourself in hot weather It can affect infrastructure, too. As well as straining power grids and causing blackouts, extreme heat can ground planes, melt roads, and cause the inside of cars to overheat to dangerous levels. Heatwaves can also have a severe impact on agriculture - either by causing vegetables to wilt and die, or by encouraging the spread of plant diseases.

State TV staff join protest strikes in Belarus,"This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been heckled by workers on a visit to a factory as anger mounts over his disputed re-election. Workers chanted ""leave"" and booed the long-time leader of the ex-Soviet state as he insisted he would not allow a new vote after allegations of ballot fraud. Strike action spread to state TV, with staff walking out on Monday. Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has suggested she could act as an interim leader. Police violence towards opposition supporters, as well as the alleged poll-rigging in the 9 August vote, fuelled a big protest rally in the capital Minsk on Sunday. Mr Lukashenko has led Belarus since 1994, maintaining close relations with neighbouring Russia, on which Belarus heavily relies for energy supplies. 'The people will not forgive this' In pictures: Striking images from Belarus protests 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change According to local, independent news site Tut.by, Sunday's opposition rally in Minsk was ""the largest in the history of independent Belarus"". A wave of anger has been rising since the Central Election Commission said Mr Lukashenko had won 80.1% of the vote and Ms Tikhanovskaya - 10.12%. Striking workers gathered outside the Minsk tractor factory on Monday Hundreds of protesters have been wounded and two have died in clashes with police over the past week. Some 6,700 people have been arrested, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of security forces. On a visit to a Minsk tractor plant on Monday, Mr Lukashenko sought to defend his disputed victory, telling workers: ""We held the election. Until you kill me, there will be no other election."" 'If you croak we don't care': brutality in Belarus However he said he was willing to hold a referendum and ""hand over my authority in accordance with the constitution - but not under pressure and not via street protests"". As Mr Lukashenko spoke at the factory, workers booed him and chanted ""leave"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Last week, workers at state-run factories walked out in solidarity with the protesters, and more strikes are planned for this week, increasing the pressure on Mr Lukashenko. At state TV, staff walked out in protest against censorship and the election results. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who left for Lithuania after denouncing the results, insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. In a video message released on Monday, she said she was ready to become a ""national leader"" in order to restore calm and normality, freeing political prisoners and preparing for new elections. This video can not be played Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and President Lukashenko give very different messages Russian TV news bulletins have been making ominous parallels between Belarus 2020 and Ukraine 2014. Ukraine's pro-Western revolution led to Moscow sending in its special operations forces to annex Crimea and Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Six years on, could Russia's military intervene in Belarus? On paper, at least, such a move would appear counter-productive. The opposition movement in Belarus is not anti-Russia/pro-Europe - it is anti-Lukashenko. If Russia were to send in troops to shore up the Belarusian leader, it risks alienating the Belarusian people and creating anti-Moscow sentiment. True, Moscow is determined to keep Belarus within what it sees as Russia's sphere of influence. The Kremlin's ultimate goal is deeper integration with its neighbour - a fully-fledged union state (with Vladimir Putin at the helm). It could still achieve this through political leverage. The Kremlin has a pathological fear of ""coloured revolution"" on its doorstep. But Minsk 2020 is not Kyiv 2014. Belarus is not choosing between East and West. The Belarusian people are outraged by the brutality of their security forces. So much so that even Mr Lukashenko's traditional base - including the state factory workers - are deserting him. Rival rallies were held in the capital, with the opposition event appearing to attract much higher numbers. An official report said 65,000 people had attended the presidential rally but unofficial estimates were as low as 10,000. Unofficial estimates for the opposition gathering ranged between 100,000 and 220,000. Mr Lukashenko described the opposition as rats There were reports of state sector workers being forced to attend Mr Lukashenko's rally or face the threat of losing their jobs. What's happening in Belarus? Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile As the president spoke, the anti-Lukashenko protesters gathered for a peaceful rally near a war memorial in the centre of Minsk. A number of officials, as well as current and former police officers, have resigned. Protesters were out in force in Minsk on Sunday The Belarusian ambassador to Slovakia, Igor Leshchenya, declared his solidarity with the protesters.  He told the BBC: ""I represent Belarus and the Belarusian people, which according to our constitution is the only source of power."" EU leaders are to hold an emergency video summit on Wednesday.EU foreign ministers agreed last week to prepare new sanctions,externalagainst Belarusian officials responsible for ""violence, repression and the falsification of election results"". The UK said on Monday it did not accept the results of the ""fraudulent"" election. ""The world has watched with horror at the violence used by the Belarusian authorities,"" saidForeign Secretary Dominic Raab,external. Also on Monday, US President Donald Trump said his administration was following the ""terrible situation"" in Belarus closely. President Lukashenko has sought Russian help, saying President Vladimir Putin has promised to provide comprehensive assistance in the event of any external military threat. In a conversation on Sunday, the two men discussed ""the situation in Belarus, taking into consideration the pressure the republic was being put under from outside"", the Kremlin said.

"NI GCSE results to be based on teacher predictionsEducation Minister Peter Weir says the move is being made due to ""exceptional circumstances"".Northern IrelandComments","GCSE results in NI will be solely based on grades provided by teachers, the education minister has said. There was controversy last week aftermore than a third of A-level and AS-level grades provided by schools were lowered by the exams board CCEA. Schools were asked to give predicted grades but then other data was used by CCEA to standardise the results. Education Minister Peter Weir has now said standardisation will not apply to GCSEs. Later on Monday,Mr Weir also announced that A-level and AS-level students in Northern Ireland will be awarded the highest gradeeither predicted by their teacher or awarded officially last week. Mr Weir said GCSEs taken with exams body CCEA - which provides about 97% of GCSE exams in Northern Ireland - would be covered by the decision. ""Having received advice from CCEA and listened to the concerns of school leaders, teachers, parents and young people, I have decided that all GCSE candidates will now be awarded the grades submitted by their centre,"" he said. ""Standardisation is normally a key feature of awarding qualifications in Northern Ireland and across the UK. ""However, these are exceptional circumstances and in exceptional times truly difficult decisions are made. ""I am conscious that for GCSEs, unlike at A-level, we do not have system level prior performance data for this group of young people."" Education Minister Peter Weir said the current circumstances are ""exceptional"" Mr Weir said he wanted to encourage as many young people as possible to remain in education or training after the age of 16. He said he was acting to ""ease anxieties"" and ""reassure young people and their families"". ""I am also mindful that unlike A-Level, many GCSE pupils will not have access to previous public examination outcomes to inform any appeals process,"" he added. CCEA said it welcomed the minister's decision. ""We will work immediately to implement this decision, with GCSE results published on Thursday 20 August 2020,"" it said. Asked by the BBC about the small number of NI GCSE students who sat tests set by English exam boards who will not benefit from this move, Mr Weir said ""a small minority, I think, have been left in a difficult position as regards GCSEs in Northern Ireland"". By Robbie Meredith, BBC News NI education correspondent The minister has basically taken the exam board CCEA's role out of the entire GCSE process this year. Those grades provided by schools alone will be used to give GCSE results. That is likely to see a massive spike in results overall, which were already pretty high in Northern Ireland. Last year, over four in every five GCSE entries were graded at A* to C, what would be regarded as pass grades. This move will come as a substantial relief to many pupils and schools. I don't think you can paint this in any other way than saying it's a U-turn for the minister. Read more: Q&A on Northern Ireland's GCSE results U-turn There was widespread criticism of the system used to determine A-level and AS-level grades prior to Mr Weir's U-turn on Monday afternoon. On Sunday,a majority of the Stormont parties backed a move to recall the assemblyto try to address the dispute over exam results in Northern Ireland. Koulla Yiasouma said the system was ""clearly flawed"" Speaking before the A-level U-turn, Northern Ireland's Children's Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma said she had co-signed a letter sent out to universities across the UK, asking them to honour conditional offers made to students prior to last week's A-level results. ""We've seen far too many young people give too many examples of quite bizarre grades. The system is clearly flawed,"" she said. ""The students of 2020 are special. No other student has been through this experience. ""We are calling on all universities to honour the conditional offers they made to those young people. This system has clearly not been fair."" Following the cancellation of exams in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, CCEA was instructed by Mr Weir to ensure the calculated results in 2020 were broadly in line with performance in recent years. CCEA asked teachers to give a predicted grade for their pupils and then rank them in order within each subject. It then used other data to standardise the results. For A-levels, the model used pupils' AS-level results and resit data. A third of NI A-level grades lower than predicted Parties back assembly recall over exam results According to CCEA, in 37% of cases this year teachers were overly optimistic in their prediction, affecting about 11,000 grades. In about 5% of tests teachers underestimated the result, meaning that about 1,500 grades rose as a result of standardisation. CCEA said if teacher judgement had been used on its own, results would have risen ""considerably"". Mr Weir initially said the move on GCSEs would not change the approach that was taken on A-levels. However he later announced the change which will see A-level and AS-level students in Northern Ireland awarded the highest grade either predicted by their teacher or awarded officially last week.

Pressure mounts on ministers to solve exam crisis,"Pupils protested outside the Staffordshire constituency office of Education Secretary Gavin Williamson Pressure is mounting on ministers to let teacher-assessed grades stand in England to avoid a second wave of exams chaos hitting GCSE results this week. About 40% of A-Level results were downgraded after the exams regulator Ofqual used an algorithm based on schools' previous results. The government is set to make an announcement on this issue this afternoon. Northern Ireland's government said it would use teachers' grades for GCSEs. The Welsh Government has announced thatteachers' grades will now be awarded to A-level and GCSE students. It will also affect AS-levels, skills challenge certificates and the Welsh Baccalaureate. Speculation is growing that a similar move will be made in England, bringing all four nations in line with each other. Scotland already said students' teacher-assessed grades would stand after a huge outcry over unfairness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, currently on holiday, spoke to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and his senior officials earlier on Monday to discuss the growing outcry over results. The Department for Education and Ofqual are now expected to address the issue for England in a statement this afternoon, but it is understood they will hold off from delaying GCSE exam results. Some 700,000 pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive results for GCSEs they never sat this week. And there is concern that the anomalies and unexpected results tied to Ofqual's algorithm will hit GCSE candidates harder. Last week in England, 280,000 A-level results were downgraded from teachers' assessments, almost 40% of the total. In Wales, it was 42% of A-level papers. Asked repeatedly about a possible U-turn on the results system, the prime minister's spokesman would only say the government continued to work to come up with the fairest possible system. ""We recognise that many people are concerned and anxious about the exam grading system,"" he said, adding: ""We will not be delaying GCSE results."" The spokesman went on to say that the PM had confidence in Mr Williamson and the head of Ofqual, Sally Collier. There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the 'calculated' results Mary Curnock-Cook, former head of the university admissions service Ucas, said a switch back to teacher-assessed grades at A-level could mean the some 55,000 students who had missed out on university places could be in a position to go back and ask for their place to be reinstated. The government has been facing a growing backlash from Conservative backbenchers, with at least 17 MPs criticising the system. The list includes former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt, who said she would be seeking meetings with the Department for Education on this issue. Ms Mordaunt said: ""This group of young people have lost out so much already, we must ensure that bright, capable students can progress on their next step."" Head teachers called last week's A-level results ""unfair and unfathomable"", with many gifted pupils losing top university places and pupils in sixth forms and further education colleges particularly badly hit by the algorithm. Why did the A-level algorithm say no? 'Huge mess' as exams appeal guidance withdrawn Anger over 'unfair' A-level results Kate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the government had had weeks to resolve the matter. ""Here we are just two or three days away from GCSE results and the government still hasn't got a grip on the problem."" Labour has called for teacher-assessed grades to be used for A-levels in England, adding the should remain open for GCSEs. This video can not be played Demonstrating students said they feel ""very let down"" and that the grading is unfair On Twitter, BBC Newsnight's Lewis Goodall said he had received scores of messages from downgraded students. One of these, David from Gateshead, was meant to be the first of his family to go to university with an offer from Cambridge to read engineering. His teachers estimated A*AA but the algorithm allocated him A*AB because his FE college had never had such good grades in maths before - and now his place is on hold. With his ""dream for years"" shattered David said: ""It doesn't feel real. ""The college thought it would be the best year we've ever had - but the algorithm says it's not allowed."" Pembroke College will have to wait as David's results were downgraded Private school pupil Abby from Bosworth also got in touch. She had offers from Lancaster and York to do geography. She needed ABB but got ABU. The U grade in maths, for which she was expecting a B or a C, means her chances of a university place are very limited. ""It's not been great to be honest. ""I cried the whole day yesterday and the day before. ""It's not justice. It's immoral."" Former Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said it was ""inevitable"" that the government would have to accept the grades estimated by teachers. ""The great danger for Gavin Williamson now is he's losing the confidence of head teachers around the country,"" he said, adding that ""he is losing the dressing room"". The Grammar School Heads Association and the private schools' body, the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), also back a switch to teacher-assessed grades, as do the teaching unions and many prominent education academics. Many students are expected to appeal, although there has been confusion over the appeals process afterOfqual withdrew its guidance for challenging resultshours after publishing it on Saturday. New guidelines was still being drawn up by Ofqual, the Department for Education said on Sunday evening. A Department for Education spokesman said hundreds of thousands of students had received a calculated grade to ""enable them to progress"" and that the department aimed ""to build as much fairness into the appeals system as possible"". On Sunday, hundreds of students held protests against grades they believe were unfairly awarded. Students warned 'your algorithm doesn't know me' during protests in London Meanwhile, analysis by the Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) looked at 65,000 exam entries in 41 subjects in its member colleges and found that grades were 20% lower than historic performances for similar students in those colleges. The SFCA said it had not found a single one where the results were above the three-year average. Ofqual says that itsobjective for A-level results,externalthis year has been to ensure ""national results are broadly similar to previous years"". The research showed that Ofqual ""not only failed to produce broadly similar results, but has in fact produced worse results in every single subject"", the SFCA said. Dr Mark Fenton, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, said the results had also been unfair to some of its students. He told the BBC that ""a great injustice has been done"" with ""utterly baffling"" results for some students with the ""only fair outcome"" being to accept grades predicted by teachers. Three of Oxford University's colleges -Worcester, Wadham and St Edmund Hall - have confirmed that all places offered to UK students will be secured irrespective of their A-level results. Ahead of GCSE results due to be released on Thursday, former Conservative Education Secretary Lord Kenneth Baker urged the government to delay the publication of grades until the situation surrounding A-levels had been resolved. ""If you are in a hole, stop digging,"" Lord Baker said.

Fears of 'homelessness wave' when eviction ban endsThe government is urged to provide more support when the ban on evictions in England is lifted.UK Politics,"England could see ""a new wave of homelessness"" when a ban on evictions ends later this month, MPs have warned. The ban was introduced in March as part of emergency legislation to protect those hit financially by the pandemic. Amid fears that evictions may lead to more homeless, 21 MPs have urged the government to guarantee council funds to house rough sleepers for a year. The government said it would ""continue to provide appropriate support"" to those affected. New evictions in England and Wales had initially been suspended until 25 June, but the pause was extended to 23 August. The Labour-led Welsh government has doubled the notice period required for evictions issued on or after 24 July to six months, excluding cases relating to anti-social behaviour. The Scottish government has proposed extending its ban on evicting renters until March 2021. Charities welcome extended Scottish eviction ban Coronavirus ban on evicting renters extended Emergency fund for rough sleepers' scheme to end With the 23 August deadline now approaching , MPs have urged the government to do more to protect the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless in England ""given the ongoing threat of coronavirus and the risk of a potential second wave"". In a letter to rough sleeping minister Luke Hall, the MPs called on him to guarantee all local authorities in England can fund accommodation for the homeless ""for at least a year"" . ""Some local authorities are in the process of confirming and funding accommodation for rough sleepers for another year, however it is so important that all councils are able to provide this. ""We cannot put a cut-off on showing all those in need compassion at this time,"" the letter said. The MPs also urged the minister to scrap the Vagrancy Act - which still stands in England and Wales, having been repealed in Scotland. The Act allows police to arrest and fine people caught begging in public. It was signed by nine Labour MPs, one DUP MP and 10 Lib Dem MPs, including the two party leadership candidates Sir Ed Davey and Layla Moran. There are an estimated 8.7m renters in England. In March, as the lockdown began, councils were told to move homeless people off the streets and out of communal shelters. The government says about 14,500 people were found emergency accommodation across England. In England, ministers have said allowing eviction hearings to resume is an important step towards protecting landlords' rights. The government has said new repossession rules will provide appropriate protection for renters after eviction court hearings resume. Labour has branded the new rules ""toothless"" and called for emergency legislation to strengthen protection for renters. Paddy says his life ""spiralled out of control"" and he ended up sleeping rough following eviction by his landlord. He had lost his job in a timber yard at the start of the pandemic, and was unable to find work to replace it. Unaware of the ban on new evictions, he says he told his landlord he had nowhere to go but his landlord told him that was ""not my problem"". ""I remember walking down the stairs and through the gate, thinking 'where am I going to go?'"" he says. He is now back in a home and retraining to be a lorry driver, but says sleeping on the streets was the ""worst experience of my life"". ""The way it came, a hundred miles an hour is how I would explain it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Ross Hawkins. ""I went from the top to the bottom in a matter of days"". Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell has gone further, and called for the evictions ban in England and Wales to be extended for at least another year. Hetold the Mirror,externalit would be ""premature"" to end the ban this month ""with so many jobs being lost and incomes drying up"". ""The ban on evictions must be extended for as long as the risk of Covid persists,"" he added. The National Residential Landlords Association has, however, called on ministers to resist calls for another extension of the evictions ban in England and Wales. The UK-wide body says its research indicates the vast majority of tenants are either paying rent or have made an arrangements with their landlord to avoid arrears. It called for ministers to offer financial help to renters in England similar to Wales, where aÂ£8m loan schemeis being set up for private tenants in arrears. A Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government spokesperson said it had taken ""unprecedented action to support the most vulnerable people in our society during the pandemic"". They added that new repossession rules in England for after eviction hearings restart will require landlords to provide more information about their tenants' situation when seeking an eviction. Judges will be able to ""adjourn a case if this information isn't provided,"" they added. Landlords in England and Wales can evict their tenants without giving a reason by issuing a Section 21 notice. Normally, this can only be done when the initial fixed term has ended. This notice might be ruled invalid if the landlord hasfailed to stick to certain rules,external, for instance by failing to properly protect a tenant's deposit. The normal notice period for this type of eviction is two months, but this has been extended to three months in England because of the Covid-19 crisis. In Wales this period is now six months, except for cases relating to anti-social behaviour. To evict a tenant who has fallen behind on rent, landlords must issue a Section 8 notice. If the tenant does not leave by the specified date, landlords can then apply to a court to enforce it. The government has put new rules in place for when new repossession proceedings are allowed to start again after 23 August. Under the new rules,external, landlords will have to say how the pandemic has affected their tenants financially when applying for a hearing. They will also be required to produce a tenant's full rent arrears history in advance of proceedings, rather than at the hearing itself.

"Australia apology over Ruby Princess virus outbreakState officials made ""serious mistakes"" in letting 2,650 ship passengers disembark, an inquiry found.Australia","Infected passengers were allowed to leave the ship in Sydney in March State officials in Australia have apologised for their failures over the handling of a huge Covid-19 outbreak on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Last week, an inquiry found New South Wales health authorities made ""serious mistakes"" in allowing about 2,650 passengers to disembark when the ship docked in Sydney in March. Those people were not tested for the virus, despite suspected cases aboard. The ship was ultimately linked to at least 900 infections and 28 deaths. Prior to Australia's second wave of the virus - which emerged in Melbourne in June - the cruise ship had been the source of Australia's biggest coronavirus cluster. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was particularly sorry to the 62 people who had caught the virus from passengers who disembarked. ""I can't imagine what it would be like having a loved one - or being someone yourself who continues to suffer and experience trauma as a result - and I want to apologise unreservedly,"" she said. After completing an 11-day return cruise to New Zealand, passengers were allowed to leave the ship at Sydney Harbour and catch public transport, and domestic and overseas flights home. An inquiry report released last Friday found NSW Health had mischaracterised the ship as low-risk, and should have tested sick patients immediately. It was ""inexcusable"" that officials had failed to immediately obtain results from coronavirus swab tests taken on 19 March - the day the vessel docked. However the inquiry found no systemic failures and said the mistakes had already been recognised by the state government. How did Australia's cruise ship debacle happen? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? European countries fight coronavirus surge Following the Ruby Princess debacle, at least a dozen other cruise ships were banned from docking at Australian ports due to their virus risk. Most of the Australian passengers on the Ruby Princess self-isolated at home, in line with government instructions for returning travellers. Excluding a cluster in the island state of Tasmania which spread through a hospital system, 62 people in Australia became infected through secondary transmissions. Ms Berejiklian singled out those cases in her apology, saying: ""Unfortunately in particular for those 62 individuals, the lessons weren't learnt soon enough."" At least a third of passengers - or around 950 people - were from overseas. The inquiry said it was not able to fully assess how many people had caught the virus because many were unable to get tested. How did Australia's cruise ship debacle happen?

Wedding party of 100 'significant Covid breach',"The gathering at Waheed's Buffet and Banqueting Hall on Sunday was dispersed by police A wedding reception of more than 100 guests has been broken up by police in Blackburn. Blackburn with Darwenbrought in extra measureson 14 July after a spike in Covid-19 cases to try to avoid a Leicester-style local lockdown. Police said the event at Waheed's Buffet and Banqueting Hall in Randal Street was a ""significant breach"" of restrictions putting people ""at risk"". Police in Manchester also attended a wedding in a marquee with 50 guests. The organiser of the wedding in Whalley Range in the city was given a fixed penalty notice. The gathering in Blackburn on Sunday was dispersed and no further action was taken. Lancashire Police's Deputy Chief Constable Terry Woods said there were between 100 and 120 people at the venue. He said: ""The vast bulk of those people were asked to leave, they were very compliant, but in effect that wedding reception was closed down and what remained was a small number of people ""Today future action is going to be considered with the local authority to see what we can do with that premises to stop it happening again. ""For businesses we know it's hard but we will name and shame places that flout the regulations to this extent and there will be consequences."" Blackburn with Darwen brought in new measures in July after a spike in Covid-19 cases In a statement on Sunday police said: ""Disappointing incident in Blackburn this evening. ""Officers have attended a report of a significant breach of Covid restrictions, and found over 100 guests at a wedding reception. ""This is a clear breach of both local and national restrictions that puts everyone attending at risk. ""Officers have engaged with the attendees and at police instruction the gathering was dispersed without further issue. ""Please work with us to help keep everyone safe by following the guidelines and restrictions."" By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit A month on since tighter restrictions were introduced in Blackburn with Darwen, compared with most of the rest of England, the area still has one of the highest rates of new cases of coronavirus. In the week to 12 August there were 141 new cases recorded, 20 more than the week before. It works out at about 94 cases per 100,000 residents in the latest week. The official data for England released on Sunday shows only Northampton, which recorded hundreds of cases following an outbreak at a sandwich factory, and Oldham currently have higher rates of new infections than Blackburn with Darwen. The borough's director of public health Dominic Harrison said: ""It's not fair to the majority of the population who are sticking by the guidance we've put out. ""Many people have made sacrifices and for them, something like this is not fair. ""We as a council, with the police, are going to be looking to take stronger action than we have up to now on events like this over the coming weeks."" He said the area's coronavirus rates were currently ""high but contained, but they are not yet coming down as fast as we hoped"". Both Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire have local restrictions in place to prevent people socialising with other households. Police say they are also concerned that responses to emergencies are being delayed because of the number of 999 calls about social distancing breaches.

'Ticking time bomb' for young jobless,"Grace Williams is a former teaching assistant who wanted the challenge of becoming an engineer Wales faces a ""ticking time bomb"" over the number of young people not in education, employment or training (Neet), according to Colleges Wales. There are fears the Covid pandemic and recession will damage the prospects of a generation. The number of Neets has increased in the last two years. The Welsh Government said it would ""tackle any increase in youth unemployment"". Grace Williams, an electrical engineering apprentice with IAC in Newport, juggles studying for qualifications with working. ""If it's something that you want to go into it's well worth doing, 100%, because you get your experience and your qualification at the one time, and you get to earn money while doing it,"" she said. But for 20-year-old, Caitlyn Morgan from Fochriw, Caerphilly county, it feels like everything is against her as she tries to find a job. Caitlyn Morgan has been struggling to find a job since the Covid lockdown She had a short work placement at a large retailer organised by the Prince's Trust but it was just as Covid struck and there was no job at the end of it. Caitlyn's spent lockdown doing online courses but she's not confident about her future. ""There's a lot more people who have lost jobs and there's a lot less jobs to go around and people like me who haven't got a lot to offer experience-wise, we are not going to be the ones at the forefront,"" she said. ""We're going to be the ones at the back of the queue. So I feel like I'm going to be at a major disadvantage to find work."" Chief executive of Colleges Wales Iestyn Davies said: ""This could well be a ticking time bomb for the economy, it's clearly not good for individuals who find themselves in this awful category of Neets"". Between 2011 and 2017, the proportion of 16 to 18-year-old Neets fell. According to the latest figures, the number rose from 10,800 in 2018 to 11,200 in 2019 - an increase from 10.6% to 11.1%. The proportion of 19 to 24-year-old Neets continues to fall. But the concern is that opportunities for young people like Caitlyn and Grace will be more limited in future as businesses face uncertainty. A Welsh Government spokesperson said its Â£40m skills and jobs package will be key to ""ensure that anyone over the age of 16 in Wales can access the advice and support they need to find work, pursue self-employment, find a place in education or training or be supported to start their own business"".

"No confidence in A-levels process, councils saySchools in north Wales have seen ""significant inconsistency and inequality"", cabinet members say.Wales","Students gathered outside the Senedd at the weekend to protest against the grading system First Minister Mark Drakeford will face his own Labour backbenchers later as criticism grows over last week's A-levels results. A total of 42% of grades predicted by teachers were lowered. Welsh Labour group chairman Vikki Howells and the Welsh Tories joined Plaid Cymru in calling for students to be honoured their predicted grades. Education Minister Kirsty Williams has allowed appeals if ""there is evidence"" pupils should have had higher grades. But pressure is growing on the Welsh Government to honour's students predicted grades. Meanwhile six Welsh council education cabinet members say they have  ""no confidence"" in the system which has allocated this year's A-level results. Happy students in Swansea on Thursday - but not all A-level pupils got the grades they expected Ms Howells, Welsh Labour Senedd group chairman and member of the Senedd (MS) for Cynon Valley, said the algorithm used to assess grades after A-Level exams were cancelled ""unjustly caused problems and considerable stress for students whose futures may depend on fair and accurate results"". She called for predicted grades to be used instead. Caerphilly Labour MS Hefin David said the appeals process ""will overwhelm any manageable system and students can't wait for it"". ""We need to move to teacher assessed grades now. In the longer term we need a standardised system of moderation across Wales and put the trust in teachers to manage the local moderation of grades."" A-levels: 22,000 sign grade change petition Lost school time 'will hurt economy for 65 years' Should I go to university this year? 'We feel so lost' - Young face job despair Suzy Davies, Welsh Conservative spokeswoman,tweeted,externalthat an appeals process ""will just add"" to the ""misery caused"" by A-level grading. She described A-level results that have come out as ""unfair"" and said guarantees over the appeals process must be given in the next 24 to 48 hours or there should be no alternative than to use teachers' predicted grades. ""The process promised to bring fairness,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastwith Claire Summers. ""But it hasn't. If there is no prompt guarantee (over appeals), confidence in that will dissolve as well."" Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland also said she could now see no alternative but to switch to using predicted grades. She called it an ""exceptional year"", adding: ""Grade inflation is not the worst thing that could happen but these young people are having their dreams shattered and being left with a complete lack of faith in our system."" Plaid Cymru education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian called for the grade standardisation process to be dropped ahead of GCSE results later this week,in line with Northern Ireland. A Senedd committee is being recalled on Tuesday during the summer recess to discuss the grades She said that would ""provide fairness and justice to its young people who have worked so hard, and have faced an unprecedentedly difficult and confusing time"". ""The Welsh Government should be doing all it can to alleviate stress for this cohort which is likely to face many more challenges from the fallout of the pandemic in the coming years, rather than putting further barriers in their path."" Ms Gwenllian added that the assessment grades given by schools and and colleges should ""replace the flawed system adopted by Welsh Government and an announcement to that effect needs to be made"" on Monday. Suzy Davies calls for guarantees to be given over appeals A letter, signed by senior councillors and officers at Anglesey, Gwynedd, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham councils, called on Ms Williams to undertake an ""urgent review"" of the situation. ""We do not feel that the process has been fair and robust especially to vulnerable learners who have been Welsh Government priority during this term,"" the letter said. ""It is quite clear that the A-level brand has been protected at the expense of individual learners who have missed out on forecasted grades when national distribution has reached school level,"" it added. It said in some schools nearly 70% of grades had been downgraded - withthe number of signatures on a petitionstarted on the weekend now standing at 26,000. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price was one of the speakers at Sunday's protest on the Senedd steps ""This has resulted in individual pupils being awarded grades by WJEC where schools can't explain the rationale behind the awarding,"" the letter said. ""Too many pupils in north Wales are at a significant risk of being disadvantaged and missing out on opportunities to the future employment pathways of their choice when compared to their peers in other countries in the UK, especially Scotland. ""Schools report that they have no confidence in the present appeal process."" It also expresses concern the same will happen when GCSE results are revealed on Thursday. Emily Mundy has been rejected to study medicine after her grades were downgraded Emily Mundy, from Anglesey, was offered places at Manchester and Birmingham to train for her dream job as a doctor. During lockdown the 18-year-old volunteered three times a week at Ysbyty Gwynedd on wards, handing out teas and coffees and chatting to patients. But after getting a B in chemistry, despite being predicted an A, she was rejected from all the universities she put as her choices and may now have to wait a year before she can go to university. ""I was pretty hopeful I would get in, I was pretty hopeful I would get the grades I wanted seeing as I did pretty well in my GCSEs,"" she said. ""They have told me that the best thing I can do is to appeal because the centre grade was an A. If I get the appeal result by 7 September, then they will be able to get me in. ""If I don't then I will have to resit the exam, or I will even have to do it next year, or I will have to go to university next year."" When Emily took part in a UCAS test, she was in the top 10% in the UK. Pupils want to be given the grades their teachers predicted for them The Welsh Parliament is on its summer break, but the Children, Young People and Education Committee has been recalled and will meet on Tuesday. The exam board WJEC is set to outline further details on the process to submit appeals early in the week. The Welsh Government said more than 4,000 students would benefit from the guarantee that no final grade would be lower than an AS grade. ""This is around 15% of all A-level students and makes a significant difference to the overall impact of variations between final grades and centre assessed grades,"" said a spokesperson. ""Even before the AS floor, 94% of the grades are the same as or within one grade of the centre assessed grades."" A spokesperson said Qualification Wales and the WJEC would share the full details but appeals could now be made where there was evidence of internal assessments judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the grade awarded.

NI GCSE results to be based on teacher predictions,"GCSE results in NI will be solely based on grades provided by teachers, the education minister has said. There was controversy last week aftermore than a third of A-level and AS-level grades provided by schools were lowered by the exams board CCEA. Schools were asked to give predicted grades but then other data was used by CCEA to standardise the results. Education Minister Peter Weir has now said standardisation will not apply to GCSEs. Later on Monday,Mr Weir also announced that A-level and AS-level students in Northern Ireland will be awarded the highest gradeeither predicted by their teacher or awarded officially last week. Mr Weir said GCSEs taken with exams body CCEA - which provides about 97% of GCSE exams in Northern Ireland - would be covered by the decision. ""Having received advice from CCEA and listened to the concerns of school leaders, teachers, parents and young people, I have decided that all GCSE candidates will now be awarded the grades submitted by their centre,"" he said. ""Standardisation is normally a key feature of awarding qualifications in Northern Ireland and across the UK. ""However, these are exceptional circumstances and in exceptional times truly difficult decisions are made. ""I am conscious that for GCSEs, unlike at A-level, we do not have system level prior performance data for this group of young people."" Education Minister Peter Weir said the current circumstances are ""exceptional"" Mr Weir said he wanted to encourage as many young people as possible to remain in education or training after the age of 16. He said he was acting to ""ease anxieties"" and ""reassure young people and their families"". ""I am also mindful that unlike A-Level, many GCSE pupils will not have access to previous public examination outcomes to inform any appeals process,"" he added. CCEA said it welcomed the minister's decision. ""We will work immediately to implement this decision, with GCSE results published on Thursday 20 August 2020,"" it said. Asked by the BBC about the small number of NI GCSE students who sat tests set by English exam boards who will not benefit from this move, Mr Weir said ""a small minority, I think, have been left in a difficult position as regards GCSEs in Northern Ireland"". By Robbie Meredith, BBC News NI education correspondent The minister has basically taken the exam board CCEA's role out of the entire GCSE process this year. Those grades provided by schools alone will be used to give GCSE results. That is likely to see a massive spike in results overall, which were already pretty high in Northern Ireland. Last year, over four in every five GCSE entries were graded at A* to C, what would be regarded as pass grades. This move will come as a substantial relief to many pupils and schools. I don't think you can paint this in any other way than saying it's a U-turn for the minister. Read more: Q&A on Northern Ireland's GCSE results U-turn There was widespread criticism of the system used to determine A-level and AS-level grades prior to Mr Weir's U-turn on Monday afternoon. On Sunday,a majority of the Stormont parties backed a move to recall the assemblyto try to address the dispute over exam results in Northern Ireland. Koulla Yiasouma said the system was ""clearly flawed"" Speaking before the A-level U-turn, Northern Ireland's Children's Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma said she had co-signed a letter sent out to universities across the UK, asking them to honour conditional offers made to students prior to last week's A-level results. ""We've seen far too many young people give too many examples of quite bizarre grades. The system is clearly flawed,"" she said. ""The students of 2020 are special. No other student has been through this experience. ""We are calling on all universities to honour the conditional offers they made to those young people. This system has clearly not been fair."" Following the cancellation of exams in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, CCEA was instructed by Mr Weir to ensure the calculated results in 2020 were broadly in line with performance in recent years. CCEA asked teachers to give a predicted grade for their pupils and then rank them in order within each subject. It then used other data to standardise the results. For A-levels, the model used pupils' AS-level results and resit data. A third of NI A-level grades lower than predicted Parties back assembly recall over exam results According to CCEA, in 37% of cases this year teachers were overly optimistic in their prediction, affecting about 11,000 grades. In about 5% of tests teachers underestimated the result, meaning that about 1,500 grades rose as a result of standardisation. CCEA said if teacher judgement had been used on its own, results would have risen ""considerably"". Mr Weir initially said the move on GCSEs would not change the approach that was taken on A-levels. However he later announced the change which will see A-level and AS-level students in Northern Ireland awarded the highest grade either predicted by their teacher or awarded officially last week.

Claims open for second self-employed support grantHM Revenue and Customs admits some people were paid too much when the first grants were distributed.,"Millions of self-employed people whose trade has been hit by coronavirus can now apply for a second support grant from the government. More than three million people may be eligible for the payment of up to Â£6,570 each, which Chancellor Rishi Sunak said would be the final hand-out. HMRC said it was pleased with the positive start the scheme made when it opened on Monday morning. By early Monday 39,000 people had successfully made claims, HMRC said. Angela MacDonald, deputy chief executive at the HMRC, told BBC Breakfast that those claims were made within the first hour-and-a-half after the scheme opened. The claims window is initially open for a four-day period but anyone who thinks they may be eligible and hasn't been contacted by HMRC has until October to make a claim, she said. ""We are trying very hard to contact all those people who are eligible in order to help them to understand when they can make their claim."" If you think you are eligible and haven't been contacted by HMRC, you can go onto the online system which will tell you if you are eligible, and when it is you can make a claim. ""People shouldn't worry about needing to do everything too much in a rush,"" said Ms MacDonald. ""If you don't manage it in those first four days the claims systems is actually open until the 19th October, so therefore everybody's got the time to do it to suit their working situation at the moment."" The first grant, launched in May, saw Â£7.8bn claimed by 2.7 million people. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has admitted thousands were paid too much, but it will not be demanding repayment. Some 15,000 payments - less than 0.6% of the total - were miscalculated in the first tranche of support, the tax authority said. ""The vast majority of grants were paid correctly, but in a very small number of cases, not all the information held on a tax return was taken into account when calculating eligibility and grants,"" said a spokesman for HMRC. ""Our top priority has been ensuring self-employed people receive grants quickly while protecting public money from deliberate fraudsters."" Legal services firm Integrated Dispute Resolution, which highlighted the error, said the scale of it was still not ""fully understood"". To be eligible for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, more than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The scheme is open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. Under the first payment, self-employed workers who qualified had been in line for a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to Â£2,500 a month for three months. This was paid in one instalment, of up to Â£7,500. Applications for this first payment closed on 13 July. As of Monday, those eligible can claim the second, slightly less generous, grant covering 70% of the applicant's average monthly trading profits. It will also be made in a single payment, covering three months and capped at Â£2,190 a month, or Â£6,570 in total. Applicants will need to confirm their business has been affected by the virus on or after 14 July, but they would not need to have taken the first grant to be eligible for the second. A number of self-employed people, such as directors who pay themselves in dividends, freelancers, and the newly self-employed, are unhappy at missing out on the government's self-employment support package. The Treasury Select Committeecalled on ministers to plug the gapsto fulfil the government's promise of ""doing whatever it takes"", but Mr Sunak defended ""the right policies for the first phase of the crisis"". The system is the alternative to theextended furlough schemefor employed workers. The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed welcomed the second round of grants. But it said the government must be ready to reopen and ""extend it to the desperately struggling forgotten self-employed"" in the event of a second wave of the coronavirus.

Strikes expected in Belarus after mass protestsRallies against the disputed election were held over the weekend but the president remains defiant.Europe,"This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been heckled by workers on a visit to a factory as anger mounts over his disputed re-election. Workers chanted ""leave"" and booed the long-time leader of the ex-Soviet state as he insisted he would not allow a new vote after allegations of ballot fraud. Strike action spread to state TV, with staff walking out on Monday. Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has suggested she could act as an interim leader. Police violence towards opposition supporters, as well as the alleged poll-rigging in the 9 August vote, fuelled a big protest rally in the capital Minsk on Sunday. Mr Lukashenko has led Belarus since 1994, maintaining close relations with neighbouring Russia, on which Belarus heavily relies for energy supplies. 'The people will not forgive this' In pictures: Striking images from Belarus protests 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change According to local, independent news site Tut.by, Sunday's opposition rally in Minsk was ""the largest in the history of independent Belarus"". A wave of anger has been rising since the Central Election Commission said Mr Lukashenko had won 80.1% of the vote and Ms Tikhanovskaya - 10.12%. Striking workers gathered outside the Minsk tractor factory on Monday Hundreds of protesters have been wounded and two have died in clashes with police over the past week. Some 6,700 people have been arrested, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of security forces. On a visit to a Minsk tractor plant on Monday, Mr Lukashenko sought to defend his disputed victory, telling workers: ""We held the election. Until you kill me, there will be no other election."" 'If you croak we don't care': brutality in Belarus However he said he was willing to hold a referendum and ""hand over my authority in accordance with the constitution - but not under pressure and not via street protests"".

Last week, workers at state-run factories walked out in solidarity with the protesters, and more strikes are planned for this week, increasing the pressure on Mr Lukashenko. At state TV, staff walked out in protest against censorship and the election results. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who left for Lithuania after denouncing the results, insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. In a video message released on Monday, she said she was ready to become a ""national leader"" in order to restore calm and normality, freeing political prisoners and preparing for new elections. This video can not be played Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and President Lukashenko give very different messages Russian TV news bulletins have been making ominous parallels between Belarus 2020 and Ukraine 2014. Ukraine's pro-Western revolution led to Moscow sending in its special operations forces to annex Crimea and Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Six years on, could Russia's military intervene in Belarus? On paper, at least, such a move would appear counter-productive. The opposition movement in Belarus is not anti-Russia/pro-Europe - it is anti-Lukashenko. If Russia were to send in troops to shore up the Belarusian leader, it risks alienating the Belarusian people and creating anti-Moscow sentiment. True, Moscow is determined to keep Belarus within what it sees as Russia's sphere of influence. The Kremlin's ultimate goal is deeper integration with its neighbour - a fully-fledged union state (with Vladimir Putin at the helm). It could still achieve this through political leverage. The Kremlin has a pathological fear of ""coloured revolution"" on its doorstep. But Minsk 2020 is not Kyiv 2014. Belarus is not choosing between East and West. The Belarusian people are outraged by the brutality of their security forces. So much so that even Mr Lukashenko's traditional base - including the state factory workers - are deserting him. Rival rallies were held in the capital, with the opposition event appearing to attract much higher numbers. An official report said 65,000 people had attended the presidential rally but unofficial estimates were as low as 10,000. Unofficial estimates for the opposition gathering ranged between 100,000 and 220,000. Mr Lukashenko described the opposition as rats There were reports of state sector workers being forced to attend Mr Lukashenko's rally or face the threat of losing their jobs.

A-level grades 'drop below three-year average'The Sixth Form Colleges Association says research shows students in larger institutions were failed.Family & Education,"A-level grades awarded in sixth form colleges this year fell below the average of the last three years in England, new analysis suggests. The Sixth Form Colleges Association said its research is evidence that students in larger institutions have been failed by this year's system. The government has defended the approach it used to determine grades. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has announced GCSE students will be awarded the grades assessed by their teachers. NI Education Minister Peter Weir said ahead of GCSE results day on Thursday it would scrap an algorithm that would have taken into account the past performance of schools. It comes after almost 40% of A-level grades awarded on Thursday in England were lower than teachers' predictions. Students, who were not able to sit exams this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, had 280,000 A-level results downgraded. Exam regulator Ofqual has faced criticism over the statistical model it used to decide the grades. Many students are expected to appeal, although there has been confusion over the appeals process afterOfqual withdrew its guidance for challenging resultswithin hours of publishing it on Saturday. New guidelines are still being drawn up by Ofqual, the Department for Education said on Sunday evening. Why did the A-level algorithm say no? 'Huge mess' as exams appeal guidance withdrawn Anger over 'unfair' A-level results Hundreds of students held a demonstration in central London on Sunday to demand clarity over the appeals procedure. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been told by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer that he needs to take ""personal responsibility"" and ""fix"" the situation. The Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) said it looked at 65,000 exam entries in 41 subjects from sixth form colleges and found that grades were 20% lower than historic performances for similar students in those colleges. It said that this equated to ""12,048 missing grades"" in those colleges alone. For example, in Biology, it found that 24% of sixth form college students were awarded a grade lower than similar students in recent years. The SFCA said its analysis of 41 subjects had not found a single one where the results were above the three-year average. Ofqual states that itsobjective for A-level results,externalthis year was to ensure ""national results are broadly similar to previous years"". SFCA said its research showed that Ofqual had ""failed"" to meet that ""fundamental objective"" and the model it used had ""not only failed to produce broadly similar results, but has in fact produced worse results in every single subject"". Bill Watkin, chief executive of the SFCA, said Ofqual should ""immediately recalibrate and rerun the model to provide all students with an accurate grade"". ""Should this still fail to produce results that are broadly similar to previous years, students should be awarded the grades predicted by teachers (known as centre assessed grades),"" he said. Dr Mark Fenton, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, said the results had also been unfair to some of its students. He told the BBC that ""a great injustice has been done"" with ""utterly baffling"" results for some students. He said the ""only fair outcome"" available would be to revert to the grade predicted by teachers and for the limit of 5% extra university places in England to be lifted. The cap on increasing student numbers for each university was put in place by ministers to prevent academically selective universities recruiting heavily to make up for a fall in international students. ""Natural justice must surely now trump the understandable desire to maintain national standards in this, the most exceptional of years,"" Dr Fenton added. Three of Oxford University's colleges -Worcester, Wadham and, as of Sunday evening, St Edmund Hall - have confirmed that all places offered to UK students will be secured irrespective of their A-level results. This video can not be played Nina Bunting-Mitcham: ""My first thought was, my life is completely over"" After exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, grades were awarded using a controversial modelling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. Ahead of GCSE results due to be released on Thursday, former Conservative Education Secretary Lord Kenneth Baker urged the government to delay the publication of grades until the situation surrounding A-levels had been resolved. ""If you are in a hole, stop digging,"" Lord Baker said. The statistical model used by Ofqual faces two legal challenges, with students arguing they were unfairly judged on the school they attend. Before results were released, the Department for Education announced a ""triple-lock"", which meant that students could accept the grade calculated by Ofqual, appeal to receive a ""valid mock result"" or sit autumn exams. The government announced on Friday thatschools would not have to pay to appeal against exam grades. In England, 36% of entries had grades lower than their teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades. A similar situation in Scotland sawa U-turn by the government,which agreed to accept teacher estimates of scores.

Australia apology over Ruby Princess virus outbreak,"Infected passengers were allowed to leave the ship in Sydney in March State officials in Australia have apologised for their failures over the handling of a huge Covid-19 outbreak on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Last week, an inquiry found New South Wales health authorities made ""serious mistakes"" in allowing about 2,650 passengers to disembark when the ship docked in Sydney in March. Those people were not tested for the virus, despite suspected cases aboard. The ship was ultimately linked to at least 900 infections and 28 deaths. Prior to Australia's second wave of the virus - which emerged in Melbourne in June - the cruise ship had been the source of Australia's biggest coronavirus cluster. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was particularly sorry to the 62 people who had caught the virus from passengers who disembarked. ""I can't imagine what it would be like having a loved one - or being someone yourself who continues to suffer and experience trauma as a result - and I want to apologise unreservedly,"" she said. After completing an 11-day return cruise to New Zealand, passengers were allowed to leave the ship at Sydney Harbour and catch public transport, and domestic and overseas flights home. An inquiry report released last Friday found NSW Health had mischaracterised the ship as low-risk, and should have tested sick patients immediately. It was ""inexcusable"" that officials had failed to immediately obtain results from coronavirus swab tests taken on 19 March - the day the vessel docked. However the inquiry found no systemic failures and said the mistakes had already been recognised by the state government. How did Australia's cruise ship debacle happen? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? European countries fight coronavirus surge Following the Ruby Princess debacle, at least a dozen other cruise ships were banned from docking at Australian ports due to their virus risk. Most of the Australian passengers on the Ruby Princess self-isolated at home, in line with government instructions for returning travellers. Excluding a cluster in the island state of Tasmania which spread through a hospital system, 62 people in Australia became infected through secondary transmissions. Ms Berejiklian singled out those cases in her apology, saying: ""Unfortunately in particular for those 62 individuals, the lessons weren't learnt soon enough."" At least a third of passengers - or around 950 people - were from overseas. The inquiry said it was not able to fully assess how many people had caught the virus because many were unable to get tested. How did Australia's cruise ship debacle happen?

Strikes expected in Belarus after mass protests,"This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been heckled by workers on a visit to a factory as anger mounts over his disputed re-election. Workers chanted ""leave"" and booed the long-time leader of the ex-Soviet state as he insisted he would not allow a new vote after allegations of ballot fraud. Strike action spread to state TV, with staff walking out on Monday. Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has suggested she could act as an interim leader. Police violence towards opposition supporters, as well as the alleged poll-rigging in the 9 August vote, fuelled a big protest rally in the capital Minsk on Sunday. Mr Lukashenko has led Belarus since 1994, maintaining close relations with neighbouring Russia, on which Belarus heavily relies for energy supplies. 'The people will not forgive this' In pictures: Striking images from Belarus protests 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change According to local, independent news site Tut.by, Sunday's opposition rally in Minsk was ""the largest in the history of independent Belarus"". A wave of anger has been rising since the Central Election Commission said Mr Lukashenko had won 80.1% of the vote and Ms Tikhanovskaya - 10.12%. Striking workers gathered outside the Minsk tractor factory on Monday Hundreds of protesters have been wounded and two have died in clashes with police over the past week. Some 6,700 people have been arrested, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of security forces. On a visit to a Minsk tractor plant on Monday, Mr Lukashenko sought to defend his disputed victory, telling workers: ""We held the election. Until you kill me, there will be no other election."" 'If you croak we don't care': brutality in Belarus However he said he was willing to hold a referendum and ""hand over my authority in accordance with the constitution - but not under pressure and not via street protests"". As Mr Lukashenko spoke at the factory, workers booed him and chanted ""leave"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Last week, workers at state-run factories walked out in solidarity with the protesters, and more strikes are planned for this week, increasing the pressure on Mr Lukashenko. At state TV, staff walked out in protest against censorship and the election results. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who left for Lithuania after denouncing the results, insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. In a video message released on Monday, she said she was ready to become a ""national leader"" in order to restore calm and normality, freeing political prisoners and preparing for new elections. This video can not be played Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and President Lukashenko give very different messages Russian TV news bulletins have been making ominous parallels between Belarus 2020 and Ukraine 2014. Ukraine's pro-Western revolution led to Moscow sending in its special operations forces to annex Crimea and Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Six years on, could Russia's military intervene in Belarus? On paper, at least, such a move would appear counter-productive. The opposition movement in Belarus is not anti-Russia/pro-Europe - it is anti-Lukashenko. If Russia were to send in troops to shore up the Belarusian leader, it risks alienating the Belarusian people and creating anti-Moscow sentiment. True, Moscow is determined to keep Belarus within what it sees as Russia's sphere of influence. The Kremlin's ultimate goal is deeper integration with its neighbour - a fully-fledged union state (with Vladimir Putin at the helm). It could still achieve this through political leverage. The Kremlin has a pathological fear of ""coloured revolution"" on its doorstep. But Minsk 2020 is not Kyiv 2014. Belarus is not choosing between East and West. The Belarusian people are outraged by the brutality of their security forces. So much so that even Mr Lukashenko's traditional base - including the state factory workers - are deserting him. Rival rallies were held in the capital, with the opposition event appearing to attract much higher numbers. An official report said 65,000 people had attended the presidential rally but unofficial estimates were as low as 10,000. Unofficial estimates for the opposition gathering ranged between 100,000 and 220,000. Mr Lukashenko described the opposition as rats There were reports of state sector workers being forced to attend Mr Lukashenko's rally or face the threat of losing their jobs. What's happening in Belarus? Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile As the president spoke, the anti-Lukashenko protesters gathered for a peaceful rally near a war memorial in the centre of Minsk. A number of officials, as well as current and former police officers, have resigned. Protesters were out in force in Minsk on Sunday The Belarusian ambassador to Slovakia, Igor Leshchenya, declared his solidarity with the protesters.  He told the BBC: ""I represent Belarus and the Belarusian people, which according to our constitution is the only source of power."" EU leaders are to hold an emergency video summit on Wednesday.EU foreign ministers agreed last week to prepare new sanctions,externalagainst Belarusian officials responsible for ""violence, repression and the falsification of election results"". The UK said on Monday it did not accept the results of the ""fraudulent"" election. ""The world has watched with horror at the violence used by the Belarusian authorities,"" saidForeign Secretary Dominic Raab,external. Also on Monday, US President Donald Trump said his administration was following the ""terrible situation"" in Belarus closely. President Lukashenko has sought Russian help, saying President Vladimir Putin has promised to provide comprehensive assistance in the event of any external military threat.

'He's two metres behind you': Pantos in peril,"Pantomimes generate huge profits for theatres, but many have been cancelled because of coronavirus Covid-19's impact on theatres will last years and will be worsened by cancelled pantomimes, an arts manager has warned. Pantomime rehearsals usually begin in August, but most venues have called them off. South Wales cultural boss Richard Hughes said ""consumer confidence"" would dictate the pace of reopening next year. The traditional panto makes significant profits for theatres, who use the money to subsidise other performances. While venues including Cardiff's New Theatre, Mold's Theatr Clwyd and Newport's Riverfront have cancelled their pantomimes, another scheduled at the Swansea Grand has yet to be officially called off. But without relaxing social distancing measures, the traditional panto is unlikely to be able to go ahead. The Grand Pavilion in Porthcawl was due to host its 50th panto season with a production of Aladdin at Christmas. Richard Hughes, chief executive of the Awen Cultural Trust, which runs venues including the Grand Pavilion, decided to cancel all events in March. Mr Hughes said it was a ""sad time"" for theatre, but added ""we understand why this has got to happen"". ""I think it is important that there is always the perspective that this is all done for the right purpose, which is to combat this virus. ""Going forward it is the uncertainty that is difficult to deal with. There is still no light at the end of the tunnel as to when theatres might return, let alone return without social distancing, and that is the only way that we will really be economically viable going forward."" Owen Money was due to perform in Cinderella at many venues across south Wales this year In the valleys north of Porthcawl, smaller scale pantomimes are laid on by broadcaster and entertainer Owen Money. He has been playing to sell-out crowds in venues like Blackwood Miners Institute and the Met in Abertillery for years with his company Rainbow Valley Productions. This Christmas he was due to play the Baron in a production of Cinderella which would be staged 98 times at venues across south Wales, many of which have been cancelled. He fears audiences may decide not to return next year if panto is called off completely. ""People get a bit set in their ways. They'd say, 'We didn't go to panto last year, we won't bother this year'. I think it will take quite a few years to get back to where we were. ""I just hope they don't lose the magic of the panto.""
