How the Taliban retook half of AfghanistanMaps of Afghanistan showing who controls districts in fighting between the government and Taliban.Asia,"The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition. Emboldened by the withdrawal of US troops, they now control all key cities in the country, including Kabul. Who are the Taliban? The Taliban took some areas from government by force. In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. Although renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities. The maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban. Source: BBC research. Districts are 2005 government boundaries Ten days that shook Afghanistan US forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents. Although most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital. The airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. Customs duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. But, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. Disruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular. US troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. But despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas. A  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. In 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.

More pinged workers to get daily Covid tests,"More critical workers will be able to take daily tests rather than isolate when they are identified as a close contact of someone who has Covid. The government said 1,200 extra sites would be established, with prisons, waste management and the armed forces among the sectors prioritised. Some 800 sites are already being set up for police, firefighters, supermarket depot staff and some other industries. Several sectors have warned of staffing shortages caused by 10-day isolations. Covid cases fall below 25,000, latest data shows UK pingdemic response chaotic, say food firms Which workers don't have to self-isolate? A total of 618,903 contact tracing alerts- popularly known as pings - advising people to self-isolate for up to 10 days were sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 15 July. Daily testing for certain critical sectors in England was launched on Monday as an alternative to self-isolation for some workers. The government has not said how many sites are currently up-and-running but that it expected 500 would be set up this week. Tesco is understood to be working through the details of the new scheme, while Morrisons said it was contacting staff who had been pinged to sign up for testing on a voluntary basis, but did say that it was ready to start. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said daily contact testing would play a ""vital role"" in helping to ""minimise the potential for disruption caused by rising cases, while keeping staff protected"". When all 2,000 testing sites are open, 800 will deal with food industry, transport and Border Force workers, as well as police and fire services. The other 1,200 will be for people employed in prisons, waste, defence and veterinary medicine, plus the energy, pharmaceutical, telecoms, chemical, communications, water, space and fish industries. Workers will be allowed to take the tests, rather than isolate, whether or not they are fully vaccinated. The announcement of the scheme's extension came after the number of Covid cases reported in the UKfell to below 25,000on Monday. Frontline health and care staff who are fully vaccinated and identified as a close contact of someone with Covidhave a separate system,,externalallowing some to go to work, subject to strict testing rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are among workers self-isolating after the health secretary tested positive last week. From 16 August, anyone in England who is fully vaccinated - and unvaccinated under-18s - will be able to takePCR tests,external- which are sent to a laboratory to be checked - instead of self-isolating, if pinged. Similar rules come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August.

Tesla profit surge driven by record car deliveries,"Tesla has reported surging profits, despite shortages of semiconductor chips and congestion at ports hampering production. Sales rose to $12bn (Â£8.6bn) in the three months to the end of June, up from $6bn a year ago, when its US factory was shut down. The electric carmaker said it delivered a record 200,000 cars to customers in the same period. It added that public support for greener cars was greater than ever. The company, led by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, reported on Monday that profits soared off the back of strong sales. Profits for the second three months of the year were $1.1bn, up from $104m last year, bolstered by sales of its cheaper Model 3 sedan and Model Y. In an update to investors,externalon Monday, Tesla said: ""Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a never-before-seen inflection point. ""We continue to work hard to drive down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles accessible to as many people as possible."" Tesla added that how quickly it could produce cars throughout the rest of the year would depend on the supply of key parts of its vehicles, with demand at ""record levels"". On a call with financial analysts on Monday, Mr Musk said: ""At this point, I think everyone can agree, electric vehicles are the only way forward."" Mr Musk said during the call that the global chip shortage ""remains quite serious"" and manufacturing would hinge on this ""slowest part of the supply chain"". He also described late-night calls with suppliers in an attempt to resolve shortages. As a result, there were growing waiting times for Tesla cars, especially across Europe, the company said in its results. It will look to start production at its new Berlin ""gigafactory"" as soon as possible.It has been plagued by delays,external, although the company bills it as ""the most advanced high-volume electric vehicle production plant in the world"". It will ramp up the manufacturing of its cars at its California hub in the meantime. Mr Musk was also reportedly seen visiting Lutonearlier this year, sparking rumours he may be considering a Tesla factory in the UK. Elon Musk recently said the firm may accept Bitcoin as a form of payment again in the future Other car giants such as Ford and General Motors have been forced to suspend production temporarily in some US factories, having been hit by the global shortage of semiconductors. Profits at Tesla in the second quarter were also dented, however, by other items such as investments in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. It invested heavily in the digital currency previously. But it stopped taking Bitcoin as a form of payment earlier this year because of Mr Musk's concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which uses huge amounts of electricity. The company reported a $23m loss on its Bitcoin investments on Monday, although its chief executive recently signalled it might accept it again in future. Amazon Bitcoin job ad boosts cryptocurrency surge Elon Musk ârather hatesâ being Tesla boss Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said that this figure was, however, ""much lower than many had feared"". He added that overall, the set of results marked a ""step in the right direction"" for the company, with ""healthy"" growth also seen in China, where Tesla began manufacturing last year. Mr Ives did point out, however, that a big question for investors would be when the company would be able to hit profitability excluding the income it gets from reselling to other carmakers the credits that it earns for exceeding emissions and fuel standards. Between April and the end of June, it saw $354m in revenues generated through the sale of such credits, down from $428m the same period a year before.

Top Trump aide denies working as foreign agent,"Mr Barrack (centre) was a long-time friend of Donald Trump Billionaire investor and former Donald Trump adviser Thomas Barrack has pleaded not guilty to charges of acting as an agent of a foreign government. Mr Barrack, 74, was a key aide to Mr Trump during his 2016 campaign. He has been accused of illegally lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) during and after the election, as well as lying to the FBI. Mr Barrack entered his not guilty plea during his first court appearance on Monday in New York City. The ex-Trump official faces federal charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making multiple false statements to the FBI during a 2019 interview.He was arrested in California last week. As he left court on Monday, Mr Barrack told reporters: ""As you'd expect, the system is working... you'll all see that I'm 100% innocent."" On Monday Matthew Grimes, a former executive at Mr Barrack's company, also pleaded not guilty to charges of illegal lobbying. A UAE citizen, Rashid Sultan Rashid Al Malik Alshahhi, 43, was charged as well and remains at large. The three men are accused of unlawfully trying to promote UAE government interests by using Mr Barrack's connections to influence officials and media appearances. They also allegedly promoted the candidacy of a UAE-favoured individual as US ambassador to Abu Dhabi. Mr Barrack, who also served as Mr Trump's inaugural committee chairman, had been friends with the former president for four decades. The wealthy investor is the latest ex-Trump aide to face criminal charges, like former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump Organization lawyer Michael Cohen. His next court appearance is 2 September. Mr Barrack is currently free on a $250m (Â£180m) bond, but must wear an electronic GPS ankle bracelet, restrict his travel and follow a curfew.

House prices at new high as buyers seek more space,"Surging demand for houses will last well into 2022 as buyers continue to look for more room after being cooped up during the pandemic, says property website Zoopla. A search for space has pushed up the average price of a house by 7.3% over the past year, reaching a new high of Â£230,700, it says. While houses are proving popular, flats are less sought after. But properties of all kinds are in short supply, the firm stressed. ""Demand for houses is twice as high as typically seen at this time of year between 2017 and 2019, accelerating away from demand for flats, creating a disparity in average price growth across the two property types,"" Zoopla said. ""House prices are being supported in part by a severe shortage of homes for sale, with stock levels down some 25% in the first half of the year compared to 2020."" The firm said that while house prices were surging, the growth in flat prices was lagging at 1.4% over the past year. House prices rise at fastest pace in 17 years People moving home drive mortgage borrowing surge Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic ""The rise in demand for houses is something we saw in the first lockdown,"" Grainne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla, told the BBC. ""It's a reassessment among many homeowners of where they want to live."" Ms Gilmore said that with the rise of working from home, many people wanted a spare room that could become an office, while others were seeking garden space. ""A cohort of buyers has eroded the supply of family houses and put upward pressure on house prices more than flats over the past 12 months,"" she said. ""That's a situation that we would expect to continue into 2022."" ""We're still seeing very high levels of demand in the market, even now with more modest stamp duty savings,"" Ms Gilmore added. The price of the average UK house has jumped by 30% since 2007, when a typical house cost just Â£177,300, according to Zoopla. In June alone, house prices were up 5.4% year-on-year, although buyer demand dipped 9% in early July because of the stamp duty holiday coming to an end. Sales agreed this year are still 22% ahead of average levels in 2020. As people are taking the opportunity to move out of big cities, house prices have grown the most in Wales at 10.2% and the North East at 8.8%. House price growth is weakest in London at 5.6%. For flats, prices have risen the most in Scotland at 5.2% and the Midlands at 3.7%, but in London, flat prices have fallen by 0.5%. Zoopla said it was also seeing a jump in demand for properties in outer London, up 86% on 2017-19 levels. But the housing website said that it expected sales in London to improve, ""providing there are no further pandemic setbacks"", since the rental market had already bounced back. ""Further relaxation on the restrictions around global travel will result in a firmer pick-up in demand, which will also reverse the downward trend in pricing,"" Zoopla said.

Shetland fires 'a warning to modular building industry',"This video can not be played The Moorfield Hotel has been extensively damaged by the fire Two devastating fires in Shetland should act as a warning to the modular building industry, it has been claimed. The world-famous Fair Isle Bird Observatory was lost in 2019, followed last year by the Moorfield Hotel. Both buildings were less than 10 years old and made from factory-built units, which had been shipped up to Shetland by sea. One expert has called for a full investigation into why the fires took hold so quickly. Both blazes were particularly severe, and fire crews were unable to stop the spread. No-one was injured in either incident. The observatory had no guests when it was destroyed in March 2019. Susannah and David Parnaby, who were its warden and administrator at the time, had been out when the fire started. Shetland hotel destroyed in overnight blaze Fire destroys Shetland bird observatory The wing of the observatory housing the flat where they lived for a decade was the last section to burn. ""I stayed until it was dark,"" Mrs Parnaby said. ""Where our flat was, that was the last wall to completely burn. I stayed till that point - you know, you've got to see it out, got to witness it, in a weird way."" The couple, who have two children, were made redundant earlier this year but have managed to stay on the island as crofters. The Moorfield Hotel had 70 occupants on the night it caught fire in July 2020. It was due to close a week later having lost its contract to house gas plant workers. Susannah and David Parnaby lost their home in the fire A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) investigation into the Fair Isle blaze was inconclusive, stating that the blaze was likely to have started in the roof space. The SFRS is still investigating the Moorfield Hotel fire, but police said their inquiry was finished, having found no suspicious circumstances. Modular construction is currently enjoying a boom. It is seen as cost-effective, quick and greener; the UK government wants 25% of new affordable homes to be modular. However, some experts are worried that there is also a fire risk and are pointing to the Shetland fires as a warning. Prefab has been around for some time, but stacking modules on top of each other is causing Ian Abley, a technical designer who works for the Fire Protection Association, some concern. Ian Abley said fire getting into the cavities between modules was a problem He writes guidance for insurers about modular buildings and has used one of the Shetland fires as an example in his latest report. ""For the Moorfield Hotel, it's a problem of the fire getting into the cavity between the modules,"" he explained. ""If it can travel from one compartment to another through unseen spaces within the compartment walls and floors, there's very little the fire brigade can do. ""If you're not very careful in the way you put it together there may be combustible materials in those cavities."" Both the hotel and the observatory had passed building standards approval. However, documents obtained via Freedom of Information show a case officer raised concerns about fire safety in the design stage of the Moorfield Hotel. BBC Scotland tracked down the man who made the notes. Stewart Douglas had been concerned at the possibility of fire spreading Stewart Douglas, who is now retired from Shetland Islands Council, identified his handwriting on the plans, and explained he had been concerned at the possibility of fire spreading from a bathroom into a service void. It was not the only issue he had with the design, but these must have been addressed, he said, or the building plans would not have been approved by the council. However, Mr Douglas, who worked in the industry for more than four decades, said sometimes in the construction trade the plans that are signed off do not always match what is built. Asked if the Moorfield Hotel plans matched what was built, he said he could not be 100% sure. ""The only way I could be sure about that is if I'd been on site on a very regular basis, if not daily,"" he said. ""It's not the building standards officer's role or duty to ensure that work's done properly. It's the building owner's responsibility."" Fair Isle Bird Observatory (pictured in the background) was built in 2010 Architect Malcolm Fraser also watched the Shetland fires closely. He works with Construction Scotland Innovation Centre on delivering timber modular buildings, such as the Fair Isle observatory. ""What an extraordinary piece of terrible luck that both the Moorfield and the observatory, as representing the new ways of building on the islands, have both gone on fire"", he said. He believes the investigations should be more wide-ranging, looking at the design of both buildings. ""Were there firebreaks? Did the firebreaks work? Were they installed correctly? And if so, why did the fire seem to have leapt past them? ""These are the obvious questions. ""If this is really the 'construction technology of the future' we need to find out why the fires took hold so quickly. We need the full investigations,"" he said. Fair Isle Bird Observatory was destroyed by fire in 2019 McAleer and Rushe, the contractor which built the Moorfield Hotel, denied any suggestion that there were issues with the construction quality. It said: ""Following the fire at Moorfield Hotel we provided the fire authority with all relevant documentation, including compliance certificates relating to the project, which was completed in 2013. Certificates supplied were compliant with regulations."" BDL Hotels, former owners of the Moorfield Hotel, said they welcomed any review of fire and life safety measures. ""The Moorfield Hotel was designed and built to ensure the safety of guests and staff at all times,"" a statement said. ""The hotel was built by a specialist hotel contractor to all relevant standards, approved by building control and independently inspected by the professional team during construction and at completion. ""The fire started on the top floor, and the fire spread externally along the flat roof behind the false pitched roof. The fire's location made it extremely difficult to reach without the use of aerial firefighting equipment. ""It is sad that despite the heroic efforts of the firefighters the building could not be saved."" Andrew H Wilson Electrical, the builder of the Fair Isle Bird Observatory, went into receivership in 2010. Fair Isle Bird Observatory Trust, the owners of the observatory, declined to comment. Fire safety expert Mr Abley wants assurances in the industry. He said: ""If the construction industry doesn't know how to do cavity construction that prevents fire from spreading from one floor to another, it needs to learn and fast.""

MPs want national register for the home-educated,"Home-education groups say there is no basis for a government register A committee of MPs is calling for a national register of home-educated children in England, saying there is an ""unacceptable level of opaqueness"" surrounding the issue. The Commons Education Committee says it is important to ""get a grip"" on the number in home education. It says more data must be collected to ensure all children out of school get a suitable education. Home educators say this will increase families' lack of trust in the system. The MPs' report - Strengthening Home Education - says the government does not collect national figures for how many children are electively home-educated and parents do not have to register the fact with councils. Committee chair, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, said it was ""frankly astonishing"" that the government was only able to make a ""best guess"" over the standard of education children schooled at home were receiving. According toresearch by the BBC,published earlier this month, the number of children registering for home education in the UK rose by 75% in the first eight months of the current school year. It found more than 40,000 pupils were formally taken out of school in the UK between September 2020 and April 2021, compared with an average of 23,000 over the previous two years. The figures are based on Freedom of Information responses from 153 of the 205 county councils and unitary authorities in Great Britain, and all of Northern Ireland. The education select committee's report notes that it is likely the coronavirus pandemic has increased the number of families choosing to pursue home education. The MPs say some families in England face being forced into home schooling - partly due to a lack of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities. They say there must be assessment of progress in numeracy and literacy to ensure that those who are home-schooled are getting the same opportunities as their school-educated peers. The report also says the government should meet entry costs of exams for home-educated children to help them ""gain the qualifications needed for future education, training and employment, that will allow them to play active roles in society"". Committee chair Mr Halfon said: ""It is frankly astonishing that we are only able to make a best guess at the number of children being educated at home, particularly when the Department for Education itself concedes that there is considerable evidence that many young people are missing out on the teaching and support that they are entitled to. ""Some parents are providing their children with a high-quality educational experience, but those against greater oversight must realise that it does not follow that all home-educated children are in the same boat. ""Getting a grip on the number of young people not being taught in school with a national register for children outside of school must just be the first step in shaking up the status quo."" Mr Halfon added that local authorities must ""keep a much closer eye"" on how home-educated children were progressing, and that financial and practical support should be given to ensure home-educated children could take exams. Home-educated child numbers soar by 75% Covid fears prompt rise in home schooling But the group Education Otherwise said the select committee's inquiry into home schooling was prejudiced. Its chair, Wendy Charles-Warner, told the BBC: ""Yet again we have policy recommended on the basis of rhetoric and rumour, rather than evidence. ""Parents are deeply aggrieved that the huge majority of their submissions - which make clear that there is no basis, nor benefit, in registration of home-educated children - have been ignored, in what was manifestly a predetermined outcome of a deeply prejudiced inquiry. ""This report will serve to increase home-educating families' lack of trust in public bodies even further."" She added: ""The only valid and reasonable recommendation in this report is that home-educated children receive fair access to examinations, a point which should not need making."" Jennifer Skillen, who runs HE Special, an online national support group for parents home-educating children with special educational needs and disabilities, welcomed the call for more support and equal access to exams. But she said a lack of clarity about the exact numbers of families home-educating did not mean those children were not receiving an education. ""This negative assumption can influence the relationship between local authorities and families and should be avoided if the government wishes to build positive relationships,"" she said. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the government must ""find out the reasons behind so many more families choosing home-education recently"". He added: ""NAHT has been calling for an official register of home-educated children for some time - the fact that there is no official source of data is a sign of how unsatisfactory the situation is.""

"Climate summit: Some progress made, says minister","Intense downpours caused flooding in London on the weekend that ministers arrived for climate talks The first in-person meeting of climate ministers in 18 months has seen some tentative progress, says the UK minister who will lead the Glasgow COP26 meeting. Alok Sharma said that the countries aligned more closely on climate issues but on some key matters they were ""not yet close enough"". One of the outstanding questions is the phasing out of coal for energy. Continued use was incompatible with a key climate target, Mr Sharma said. Representatives from 51 countries attended the informal gathering in London over the weekend. COP26: What, where, when? Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? Climate scientists begin debate on vital report Israel to cut 85% of emissions by mid-century Tell climate change stories with the BBC COP26 will aim to raise ambition on tackling climate change - in order to avoid far-reaching consequences for the planet. With just three months until the Glasgow summit, there has been a flurry of scientific and diplomatic activity in recent days related to climate change. Scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the UN's climate science body -have begun two weeks of discussionsto try and agree a new report on the state of the global climate. On the political front,environment ministers from the G20 group of nations,externalmet in Naples, Italy, last week to try and make progress on questions such as the elimination of coal from power generation. While there was strong support for the step, it was opposed by China and India. There was also dissent from some G20 countries on strengthening the language around the 1.5C temperature goal in the Paris agreement, drawn up in 2015. Scientists say that we must keep the global rise in temperatures to 1.5C since industrial times if we are to avoid the most dangerous effects of warming. The planet has already warmed around 1.2C compared to the pre-industrial era. However, the nations did agree that they would all submit new climate pledges before the Glasgow meeting. UK Minister Alok Sharma, centre, is set to chair the key climate conference in Glasgow Many of these same ministers have spent the weekend in London, at an informal gathering organised by the UK to discuss some of the key issues that will need resolving before COP26. In all, representatives from 51 countries including the US, India, China took part in this meeting along with nations hugely vulnerable to rising temperatures such as Rwanda, Costa Rica and the Marshall Islands. One major step forward, apart from the discussions, was that the many of the participants attended in person. ""This was the most important meeting since COP25 in Madrid (in 2019), and it turned out to be an extremely productive meeting,"" said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UNFCCC at a news conference. Mr Sharma said there was a sense among participants that the lived experience of climate change was bringing home to people the urgency of the situation. ""I sense this sense of common endeavour, and a shared desire to address the climate crisis before us,"" said Mr Sharma, who will chair the conference in Glasgow. ""I do think we made progress over these two days, however the issues we discussed are complex, and there are still significant differences that persist. We have moved closer together over the past few days, but still on these vital issues, we are not yet close enough."" Mr Sharma said that keeping the 1.5C temperature goal alive is a key outcome for Glasgow. This will require the world to get to net zero emissions by the middle of this century and would need countries to pursue substantial emissions cuts over the next decade. Net zero means that any greenhouse gas emissions that can't be avoided through the use of clean technology by 2050 will either have to be buried using the technology of carbon capture and storage, or soaked up by plants and soils. But substantial obstacles to achieving this goal remain, of which the rapid phasing out of coal is key. ""We weren't able to get every country in the G20 to agree to language on unabated coal phase out, it's a simple as that,"" Mr Sharma told a news conference. Climate protestors say the UK government is not doing enough with less than 100 days until the Glasgow COP ""For me that was very disappointing and very disappointing for those countries that are supporting of this policy."" Mr Sharma said there had been some progress on issues such as climate finance. The richer world promised back in 2009 that there would be $100bn for poorer countries from 2020 to help them cope with climate change. Securing the cash, even a year late, is seen as a crucial question of trust. Without it, there will be little progress on questions of substance in Glasgow. Other participants felt that the face-to-face talks had been an improvement over the virtual meetings that have taken place for the last year-and-a-half. ""At the UK's ministerial [meeting], the message from small island developing states appeared to be well received. This provides a level of hope that the major emitters are beginning to understand their responsibilities and should be committed to keeping the 1.5C goal in reach,"" stated Minister Molwyn Joseph from Antigua and Barbuda. ""Realistically, this is going to require that we continue to press for declared commitments by the major emitters ahead of COP26 in Glasgow,"" he added. There are also a range of issues relating to the workings of the Paris agreement that have not yet been satisfactorily resolved, such as the role of carbon markets, and common time frames for reporting progress. Mr Sharma said some small steps had been agreed on these questions. Among the ministers attending the meeting was US Climate Envoy John Kerry. He warned recently that countries likeChina will have to do more heavy lifting when it comes to cutting carbon, saying that without greater efforts from Beijing, the idea of keeping the rise in temperatures under 1.5C was ""essentially impossible"".

Final victim identified in Miami building collapse,"Estelle Hedaya, from New York, worked for a jewellery company and lived on the building's sixth floor The family of the final victim unaccounted for in a deadly apartment block collapse in Florida say her remains have been found and identified. The discovery ends a weeks-long wait for the family of 54-year-old Estelle Hedaya, who had been missing since her building collapsed on 24 June. Her brother Ikey Hedaya told US media that local New York police delivered the news to their family on Monday. Her discovery brings the death toll in the collapse disaster to 98. Search teams spent weeks combing the rubble for victims but said on Friday that their search had finally ended. At that time, Estelle Hedaya was still unaccounted for. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Monday that police volunteers were continuing to ""carefully and meticulously"" sift through millions of pounds of debris at a secondary site looking for remains and personal items. ""We have done everything possible to bring closure to the families and I am especially proud that through these tireless efforts we were able at last to bring closure to all those who reported missing loved ones,"" she told reporters. The number of people missing had initially been put as high as 159, but police brought that figure down after weeks of checking reports. Officials say the site where the 12-floor Champlain Towers South building once stood is being treated as a crime scene. What caused the 40-year-old building to fall to the ground remains unknown, but a2018 report had found structural problemswith the ocean-side block. All but one of those killed were recovered dead in the rubble, with one victim dying in hospital. CONTEXT:What we know about the Miami collapse victims EXPLAINER:A visual guide to Miami collapse A funeral is expected to take place for Estelle Hedaya in New York on Tuesday, the AP news agency reports. Her family and friends described her as outgoing and fun-loving and said she loved to travel and try new things, like salsa dancing. Other victims of the disaster include the seven-year-old daughter of a Miami firefighter, a 92-year-old grandmother and the sister of Paraguay's first lady.

Tesla profit surge driven by record car deliveriesThe electric carmaker's revenues nearly doubled in the three months to 30 June compared with last year.Business,"Tesla has reported surging profits, despite shortages of semiconductor chips and congestion at ports hampering production. Sales rose to $12bn (Â£8.6bn) in the three months to the end of June, up from $6bn a year ago, when its US factory was shut down. The electric carmaker said it delivered a record 200,000 cars to customers in the same period. It added that public support for greener cars was greater than ever. The company, led by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, reported on Monday that profits soared off the back of strong sales. Profits for the second three months of the year were $1.1bn, up from $104m last year, bolstered by sales of its cheaper Model 3 sedan and Model Y. In an update to investors,externalon Monday, Tesla said: ""Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a never-before-seen inflection point. ""We continue to work hard to drive down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles accessible to as many people as possible."" Tesla added that how quickly it could produce cars throughout the rest of the year would depend on the supply of key parts of its vehicles, with demand at ""record levels"". On a call with financial analysts on Monday, Mr Musk said: ""At this point, I think everyone can agree, electric vehicles are the only way forward."" Mr Musk said during the call that the global chip shortage ""remains quite serious"" and manufacturing would hinge on this ""slowest part of the supply chain"". He also described late-night calls with suppliers in an attempt to resolve shortages. As a result, there were growing waiting times for Tesla cars, especially across Europe, the company said in its results. It will look to start production at its new Berlin ""gigafactory"" as soon as possible.It has been plagued by delays,external, although the company bills it as ""the most advanced high-volume electric vehicle production plant in the world"". It will ramp up the manufacturing of its cars at its California hub in the meantime. Mr Musk was also reportedly seen visiting Lutonearlier this year, sparking rumours he may be considering a Tesla factory in the UK. Elon Musk recently said the firm may accept Bitcoin as a form of payment again in the future Other car giants such as Ford and General Motors have been forced to suspend production temporarily in some US factories, having been hit by the global shortage of semiconductors. Profits at Tesla in the second quarter were also dented, however, by other items such as investments in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. It invested heavily in the digital currency previously. But it stopped taking Bitcoin as a form of payment earlier this year because of Mr Musk's concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which uses huge amounts of electricity. The company reported a $23m loss on its Bitcoin investments on Monday, although its chief executive recently signalled it might accept it again in future. Amazon Bitcoin job ad boosts cryptocurrency surge Elon Musk ârather hatesâ being Tesla boss Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said that this figure was, however, ""much lower than many had feared"". He added that overall, the set of results marked a ""step in the right direction"" for the company, with ""healthy"" growth also seen in China, where Tesla began manufacturing last year. Mr Ives did point out, however, that a big question for investors would be when the company would be able to hit profitability excluding the income it gets from reselling to other carmakers the credits that it earns for exceeding emissions and fuel standards. Between April and the end of June, it saw $354m in revenues generated through the sale of such credits, down from $428m the same period a year before.

"More pinged workers to get daily Covid testsWaste workers, prison staff and defence workers will be able to avoid isolation, the government says.UK Politics","More critical workers will be able to take daily tests rather than isolate when they are identified as a close contact of someone who has Covid. The government said 1,200 extra sites would be established, with prisons, waste management and the armed forces among the sectors prioritised. Some 800 sites are already being set up for police, firefighters, supermarket depot staff and some other industries. Several sectors have warned of staffing shortages caused by 10-day isolations. Covid cases fall below 25,000, latest data shows UK pingdemic response chaotic, say food firms Which workers don't have to self-isolate? A total of 618,903 contact tracing alerts- popularly known as pings - advising people to self-isolate for up to 10 days were sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 15 July. Daily testing for certain critical sectors in England was launched on Monday as an alternative to self-isolation for some workers. The government has not said how many sites are currently up-and-running but that it expected 500 would be set up this week. Tesco is understood to be working through the details of the new scheme, while Morrisons said it was contacting staff who had been pinged to sign up for testing on a voluntary basis, but did say that it was ready to start. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said daily contact testing would play a ""vital role"" in helping to ""minimise the potential for disruption caused by rising cases, while keeping staff protected"". When all 2,000 testing sites are open, 800 will deal with food industry, transport and Border Force workers, as well as police and fire services. The other 1,200 will be for people employed in prisons, waste, defence and veterinary medicine, plus the energy, pharmaceutical, telecoms, chemical, communications, water, space and fish industries. Workers will be allowed to take the tests, rather than isolate, whether or not they are fully vaccinated. The announcement of the scheme's extension came after the number of Covid cases reported in the UKfell to below 25,000on Monday. Frontline health and care staff who are fully vaccinated and identified as a close contact of someone with Covidhave a separate system,,externalallowing some to go to work, subject to strict testing rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are among workers self-isolating after the health secretary tested positive last week. From 16 August, anyone in England who is fully vaccinated - and unvaccinated under-18s - will be able to takePCR tests,external- which are sent to a laboratory to be checked - instead of self-isolating, if pinged. Similar rules come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August.

A motorcyclist drives through deep water on a flooded road in The Nine Elms district of London One woman described her ""heartbreak"" as flood water ruined her parents home in Walthamstow. Nicola Thorogood, 33, said her family tried to prevent water coming into the house but eventually had to give up and attempt to salvage as many belongings as possible. She said her parents had ""worked so hard all their life to have that house and it's the thing they're most proud of and want to pass on to us eventually"". ""It's that that breaks my heart,"" she said. ""We took what we could upstairs, obviously anything like sentimental photos and things like that. ""Then we retreated upstairs to my parents' room and just watched the rain fall and the flood come in."" By Tom Edwards, BBC London Environment Correspondent Gardens in Walthamstow remain full of floodwater Like cities all over the world, London finds itself facing extreme weather. Twice in the last fortnight, it has suffered flash floods with a huge amount of rain in a short period of time. Experts say with a warming climate, extreme weather will become worse and much more common. And it's not like London hasn't been warned. In one report, Green Party London Assembly members warned 23 stations on the London Underground Network were at significant risk of flooding as well as 643 schools. The mayor said more is needed to be done to combat the impacts of climate change but he wants more powers and financial backing from the government. As it stands, experts say London has to get proactive and increase its resilience against flash floods. Residents on a street in Woodford, in east London, grabbed buckets, brooms and wooden boards to prevent rising rainwater from flooding their homes. Resident Chris Datetweeted,externala photo of a bus in Bakers Arms, Walthamstow, saying the flood water was ""above the kerb"". ""It's impossible to walk on the pavement. To get on that bus the water came up to my shins. This is a canal, not a road,"" he said. Mr Elliott said the flooding was the worst he had experienced in the city, and described seeing ""buses stood broken down in the water"". Homes in Ilford were also deluged with flood water Buses were caught up in storm waters Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""in contact with key partners"" with whom he will hold a roundtable. Mr Khan said: ""We are seeing increasing incidents of extreme weather events linked to climate change. This is not the first time in recent weeks that London has been hit by major flooding. ""Despite having limited powers in the area, it remains a key priority for myself and London's council leaders that more is done urgently to tackle flooding and the other impacts of climate change."" Dr Veronica Edmonds-Brown, senior lecturer in aquatic ecology at the University of Hertfordshire said London's Victorian era drainage system ""cannot cope with the huge increase in population"". Dr Edmonds-Brown said there were several reasons for Sunday's flooding. ""The first is building on the floodplains of the Thames and River Lea. The second is urbanisation. The more impervious surfaces we install - and we are amid a rapid housing programme at the moment - the worse this situation will get. ""The final reason is that our drainage system is not built for the amount of water it is receiving. Due to budget limitations, local authorities are not able to maintain or improve them."" The government said it would support any councils affected by flooding. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The Environment Agency is looking at the situation closely and continues to work with local authorities to ensure that any support they need is provided."" The spokesman said Boris Johnson agreed with scientists that extreme weather was more likely as a result of global warming, but it was a matter for experts to decide whether individual events were down to the phenomenon.

Today's live page was brought to you by Becky Morton, Julian Joyce, Jennifer Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Francesca Gillett. You can read our latest story on the Covid pandemic in the UK here. We'll be bringing this live page to a close shortly so here's a summary of the main stories today: Radio 4 PM The number of new cases recorded in the UK has fallen for the sixth day in a row - the first time this has happened without any lockdown being imposed since the whole pandemic began. Prof Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who advises the government on respiratory viruses, was asked on BBC Radio 4's PM programme why this is happening. ""I think we're all cautiously pleased,"" he says - but adds that the next few days of figures will show if it's a sustained reduction, or ""just a blip"". ""It is exciting to see those rather encouraging figures but there have been some delays in reporting the figures and we're still waiting for the full data to be released by the Office for National Statistics,"" he says. ""So let's not get overexcited."" Have we reached herd immunity? We're getting there, suggests Openshaw. ""The proportion of people who have got antibodies... is reaching those very, very high levels that we would want to see in a population that is going to be resistant,"" he says. But because the Delta variant is so transmissible, there have been predictions that we'd need immunity rates of up to 98.5% because it's so contagious. The UK is at more than 90%, he says. ""I really don't want people to go away with the idea they can now throw away all caution,"" he adds. And of course, any impact of the lockdown easing in England last Monday isn't showing up yet, he says. Airlines UK - the trade group representing carriers - has written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saying international bookings have failed to recover despite some restrictions easing. The group blamed the government's ""frustrating""traffic light systemand expensive requirements to get tested. It said spending on travel was now back at ""the same fraught position as last year"" - and said confidence has been weakened by the government removing Portugal and the Balearics from the green list less than a month after they were added. ""These represent examples of the frustrating, last-minute and opaque decision-making that has been a mainstay of the [traffic light] system so far,"" the group wrote. The government says the traffic light system helps to stop new Covid variants from being brought into the UK. More on this story here. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC News Senegal is one of the countries that Unicef is working to get vaccines to under the Covax scheme Senegal's health ministry is warning that hospitals in the capital Dakar are becoming overwhelmed due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. Infections have soared over the past month from a few dozen a day to around 1,700 daily cases. Health officials in Senegal are warning that medical staff in the capital Dakar are experiencing burn-out and almost all hospital beds in the city are full. This third wave of Covid-19 infections is also putting a strain on laboratories which are overwhelmed by the rise in demand for tests. Senegal - like many other African countries - is a victim of the lopsided global distribution of vaccines. It's struggling to get supplies and so far just 5% of the Senegalese population has received a single dose. The authorities will also be aware that a few months ago curfews and other restrictions led to riots as people struggled to earn a living. Ministers delayed taking a decision last Thursday saying they wanted more information about the risks Theatres and concert venues in Northern Ireland can reopen from Tuesday evening, the NI Executive has agreed. Ministers met earlier after delaying the decision, saying they wanted more information about risks. But unlike in England, there are still rules for theatres and venues - including audience members must purchase tickets in advance, must have allocated seating and social distancing of 1m (3ft) will be required. Other changes to restrictions have also been made, including an increase in the number of people who can meet indoors. And in line with elsewhere in the the UK, fully vaccinated people returning to Northern Ireland from so-called amber countries will not have to quarantine. Read the full story here. Hacking experts warn that cyber-attacks are likely to become more frequent, and suggest businesses cannot afford to underestimate the hidden impact the pandemic has had on their vulnerability. A recent survey from the UK and US-based security firm, Tessian, has found that 56% of senior IT technicians believe their employees have picked up bad cyber-security habits while working from home. Worryingly, the survey found that many employees agreed with that assessment. Nearly two in five (39%) admitted that their cyber-security practices at home were less thorough than those practised in the office, with half admitting that this is a result of feeling less scrutinised by their IT departments now than prior to Covid. ""One of the main mistakes we've seen is moving company data to personal e-mail accounts,"" says Henry Trevelyan-Thomas, Tessian's vice-president of Customer Success. ""When you do that, it's likely you don't have any sort of two-factor authentication. This then makes it easier for attackers to exploit that data. If data is leaked, attackers compromise it and it can end up in the wrong hands."" Read more here.  The number of people testing positive for Covid has continued to fall in the UK, the latest daily figures show. A further 24,950 new cases were reported on Monday - down from 29,173 the day before. It's the first time since mid-November that the UK has seen cases fall for six consecutive days. Back then, it was following the reintroduction of national lockdown measures in England. Because of technical difficulties, there were delays in processing the number of daily deaths in England so that figure hasn't been released yet. A GP is being investigated for taking 300 Covid-19 vaccines to be administered outside of an official vaccination centre. Patients in Portsmouth, Hampshire, who received one of the doses are being offered an additional jab as a precaution. The Portsmouth Clinical Commissioning Group has warned that the 300 vaccinations given by the GP, who has not been named, might not be as effective if they had not been stored at the correct temperature. A spokeswoman says: ""These vaccinations were given by a GP outside of an NHS-approved vaccination site. ""While there is no reason to suggest that people vaccinated at this site are at any increased risk, we are acting on advice from Public Health England and contacting them to offer an additional vaccination as a precaution."" Covid passports have been in the news over the past week. It's because the government announced it is planning to make it a requirement for people to have proof they are fully vaccinated if they want to go to nightclubs or some other large, crowded venues in England. The rule is expected to come into force at the end of September. People can show it has been at least two weeks since their second dose - meaning they are fully vaccinated - using the NHS Covid Pass. The pass can also be used to show: People in England can request a Covid passvia the NHS website,externalor, if you are registered with a GP, theNHS app,external(not theNHS Covid-19 app,,externalwhich is used for contact tracing). You can read more about Covid passes here. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 A scientist who sits on a sub-group of the Sage says he does not believe Covid passports would encourage more young people to be vaccinated. From the end of September the government plans to require proof of full vaccination to attend nightclubs and other large, crowded venues in England. Prof Robert West tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""Using a sort of stick approach as opposed to a carrot and stick approach I think is a mistake."" The professor - who sits on the behavioural science panel - says: ""By and large, if we want to get people to do things, it is far better to get them on board with the idea of doing it rather than getting them to do it simply because they felt they have to, because when you do that you start to create resentment, to create inequities and people start to game the system."" West adds: âThere is a concern that people are not coming forward to be vaccinated, and unfortunately I suspect this may be a side effect of the sort of rhetoric going around which is kind of like normalising the virus and saying, 'well itâs not as serious as all that'. ""And so I think we do really need to step up the campaign to explain to people how important it is for them to be vaccinated."" The use of face masks among young people has fallen since restrictions were eased in England on 19 July, a new poll suggests. The YouGov survey found 46% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they wore a face mask in a public place in the last two weeks, compared to 58% on 16 July and 64% on 2 June. Meanwhile, the survey of 1,742 British adults, which was carried out between 21-22 July, found other age groups were still wearing face coverings at around the same rate. Some 69% of all Britons say they wore a face mask in the last two weeks, compared to 71% on 16 July and 73% on 2 June. Since 19 July,face masks have no longer been legally required in England, although government guidance says it ""expects and recommends"" people to wear them in crowded areas like public transport. Some transport providers, including Transport for London, still require passengers to wear face coverings to travel. Meanwhile, the proportion of Britons thinking the government is handling Covid-19 well fell from 41% just before 19 July to 34% afterwards. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There are concerns today in China that an outbreak, beginning at
an airport last week, may have spread to other parts of the country. Last week, a number of airport workers tested positive at the
Nanjing Lukou International Airport, prompting flight cancellations
and delays. In the last 24 hours, 39 people have tested positive for Covid-19
with symptoms in the eastern city of Nanjing. A further eight are asymptomatic. In total, 88 people have now tested positive in Nanjing. And
today, there are also reports on asymptomatic cases of Covid-19in southern Guangdong,externalprovinceand eastern Anhui province.,externalBoth patients had recently returned from Nanjing. Nanjingâs health commission has said that the majority of cases in
the city are exhibiting mild symptoms thanks to most patients being vaccinated. Nanjing is now attempting to prevent further transmission by
conducting a massive testing drive and inspection points have been set up along the motorways to test people
before they leave the city. Much of Nanjing â a city with a population of 9.3 million â is
now under lockdown. Oliver Voysey is a regular visitor to the Lake District Calvert Trust A 13-year-old boy has received an award from the prime minister after raising Â£250,000 to save a charity that almost closed permanently because of Covid restrictions. The Lake District Calvert Trust - which provides outdoor adventure holidays for disabled adults and children - says it faced its ""darkest hour"" last year, when it lost Â£1m in revenue due to lockdown. The charity feared it may not reopen. Oliver Voysey, who is a regular visitor to the centre, completed a series of themed challenges in the run up to his 13th birthday, such as walking on a treadmill for 13 minutes. Oliver suffered a brain injury when he was two days old, and has sight loss, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism and learning difficulties. He's now been given the Prime Minister's Points of Light award, with Boris Johnson saying he was ""lost in awe hearing about your phenomenal fundraising appeal to help the activity centre you love"". The centre raised a further Â£500,000 through an additional appeal and reopened last month. Read more here. There's a disagreement in Scotland over a pledge by the government to get people aged 40-49 fully vaccinated. Last month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament that ""by July 26, we expect to have given second doses to all 40- to 49-year-olds"". That deadline was today - but figures show almost a quarter of that age group still have not had two doses. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government over not meeting the pledge. But Sturgeon has responded, telling the PA news agency that the government's target was to offer first doses, not provide them, by 26 July. ""I think it's important we deal in facts and not in childish politics, which at this time is not what we should be doing,"" she said during a visit on Monday. ""No vaccination target has been missed and that's not an opinion, that's a fact. ""What we set ourselves the target of was offering, by now, the first dose of the vaccine to every adult, everybody over the age of 18, and two doses to the over 40 age group. ""Those targets have been met, everybody in those age groups had those offers and appointments. Uptake rates are very high by the standards of any previous vaccination programme."" Scotland also announced 1,000 new coronavirus cases and no further deaths. There were 475 people in hospital with Covid on Sunday, the figures showed. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Ingemo Andersson with Iconovo's vaccine inhaler Right now, protection against Covid-19 comes via an injection. But in future, those vaccines could come from inhalers or even pills. Swedish chemist Ingemo Andersson and her team hope a thin, plastic inhaler, half the size of a matchbox, could play a big role in the fight against coronavirus, allowing people to take powdered versions of future vaccines at home. ""It's easy and it's really cheap to produce,"" says Johan Waborg, chief executive of Iconovo, a firm which usually makes inhalers for patients with asthma. ""You just remove a little plastic slip and then the vaccine inhaler is activated and you just put it in your mouth, take a deep breath and inhale."" It is collaborating with an immunology research start-up in Stockholm, ISR, which has developed a dry-powder vaccine against Covid-19. It uses manufactured Covid-19 virus proteins (unlike Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca which use RNA or DNA that code for these proteins), and can withstand temperatures of up to 40C. Read more here. A new survey suggests more than 40% of adults in England have gained weight during the pandemic - with the average gain being half a stone (just over 3kg). Public Health England (PHE) surveyed 5,000 people and said the Covid lockdowns and disrupted daily routines have made it challenging for people to eat healthily and keep fit. Snacking and comfort eating were given as the main contributor by about half of those who said they were fatter. PHE is now recommending a summer fitness drive. ""We know how hard it can be to lose weight and keep it off - so, we are providing a range of support options to help motivate people and help them maintain a healthy weight,"" it said, as it launchedits Better Health campaign with the NHS.,external Read the full story here. More from Downing Street, where the prime minister's spokesman did not deny reports that students would need to be fully vaccinated to attend university lectures. ""You have heard what the PM has said before, specifically that the pandemic is not over,"" he says. ""We are still looking at the scope for vaccination certifications."" Asked if there was concern about take-up of the vaccines in younger age groups, the spokesman says: ""I think you continue to see more and more young people coming forward to receive the vaccine, both in terms of first doses and now second doses. ""Of course, we want to see more people come forward to receive it. ""We would like to see everybody who is invited to come forward and receive the vaccination to do so. That's the message we continue to try and give to young people."" Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent As we heard earlier, the government says 500 testing sites will be operating for critical workers by the end of this week so staff can avoid self-isolation after being in contact with a positive case. Morrisons supermarket has said three of its largest depots will be included in the initial 15 priority testing sites. Theyâre now in the process of contacting staff who have been double-vaccinated and pinged by the NHS Covid app to see if they would like to move to a daily testing regime. The scheme is voluntary. Testing on site is not expected to begin today, but Morrisons says it's ready to start. They havenât named which sites will be taking part. Most remaining coronavirus rules were relaxed in the UK exactly a week ago - but the government figures show the number of daily cases has been falling. Why is that? We don't know for sure, but some reasons have been suggested:  But we won't know if there's been any rise in new cases linked to the reopening in England on 19 July for some days to come. In other countries, such as the Netherlands and Spain, the reopening of nightclubs has been followed by a sharp rise in infections. Some scientists say the impact of unlocking in England is extremely hard to predict but could be offset by schools closing closing for the summer holidays. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

High Court bid against road schemes dismissed,"Other work in the government strategy could see improvements to the A66 between Cumbria and North Yorkshire A High Court challenge against a proposed Â£27bn road development scheme that includes a new road tunnel close to Stonehenge has been dismissed. The Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2) relates to 45 government projects in England. Campaigners said the government ignored the environmental impact of RIS2 and it had been unlawfully approved. Mr Justice Holgate said its net zero carbon target had ""plainly been taken into account"" when it was approved.

Today's live page was brought to you by Becky Morton, Julian Joyce, Jennifer Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Francesca Gillett. You can read our latest story on the Covid pandemic in the UK here. We'll be bringing this live page to a close shortly so here's a summary of the main stories today: Radio 4 PM The number of new cases recorded in the UK has fallen for the sixth day in a row - the first time this has happened without any lockdown being imposed since the whole pandemic began. Prof Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who advises the government on respiratory viruses, was asked on BBC Radio 4's PM programme why this is happening. ""I think we're all cautiously pleased,"" he says - but adds that the next few days of figures will show if it's a sustained reduction, or ""just a blip"". ""It is exciting to see those rather encouraging figures but there have been some delays in reporting the figures and we're still waiting for the full data to be released by the Office for National Statistics,"" he says. ""So let's not get overexcited."" Have we reached herd immunity? We're getting there, suggests Openshaw. ""The proportion of people who have got antibodies... is reaching those very, very high levels that we would want to see in a population that is going to be resistant,"" he says. But because the Delta variant is so transmissible, there have been predictions that we'd need immunity rates of up to 98.5% because it's so contagious. The UK is at more than 90%, he says. ""I really don't want people to go away with the idea they can now throw away all caution,"" he adds. And of course, any impact of the lockdown easing in England last Monday isn't showing up yet, he says. Airlines UK - the trade group representing carriers - has written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saying international bookings have failed to recover despite some restrictions easing. The group blamed the government's ""frustrating""traffic light systemand expensive requirements to get tested. It said spending on travel was now back at ""the same fraught position as last year"" - and said confidence has been weakened by the government removing Portugal and the Balearics from the green list less than a month after they were added. ""These represent examples of the frustrating, last-minute and opaque decision-making that has been a mainstay of the [traffic light] system so far,"" the group wrote. The government says the traffic light system helps to stop new Covid variants from being brought into the UK. More on this story here. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC News Senegal is one of the countries that Unicef is working to get vaccines to under the Covax scheme Senegal's health ministry is warning that hospitals in the capital Dakar are becoming overwhelmed due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. Infections have soared over the past month from a few dozen a day to around 1,700 daily cases. Health officials in Senegal are warning that medical staff in the capital Dakar are experiencing burn-out and almost all hospital beds in the city are full. This third wave of Covid-19 infections is also putting a strain on laboratories which are overwhelmed by the rise in demand for tests. Senegal - like many other African countries - is a victim of the lopsided global distribution of vaccines. It's struggling to get supplies and so far just 5% of the Senegalese population has received a single dose. The authorities will also be aware that a few months ago curfews and other restrictions led to riots as people struggled to earn a living. Ministers delayed taking a decision last Thursday saying they wanted more information about the risks Theatres and concert venues in Northern Ireland can reopen from Tuesday evening, the NI Executive has agreed. Ministers met earlier after delaying the decision, saying they wanted more information about risks. But unlike in England, there are still rules for theatres and venues - including audience members must purchase tickets in advance, must have allocated seating and social distancing of 1m (3ft) will be required. Other changes to restrictions have also been made, including an increase in the number of people who can meet indoors. And in line with elsewhere in the the UK, fully vaccinated people returning to Northern Ireland from so-called amber countries will not have to quarantine. Read the full story here. Hacking experts warn that cyber-attacks are likely to become more frequent, and suggest businesses cannot afford to underestimate the hidden impact the pandemic has had on their vulnerability. A recent survey from the UK and US-based security firm, Tessian, has found that 56% of senior IT technicians believe their employees have picked up bad cyber-security habits while working from home. Worryingly, the survey found that many employees agreed with that assessment. Nearly two in five (39%) admitted that their cyber-security practices at home were less thorough than those practised in the office, with half admitting that this is a result of feeling less scrutinised by their IT departments now than prior to Covid. ""One of the main mistakes we've seen is moving company data to personal e-mail accounts,"" says Henry Trevelyan-Thomas, Tessian's vice-president of Customer Success. ""When you do that, it's likely you don't have any sort of two-factor authentication. This then makes it easier for attackers to exploit that data. If data is leaked, attackers compromise it and it can end up in the wrong hands."" Read more here.  The number of people testing positive for Covid has continued to fall in the UK, the latest daily figures show. A further 24,950 new cases were reported on Monday - down from 29,173 the day before. It's the first time since mid-November that the UK has seen cases fall for six consecutive days. Back then, it was following the reintroduction of national lockdown measures in England. Because of technical difficulties, there were delays in processing the number of daily deaths in England so that figure hasn't been released yet. A GP is being investigated for taking 300 Covid-19 vaccines to be administered outside of an official vaccination centre. Patients in Portsmouth, Hampshire, who received one of the doses are being offered an additional jab as a precaution. The Portsmouth Clinical Commissioning Group has warned that the 300 vaccinations given by the GP, who has not been named, might not be as effective if they had not been stored at the correct temperature. A spokeswoman says: ""These vaccinations were given by a GP outside of an NHS-approved vaccination site. ""While there is no reason to suggest that people vaccinated at this site are at any increased risk, we are acting on advice from Public Health England and contacting them to offer an additional vaccination as a precaution."" Covid passports have been in the news over the past week. It's because the government announced it is planning to make it a requirement for people to have proof they are fully vaccinated if they want to go to nightclubs or some other large, crowded venues in England. The rule is expected to come into force at the end of September. People can show it has been at least two weeks since their second dose - meaning they are fully vaccinated - using the NHS Covid Pass. The pass can also be used to show: People in England can request a Covid passvia the NHS website,externalor, if you are registered with a GP, theNHS app,external(not theNHS Covid-19 app,,externalwhich is used for contact tracing). You can read more about Covid passes here. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 A scientist who sits on a sub-group of the Sage says he does not believe Covid passports would encourage more young people to be vaccinated. From the end of September the government plans to require proof of full vaccination to attend nightclubs and other large, crowded venues in England. Prof Robert West tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""Using a sort of stick approach as opposed to a carrot and stick approach I think is a mistake."" The professor - who sits on the behavioural science panel - says: ""By and large, if we want to get people to do things, it is far better to get them on board with the idea of doing it rather than getting them to do it simply because they felt they have to, because when you do that you start to create resentment, to create inequities and people start to game the system."" West adds: âThere is a concern that people are not coming forward to be vaccinated, and unfortunately I suspect this may be a side effect of the sort of rhetoric going around which is kind of like normalising the virus and saying, 'well itâs not as serious as all that'. ""And so I think we do really need to step up the campaign to explain to people how important it is for them to be vaccinated."" The use of face masks among young people has fallen since restrictions were eased in England on 19 July, a new poll suggests. The YouGov survey found 46% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they wore a face mask in a public place in the last two weeks, compared to 58% on 16 July and 64% on 2 June. Meanwhile, the survey of 1,742 British adults, which was carried out between 21-22 July, found other age groups were still wearing face coverings at around the same rate. Some 69% of all Britons say they wore a face mask in the last two weeks, compared to 71% on 16 July and 73% on 2 June. Since 19 July,face masks have no longer been legally required in England, although government guidance says it ""expects and recommends"" people to wear them in crowded areas like public transport. Some transport providers, including Transport for London, still require passengers to wear face coverings to travel. Meanwhile, the proportion of Britons thinking the government is handling Covid-19 well fell from 41% just before 19 July to 34% afterwards. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There are concerns today in China that an outbreak, beginning at
an airport last week, may have spread to other parts of the country. Last week, a number of airport workers tested positive at the
Nanjing Lukou International Airport, prompting flight cancellations
and delays. In the last 24 hours, 39 people have tested positive for Covid-19
with symptoms in the eastern city of Nanjing. A further eight are asymptomatic. In total, 88 people have now tested positive in Nanjing. And
today, there are also reports on asymptomatic cases of Covid-19in southern Guangdong,externalprovinceand eastern Anhui province.,externalBoth patients had recently returned from Nanjing. Nanjingâs health commission has said that the majority of cases in
the city are exhibiting mild symptoms thanks to most patients being vaccinated. Nanjing is now attempting to prevent further transmission by
conducting a massive testing drive and inspection points have been set up along the motorways to test people
before they leave the city. Much of Nanjing â a city with a population of 9.3 million â is
now under lockdown. Oliver Voysey is a regular visitor to the Lake District Calvert Trust A 13-year-old boy has received an award from the prime minister after raising Â£250,000 to save a charity that almost closed permanently because of Covid restrictions. The Lake District Calvert Trust - which provides outdoor adventure holidays for disabled adults and children - says it faced its ""darkest hour"" last year, when it lost Â£1m in revenue due to lockdown. The charity feared it may not reopen. Oliver Voysey, who is a regular visitor to the centre, completed a series of themed challenges in the run up to his 13th birthday, such as walking on a treadmill for 13 minutes. Oliver suffered a brain injury when he was two days old, and has sight loss, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism and learning difficulties. He's now been given the Prime Minister's Points of Light award, with Boris Johnson saying he was ""lost in awe hearing about your phenomenal fundraising appeal to help the activity centre you love"". The centre raised a further Â£500,000 through an additional appeal and reopened last month. Read more here. There's a disagreement in Scotland over a pledge by the government to get people aged 40-49 fully vaccinated. Last month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament that ""by July 26, we expect to have given second doses to all 40- to 49-year-olds"". That deadline was today - but figures show almost a quarter of that age group still have not had two doses. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government over not meeting the pledge. But Sturgeon has responded, telling the PA news agency that the government's target was to offer first doses, not provide them, by 26 July. ""I think it's important we deal in facts and not in childish politics, which at this time is not what we should be doing,"" she said during a visit on Monday. ""No vaccination target has been missed and that's not an opinion, that's a fact. ""What we set ourselves the target of was offering, by now, the first dose of the vaccine to every adult, everybody over the age of 18, and two doses to the over 40 age group. ""Those targets have been met, everybody in those age groups had those offers and appointments. Uptake rates are very high by the standards of any previous vaccination programme."" Scotland also announced 1,000 new coronavirus cases and no further deaths. There were 475 people in hospital with Covid on Sunday, the figures showed. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Ingemo Andersson with Iconovo's vaccine inhaler Right now, protection against Covid-19 comes via an injection. But in future, those vaccines could come from inhalers or even pills. Swedish chemist Ingemo Andersson and her team hope a thin, plastic inhaler, half the size of a matchbox, could play a big role in the fight against coronavirus, allowing people to take powdered versions of future vaccines at home. ""It's easy and it's really cheap to produce,"" says Johan Waborg, chief executive of Iconovo, a firm which usually makes inhalers for patients with asthma. ""You just remove a little plastic slip and then the vaccine inhaler is activated and you just put it in your mouth, take a deep breath and inhale."" It is collaborating with an immunology research start-up in Stockholm, ISR, which has developed a dry-powder vaccine against Covid-19. It uses manufactured Covid-19 virus proteins (unlike Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca which use RNA or DNA that code for these proteins), and can withstand temperatures of up to 40C. Read more here. A new survey suggests more than 40% of adults in England have gained weight during the pandemic - with the average gain being half a stone (just over 3kg). Public Health England (PHE) surveyed 5,000 people and said the Covid lockdowns and disrupted daily routines have made it challenging for people to eat healthily and keep fit. Snacking and comfort eating were given as the main contributor by about half of those who said they were fatter. PHE is now recommending a summer fitness drive. ""We know how hard it can be to lose weight and keep it off - so, we are providing a range of support options to help motivate people and help them maintain a healthy weight,"" it said, as it launchedits Better Health campaign with the NHS.,external Read the full story here. More from Downing Street, where the prime minister's spokesman did not deny reports that students would need to be fully vaccinated to attend university lectures. ""You have heard what the PM has said before, specifically that the pandemic is not over,"" he says. ""We are still looking at the scope for vaccination certifications."" Asked if there was concern about take-up of the vaccines in younger age groups, the spokesman says: ""I think you continue to see more and more young people coming forward to receive the vaccine, both in terms of first doses and now second doses. ""Of course, we want to see more people come forward to receive it. ""We would like to see everybody who is invited to come forward and receive the vaccination to do so. That's the message we continue to try and give to young people."" Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent As we heard earlier, the government says 500 testing sites will be operating for critical workers by the end of this week so staff can avoid self-isolation after being in contact with a positive case. Morrisons supermarket has said three of its largest depots will be included in the initial 15 priority testing sites. Theyâre now in the process of contacting staff who have been double-vaccinated and pinged by the NHS Covid app to see if they would like to move to a daily testing regime. The scheme is voluntary. Testing on site is not expected to begin today, but Morrisons says it's ready to start. They havenât named which sites will be taking part. Most remaining coronavirus rules were relaxed in the UK exactly a week ago - but the government figures show the number of daily cases has been falling. Why is that? We don't know for sure, but some reasons have been suggested:  But we won't know if there's been any rise in new cases linked to the reopening in England on 19 July for some days to come. In other countries, such as the Netherlands and Spain, the reopening of nightclubs has been followed by a sharp rise in infections. Some scientists say the impact of unlocking in England is extremely hard to predict but could be offset by schools closing closing for the summer holidays. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

A motorcyclist drives through deep water on a flooded road in The Nine Elms district of London One woman described her ""heartbreak"" as flood water ruined her parents home in Walthamstow. Nicola Thorogood, 33, said her family tried to prevent water coming into the house but eventually had to give up and attempt to salvage as many belongings as possible. She said her parents had ""worked so hard all their life to have that house and it's the thing they're most proud of and want to pass on to us eventually"". ""It's that that breaks my heart,"" she said. ""We took what we could upstairs, obviously anything like sentimental photos and things like that. ""Then we retreated upstairs to my parents' room and just watched the rain fall and the flood come in."" By Tom Edwards, BBC London Environment Correspondent Gardens in Walthamstow remain full of floodwater Like cities all over the world, London finds itself facing extreme weather. Twice in the last fortnight, it has suffered flash floods with a huge amount of rain in a short period of time. Experts say with a warming climate, extreme weather will become worse and much more common. And it's not like London hasn't been warned. In one report, Green Party London Assembly members warned 23 stations on the London Underground Network were at significant risk of flooding as well as 643 schools. The mayor said more is needed to be done to combat the impacts of climate change but he wants more powers and financial backing from the government. As it stands, experts say London has to get proactive and increase its resilience against flash floods. Residents on a street in Woodford, in east London, grabbed buckets, brooms and wooden boards to prevent rising rainwater from flooding their homes. Resident Chris Datetweeted,externala photo of a bus in Bakers Arms, Walthamstow, saying the flood water was ""above the kerb"". ""It's impossible to walk on the pavement. To get on that bus the water came up to my shins. This is a canal, not a road,"" he said. Mr Elliott said the flooding was the worst he had experienced in the city, and described seeing ""buses stood broken down in the water"". Homes in Ilford were also deluged with flood water Buses were caught up in storm waters Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""in contact with key partners"" with whom he will hold a roundtable. Mr Khan said: ""We are seeing increasing incidents of extreme weather events linked to climate change. This is not the first time in recent weeks that London has been hit by major flooding. ""Despite having limited powers in the area, it remains a key priority for myself and London's council leaders that more is done urgently to tackle flooding and the other impacts of climate change."" Dr Veronica Edmonds-Brown, senior lecturer in aquatic ecology at the University of Hertfordshire said London's Victorian era drainage system ""cannot cope with the huge increase in population"". Dr Edmonds-Brown said there were several reasons for Sunday's flooding. ""The first is building on the floodplains of the Thames and River Lea. The second is urbanisation. The more impervious surfaces we install - and we are amid a rapid housing programme at the moment - the worse this situation will get. ""The final reason is that our drainage system is not built for the amount of water it is receiving. Due to budget limitations, local authorities are not able to maintain or improve them."" The government said it would support any councils affected by flooding. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The Environment Agency is looking at the situation closely and continues to work with local authorities to ensure that any support they need is provided."" The spokesman said Boris Johnson agreed with scientists that extreme weather was more likely as a result of global warming, but it was a matter for experts to decide whether individual events were down to the phenomenon.

GB's Daley & Lee win Olympic diving goldGB's Pidcock takes mountain bike goldWhat's happened so far on day three?Tokyo Olympics medals table,"This video can not be played Tom Daley and Matty Lee claim gold in men's synchronised 10m platform Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Tom Daley ended his long wait for an Olympic gold medal with a sublime display alongside Matty Lee in a nerve-filled men's synchronised 10m platform event at Tokyo 2020. In a nail-biting finale, the British pair watched on as Cao Yuan and Chen Aisen conducted their final dive and broke into wild celebrations when it became clear they had ended China's golden grip on the event, dating back to 2000. For Daley - now 27 - it marks a first gold medal at his fourth Olympic Games and he wept with joy on the podium, while Lee - four years his junior - can contemplate gold at the first time of asking. ""I still can't honestly believe what is happening,"" Daley told BBC Sport. ""That moment, being about to be announced as Olympic champions, I was gone. I was blubbering."" Tears on the podium for a dream come true - the story of Tom Daley The pair dived impeccably throughout, moving top of the leaderboard after four dives, before going on to expertly handle nerves and pressure in their final two routines. The British duo's total score of 471.81 left China's Cao and Chen with too much to do and when their tally of 470.58 appeared on the giant screen, Daley, Lee, their coaches and a score of team-mates could not hide their emotions. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Tom Daley and Matty Lee take diving gold - highlights Former Olympic silver medallist Leon Taylor told BBC viewers he was fighting back tears watching ""pictures that speak a thousand words"". On a morning where Britain'sAdam Peaty and Tom Pidcock won golds in swimming and mountain bike cross countryrespectively, BBC presenter Sam Quek spoke of feeling ""goose bumps"" as she watched Daley cry while the national anthem played. Lee - who moved to London to train with Daley in 2018 - deserves immense praise for his handling of the pressure-filled situation but a huge focus will now turn to his partner, who has become a household name across Britain ever since his debut at the 2008 Games, aged 14. His journey has been one filled with emotion, with an outpouring of sympathy on show following the death of his father in 2011. Daley would explain he hoped to one day be ""half the dad my dad was to me"" and his Olympic gold arrived in his first Games since become a father to son Robbie - who is named after his dad - in 2018.

Daley, who married husband Dustin Lance Black in 2017, has said becoming a father offered him ""a different headspace"" going into the Tokyo Games. And so it proved as he upgraded bronze medals in the individual and synchronised 10m events in 2012 and 2016 respectively for a landmark gold. ""To finally have this around my neck, I've been diving over 20 years,"" added Daley. ""Lots of people would have counted me out but I'm in the best shape and with the support with Matty, we've had that unstoppable mentality this year and that's the first time I've ever been able to think like that. ""I can't believe what is happening and I didn't think I would get here in the first place."" This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Watch Tom Daley and Matty Lee's emotional interview after winning gold Daley's win is all the more poignant as his future in the sport is uncertain beyond his position in the men's field for the 10m individual event later in the Games. After 13 years at the elite Olympic level and with a gold medal now in his possession, there is little more he can achieve given he has already won European, World and Commonwealth golds. His experience appeared to shine through at key times during his golden Olympic moment but he later explained he felt he was ""going to crumble"" at points and he thanked Lee for ""holding things together."" Lee replied: ""It's crazy. I don't understand what happened. To be able to share my first Olympics with Tom and get a gold, it's special."" An error by the Chinese pair in their fourth dive opened the door for Daley and Lee, whose score of 93.96 for a back three-and-a-half somersaults at the same stage moved them to top spot. A mark of 89.76 for a reverse three-and-a-half somersaults kept them ahead after round five but a flawless tilt at their toughest routine - a forward four-and-a-half somersault - was judged at 101.01 for their final dive. With the Russian Olympic Committee team in bronze-medal position, the quality of the final Chinese effort prompted a minor pause for breath before the Daley-Lee celebrations could breakout. Daley, once a point of curiosity for a watching British audience given his tender teenage years, has remained dedicated and persistent while handling scrutiny away from competition. He has spent half his life focused on Olympic cycles while carrying a weight of expectation. With Lee's steadfast help, at last he has his gold medal. Allow Twitter content?

The 20 gold medals are seven behind Rio and eight behind London. The final day in Rio delivered Joseph Joyce's boxing silver medal. In London, Anthony Joshua won boxing gold on the last day amongst three medals. This year though, there are track cycling events on the last day with Jack Carlin and Laura Kenny as strongest potential medallists. In addition, Team GB have a guaranteed 64th medal from Lauren Price and Callum Hawkins amongst the best marathon runners. On Great Britain v ROC for fourth place: As expected, ROC won three gold medals to overtake Great Britain on the medal table on day 15. Both have 20 gold medals but ROC have won five more silvers. On Sunday, ROC have two opportunities to win golds - in rhythmic gymnastics and handball. Russia won both of these events at the last Olympic Games and are favourites to win both again. To finish fourth on the medal table, Great Britain probably need to win two gold medals on Sunday and hope that ROC do not win both of these events.

Heathrow warns of further fall in passengers,"International travel from the UK is yet to restart in a ""meaningful"" way despite the easing of some restrictions, the industry says. Trade group Airlines UK said bookings had failed to recover due to the ""frustrating"" traffic light system and costly testing requirements. It added that consumer confidence would remain weak without change. The comments came as Heathrow warned it expects to see a further fall in passenger numbers in 2021. The airport, which was Europe's busiest before the pandemic, welcomed just four million passengers in the first six months of the year - a total that it would have taken just 18 days to reach in 2019. In a letter to the transport secretary Grant Shapps, Airlines UK noted that passenger bookings in the rest of Europe had recovered to 50% of pre-crisis levels in June, compared to just 16% in the UK. Fully jabbed France arrivals must still isolate What are the rules for foreign holidays this summer? Meanwhile, US visitor numbers to the UK are still only 20% of 2019 levels, whereas to the EU they are around 65%. Blaming the traffic light system, the trade group said spending on travel was now back at ""the same fraught position as last year"". It cited the decision to remove Portugal from the green list of Covid-safe destinations, closely followed by the Balearics, both within a month of their initial inclusion. It also criticised the decision to maintain quarantine rules for arrivals from France, while removing them for travellers from all other amber list destinations. ""These represent examples of the frustrating, last-minute and opaque decision-making that has been a mainstay of the [traffic light] system so far,"" the group wrote. ""[There has also been] a refusal to make more proportionate travel restrictions from low-risk countries even as nightclubs open in England - without any restrictions."" The government says the traffic light system helps to stop new Covid variants from being brought into the UK. But in its results for the six months to 30 June, Heathrow also criticised the rules for creating unreasonable costs and conditions for travellers. Currently anyone who is not fully vaccinated, or who was fully vaccinated outside the UK, has to pay for three tests - one before arriving in England, and tests on day two and day eight after arrival - and quarantine for 10 days on their return from amber list countries such as Spain. They also have the option of ending quarantine early by paying for a test under the Test and Release scheme on day five. Heathrow now believes just 21.5 million passengers will travel through the airport in 2021, down from 22.1 million in 2020 at the height of the pandemic, and down from almost 90 million in 2019. The airport said its cumulative losses from Covid now stood at some Â£2.9bn. ""The UK is emerging from the worst effects of the health pandemic, but is falling behind its EU rivals in international trade by being slow to remove restrictions,"" said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye. ""Replacing PCR tests with lateral flow tests and opening up to EU and US vaccinated travellers at the end of July will start to get Britain's economic recovery off the ground."" Ryanair says it has seen a surge in bookings in recent weeks In separate results, Ryanair said it had seen a surge in summer bookings in the past few weeks, but it said many people were booking at the last minute amid fears travel rules could change. The airline's chief financial officer, Neil Sorahan, said the EU's digital Covid certificate, which allows a person's vaccination status to be recognised across the whole bloc, had boosted bookings. ""I think the European policy has worked an awful lot better than in the UK,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""It's given more certainty, it's led to more steady green lists all across Europe. The UK has been a little bit more haphazard with what's on the green list, what's on the amber list."" The carrier now expects to fly 90-100 million passengers this financial year - up from the lower end of a previously forecast range of 80-100 million. But that is still way off the 148.6 million it flew in 2019. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said: ""Pricing remains below pre Covid-19 levels and there will continue to be great value for Ryanair guests travelling this summer as we focus on recovering traffic, jobs and tourism across our European network. ""Based on current (close-in) bookings, we expect traffic to rise from over five million in June to almost nine million in July, and over 10 million in August, as long as there are no further Covid setbacks in Europe.""

Senior doctors to be consulted on pay rise offer,"Senior doctors in England will be asked whether they want to consider industrial action over the 3% pay rise offered by the government. The British Medical Association union says tens of thousands hospital consultants will be contacted. It previously said industrial action may be considered if senior doctors were not given at least a 5% rise. The Royal College of Nursing has also said that itcould consider strikingand would consult members. The Department of Health was criticised over its previous stance that only a 1% rise was affordable. But earlier this week,ministers announced a 3% pay rise offerfollowing a recommendation from an independent pay review body. It is for most NHS staff in England, including nurses, paramedics, consultants, dentists and salaried GPs and is backdated to April 2021. All NHS staff in Walesare to be offered a 3% rise by the Welsh government. But the BMA, which represents doctors, said whilst the latest pay offer represented an increase on the government's ""paltry"" 1% offer, it was still ""well below"" the 5% minimum pay rise its consultants' committee had been calling for. It argues that senior doctors are exhausted and feel undervalued because of previous below-inflation pay rises. NHS workers in England offered 3% pay rise What is the state of NHS pay? Unions to consult NHS staff over 3% pay rise Dr Vishal Sharma, the chair of the BMA's consultants committee, said the pay offer was ""bitterly disappointing"" and showed ""once again how little the government values the dedication and expertise of consultants in England - many of whom have been brought to the brink of breaking point by the pressures of the past 18 months"". He added: ""Consultants have given their all in leading the fight against Covid-19, some at the expense of their own health, others with their lives. And this pressure will only intensify as we begin to tackle the backlog of delayed treatment caused by the pandemic."" Consultants have not taken industrial action since the 1970s, apart from a day of action over pensions in 2012. The BMA has previously said industrial action by consultants would involve stopping paid and unpaid overtime, which would affect patient clinics and attempts by hospitals to reduce waiting lists. The findings of its survey will be reviewed by the union and help leaders decide whether to proceed to a formal ballot. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""NHS staff - from doctors and nurses to paramedics and porters - are rightly receiving a 3% pay rise this year in recognition of their extraordinary efforts throughout this global pandemic. ""This follows the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body and the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration, who considered a wide range of evidence from organisations across government, the NHS and trade unions in making the decision.""

Â£48m to improve adoption in England,"A new Â£48m National Adoption Strategy seeks to improve adoption services and help place more children with families as it launches in England. Thousands of families will benefit from better support when adopting children - ending a postcode lottery that many face, the government said. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""There is no substitute for a loving, permanent family."" Adoption support groups have welcomed the new approach. Charity Adoption UK said there were nearly 3,000 children waiting to be adopted in England - the average wait is now 15 months from the point they are taken into care. But older children, siblings, those with special educational needs and those from ethnic minority groups can face difficulty finding a place. How has adoption changed in the pandemic? 'Birth family turned our adopted sons against us' Adopting siblings 'the best feeling in the world' The new strategy is an attempt to tackle this, with clarification for local authorities that people looking to adopt should never be deterred from doing so because they are worried about their own background. Instead, councils will be urged to prioritise an adopters' ability to provide a stable environment for a young person to grow up in, the government said. It will also provide more training for front-line staff and support the work of over 30 regional adoption agencies. Alison Woodhead, Adoption UK's director of public affairs and an adoptive parent herself, welcomed the fact the strategy marked a shift from placing children with families to ""supporting those families over the long term"". It is an ""important moment"" for adopters - but the concern is how to hold adoption agencies to account ""for making these big shifts"" without new legislation in place. The strategy is funded by Â£48m for 2021-22, adding to an investment of more than Â£200m for adoptive families since 2015 - including post-adoption support, therapy and activities. Vicky Ford, children's minister, said it was crucial to make sure there was support for families ""not only when the children are young but through their teenage life and into adulthood"". The new funding will make sure the level of support is ""equaled out across the country"", she added. She also said that children from certain ethnic minorities can wait longer to be adopted. The government wants to ""break down some of those barriers from the past"", which has led to people thinking they can only adopt children of the same ethnic background as them. The minister said they want to challenge other misconceptions, adding that you do not have to be in a couple to adopt, or own your own home, for example. ""We are committed to improving adoption services, as well as breaking down barriers so that parents from all walks of life can adopt and to ensure they are not deterred from adopting simply because of their background,"" Mr Williamson added. ""We have taken steps to ensure these children and young people can be matched with the families that are right for them, but we know there is more to do and this strategy sets out our vision for radically improving systems so that we can be confident that every adoptive family in England is receiving the same high quality service no matter where they live."" Lucy Peake, the chief executive of the Kinship care charity, said the funding would ""mean that many more kinship carers will be able to access advice and peer support when they need it, helping them provide stable and loving care for vulnerable children"". Cathy Ashley, of Family Rights Group, said the charity's advice line ""received more calls than at any time in its history"" last year, with new funding allowing it to advise 1,300 more callers a year about their rights and options.

Today's live page was brought to you by Becky Morton, Julian Joyce, Jennifer Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Francesca Gillett. You can read our latest story on the Covid pandemic in the UK here. We'll be bringing this live page to a close shortly so here's a summary of the main stories today: Radio 4 PM The number of new cases recorded in the UK has fallen for the sixth day in a row - the first time this has happened without any lockdown being imposed since the whole pandemic began. Prof Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who advises the government on respiratory viruses, was asked on BBC Radio 4's PM programme why this is happening. ""I think we're all cautiously pleased,"" he says - but adds that the next few days of figures will show if it's a sustained reduction, or ""just a blip"". ""It is exciting to see those rather encouraging figures but there have been some delays in reporting the figures and we're still waiting for the full data to be released by the Office for National Statistics,"" he says. ""So let's not get overexcited."" Have we reached herd immunity? We're getting there, suggests Openshaw. ""The proportion of people who have got antibodies... is reaching those very, very high levels that we would want to see in a population that is going to be resistant,"" he says. But because the Delta variant is so transmissible, there have been predictions that we'd need immunity rates of up to 98.5% because it's so contagious. The UK is at more than 90%, he says. ""I really don't want people to go away with the idea they can now throw away all caution,"" he adds. And of course, any impact of the lockdown easing in England last Monday isn't showing up yet, he says. Airlines UK - the trade group representing carriers - has written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saying international bookings have failed to recover despite some restrictions easing. The group blamed the government's ""frustrating""traffic light systemand expensive requirements to get tested. It said spending on travel was now back at ""the same fraught position as last year"" - and said confidence has been weakened by the government removing Portugal and the Balearics from the green list less than a month after they were added. ""These represent examples of the frustrating, last-minute and opaque decision-making that has been a mainstay of the [traffic light] system so far,"" the group wrote. The government says the traffic light system helps to stop new Covid variants from being brought into the UK. More on this story here. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC News Senegal is one of the countries that Unicef is working to get vaccines to under the Covax scheme Senegal's health ministry is warning that hospitals in the capital Dakar are becoming overwhelmed due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. Infections have soared over the past month from a few dozen a day to around 1,700 daily cases. Health officials in Senegal are warning that medical staff in the capital Dakar are experiencing burn-out and almost all hospital beds in the city are full. This third wave of Covid-19 infections is also putting a strain on laboratories which are overwhelmed by the rise in demand for tests. Senegal - like many other African countries - is a victim of the lopsided global distribution of vaccines. It's struggling to get supplies and so far just 5% of the Senegalese population has received a single dose. The authorities will also be aware that a few months ago curfews and other restrictions led to riots as people struggled to earn a living. Ministers delayed taking a decision last Thursday saying they wanted more information about the risks Theatres and concert venues in Northern Ireland can reopen from Tuesday evening, the NI Executive has agreed. Ministers met earlier after delaying the decision, saying they wanted more information about risks. But unlike in England, there are still rules for theatres and venues - including audience members must purchase tickets in advance, must have allocated seating and social distancing of 1m (3ft) will be required. Other changes to restrictions have also been made, including an increase in the number of people who can meet indoors. And in line with elsewhere in the the UK, fully vaccinated people returning to Northern Ireland from so-called amber countries will not have to quarantine. Read the full story here. Hacking experts warn that cyber-attacks are likely to become more frequent, and suggest businesses cannot afford to underestimate the hidden impact the pandemic has had on their vulnerability. A recent survey from the UK and US-based security firm, Tessian, has found that 56% of senior IT technicians believe their employees have picked up bad cyber-security habits while working from home. Worryingly, the survey found that many employees agreed with that assessment. Nearly two in five (39%) admitted that their cyber-security practices at home were less thorough than those practised in the office, with half admitting that this is a result of feeling less scrutinised by their IT departments now than prior to Covid. ""One of the main mistakes we've seen is moving company data to personal e-mail accounts,"" says Henry Trevelyan-Thomas, Tessian's vice-president of Customer Success. ""When you do that, it's likely you don't have any sort of two-factor authentication. This then makes it easier for attackers to exploit that data. If data is leaked, attackers compromise it and it can end up in the wrong hands."" Read more here.  The number of people testing positive for Covid has continued to fall in the UK, the latest daily figures show. A further 24,950 new cases were reported on Monday - down from 29,173 the day before. It's the first time since mid-November that the UK has seen cases fall for six consecutive days. Back then, it was following the reintroduction of national lockdown measures in England. Because of technical difficulties, there were delays in processing the number of daily deaths in England so that figure hasn't been released yet. A GP is being investigated for taking 300 Covid-19 vaccines to be administered outside of an official vaccination centre. Patients in Portsmouth, Hampshire, who received one of the doses are being offered an additional jab as a precaution. The Portsmouth Clinical Commissioning Group has warned that the 300 vaccinations given by the GP, who has not been named, might not be as effective if they had not been stored at the correct temperature. A spokeswoman says: ""These vaccinations were given by a GP outside of an NHS-approved vaccination site. ""While there is no reason to suggest that people vaccinated at this site are at any increased risk, we are acting on advice from Public Health England and contacting them to offer an additional vaccination as a precaution."" Covid passports have been in the news over the past week. It's because the government announced it is planning to make it a requirement for people to have proof they are fully vaccinated if they want to go to nightclubs or some other large, crowded venues in England. The rule is expected to come into force at the end of September. People can show it has been at least two weeks since their second dose - meaning they are fully vaccinated - using the NHS Covid Pass. The pass can also be used to show: People in England can request a Covid passvia the NHS website,externalor, if you are registered with a GP, theNHS app,external(not theNHS Covid-19 app,,externalwhich is used for contact tracing). You can read more about Covid passes here. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 A scientist who sits on a sub-group of the Sage says he does not believe Covid passports would encourage more young people to be vaccinated. From the end of September the government plans to require proof of full vaccination to attend nightclubs and other large, crowded venues in England. Prof Robert West tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""Using a sort of stick approach as opposed to a carrot and stick approach I think is a mistake."" The professor - who sits on the behavioural science panel - says: ""By and large, if we want to get people to do things, it is far better to get them on board with the idea of doing it rather than getting them to do it simply because they felt they have to, because when you do that you start to create resentment, to create inequities and people start to game the system."" West adds: âThere is a concern that people are not coming forward to be vaccinated, and unfortunately I suspect this may be a side effect of the sort of rhetoric going around which is kind of like normalising the virus and saying, 'well itâs not as serious as all that'. ""And so I think we do really need to step up the campaign to explain to people how important it is for them to be vaccinated."" The use of face masks among young people has fallen since restrictions were eased in England on 19 July, a new poll suggests. The YouGov survey found 46% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they wore a face mask in a public place in the last two weeks, compared to 58% on 16 July and 64% on 2 June. Meanwhile, the survey of 1,742 British adults, which was carried out between 21-22 July, found other age groups were still wearing face coverings at around the same rate. Some 69% of all Britons say they wore a face mask in the last two weeks, compared to 71% on 16 July and 73% on 2 June. Since 19 July,face masks have no longer been legally required in England, although government guidance says it ""expects and recommends"" people to wear them in crowded areas like public transport. Some transport providers, including Transport for London, still require passengers to wear face coverings to travel. Meanwhile, the proportion of Britons thinking the government is handling Covid-19 well fell from 41% just before 19 July to 34% afterwards.

an airport last week, may have spread to other parts of the country. Last week, a number of airport workers tested positive at the
Nanjing Lukou International Airport, prompting flight cancellations
and delays. In the last 24 hours, 39 people have tested positive for Covid-19
with symptoms in the eastern city of Nanjing. A further eight are asymptomatic. In total, 88 people have now tested positive in Nanjing. And
today, there are also reports on asymptomatic cases of Covid-19in southern Guangdong,externalprovinceand eastern Anhui province.,externalBoth patients had recently returned from Nanjing. Nanjingâs health commission has said that the majority of cases in
the city are exhibiting mild symptoms thanks to most patients being vaccinated. Nanjing is now attempting to prevent further transmission by
conducting a massive testing drive and inspection points have been set up along the motorways to test people
before they leave the city. Much of Nanjing â a city with a population of 9.3 million â is
now under lockdown. Oliver Voysey is a regular visitor to the Lake District Calvert Trust A 13-year-old boy has received an award from the prime minister after raising Â£250,000 to save a charity that almost closed permanently because of Covid restrictions. The Lake District Calvert Trust - which provides outdoor adventure holidays for disabled adults and children - says it faced its ""darkest hour"" last year, when it lost Â£1m in revenue due to lockdown. The charity feared it may not reopen. Oliver Voysey, who is a regular visitor to the centre, completed a series of themed challenges in the run up to his 13th birthday, such as walking on a treadmill for 13 minutes. Oliver suffered a brain injury when he was two days old, and has sight loss, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism and learning difficulties. He's now been given the Prime Minister's Points of Light award, with Boris Johnson saying he was ""lost in awe hearing about your phenomenal fundraising appeal to help the activity centre you love"". The centre raised a further Â£500,000 through an additional appeal and reopened last month. Read more here. There's a disagreement in Scotland over a pledge by the government to get people aged 40-49 fully vaccinated. Last month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament that ""by July 26, we expect to have given second doses to all 40- to 49-year-olds"". That deadline was today - but figures show almost a quarter of that age group still have not had two doses. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government over not meeting the pledge. But Sturgeon has responded, telling the PA news agency that the government's target was to offer first doses, not provide them, by 26 July. ""I think it's important we deal in facts and not in childish politics, which at this time is not what we should be doing,"" she said during a visit on Monday. ""No vaccination target has been missed and that's not an opinion, that's a fact. ""What we set ourselves the target of was offering, by now, the first dose of the vaccine to every adult, everybody over the age of 18, and two doses to the over 40 age group. ""Those targets have been met, everybody in those age groups had those offers and appointments. Uptake rates are very high by the standards of any previous vaccination programme."" Scotland also announced 1,000 new coronavirus cases and no further deaths. There were 475 people in hospital with Covid on Sunday, the figures showed.

Theyâre now in the process of contacting staff who have been double-vaccinated and pinged by the NHS Covid app to see if they would like to move to a daily testing regime. The scheme is voluntary. Testing on site is not expected to begin today, but Morrisons says it's ready to start. They havenât named which sites will be taking part. Most remaining coronavirus rules were relaxed in the UK exactly a week ago - but the government figures show the number of daily cases has been falling. Why is that? We don't know for sure, but some reasons have been suggested:  But we won't know if there's been any rise in new cases linked to the reopening in England on 19 July for some days to come.

Today's live page was brought to you by Becky Morton, Julian Joyce, Jennifer Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Francesca Gillett. You can read our latest story on the Covid pandemic in the UK here. We'll be bringing this live page to a close shortly so here's a summary of the main stories today: Radio 4 PM The number of new cases recorded in the UK has fallen for the sixth day in a row - the first time this has happened without any lockdown being imposed since the whole pandemic began. Prof Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who advises the government on respiratory viruses, was asked on BBC Radio 4's PM programme why this is happening. ""I think we're all cautiously pleased,"" he says - but adds that the next few days of figures will show if it's a sustained reduction, or ""just a blip"". ""It is exciting to see those rather encouraging figures but there have been some delays in reporting the figures and we're still waiting for the full data to be released by the Office for National Statistics,"" he says. ""So let's not get overexcited."" Have we reached herd immunity? We're getting there, suggests Openshaw. ""The proportion of people who have got antibodies... is reaching those very, very high levels that we would want to see in a population that is going to be resistant,"" he says. But because the Delta variant is so transmissible, there have been predictions that we'd need immunity rates of up to 98.5% because it's so contagious. The UK is at more than 90%, he says. ""I really don't want people to go away with the idea they can now throw away all caution,"" he adds. And of course, any impact of the lockdown easing in England last Monday isn't showing up yet, he says. Airlines UK - the trade group representing carriers - has written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saying international bookings have failed to recover despite some restrictions easing. The group blamed the government's ""frustrating""traffic light systemand expensive requirements to get tested. It said spending on travel was now back at ""the same fraught position as last year"" - and said confidence has been weakened by the government removing Portugal and the Balearics from the green list less than a month after they were added. ""These represent examples of the frustrating, last-minute and opaque decision-making that has been a mainstay of the [traffic light] system so far,"" the group wrote. The government says the traffic light system helps to stop new Covid variants from being brought into the UK. More on this story here. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC News Senegal is one of the countries that Unicef is working to get vaccines to under the Covax scheme Senegal's health ministry is warning that hospitals in the capital Dakar are becoming overwhelmed due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. Infections have soared over the past month from a few dozen a day to around 1,700 daily cases. Health officials in Senegal are warning that medical staff in the capital Dakar are experiencing burn-out and almost all hospital beds in the city are full. This third wave of Covid-19 infections is also putting a strain on laboratories which are overwhelmed by the rise in demand for tests. Senegal - like many other African countries - is a victim of the lopsided global distribution of vaccines. It's struggling to get supplies and so far just 5% of the Senegalese population has received a single dose. The authorities will also be aware that a few months ago curfews and other restrictions led to riots as people struggled to earn a living. Ministers delayed taking a decision last Thursday saying they wanted more information about the risks Theatres and concert venues in Northern Ireland can reopen from Tuesday evening, the NI Executive has agreed. Ministers met earlier after delaying the decision, saying they wanted more information about risks. But unlike in England, there are still rules for theatres and venues - including audience members must purchase tickets in advance, must have allocated seating and social distancing of 1m (3ft) will be required. Other changes to restrictions have also been made, including an increase in the number of people who can meet indoors. And in line with elsewhere in the the UK, fully vaccinated people returning to Northern Ireland from so-called amber countries will not have to quarantine. Read the full story here.

Daley and Lee win Olympic diving goldGB's Yee wins triathlon silver in TokyoPidcock takes mountain biking goldWhat's happened so far on day three?Flooded London hospitals ask patients to stay away,"This video can not be played Tom Daley and Matty Lee claim gold in men's synchronised 10m platform Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Tom Daley ended his long wait for an Olympic gold medal with a sublime display alongside Matty Lee in a nerve-filled men's synchronised 10m platform event at Tokyo 2020. In a nail-biting finale, the British pair watched on as Cao Yuan and Chen Aisen conducted their final dive and broke into wild celebrations when it became clear they had ended China's golden grip on the event, dating back to 2000. For Daley - now 27 - it marks a first gold medal at his fourth Olympic Games and he wept with joy on the podium, while Lee - four years his junior - can contemplate gold at the first time of asking. ""I still can't honestly believe what is happening,"" Daley told BBC Sport. ""That moment, being about to be announced as Olympic champions, I was gone. I was blubbering."" Tears on the podium for a dream come true - the story of Tom Daley The pair dived impeccably throughout, moving top of the leaderboard after four dives, before going on to expertly handle nerves and pressure in their final two routines. The British duo's total score of 471.81 left China's Cao and Chen with too much to do and when their tally of 470.58 appeared on the giant screen, Daley, Lee, their coaches and a score of team-mates could not hide their emotions. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Tom Daley and Matty Lee take diving gold - highlights Former Olympic silver medallist Leon Taylor told BBC viewers he was fighting back tears watching ""pictures that speak a thousand words"". On a morning where Britain'sAdam Peaty and Tom Pidcock won golds in swimming and mountain bike cross countryrespectively, BBC presenter Sam Quek spoke of feeling ""goose bumps"" as she watched Daley cry while the national anthem played. Lee - who moved to London to train with Daley in 2018 - deserves immense praise for his handling of the pressure-filled situation but a huge focus will now turn to his partner, who has become a household name across Britain ever since his debut at the 2008 Games, aged 14. His journey has been one filled with emotion, with an outpouring of sympathy on show following the death of his father in 2011. Daley would explain he hoped to one day be ""half the dad my dad was to me"" and his Olympic gold arrived in his first Games since become a father to son Robbie - who is named after his dad - in 2018.

Daley, who married husband Dustin Lance Black in 2017, has said becoming a father offered him ""a different headspace"" going into the Tokyo Games. And so it proved as he upgraded bronze medals in the individual and synchronised 10m events in 2012 and 2016 respectively for a landmark gold. ""To finally have this around my neck, I've been diving over 20 years,"" added Daley.

This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Watch Tom Daley and Matty Lee's emotional interview after winning gold Daley's win is all the more poignant as his future in the sport is uncertain beyond his position in the men's field for the 10m individual event later in the Games. After 13 years at the elite Olympic level and with a gold medal now in his possession, there is little more he can achieve given he has already won European, World and Commonwealth golds. His experience appeared to shine through at key times during his golden Olympic moment but he later explained he felt he was ""going to crumble"" at points and he thanked Lee for ""holding things together."" Lee replied: ""It's crazy. I don't understand what happened. To be able to share my first Olympics with Tom and get a gold, it's special."" An error by the Chinese pair in their fourth dive opened the door for Daley and Lee, whose score of 93.96 for a back three-and-a-half somersaults at the same stage moved them to top spot. A mark of 89.76 for a reverse three-and-a-half somersaults kept them ahead after round five but a flawless tilt at their toughest routine - a forward four-and-a-half somersault - was judged at 101.01 for their final dive. With the Russian Olympic Committee team in bronze-medal position, the quality of the final Chinese effort prompted a minor pause for breath before the Daley-Lee celebrations could breakout. Daley, once a point of curiosity for a watching British audience given his tender teenage years, has remained dedicated and persistent while handling scrutiny away from competition. He has spent half his life focused on Olympic cycles while carrying a weight of expectation. With Lee's steadfast help, at last he has his gold medal. Allow Twitter content?

Daley and Lee win Olympic gold,"This video can not be played Tom Daley and Matty Lee claim gold in men's synchronised 10m platform Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Tom Daley ended his long wait for an Olympic gold medal with a sublime display alongside Matty Lee in a nerve-filled men's synchronised 10m platform event at Tokyo 2020. In a nail-biting finale, the British pair watched on as Cao Yuan and Chen Aisen conducted their final dive and broke into wild celebrations when it became clear they had ended China's golden grip on the event, dating back to 2000. For Daley - now 27 - it marks a first gold medal at his fourth Olympic Games and he wept with joy on the podium, while Lee - four years his junior - can contemplate gold at the first time of asking. ""I still can't honestly believe what is happening,"" Daley told BBC Sport. ""That moment, being about to be announced as Olympic champions, I was gone. I was blubbering."" Tears on the podium for a dream come true - the story of Tom Daley The pair dived impeccably throughout, moving top of the leaderboard after four dives, before going on to expertly handle nerves and pressure in their final two routines. The British duo's total score of 471.81 left China's Cao and Chen with too much to do and when their tally of 470.58 appeared on the giant screen, Daley, Lee, their coaches and a score of team-mates could not hide their emotions. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Tom Daley and Matty Lee take diving gold - highlights Former Olympic silver medallist Leon Taylor told BBC viewers he was fighting back tears watching ""pictures that speak a thousand words"". On a morning where Britain'sAdam Peaty and Tom Pidcock won golds in swimming and mountain bike cross countryrespectively, BBC presenter Sam Quek spoke of feeling ""goose bumps"" as she watched Daley cry while the national anthem played. Lee - who moved to London to train with Daley in 2018 - deserves immense praise for his handling of the pressure-filled situation but a huge focus will now turn to his partner, who has become a household name across Britain ever since his debut at the 2008 Games, aged 14. His journey has been one filled with emotion, with an outpouring of sympathy on show following the death of his father in 2011. Daley would explain he hoped to one day be ""half the dad my dad was to me"" and his Olympic gold arrived in his first Games since become a father to son Robbie - who is named after his dad - in 2018.

Daley, who married husband Dustin Lance Black in 2017, has said becoming a father offered him ""a different headspace"" going into the Tokyo Games. And so it proved as he upgraded bronze medals in the individual and synchronised 10m events in 2012 and 2016 respectively for a landmark gold. ""To finally have this around my neck, I've been diving over 20 years,"" added Daley. ""Lots of people would have counted me out but I'm in the best shape and with the support with Matty, we've had that unstoppable mentality this year and that's the first time I've ever been able to think like that.

The 20 gold medals are seven behind Rio and eight behind London. The final day in Rio delivered Joseph Joyce's boxing silver medal. In London, Anthony Joshua won boxing gold on the last day amongst three medals. This year though, there are track cycling events on the last day with Jack Carlin and Laura Kenny as strongest potential medallists. In addition, Team GB have a guaranteed 64th medal from Lauren Price and Callum Hawkins amongst the best marathon runners. On Great Britain v ROC for fourth place: As expected, ROC won three gold medals to overtake Great Britain on the medal table on day 15. Both have 20 gold medals but ROC have won five more silvers. On Sunday, ROC have two opportunities to win golds - in rhythmic gymnastics and handball. Russia won both of these events at the last Olympic Games and are favourites to win both again. To finish fourth on the medal table, Great Britain probably need to win two gold medals on Sunday and hope that ROC do not win both of these events.

Executive to consider theatre and concert reopening,"The Northern Ireland Executive has agreed that theatres and concert venues can reopen from 18:00 on Tuesday. Ministers met earlier after delaying the decision, saying they wanted more information about risks. There have been other modest changes to Covid-19 restrictions, including an increase in the number of people who can meet indoors. Ten people from three households will also be allowed to meet inside a home. NI theatre and concert hall opening decision delay 'We've lost count of the performances postponed' What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease? As part of the move to allow theatres and concert venues to reopen, the executive has agreed live music will be permitted for rehearsals and performances with no restriction to background ambient levels of volume. Audience members must purchase tickets in advance, must have allocated seating and social distancing of 1m (3ft) will be required. Ãine McCarron, marketing officer at the Playhouse in Londonderry, said she was delighted by the news. ""It's music to my ears, I just can't believe it that we have finally been given the go ahead,"" Ms McCarron told BBC News NI. She said it was now important to ""build confidence among audience members who come through our doors"". ""We can very easily sit people 1m apart under our seating place and we can contract trace because we operate through a booking system already,"" she said. The Lyric Theatre will be operating at a third of overall capacity for Tuesday's production of Dracula Julie McKegney, head of customer services at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, said the industry had ""been waiting for this news since March 2020"". The theatre will be operating at a third of its overall capacity for Tuesday's production of Dracula. Speaking to BBC Evening Extra, Ms McKegney said there would be requirements for guests to follow upon entry. ""They'll come in to the box office here that's behind perspex screens, where they'll be directed over to a sign-in point with their QR code - that's mandatory,"" she said. ""All venues have to take details of a person's first name, surname, a method of contact and a time and date of when they were in attendance for track and trace purposes."" However, Belfast singer-songwriter Sir Van Morrison, who has beenan outspoken critic of the Northern Ireland Executive's coronavirus restrictions,described Monday's announcement as ""shambolic"". Sir Van Morrison had to cancel a series of gigs in Belfast last month due to Covid-19 restrictions ""The announcement has come so late in the day that it's a kick in the teeth,"" Sir Van said. ""Cancelled concerts that were planned for this week could have gone ahead. ""Regrettably like many other sectors, there's been no advance warning, no plan or roadmap for the industry. ""Stormont have lost the confidence in the public and are clearly deaf to our industry when making decisions."" Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey welcomed the return of theatres and concerts. She said: ""I expect all venue promoters to have safety measures in place to ensure that staff and audiences are in a Covid safe environment. ""I believe that equality of access to the arts, be that through participation or as a member of the audience, is crucial and I look forward to attending a performance in the time ahead."" Ms Hargey said she will meet with the chairwoman of the Culture, Arts and Heritage Recovery Taskforce later in the week to discuss financial support for the sector. Ten people from three households will be allowed to meet inside a home, with children aged 12 and under not counting towards that total. Previously the rules permitted six people from two households to meet inside, with up to 10 people allowed if one household was bigger than six people. Ministers also agreed that people attending religious services will not have to wear face coverings during the service The Northern Ireland Executive also agreed that people attending religious services will not have to wear face coverings during the service. It will be guidance only to wear a covering. It will still be a legal requirement to masks when entering and exiting the building. Ministers will also strongly advise their use when singing or when moving around during services. This all amounts to another move towards life after lockdown - changes that will be very welcome in different parts of society. There will be relief in the arts sector - it means indoor plays, concerts and other performances can at last go ahead with restrictions. This is another step towards the life we all used to lead but in the background there is concern about the rising number of Covid cases. It is a day about change but there is still much caution in the air. Earlier on Monday other rules changed, including allowing 15 people from unlimited households to meet outdoors and close-contact services being allowed to operate without the need for pre-booked appointments. The executive will meet again on Thursday to consider other Covid-19 restrictions. It comes asanother 639 positive cases were reported by the Department of Health on Monday.
