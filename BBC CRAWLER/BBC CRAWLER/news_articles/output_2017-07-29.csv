Australia 'foils terror plot to bomb plane',"At least one of the raids took place in the Sydney suburb of Surry Hills Counter-terrorism police in Australia have stopped a suspected plot to bring down an aeroplane, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said. He was speaking after four people were arrested in raids across Sydney. Investigators said they had seized materials in the raids that could have been used to make an improvised explosive device. Mr Turnbull said the raids had been a ""major joint counter-terrorism operation"". He said extra security was in place at domestic and international airports. The raids took place in the Sydney suburbs of Surry Hills, Lakemba, Wiley Park and Punchbowl, Australian broadcaster ABC reported. Australia's national terror threat level remains at ""probable"". Police sealed off roads following the raids across Sydney Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said the four men arrested were allegedly linked to a Islamist-inspired plot. ""In recent days, law enforcement has become aware of information that suggested some people in Sydney were planning to commit a terrorist attack using an IED (improvised explosive device),"" he told a news conference. He said police did not yet have information on ""the specific attack, the location, date or time"", adding that he expected the investigation to be ""long and protracted"". ABC reported that a woman in the Surry Hills area, who said her son and husband had been arrested, denied that they had any links to terrorism.

Second emergency landing for Jet2 plane,"Oxygen masks were deployed for the second time in two weeks after what Jet2 described as a ""minor technical fault"" A Jet2 aircraft has made a second emergency landing in as many weeks after an apparent recurrence of a technical problem. A flight from Ibiza to Leeds was diverted to Barcelona on 16 July. On Friday, the same plane was diverted to Frankfurt after a similar incident, Jet2 confirmed. It said passenger safety had not been compromised. Passengers on both flights described how oxygen masks were released as the aircraft began to descend at speed. The aircraft - registration G-CELI - had taken off from Newcastle bound for Prague Friday's flight had taken off from Newcastle bound for Prague, but it was diverted to Frankfurt after what Jet2 described as a ""minor technical fault"" that led to oxygen masks being deployed. Philippa Bell, whose fiancÃ© Joe Monkhouse was on the flight, toldthe Chronicle,externalthe plane went into a swift descent after the pilot informed passengers of an ""emergency"". She said the oxygen masks came down and her fiancÃ© felt his ears popping as the plane headed for Frankfurt Airport. Describing the first flight from Ibiza, passenger Tom Miller told BBC Look North: ""You're going down and there is so much panic. It levelled out but it felt so close to the water."" In a statement relating Friday's flight a spokesperson for Jet2 said: ""Our flight crew followed procedure and made a controlled descent before landing safely. ""At all times the safety of our passengers is our number one priority... and at no point was the safety of passengers compromised."" Jet2 said the aircraft had been grounded while engineers carry out a ""thorough inspection"". Aviation historian and consultant Ken Cothliff said it was ""incredibly rare"" for a fault to recur on the same aircraft in such a short space of time. However, he said it was probably down to a simple electrical fault rather than an actual problem with the aircraft. He added that Jet2, along with other budget airlines, has to adhere to a very stringent maintenance programme.

A nearly 500m (1,640ft) bridge for hikers billed as the longest hanging pedestrian bridge in the world has opened near the Swiss town of Zermatt. The 494m bridge, named the EuropabrÃ¼cke (Europe Bridge), hangs up to 85m above the Grabengufer ravine. The Zermatt Tourist Board says it is the world's longest, although a 405m bridge in Reutte in Austria hangs 110m higher above the ground. It replaces a previous bridge that had been damaged by rock falls. The new bridge, whose cables weigh about eight tonnes, is equipped with a system to prevent it from swinging, the Zermatt Tourist Board said.

Comedian under fire over race video,"Chris Lilley apologised for the timing of the video, but not its content A leading Australian comedian has apologised after a video of him posing in blackface was posted on his Instagram account. Social media users had criticised Chris Lilley, the star of TV show Summer Heights High. In the video, taken from a 2009 show, Lilley poses as a black rapper and sings a song called Squashed N**ga. It was posted days after the end of a court case focusing on an indigenous boy who was run over and killed. Lilley did not apologise for the content of the video or for appearing in blackface. The character, a rapper named S Mouse, is from his mockumentary show Angry Boys, which has aired in the UK on BBC Three. Instead, he apologised for the timing of the post, saying on Twitter that it was ""not connected in any way to current news stories"". Allow Twitter content?

Protests after the Elijah Doughty verdict have taken place in Melbourne and other Australian cities The video was posted days after a controversial verdict in the case of Elijah Doughty, a 14-year-old from Kalgoorlie in Western Australia who died after being run over last August. The clip began with Lilley in blackface sprawled across the ground, apparently having been struck. Why do Australians keep wearing blackface? The lesson behind an Australia blackface tutorial In the Doughty case, a 56-year-old man, whose name has not been revealed, admitted to a jury in Perth to chasing a person riding a motorbike he thought had been stolen from his house. He said he then struck the motorbike with his four-wheel-drive vehicle. Doughty suffered a number of injuries in the collision and died instantly. The man was found not guilty of manslaughter, but guilty of the lesser charge of dangerous driving causing death. He was sentenced to three years in prison by the jury. The verdict led to an angry reaction in court, and has spawned protests demanding equality across Australia. On Friday night, hundreds of demonstrators, demanding Justice for Elijah, shut down a large part of Melbourne. The blackface ad shocking Malaysia Allow Twitter content?

Rashan Charles family calls for peace,"This video can not be played Stafford Scott, on behalf of the family of Rashan Charles: ""Burning down homes will not give justice"" The family of a black man who died after being apprehended by police has appealed for peace after violent protests in the wake of his death. Rashan Charles, 20, was wrestled to the ground in Dalston, east London, on 22 July, and died about an hour later. On Friday, clashes broke out in Hackney as protesters blocked part of Kingsland Road and set mattresses alight. A spokesman for Mr Charles's family said they understood the anger but called for ""dignified"" protest. ""Burning down homes will not give justice,"" he said. Mr Charles was pursued by officers and became ill after trying to swallow an object, the Met has said. He died soon after in hospital. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating. This video can not be played The BBC's Alex Collins: ""Windows have been smashed open"" Police warned that anyone using Mr Charles's death ""as an excuse to commit crime"" would be ""dealt with robustly"". Appealing for calm, family spokesman Stafford Scott said: ""We understand your frustration, we understand your anger - don't feel that the family doesn't feel the anger and the frustration too. ""But what the family knows is taking it to the streets doesn't give you justice. ""Burning down your own homes, burning down your neighbourhood is not going to give you justice."" Tributes have been left in memory of Rashan Charles Mr Scott, who runs race advocacy group Tottenham Rights, said black people had historically found it difficult ""to win the hearts and minds of people"". ""We get no empathy, we get no sympathy. But this case is different - for once we've got the evidence. ""For once we're not relying on the IPCC or the police to gather the evidence. The world has seen it and will feel it if we don't get justice."" He added the family needed to ""fight this properly"" and had sought the best legal support. Mr Scott said the family asked the community ""to support them in their struggle, to be dignified when they expect us to be wild"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott is the family's local MP Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott told the protest she supported Mr Charles's parents and would not rest until questions were answered. In an earlier statement, the shadow home secretary said: ""The anger and upset at the death of Rashan Charles is understandable. ""But Rashan's family have explicitly spoken out against hostile actions. We must respect their wishes and any protests must be peaceful."" The anger of the protesters is clear. Many chanted ""Justice for Rashan"", clutching pictures of him along with their placards. Some confronted the police officers there to keep an eye on the demonstration, demanding answers. There were none forthcoming. That's because the investigation is now in the hands of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It will be their job to determine exactly what happened. Some campaigners, though, say there are too many of these investigations, too many lives being lost. They feel that their voices are too often not heard. There was much talk of the CCTV footage that captured the moment Rashan Charles was restrained. That has been pored over frame by frame, with many different interpretations of what happened, and many questions raised by it. Despite the anger, the vigil passed off peacefully, but the campaigners say they will not be silenced. They left though with the words of the family ringing in their ears: ""We want peace on the streets."" Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest following the death of Mr Charles On Friday evening, demonstrators blocked part of Kingsland Road. At one point protesters, some wearing masks, jumped on to a lorry and clung to the wing mirrors as it drove through the barricade. Scores of missiles were later launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group. Police in Hackneytweeted,external: ""Officers have been subjected to abuse and violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently not what the family of Rashan Charles wanted."" The Met Police has since said that the violence that erupted on Friday night was ""separate"" from a peaceful protest that was held earlier in the day. Det Supt Claire Crawley said: ""Thankfully nobody was seriously injured, but there was inconvenience to local residents and road users and damage caused to vehicles, a cash machine and a number of windows. ""We will always support the right to lawful protest but behaviour such as that seen last night cannot be tolerated.""

Extra-sweet end-of-term gift for teacher,"Read on, there are more TREATS to come! At the end of term some teachers receive special gifts from their pupils, but one in particular was given an especially sweet present from one student. If actions speak louder than words, in this case, perhaps confectionery is louder still. The pupil had replaced sweets for some of the words in the message and stuck them on a large piece of cardboard. It reads (with sweet replacement in capital letters): 'To Mr Hathway. You are an EXTRA special teacher. 'I have loved all of TOPIC this year. Have you got the munchies yet? 'Thank you for turning me into a real SMARTIES this year. 'You have given my learning a real BOOST. It's the summer holidays now so TWIRL with excitement and take TIME OUT to relax. 'You should have a nice PICNIC but watch out for the LION. Or you could even go on a AERO plane to a TURKISH DELIGHT and just FLAKE out on the beach. What a treat to 'flake out' on a beach 'I'll miss you lots like JELLY TOTS. Your one in a MILLION.' Rob Hathway, who has been teaching Year 6 pupils at Watermore Primary School in Frampton Cotterell, Bristol, told the BBC he was sad to see his pupils leave but this present will be a treasured reminder of them. ""I was so grateful for teaching such a lovely class. ""I was very grateful for having such a nice class,"" said Rob Hathway ""They've been like an extended family. On the last Thursday of term I received chocolates, cards and wine from my pupils, but when this one was given to me, I was so impressed by how much thought had gone into it. Mr Hathway will be missed lots, like Jelly Tots ""There have been some nice characters in class and some extremely helpful children. We had a special bond. I was a bit sad to seem them off but I was just glad that they have done so well and delighted to leave them in a position where they are ready for the next step at comprehensive school. This creation was high up in the list of unusual presents Mr Hathway has been given previously: ""Aside from usual gifts, I was once given a crate of wine when I was teaching in Spain. It turned out that the pupil's father owned a bodega!"" When asked whether he would eat all the chocolate bars, Mr Hathway said he eats chocolate from time to time, but as there is quite a lot he will share it with his family. Sweet!

Universities face Â£17.5bn pensions gap,"Universities face a new blow to their finances after the main pension fund deficit soared to Â£17.5bn. The Universities Superannuation Scheme now has the largest pensions deficit of any UK pension fund after it increased by Â£9bn last year. One expert said student fees may have to rise or be diverted from teaching. But a USS spokesperson said the pensions were ""secure, backed by a solid investment portfolio and the strength of sponsoring employers."" The USS funds pensions for academics who are mostly based in the pre-1992 universities, and has more than 390,000 members. To ensure the fund remains solvent, the USS will have to submit a plan to the pensions regulator to reduce the size of the deficit, which wasfirst reported in The Financial Times,external. That could mean cutting the value of future pay-outs, increasing staff contributions or raising employer contributions, putting pressure on university budgets. John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant, said: ""It seems inconceivable to me that student fees will not have to be diverted into plugging the pension deficit. ""That means either they go up or there is a smaller amount of money that can be dedicated to teaching and research. And obviously the student fees that are paid are for teaching and research, not to pay for the folly of USS betting on equities over the last few years."" The pensions deficit has grown rapidly since 2014, when benefits were reduced for new entrants to plug a Â£5,3bn deficit. John Ralfe, independent pensions consultant, says tuition fees could be used to plug the pensions gap Mr Ralfe said poor management of the fund was to blame. ""I think the root cause of this is the USS trustees going down to the casino and betting the money that they had been given by universities, betting it on [the stock market],"" he said. Lord Adonis, who helped increase university tuition fees to Â£3,000 as head of the Number 10 policy unit under Tony Blair, agreed there were ""big questions"" over the schemes management and it was time for vice chancellors to ""get their acts together"". However, he said there was ""no reason"" for students to fear another rise in tuition fees to cover the costs. A spokesperson for the USS said investments had outperformed their five-year target by more than Â£1bn, but the deficit was caused by liabilities growing even more quickly. ""USS pensions are secure, backed by a solid investment portfolio and the strength of sponsoring employers,"" the spokesperson said. The USS said that it was backed by universities which had net assets of more than Â£50bn. University lecturers balloted for strikes in 2011 and 2014, when earlier changes were made to pensions. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: ""Recent years have not been good ones for members of USS as twice they have seen the value of their pensions reduced and been asked to pay more for the privilege.""

West Highlands worst for broadband,"The parliamentary constituency that covers Skye was the worst in the UK for broadband The parliamentary constituency of Ross, Skye and Lochaber is the worst area in the UK for broadband, new figures show. A total of 65.6% of connections in the rural constituency were below the UK government's proposed minimum standard of 10 megabits per second (Mb/s). Scotland had eight of the 20 worst performing areas, according to analysis by the British Infrastructure Group of MPs. It was closely followed by Wales with seven. MPs' analysis of download speed data recorded by Ofcom in 2016 found Scotland had the four worst performing parliamentary constituencies in the UK. More than 60% of connections in three other Scottish constituencies - Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Argyll and Bute and Orkney and Shetland - failed to reach download speeds of 10 Mb/s. Kingston upon Hull East was the worst constituency in England for download speeds, with 56.8% of connections failing to hit the government's proposed universal service obligation. A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ""We are committed to delivering 100% superfast broadband access across Scotland by 2021. ""This is the most ambitious commitment in the UK - focusing on delivery of speeds over 30mbps - whilst there is still no clarity from the UK government on how they intend to implement the proposed Universal Service Obligation for broadband - which will deliver just 10mbps. ""Alongside our partners, we have invested over Â£410m in the Digital Scotland Superfast Broadband programme and are on track to deliver fibre broadband access to at least 95% of premises across Scotland by end 2017, and that thanks to the programme around 780,000 premises have been connected to fibre.""

Hamburg attacker 'was known Islamist',"Police said the suspected knife attacker was cornered and overpowered by members of the public The man who killed one person and injured six in a supermarket knife attack in Hamburg was a ""known Islamist"", officials say. ""He was known as an Islamist but not a jihadist,"" Hamburg's Interior Minister Andy Grote said, noting the suspect also had ""psychological"" issues. The man, a failed asylum seeker born in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), attacked customers at random on Friday. Police said he acted alone and he was overpowered by passers-by. The 26-year-old man, identified as Ahmad A, is a Palestinian from the UAE who is registered on an Islamist database, Mr Grote said on Saturday. The attacker, who arrived in Germany in 2015 but could not be deported because he had no identification papers, was also suffering from mental health problems, officials said. Police have carried out a search of the shelter in Hamburg where the man was living but said there was no evidence that he had accomplices or was part of a terror organisation. It is not yet clear what the suspect's motivations were. Forensic investigators search for evidence at the supermarket where the attack took place on Friday The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain. Police said the man entered the supermarket and removed a kitchen knife, measuring around 20 cm (8 in) long, from the shelves. ""He ripped off the packaging and then suddenly brutally attacked the 50-year-old man who later died,"" police spokeswoman Kathrin Hennings said. He later wounded two other men in the supermarket before fleeing the scene. A memorial arranged as a sign of peace has been placed at the location of the deadly attack Police praised the courage of the three men who followed the attacker after video footage emerged of passers-by using chairs as shields to corner the suspect. Eyewitnesses said that members of the public shouted at the man in Arabic to drop the knife. A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect. German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered her ""deepest sympathies"" to the relatives of the murdered victim and praised the courage of the public and the authorities. ""I thank the police for their effort and all those who stood up against the attacker with civil courage and bravery,"" Mrs Merkel said, adding that the incident ""must and will be fully investigated"". Germany has suffered a series of attacks in recent months. Security was heightened after a manploughed a lorry into a busy Christmas marketin the heart of Berlin in December 2016. In July 2016, a German teenager of Iranian heritage shot dead nine people in Munich before shooting himself dead. The same month, a teenage Afghan refugeearmed with an axe and a knifeinjured four people on a train in the southern German city of Wuerzburg before being shot dead by police.

He was speaking after four people were arrested in raids across Sydney. Investigators said they had seized materials in the raids that could have been used to make an improvised explosive device.

The raids took place in the Sydney suburbs of Surry Hills, Lakemba, Wiley Park and Punchbowl, Australian broadcaster ABC reported. Australia's national terror threat level remains at ""probable"". Police sealed off roads following the raids across Sydney Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said the four men arrested were allegedly linked to a Islamist-inspired plot. ""In recent days, law enforcement has become aware of information that suggested some people in Sydney were planning to commit a terrorist attack using an IED (improvised explosive device),"" he told a news conference. He said police did not yet have information on ""the specific attack, the location, date or time"", adding that he expected the investigation to be ""long and protracted"".

Rashan Charles death: Family urge peace,"This video can not be played Stafford Scott, on behalf of the family of Rashan Charles: ""Burning down homes will not give justice"" The family of a black man who died after being apprehended by police has appealed for peace after violent protests in the wake of his death. Rashan Charles, 20, was wrestled to the ground in Dalston, east London, on 22 July, and died about an hour later. On Friday, clashes broke out in Hackney as protesters blocked part of Kingsland Road and set mattresses alight. A spokesman for Mr Charles's family said they understood the anger but called for ""dignified"" protest. ""Burning down homes will not give justice,"" he said. Mr Charles was pursued by officers and became ill after trying to swallow an object, the Met has said. He died soon after in hospital. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating. This video can not be played The BBC's Alex Collins: ""Windows have been smashed open"" Police warned that anyone using Mr Charles's death ""as an excuse to commit crime"" would be ""dealt with robustly"". Appealing for calm, family spokesman Stafford Scott said: ""We understand your frustration, we understand your anger - don't feel that the family doesn't feel the anger and the frustration too. ""But what the family knows is taking it to the streets doesn't give you justice. ""Burning down your own homes, burning down your neighbourhood is not going to give you justice."" Tributes have been left in memory of Rashan Charles Mr Scott, who runs race advocacy group Tottenham Rights, said black people had historically found it difficult ""to win the hearts and minds of people"". ""We get no empathy, we get no sympathy. But this case is different - for once we've got the evidence. ""For once we're not relying on the IPCC or the police to gather the evidence. The world has seen it and will feel it if we don't get justice."" He added the family needed to ""fight this properly"" and had sought the best legal support. Mr Scott said the family asked the community ""to support them in their struggle, to be dignified when they expect us to be wild"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott is the family's local MP Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott told the protest she supported Mr Charles's parents and would not rest until questions were answered. In an earlier statement, the shadow home secretary said: ""The anger and upset at the death of Rashan Charles is understandable. ""But Rashan's family have explicitly spoken out against hostile actions. We must respect their wishes and any protests must be peaceful."" The anger of the protesters is clear. Many chanted ""Justice for Rashan"", clutching pictures of him along with their placards. Some confronted the police officers there to keep an eye on the demonstration, demanding answers. There were none forthcoming. That's because the investigation is now in the hands of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It will be their job to determine exactly what happened. Some campaigners, though, say there are too many of these investigations, too many lives being lost. They feel that their voices are too often not heard. There was much talk of the CCTV footage that captured the moment Rashan Charles was restrained. That has been pored over frame by frame, with many different interpretations of what happened, and many questions raised by it. Despite the anger, the vigil passed off peacefully, but the campaigners say they will not be silenced. They left though with the words of the family ringing in their ears: ""We want peace on the streets."" Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest following the death of Mr Charles On Friday evening, demonstrators blocked part of Kingsland Road. At one point protesters, some wearing masks, jumped on to a lorry and clung to the wing mirrors as it drove through the barricade. Scores of missiles were later launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group. Police in Hackneytweeted,external: ""Officers have been subjected to abuse and violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently not what the family of Rashan Charles wanted."" The Met Police has since said that the violence that erupted on Friday night was ""separate"" from a peaceful protest that was held earlier in the day. Det Supt Claire Crawley said: ""Thankfully nobody was seriously injured, but there was inconvenience to local residents and road users and damage caused to vehicles, a cash machine and a number of windows. ""We will always support the right to lawful protest but behaviour such as that seen last night cannot be tolerated.""

Elon Musk rolls out cheapest Tesla yet,"The first Tesla Model 3 cars off the production line are now with their new owners Electric car maker Tesla has rolled out its new Model 3 vehicle - the company's cheapest car to date. The first 30 customers - most of them employees of the company - received their cars on Friday. Chief executive Elon Musk said the Model 3 was the ""best car for its cost, either electric or gasoline"". Prices start at $35,000 (Â£26,650), which the firm hopes will bring mass market interest. The price is still higher than that of rival electric car the Nissan Leaf, which starts at $30,680, or the hybrid Chevrolet Volt, which goes for $34,095. Volvo goes electric across the board Past Tesla models, the ""S"" and ""X"", had a starting price of $80,000, putting them beyond the means of many. The company aims to produce 5,000 units of the Model 3 a week in 2017, and 10,000 a week by 2018. Buyers ordering now are being told to expect delivery late next year. More than half a million customers have already placed deposits. If Tesla can successfully produce and sell that many cars a year, it will outperform BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus in the US. Tesla CEO Elon Musk wants to speed the transition to renewable energy Showman Mr Musk was on buoyant form at a delivery ceremony at the firm's plant in Fremont, California, driving on to an outdoor stage in a Model 3. Can Tesla live up to its value? Tesla to build world's largest lithium battery Tesla will unveil electric lorry in September ""For the future, the future being now, the cars will be increasingly autonomous,"" Mr Musk said. He added that every Tesla model had the hardware needed to drive itself. ""You will be able to watch a movie, talk to friends, go to sleep..."" The Model 3's electric battery will run for 354km (220 miles) before needing a recharge, Tesla says. Elon Musk introduces one of the first cars off the production line The more affordable Model 3 is a significant step for the firm, whose market value hit $49bn in April.

N Korea: 'All US within missile range',"This video can not be played North Korea missile ""seen from Japan"" North Korea has hailed as a success its latest test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), describing it as a ""stern warning"" for the US. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said the test proved that the entire US was within striking range, state media reported. However, experts say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets. The launch came three weeks after North Korea's first ICBM test. The Pentagon said the latest missile was launched at 23:41 (15:41 GMT) from an arms plant in Jagang province in the north of the country. North Korea said the ICBM flew for just over 47 minutes and reached an altitude of 3,724km (2,300 miles). It is unusual for North Korea to launch a missile at night - the significance is as yet unclear. This is the first missile fired from Jagang province, indicating a previously-unknown launch site is operational. The test was condemned by the US and North Korea's neighbours. US President Donald Trump called it ""only the latest reckless and dangerous action by the North Korean regime"". How the US might defend itself Are Alaskans scared of Kim Jong-un? South Korea said it was concerned the North may have made ""a significant advancement in technology"", adding that the missile test was ""unique in its time and place of launch"". Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the threat to his country's security was ""grave and real"". China also condemned the missile test but urged ""all parties concerned"" to exercise restraint ""and avoid intensifying tensions"". The US and South Korea conducted a joint exercise using surface-to-surface missiles in response to the test Pyongyang said the launch had ""successfully tested re-entry capabilities"" of the missile. Kim Jong-un ""said proudly the test also confirmed all the US mainland is within our striking range,"" the Korean Central News Agency said. The statement said that the rocket was a Hwasong-14, the same model North Korea tested on 3 July. Is ICBM test a game-changer? What the outside world can do The North has repeatedly tested missiles in breach of UN resolutions. ICBMs can reach altitudes well outside the earth's atmosphere. Using sharp trajectories with high altitudes allows North Korea to avoid firing over neighbouring countries. Despite the ongoing tests, experts believe the North does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target. Others, however, believe that at the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US. Melissa Hanham, Senior Research Associate in the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies North Korea's latest ICBM test went farther and higher than its previous 3 July test, meaning that it may be able to strike even deeper into the heartland of the United States than initially assessed. Within minutes of the launch, South Korean, Japanese and US officials reported data about the location, range, apogee, and flight time of the missile. While full analysis has not been finalised yet, several points stand out. First, the data available indicates that the missile may have a range of approximately 10,400km. Since this missile is road-mobile, a launch from the north-eastern city of Rason would put New York City in range of the ICBM. Second, the US reported that North Korea launched the ICBM from Mupyong-ni, North Korea. This location was different from many press accounts leading up to the launch which predicted a Kusong launch. The missile launched at 23:11 local time, an unusual time for North Korea's tests as well. It is possible that North Korea is already experimenting with deploying the missile under the cover of night or setting up multiple launch sites to confuse observers. Reports on Friday said the missile had come down in the sea off northern Japan. In response, the US and South Korean military conducted a live-firing exercise using surface-to-surface missiles, a US defence official said. Does N Korea have the bomb? The missiles were fired into the ""territorial waters of South Korea along the east coast,"" a US military statement said. South Korean Defence Minister Song Young-moo said the country would prepare independent measures to curb the North Korea threat, speeding up the deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) provided by the US. China is opposed to the deployment of Thaad, saying it affects the regional security balance. What can the outside world do about N Korea? Can the US defend itself against North Korea?

Criminals 'using children as money mules',"Children are being targeted by criminals to act as money mules, police have warned. The scam involves transferring stolen money through children's bank accounts to hide it from the authorities. According toThe Times,external, the Met Police wrote to parents warning that pupils were being approached outside school gates and on social media. Det Ch Insp Gary Miles said the Met wanted to ""make parents aware so they can discuss this with their children"". In a statement, he added: ""Children are getting accounts at a younger and younger age - 13-year-olds now have access to money that they didn't have before."" According to fraud prevention service Cifas,  the number of so-called ""misuse of facility"" frauds involving people under 21 has almost doubled in the last year. It said there were 4,222 cases in the first half of 2017, compared to 2,143 in the same period last year. Cifas' assistant director Sandra Peaston told the BBC: ""Some of them are as young as 13 or 14, and essentially they're responding to adverts that they see on social media, on video sharing sites, which are offering money in exchange for moving money through their bank account.

Australia opposition vows republic vote,"PM Malcolm Turnbull says a vote should not be held during the Queen's reign Australia's Labor opposition has vowed to hold a referendum on whether the country should formally become a republic if it wins the next election. Its leader, Bill Shorten, said the move ""does not change our respect to the Queen for her service, but we are not Elizabethan, we are Australians"". He was referring to PM Malcolm Turnbull's description of himself as a ""very strong Elizabethan"", before meeting the Queen this month. The last referendum was held in 1999. Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, with the Queen as head of state. Mr Shorten revealed the policy decision at the party's Queensland state conference in Townsville. The referendum would be held in the first term of a Labor government, he said. The Turnbull government returned to power in the 2016 federal election but with a razor-thin majority. 'Australia can run its own show' Turnbull cautions on republic debate Barring dissolution, the next election must be held between August 2018 and May 2019 for half of state senators and before 2 November 2019 for the House of Representatives and for Senators from territories. Mr Shorten said: ""We will put a simple Yes or No question to the Australian people - do you support an Australian republic with an Australian head of state."" Bill Shorten wants a simple Yes or No question He said the country should avoid repeating the 1999 referendum, which offered two questions and set out a model for the republic that was rejected by voters by 54.87% to 45.13%. Mr Turnbull was the leader of the republican movement at that time but since coming to power, he has said that no change should occur until the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends. But Mr Shorten said that Australia should not wait: ""The British monarchy could hardly be described as an Australian patriot, or even a loyal citizen. They will never have to sign up to our so-called values."" Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said the issue was not a priority for most Australians.

Protest over man's death turns violent,"This video can not be played The BBC's Alex Collins: ""Windows have been smashed open"" Fireworks and bottles were hurled at riot police as a protest following the death of a black man turned violent. Rashan Charles, 20,died after being apprehended by policein Dalston, east London, on 22 July. Earlier, a peaceful protest took place at Stoke Newington police station which Scotland Yard said was separate. Angry clashes broke out on Friday evening after protesters blocked part of Kingsland Road and set mattresses alight. Some of the protestors carried Black Lives Matter placards. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating his death. Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest over the death of Rashan Charles Mr Charles's father, Esa, gave a statement outside Stoke Newington police station. He was joined by the father of Edir Da Costa, who it is claimedwas ""brutally beaten"" by Met officersin June. That death is also being investigated by the police watchdog. Police warned that anyone using Saturday's events ""as an excuse to commit crime"" would be ""dealt with robustly"". Bins, mattresses and debris were in flames At one point protesters, some wearing masks, jumped on to a lorry and clung to the wing mirrors as it drove through the barricade. Scores of missiles were later launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group. Police in Hackneytweeted,external: ""Officers have been subjected to abuse and violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently not what the family of Rashan Charles wanted."" Rashan Charles died after being apprehended by police in Dalston Videos on social media showed officers walking backwards as objects were thrown at them. Several wheelie bins were set alight and mattresses thrown on top of the burning pile. Shop windows were also smashed, littering the streets with glass, with those involved described by an eyewitness as ""very, very angry"". A lorry drove through a barricade in Kingsland Road with people clinging to it Police in Hackney said they were ""subjected to abuse and violence"" The crowd dispersed at about 23:40 BST, the Met said. A 17-year-old was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. He was taken to an east London police station where he remains in custody. The Met said a police officer injured his eye and a member of the public was knocked off his bike and assaulted as he tried to pass through the protest. Det Supt Claire Crawley, from Hackney Borough, said: ""The disorder of last night was separate from the peaceful protest at Stoke Newington Police Station that was held earlier that day."" She added: ""We will always support the right to lawful protest but behaviour such as that seen last night cannot be tolerated."" One man who was at the demonstration told the BBC the protesters were ""angry and confused"" because they were ""not being represented"". He suggested young people were ""living in fear"", adding they ""don't understand how to live, how to make money, how to work for what they want"", with some ""forced into"" situations such as selling drugs or carrying knives. Protesters also gathered outside Stoke Newington police station on Monday Shadow home secretary and Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott said: ""The anger and upset at the death of Rashan Charles is understandable. ""But Rashan's family have explicitly spoken out against hostile actions. We must respect their wishes and any protests must be peaceful."" Philip Glanville, the mayor of Hackney, said the community intended to hold peaceful protests, but some people from outside the borough wanted to ""engage in vandalism and unrest"". ""What we've tried to do all week is separate the two groups, to recognise the rawness of the anger out in the community,"" he said. Mr Glanville said he did not think there was a problem between the police and the community, as a lot of work had been carried out in the area following the 2011 riots. Police officers were seen retreating as objects were thrown at them Riot police had fireworks and bottles thrown at them The IPCC said ""we understand the concerns raised following Rashan's death"". A statement added: ""We will independently examine the circumstances of this incident, we will follow the evidence, we will consider whether there is an indication there may have been misconduct or criminality, and we will seek to answer the questions that Rashan's family and the community of Hackney understandably have.""

"Tributes to killed time-trial cyclist, 91","Ray Dare had been attempting to set a new national record for a 91-year-old A 91-year-old cyclist killed on a dual carriageway while trying to set a new record ""came into his own as he grew older"", his club said. Ray Dare died in a crash involving a van on the A41 Aston Clinton bypass, near Aylesbury, on 19 July. The Kingston Phoenix Road Club said at the time he was attempting to ride 10 miles in under 29 minutes and 43 seconds and it had been ""going well"". Thames Valley Police has appealed for witnesses. No arrests have been made. The Surrey-based club, where Mr Dare had been a member for 65 years, said it was ""devastated"" by his death. A spokesman said he was a good rider in his younger years but ""came into his own as he grew older, barely slowing down as his contemporaries did"". His specialist event was time trialling, where a cyclist rides alone between two time keepers against the watch. Ray Dare ""came into his own as he grew older"", his club said Mr Dare was taken to the Buckinghamshire time trial event by club mate John Beer, and they drove round the course before the trial to familiarise themselves with it. When he died, he was trying to break the 2003 record held by Jack Brownhill of the Abbotsford Park Road Club. A few weeks ago he recorded a time of 29:59, and ""knew that he could meet the challenge"", the club said. ""Ray was excited for the event and knew that he could break the record. ""By all accounts he was going well and would have achieved his goal. Sadly his ride only lasted eight of the ten miles before tragedy struck."" Mr Dare held eight national Veterans Time Trials Association (VTTA) records including at the age of 88, riding 50 miles in 2:52:01 and 10 miles in 27:57. National secretary Rachael Elliott said that while the VTTA has a number of members aged over 90, she believed Mr Dare had been the oldest person actively racing in the UK Time Trials when he died.

Has the Charlie Gard case changed everything?,"Few British legal cases in recent years have proved as controversial or emotionally charged as that over the fate of Charlie Gard,the 11-month-old baby who died on Fridayafter a lengthy battle over his medical treatment. During the many hours of legal debate in court, Katie Gollop QC, who led Great Ormond Street's legal team, described the case as ""sad"", but not ""exceptional"". She was wrong. The case, which saw Charlie's parents take on the world-renowned hospital in the courts, was one of those rare cases that transcend the cut-and-thrust of legal argument. Its impact reverberated around the country and the rest of the world, prompting protests on the streets, a mass outpouring of emotion on social media, the vilification of one of the most famous hospitals in the world andthe intervention of both the Vatican and US president. In doing so, it made us question the role of the parent, the motives of doctors and - as always in this digital age - wonder about the ever-growing influence of the internet. How did it come to this? And what does it tell us about society? Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) is perhaps the most respected and well-known children's hospital in the world. It has been synonymous with excellence ever since it was founded in the 1850s with patients from all over the world now being sent there for pioneering treatment. And yet in the course of this case it found itself under attack with some staff reporting they had been victims of ""vile"" abuse and threats (Charlie's parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, also reported that they had been the target of abuse on a daily basis.) One of the problems the hospital faced, particularly as the case developed and the parents received more media attention, was that it simply could not win. While Charlie's parents gave television and newspaper interviews and made pleas on social media, GOSH was left to rely on media statements and court papers to explain its position. The hospital said it was not possible to give Charlie the non-invasive treatment - a powder that could be added to his food - that his parents felt could help him in his battle with mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. Rational, scientific logic was never going to win hearts and minds against the raw emotion of parents trying to do everything they could for the severely ill baby. Should more have been done by the world of medicine? As the case developed, GOSH started publishing more details about the case and its position. Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie But Prof Uta Frith, an expert in cognitive development at University College London, wonders if there is a lesson here, arguing science cannot be entirely stripped of its emotional context. ""We can never be 100% certain about our facts and theories. Emotion, which is utterly certain, wins in comparison. ""However, scientific reasoning cannot be completely stripped of emotion. Perhaps this is an asset we need to cultivate more. Reasoned evidence needs champions to engage the hearts of people."" The story of Charlie Gard Fergus Walsh: Why everyone had an opinion on Charlie Gard Reality Check: Why don't Charlie Gard's parents have the final say But the case - and its importance - also comes down to a dilemma that becomes more acute as medicine develops. At what point is it appropriate not to treat patients and allow them to die? These are discussions that go on every day in hospitals - and the overwhelming majority are resolved without major dispute. Patients coming to the end of life - both the elderly and the young - are now routinely encouraged to discuss advanced care plans setting out how much they want doctors to do when they get closer to death. These plans cover everything from when it is appropriate to resuscitate to when treatment should be withdrawn and a patient moved on to palliative care to help them die with dignity. Of course in Charlie's case, because he was a baby, this was simply not possible. Instead, he was kept alive on a ventilator while his parents and doctors took to the courts. The medical profession - bound by the basic tenet of medicine ""do no harm"" - felt it was in his best interests to let him die with dignity rather than have an experimental treatment that they believed would do him no good. In court they argued he had ""no quality of life and no real prospect of any quality of life"". But there is also an ethical dimension to this. Are doctors the right people to determine what constitutes ""quality of life""? Do we put too much emphasis on their opinion? 3 March:Parents of Charlie Gard appear before High Court to challenge decision by Great Ormond Street to turn off their seven-month-old son's life support 11 April:11 Mr Justice Francis delivers ruling that doctors can end treatment of Charlie 3 May:3 Charlie's parents take their case to Court of Appeal 8 June:8 Appeal is dismissed 27 June:27 European Court of Human Rights reject plea to intervene in case 10 July:10 Case returns to High Court to examine ""new"" evidence in case 24 July:24 Charlie's parents announce they are ending their legal fight over treatment 27 July:Mr Justice Francis rules that Charlie should be moved to a hospice and his treatment ended shortly afterwards It is a point made by Prof Julian Savulescu, an expert in ethics at Oxford University. He believes Charlie's parents should have been allowed to take him to the US earlier in the year - even with the low odds that the treatment would have worked - given that they had raised Â£1.3m themselves. He says GOSH - and the doctors the hospital consulted - made a ""value judgement"" that was reasonable to disagree with. ""The state should not have to pay for expensive experimental treatment with low prospect of success, but Charlie's parents have raised the funds,"" he says. ""Charlie should have been allowed to go straight away - and saved hundreds of thousands of pounds of British taxpayer funds which have been used to provide months of intensive care. ""This is not a religious or right-to-life argument or an argument based on compassion. It's a secular ethical argument about the extreme complexity of judging someone's life to be not worth living."" But that brings us on to one of the key arguments put forward by Charlie's parents during the hours of legal discussion - the rights of parents to make decisions for their children. They believed it should have been up to them to decide what was best for their son. But this is not what the law says. The 1989 Children's Act, which was introduced following a child abuse scandal in Cleveland, makes it clear that where a child is at risk of harm the state can and should intervene. Subsequent legislation has followed and a framework has been created whereby the state has been emboldened to challenge the view of parents where they believe children's best interests are not being served. This sees doctors oppose the decision of parents who are Jehovah's Witnesses and refuse blood transfusions for their children. The law is also used by councils to take children they believe are at risk into care. Of course, proving someone is at risk or can be helped by medical treatment is much easier to do than proving a treatment is no longer in the best interests of a child when the parents disagree. But what was often overlooked in the Charlie Gard case was that it wasn't just the doctors against the parents. Charlie also had an independent guardian who agreed with the hospital. Chris Gard and Connie Yates announce the end of their legal fight for treatment Daniel Sokol, a medical ethicist and barrister, says the case has shone a light on this issue. ""It reminds us that the rights of parents over their children are not absolute. They are limited by what is in the best interests of the child."" But he says it is interesting that in the US, which played such a key role through the intervention of doctors who said they would be prepared to treat Charlie, and because of President Donald Trump's offer of help, the rights of parents to decide what is best are much more enshrined. ""The wishes of parents and 'surrogates' generally carry more weight, which is why many US commentators have expressed surprise at the hospital's handling of this case,"" he says. ""For them, the doctors should do what the parents want."" It's fair to say this case simply would not have played out the way it did in the pre-internet age. It was with the help of social media and crowd funding that Charlie's parents were able to raise the funds for him to be treated in the US in the first place. And it was via the internet that the parents were able to make a video appeal - just at the moment that it looked like Great Ormond Street would remove life support - to be given longer to say goodbye. A week later the Vatican and Donald Trump intervened and the case ended up back in court. This time the issue was whether new evidence about the treatment warranted a re-think of the ruling that he should be allowed to die. Mr Sokol says the influence of the internet was ""remarkable"". ""Through the internet, in particular social media, the family obtained an enormous following, support from influential persons and vast amounts of funding. ""The family can find doctors, on the other side of the world, who will support their case."" Indeed, if there is to be one overriding legacy of the Charlie Gard case it is likely to be related to this. There is already a long-term trend towards greater scepticism of medical opinion. Coupled to the power of the internet this could create an environment whereby doctors find their decisions increasingly challenged.

10 ways in which gay rights have changed,"It's 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexual sex in England and Wales. How did the law change society? The proportion of the British public who say they approve of same-sex partnerships has soared over the past 30 years. Since 1983 the British Social Attitudes survey has asked people whether they think sexual relationships between two adults of the same sex are ""always wrong, mostly wrong, sometimes wrong, rarely wrong or not wrong at all"". The group of people answering that they thought same-sex partnerships were ""not wrong at all"" has almost quadrupled from 17% when the survey started in 1983, to 64% in 2016. Approval fell in the 1980s when the Aids crisis and the introduction of section 28 - a law prohibiting the promotion or teaching of homosexuality in schools - could have swayed public opinion according to NatCen, the think tank which runs the survey. But a steady and rapid rise from the early 1990s reflects a wider trend of social liberalisation, something also seen in changing attitudes to pre-marital sex. Gay and persecuted - one man's story I was sent for gay cure Aversion therapy: Society told me I was dirty Approval of pre-marital sex grew initially among the young - as they got older they retained that belief, and soon both old and young were more liberal on the issue. For same-sex relationships the shift in attitude has been quicker - not only did young people with liberal views get older, but older people changed their minds, too. This might in part be because changes in the law, such as the legalisation of civil partnerships and then gay marriage, have a powerful influence on people's views, a NatCen spokesman suggests. While the 1967 act was a milestone in equality, it was far from the end of the story - and it chiefly benefited men who had sex with men. There have been a number of other key dates on the journey towards sexual and gender equality, not just for gay men but for the rest of the LGBT community. For example, gay sex remained illegal in Scotland and Northern Ireland until 1982 while transgender people weren't protected in equality legislation until 2010. 50 years of legislation 1967- Sex between two men over 21 and ""in private"" is decriminalised 1980- Decriminalisation in Scotland 1982- Decriminalisation in Northern Ireland 1994- The age of consent for two male partners is lowered to 18 2000- The ban on gay and bisexual people serving in the armed forces is lifted; the age of consent is equalised for same- and opposite-sex partners at 16 2002- Same-sex couples are given equal rights when it comes to adoption 2003- Gross indecency is removed as an offence 2004- A law allowing civil partnerships is passed 2007- Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is banned 2010- Gender reassignment is added as a protected characteristic in equality legislation 2014- Gay marriage becomes legal in England, Wales and Scotland In 1967, homosexuality was only partially decriminalised. Those keen to criminalise any public displays of consensual homosexual activity still had tools to do so through the offence of ""gross indecency"", which had a broad interpretation. Prosecutions for relationships between two consenting men over the age of 16 continued until 2000 when the age of consent was equalised. In the years following the 1967 law change, even public displays of affection could be criminalised as ""procuring"" or ""soliciting"". Gross indecency covered activities ranging fromhaving sex in public, to sexual activity in private involving more than two men. Hotels were counted as public and so men could be prosecuted for meeting there while others were convicted as recently as 1998 for having group sex in private. After the 1967 Act, activities that had not been decriminalised were prosecuted far more strictly than before, according to human-rights barrister Alex Bailin QC. This led to a steep rise in offences of gross indecency. After a decline there was another spike in the 1980s amid a moral panic over the Aids epidemic. Sexual activity in a public toilet remains a specific offence to this day - for opposite-sex couples as well.  Prosecutions were far more common until the 1990s but have tailed off since, partly because of social attitudes to gay relationships, says Kate Goold, a solicitor at Bindmans. Given this legacy of criminalisation, the government introduced a scheme in October 2012 allowing those prosecuted under defunct gay-sex-related laws, to have their convictions removed from police and court records. The Home Office estimates that there were about 50,000 such offences recorded on the system from the 1950s until 2000. But of these 50,000, only an estimated 16,000 are for people who are still living and so able to apply. Not all of the 16,000 offences are eligible to be ""disregarded"". They include some where the activity was non-consensual, with a person under 16 years of age, or involving other activity which would still be a crime today - for example having sex in a public toilet. Between October 2012 and April 2016, only 242 people applied for a disregard and only 83 were granted, according to a written answer in parliament. The law changed further in 2016. Family members can now apply for posthumous pardons. The mathematician Alan Turing was posthumously pardoned for his gross indecency conviction A steep rise in homophobic hate crimes has been recorded over the past five years, but this is thought to be in large part down to an increase in people reporting incidents rather than a genuine rise in crime. The National Police Chiefs Council's lead on homophobic crimes, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, says: ""Traditionally, homophobic hate crime has been significantly under-reported and we do not believe that current statistics accurately reflect actual levels of abuse. ""However, higher reporting rates indicate that the LGBT community feels increasingly confident to come forward and report incidents."" The Home Office's report on the latest figures says that ""these could be genuine increases in hate crimes or increases in the numbers of victims coming forward to report a hate crime"". Public opinion has shifted hugely on same-sex relationships over the past decade. It's striking that people aged 16-24 are more than five times more likely than those aged over 65 to identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual. The Office for National Statistics keeps records of people who identify themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual - 1.7% of the adult population (2% of men and 1.5% of women). This is likely to underestimate the real numbers as the survey doesn't capture sexual attraction or behaviour. In 2005 the government tried to estimate the size of the lesbian, gay and bisexual population and came up with a larger number - 5-7% of the population. People who identify as gay, lesbian and bisexual report lower levels of well-being than heterosexuals in the UK. The ONS looks at happiness, life satisfaction, and the extent to which people feel their life is worthwhile. For all three of those categories, gay, lesbian and bisexual people report much lower levels. Data is also collected on anxiety, which has the biggest sexuality gap. Gay and lesbian people report higher levels of anxiety than straight people, but bisexual people are even more likely to suffer from the condition. Young lesbian, gay and bisexual people are also more likely to suffer from suicidal thoughts than their straight friends, according to a2014 survey by LGBT support charity Metro. The results also suggested higher rates of self-harm. Civil partnerships were legalised in 2004 throughout the United Kingdom, with the first ceremonies taking place at the end of the following year. Nearly 140,000 people entered intocivil partnerships between 2005 and 2015, the last year for which figures are available. Across the UK, gay and lesbian couples were granted many of the same rights as married heterosexuals, albeit with a few differences around issues like private-sector pensions. It meant that couples could no longer be kept out of hospital rooms when their partner was sick, they would no longer lose their home or business because of tax laws, and they had parental rights over children. Same-sex marriage was legalised a decade later, with the first ceremonies taking place in England, Wales and Scotland in 2014. It is still banned in Northern Ireland. According to official estimates about 60,000 people were in same-sex marriages in 2016. England, Scotland and Wales were far from the first places to legalise same-sex marriage. The Netherlands changed the law first in 2001. Gay marriage is now legal in 22 countries worldwide, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA). That's just 11% of UN member states. Definitions can sometimes be tricky though - the UK is included despite Northern Ireland's ban. Brazil and Mexico are also on ILGA's list because ""through one legal route or another, it appears to be possible to marry in most jurisdictions"". Germany is not included - MPs gave their approval to same-sex marriage earlier this year but the law does not come into force until October. Countries where gay marriage is legal 2001Netherlands 2003Belgium 2005Canada, Spain 2006South Africa 2009Norway, Sweden 2010Iceland, Portugal, Argentina 2012Denmark 2013Uruguay, New Zealand, France, Brazil 2014UK (excluding Northern Ireland) 2015Luxembourg, Ireland, Mexico, USA 2016Colombia 2017Finland A further 28 countries guarantee some civil-partnership recognition according to ILGA. Britain is marking 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality but same-sex relations are still illegal across vast swathes of the world. There are 72 countries which explicitly outlaw homosexuality, according to ILGA, but there are several others with some form of legal restriction. For example, Russia is included even though same-sex relationships were formally legalised in 1993. This is because ""a variety of repressive legal provisions"" have come into force over the past decade, according to ILGA. In eight countries same-sex relationships sometimes carry the death penalty - Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, and parts of Iraq and Syria held by so-called Islamic State. The number of states that criminalise same-sex relations is decreasing annually, though, with Belize and the Seychelles repealing such laws last year.

Cancer debt: Is your bank listening?,"Tracy Jameson was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year Some cancer sufferers who phone the Macmillan support line want to talk about death, and the process of dying. But for 25 times as many patients, it's not their health they want to discuss. It's their finances. Macmillan's research shows that most cancer sufferers are nearly Â£7,000 a year worse off because of the disease. Many go overdrawn, or into debt. Some have even become homeless. Banks meanwhile are being accused of doing very little to help such patients in their hour of need. Insurers should do more to help cancer patients, says FCA But now Lloyds Banking Group has decided to act. This week it begin offering some practical financial help. Tracy Jameson was forced to give up her job as an assistant head teacher in Oxford, after she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year. After six months of sick leave, she went on to half pay. As a single mother, her finances were stretched to the limit, and she used up all her Â£2,500 overdraft. ""I was having to take unexpected transport; suddenly none of my clothes fitted. Everything was literally falling off me because I had lost so much weight,"" she told the BBC. Tracy Jameson appears in a television advert, promoting the new service On occasions, money matters took a back seat. ""I found that I used all of my braveness to face the cancer treatment. If I needed to buy cat food, I needed to buy cat food. If I needed to buy cordial, because that's what I felt like, then I bought it."" Lloyds already has what it calls its ""Moments of Truth"" team, which helps customers suffering from a bereavement or other personal issues. Members of the team have now been trained by Macmillan Cancer Support to deal with cancer patients as well. By the end of the year there will be 100 such staff, based in call centres in Newport, Leeds and Dunfermline. They have the power to refund charges and fees on current accounts, give budgetary help to customers, and organise repayment holidays on loans and mortgages. Those banking with Halifax or Bank of Scotland are also eligible. ""We can give them a two-month holiday break on loan payments; mortgage payments similarly,"" says Lee Jones, who runs the bank's team in South Wales. ""We can look at what works for the customer."" Customers of Halifax and Bank of Scotland can also access the service In Tracy's case they offered her a mortgage holiday, and refunded all banking charges for six months. They also used her in a television advertisement to promote the service. Tracy's view of banks has changed as a result: ""Banks are your financial partners; they are not your adversary."" Go into a branch and ask staff to contact the cancer support team Call the team directly on 0800 015 0016 between 9am and 5pm on weekdays Call Macmillan Support on 0808 808 0000 and ask them to refer you The move by Lloyds follows an example set by the much smaller Nationwide Building Society two years ago. Since then it has dealt with nearly 2,000 cancer patients or their carers. Many face extra expenses because of travelling to hospital, or having to give up work. Like Lloyds, it can refund charges, and offer payment holidays. ""With cancer we are often looking at short-term measures, to try and get people through a particular period of treatment,"" says Mandy Griffin, director of membership at Nationwide. ""It could be they're having chemotherapy; it could be they are unable to work for a period; so a payment holiday is ideal in those circumstances."" Make a list of income and outgoings to help you budget (see calculator at end of article) If working, ask your employer when your sick pay will end If you are not well enough you can get a friend or partner to call the bank for you - as account holder you will have to authorise this with your bank first Check your benefits entitlement (see links at end of article) You may be eligible for grants, especially with energy and housing - Macmillan provides small grants to those with minimal savings The move by Lloyds follows an example set by the much smaller Nationwide Building Society two years ago While Macmillan has welcomed the move by Lloyds and Nationwide, it believes there has not been enough progress in the banking industry as a whole. It is asking the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to impose a ""duty of care"" on the banks, to force them to do more. ""I'd like to see the whole banking sector take a look at the work we're doing with Lloyds and Nationwide, and actually see the difference that it is making, day in and day out, to vulnerable customers,"" says Dr Fran Woodard, an executive director at Macmillan. So will other banks follow suit? UK Finance, which represents the High Street banks, said its members were keen to respond to individuals' circumstances and needs ""sympathetically and positively"". However, no other bank has announced plans for anything similar. But given that Lloyds has some 25 million customers, it is a challenge that rivals may not want to ignore. After all, one in two people born since 1960 is likely to get cancer at some time in their lives. A year on from her diagnosis, Tracy is doing OK, but will not be able to return to teaching. ""While you weren't looking, cancer has bulldozed the rest of your life,"" she says.

Who should headline the 2018 Super Bowl?,"The confetti has been ordered, the wind machines are powered up... now the world's biggest gig just needs a headliner. And the rumours have already starting swirling about who might perform at next February's Super Bowl. The half-time show is basically the most prestigious live slot in music and normallyattracts,externala worldwide TV audience of 120 million or so. Only the absolute top artists in the world are invited to perform - with recent headliners including Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Coldplay, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and Madonna. So, who could do it next year? Britney currently has a residency in Las Vegas Earlier this monthit was reported,externalthat Britney Spears was ""in talks"" to perform - but the stories were swiftlydenied,external. ""I can tell you it's not Britney,"" said Justin Toman, head of sports marketing for main sponsor PepsiCo. ""We'll reveal in due time,"" he added, pointing out that performer ""rumours always start around this time"". Speaking about what's required of the performance, hesaid,external: ""In those 12 minutes of the show, someone has to deliver power, punch, performance, singing, lightsâ¦. who has the reach, the social following, the album sales, who's trending, who's in cycle?"" Let's take a look at who might be able to tick all those boxes. With six studio albums, countless hits and a reputation for putting on a spectacular live show, Pink would have no trouble taking on the Super Bowl. And eagle-eyed fans have noticed she's releasing new music this autumn, which would make her a prime candidate for the show in February. ""If Pink is dropping new music in November, performing at the Super Bowl would be perfect for her album cycle,"" Perez Hilton saidon his podcast,externalthis month. ""I do know she's been asked in the past multiple times, and she's turned them down multiple times. ""She's got so many hits, but she's towards the end of the road as a viable artist and will soon be transitioning to legacy act. Pink has been around for two decades, so I hope she does it now."" We admit this one may be a bit of a risk. We like anunscripted stage rantas much as the next person, but Kanye's tendency toscrap entire toursor cut shows short after a few songs would leave the Super Bowl's insurance company a little nervous. But fans were quick to launch the#KanyeForSuperBowl52,externalcampaign after Lady Gaga's half-time show earlier this year. And West's wife Kim Kardashian seemed on board, retweeting many of the fans in apparent support of the idea. We've had cameo appearances from Nelly and Missy Elliott in previous half-time shows, but could West be the first solo hip-hop artist to headline? Popcrush recently took this very question to their readers, asking who they would like to see perform at the 2018 Super Bowl. Out of a hugemultiple choice list,externalwhich included Kylie and Jennifer Lopez, there was one very clear winner:Queen and Adam Lambert,external. The band have been touring with the singer for several years now and have played to sold-out venues around the world. Fortunately, Queen also have the odd couple of hits to their name. Together with Adam Lambert's electric stage presence, we wouldn't bet against this. Since Britney appeared to be in the frame this year, it'd only be fair to consider her early noughties counterpart. Christina Aguilera certainly has enough hit songs to fill a show. Crucially, though, she's also got a voice that can really deliver in a stadium setting. In 2015, she proved as much by belting out the national anthem at the event before the game started (although she got in abit of a tanglewith the lyrics). Christina may not have a high profile in the UK anymore, apart from when she's referenced as Quiz Team Aguilera during every pub quiz you've ever been to. But she's still very well-known in the US - particularly as a TV personality, thanks to her role as a coach on The Voice for six of its 12 seasons. Justin Timberlake would be a fine choice, as long as he promises no ""wardrobe malfunctions,external"" this time around. With a bit of luck he might bring out *NSync instead, in a similar vein to Beyonce briefly reuniting with Destiny's Child at the half-time show in 2013. Timberlake faces tough competition for the slot though, as there's been a new Justin in town for several years now. But in the event that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is unavailable, we'd also settle for Bieber, whose back catalogue would be a joy to hear in the middle of a sports match. In addition to his own solo hits, he's been going in a more dancey direction recently, collaborating with the likes of David Guetta on songs that would suit the Super Bowl down to the pitch. It's become traditional in recent years for the half-time show performers to bring on guests during their sets. Katy Perry had Missy Elliott, Coldplay had Beyonce and Janet Jackson had Justin Timberlake... although that one was a bit dull and uneventful. Can you imagine the sheer multitude of special guests Rihanna would have to choose from if she were headlining? DJ Khaled, Drake, Calvin Harris, Eminem, Kendrick, Shakira, Nicki Minaj, Coldplay and so many more could all be potentially enlisted for cameo appearances. Now would be a good time for a British headliner with two of the world's top music stars hailing from the UK. But would Adele or Ed Sheeran really be right for a show that is so much about the spectacle? Adele doesn't exactly have a huge number of upbeat party jams to her name, while Ed Sheeran had a few sceptics when heheadlined Glastonburythis year. The Independentsaid,externalhe was ""one of the least satisfying headliners in recent memory"", putting it down to his lack of ""charisma"" and the fact he performed completely on his own without any band or dancers. Both artists are huge in the US, so it's not totally impossible. Realistically, though, the thought of 65,000 excitable football fans jigging to Galway Girl may be a bit too much to hope for. Taylor is another performer who is likely to have new music to promote by early next year, which would make the Super Bowl an ideal fit. She's been keeping a low profile recently, so there would be the potential for this to be a comeback of epic proportions. ""I think I should take some time off. I think people might need a break from me,""she said in 2015,external, adding: ""I'm like this close to over-exposure."" Well, Taylor, we think your gap yah has gone on quite long enough now to be honest - so keep a Blank Space in your diary around February time. Dave Grohl Inc. are still on a high after a hugely successfulGlastonbury headline slotearlier this summer. The Super Bowl organisers do seem to love a good rock set - with Bruce Springsteen and the Rolling Stones among performers over the years. But the last few have been quite pop-oriented, so the timing could now be right for some tattooed men playing heavy guitar. More importantly, think how glorious Grohl's hair would look against the force of a Super Bowl wind machine.

CNN and BBC targeted by Kenya fake news,"A report was made to look as though it was produced by the BBC Focus on Africa programme A fake news report about Kenya's election that is made to look as if it is from broadcaster CNN has been circulating on social media. It comes aftera fake video imitating the BBC'sFocus on Africa programme was also distributed on Friday. Both videos had bogus surveys showing President Uhuru Kenyatta well ahead in polls ahead of August's election. In fact, recent opinion polls suggest neither he nor rival Raila Odinga have enough support to win outright. Arecent survey,externalsuggested that 90% of Kenyans had seen or heard false news in the run-up to the poll. CNN has taken to Twitter to confirm that the video report is fake, while the BBC has urged people to verify any stories claiming to be from the broadcaster by visiting the BBC website. Uhuru Kenyatta: Kenya's 'digital president' Raila Odinga: The man Kenyans either love or loathe The fake CNN report cuts from a CNN Philippines broadcast to a fake video that uses CNN logo. However, the font used in the headlines is visibly different from the one used by the broadcaster. CNN confirmed the report was fake via Twitter A Portland/GeoPoll survey found that many Kenyans feel some news items about the elections have been deliberately misleading. It also found that while traditional media remained the most trusted source of information, large numbers of people got their news from Facebook and WhatsApp. The presidential election on 8 August will see incumbent President Kenyatta run against seven candidates including his main challenger, opposition leader Raila Odinga. This video can not be played How do you spot fake news? The BBC's Focus on Africa editor explains. To win outright, a candidate must get 50% of votes cast plus one vote, as well as at least 25% of votes in half of Kenya's 47 counties. If no-one achieves that, the election will go to a run-off. Recent polls,externalhave providedconflicting data,externalon whether Mr Kenyatta or Mr Odinga is ahead. However, the polls suggested support for both of the candidates is below 50%. Eight things about the Kenyan elections Kenya's election: Your questions answered What Kenya's chaotic primaries tell us about August election While Kenya's 2013 elections passed relatively peacefully, there was serious post-election violence following the 2007 polls, which left over 1,000 people dead and 600,000 displaced from their homes.

Is the Independent still independent?,"The Independent newspaper closed in 2016 and is now online only Who is Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel, the man who has just bought a 30% stake in the Independent online newspaper? He is a rich man who wants to be richer, in short; and a Saudi investor seeking influence. Money and influence are the two main reasons that people invest in media, and there's no reason to think Abuljadayel is any different. Like Evgeny Lebedev, the majority owner of the Independent and the London Evening Standard with whom he is now a partner, Abuljadayel inherited his wealth. The 42-year-old Saudi hails from a family with huge international property investments, and I am told he is not a member of the Saudi royal family or government. But in a theocracy where all roads lead back to the House of Saud, the links between Abuljadayel and a monarchy whose reformist noises cannot conceal an appalling record on human rights will now come under the spotlight. I have already been contacted by staff at the Independent - who are on the whole young, internationalist, and liberal in outlook - discomforted by the principle of a Saudi investor. Their concern is naturally over ""editorial restrictions as to what we could run"". This would be true of any investor, of course. But the Saudi connection will prove especially troublesome to several staff, not least young female writers disgusted by treatment of women in that country. The deal, concluded in June, has been structured to allay concerns about editorial independence. He will have no place on the Board, and guarantees have been written into the Shareholder Agreement. Evgeny Lebedev retains 41%; Justin Byam Shaw, an entrepreneur, will have 26%; and a few other minor shareholders make up the rest. The Independent is known around the world for its coverage of the Middle East, led by Patrick Cockburn, Robert Fisk and Kim Sengupta. It opposed the Iraq War and has been ferocious in its condemnation of the Saudi regime - including during the time that this deal was in the works. The Evening Standard became a free title under Evgeny Lebedev's ownership Expect a big anti-Saudi story in the next few days to prove the independent credentials of the publication. The Independent newspaper - of which I was editor between June 2013 and its closure last March - was founded by idealists who wanted an upmarket, centrist paper free from editorial interference. Goodness know what they would have made of the modern publication, a left-wing multi-platform digital title, pursuing a viral social media strategy with frequently salacious stories, whose main owners are the son of a former KGB economic attachÃ© and the scion of Saudi property owners. And yet, while the paper - which Rupert Murdoch targeted in a brutal 1990s price war - was bedevilled by financial problems, the website is now profitable and valued at around Â£100m. That was simply unimaginable even five years ago. Back then, the paper was losing around Â£17m, and its horror-filled path to profitability was a combination of price rises (including on the sister paper, The I, subsequently sold to Johnston Press) and cost savings across editorial, production and distribution. Full disclosure: I was responsible for delivering some of the latter. Now the distribution costs don't exist, because the bizarre and expensive ritual of printing things on paper, putting it in lorries, and driving it to shops around the country has been eradicated. And unlike, for instance, the Guardian, the Independent retains few of the senior, expensive and highly experienced staff of old. The new staff, while talented and digitally savvy, are on average younger and cheaper too. Many newspaper groups try to ride two horses: both print and digital. The Independent, which has innovation in its DNA - it was the first title to go compact, and launched that brilliant sister title in 2010 - decided to abandon one horse altogether. Other publications will wonder whether the commercial revival of the Independent suggests they should consider following the same strategy. It's not always clear that they should. First of all, the Independent online is a very different beast to the paper, and frequently publishes articles that would never have got close to the print version. Second, the newspaper's circulation was so low towards the end, that its print revenues - while vital - could quickly be supplanted by digital revenue growth. That is not yet true of somewhere like the Guardian, the Financial Times or the Daily Mail, for whom print revenues remain vast. And third, moving to the much lower cost base of a younger editorial staff involves a huge amount of pain - including extensive redundancies - that many titles, and executives, just won't have the stomach for. The huge injection of cash in the Independent will now be used to fund long-promised international expansion, with Urdu and Arab language services being explored. One third of revenues at the title come from the US, where the anti-Trump wave has been a boon. That's why I called him a saviour of the media. Within a few years, the business will be predominantly US-focused. In terms of the short-term needs of ESI Media, the group which The Independent is part of (together with the Standard and television station London Live), this is precious cash for another reason. It used to be the case that the Independent was loss-making, while the Standard was profitable. Former Chancellor George Osborne became editor of the Standard in May This was always susceptible to misinterpretation both inside and outside the company, because it wasn't a verdict on the relative quality of the titles: it just so happened that the Standard's business model, in which it had become a free title under the Lebedevs, was successful. No more. The Standard, where George Osborne is editor, now faces terrifying commercial realities. Print display advertising provides almost all of the roughly Â£70m in revenues at the paper (whose website is much smaller than the Independent). That is likely to fall to around Â£65m this year - which is why I have been making the point repeatedly here that Osborne's task is as much commercial as editorial. For those who worked at the Independent in its long and proud history, a situation where Russian and Saudi money are used to fund not just international growth at the title, but the ambitions of a Tory ex-Chancellor now installed in the editor's chair of a sister title is, well, a long way from what the founders intended. They could be forgiven a wry smile today. For staff at the title, the initial surprise will give way to a mixture of relief at their new wealth and concern about its origins.

Did antidepressants help make this man a mass-murderer?," He slumps wild-eyed across the desk from detectives, with a mess of badly dyed red hair, his clothes hanging off him. James Holmes looks every inch the monster who coldly executed 12 innocent people and injured dozens more at a midnight screening of the Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. Holmes had carried out the killings with an arsenal of weaponry he had accumulated in the preceding weeks. He had planned the shootings down to the tiniest detail, even booby-trapping his own apartment with home-made bombs to divert police resources while he launched the attack. Watching a recording of his interview at the police station, conducted just hours after he carried out one of the worst mass shootings in recent US history, who could feel anything but loathing for this callous 24-year-old graduate student?  When asked how to spell his surname, Holmes cockily replies, “Like Sherlock”. When left alone with paper bags on his hands to secure forensic evidence, he’s caught on camera using them to talk to one another, like sock puppets. The only hint he may have some inkling of what he’s just done is when he asks a detective, “There wasn’t any children hurt?” In fact, six-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan was the youngest of Holmes’s victims that night in July 2012 - killed as she watched the movie premiere with her mother at the packed cinema in Aurora, Colorado. Americans have become wearily accustomed to mass shootings. Usually, in the days and weeks that follow, some kind of warped explanation emerges - be it terrorism, revenge or a predisposition to violence. It’s highly unusual for the perpetrator to be taken alive. Usually they are killed or kill themselves at the scene. Holmes survived, and as the evidence stacked up it looked like another tragic collision of mental breakdown with America’s lax gun laws. Holmes's Glock 22 Pistol photographed on the bonnet of his car Why else would a clever, shy guy with no history of violence, from a loving home, carry out such a heinous attack?  Holmes had no enemies, no terrorist ideology to drive him on. But the student had been seeing a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado Denver and this was no barrier to him buying a handgun, tear gas, full body armour and a semi-automatic rifle. .223 M&P rifle photographed outside the cinema Before he faced a court of law, Holmes was evaluated by a number of psychiatrists. No two doctors reached exactly the same conclusion. There were diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal disorder – or no diagnosable disorder at all. Some thought Holmes couldn’t legally be held responsible for his crime, on grounds of insanity. Others disagreed, arguing he still knew right from wrong when he carried out the shootings. When these questions came before a jury two years ago, the verdict was unanimous. Holmes was found guilty on all counts of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder. Judge Carlos Samour Jr said: It is the court’s intention that the defendant never set foot in free society again. Get the defendant out of my courtroom please.” He was led from the dock to jeers of “loser”, as his bewildered parents Bob and Arlene looked on, to begin one of the longest prison terms in US history - 12 life sentences plus 3,318 years in prison. He only narrowly escaped the death penalty. Holmes is being held in solitary confinement at a maximum security prison in an undisclosed state, because the nature of his crimes make him a target for other prisoners. That’s how he will spend the rest of his days. Like any other casual observer skimming over the court reporting online, I thought justice had been done, and that this was where Holmes’s story ended. Then I spoke to psycho-pharmacologist and long-time campaigner on the potential dangerous side effects of antidepressants, Prof David Healy. Healy had been hired as an expert witness in the James Holmes case and had visited him in jail before the trial. The public defender appointed to represent Holmes wanted Healy to evaluate whether the antidepressant sertraline (also known as Lustral in the UK and Zoloft in the US), which Holmes had been prescribed, could have played a role in the mass murder. Prof David Healy I have worked with David Healy in the past on a number of investigative films for the BBC’s current affairs programme, Panorama. These films revealed cases where people with no previous history of suicidal thoughts or violence went on to seriously harm themselves or others after being thrown into a state of mental turmoil by the newer generation of SSRI antidepressants, such as paroxetine and fluoxetine. Before meeting Holmes, Healy doubted the pills had played a part. But by the end of his prison visit he had reached a controversial conclusion. He was never called to give evidence at the trial of James Holmes, but he told me in August 2016 that he would have told the court: These killings would never have happened had it not been for the medication James Holmes had been prescribed.” SSRIs are thought to work by boosting serotonin levels to the brain. Stephen Buckley, from mental health charity Mind, says: Millions of people take SSRIs and other antidepressants and many find them useful in managing their mental health problems. Side effects from medication can be serious but it’s important to recognise that severe side effects are incredibly rare.” He adds that no-one should stop taking medication suddenly, without advice from a health professional. “If anyone is concerned that they may be experiencing harmful side effects they should speak to their doctor or pharmacist about alternatives.” Prof Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says: “In all treatments – from cancer to heart disease – medicines which do good can also do harm. This applies in psychiatry. Current evidence from large-scale studies continues to show that for antidepressants the benefits outweigh the risks.” David Healy maintains that while antidepressants can be a lifesaver for some, for others they can cause more harm than the original problems they were prescribed to treat. But what makes a young man plan over months a mass shooting, then carry it out with cold precision? Could antidepressants possibly do that? Arlene and Bob Holmes sat through every day of their son's trial but rejected all approaches to talk in public about their son out of respect for the victims and their families. However, a book that Arlene wrote, When the Focus Shifts: The Prayer Book of Arlene Holmes 2013-2014, gives an insight into her thoughts in the run-up to the trial in April 2015. Arlene and Bob Holmes arrive at the court building In one section, she describes the effects of taking the lowest dose of an SSRI antidepressant in March 2014: I have become fatter, ‘flatter’, dumber, number. Less tearful, yes. Unfortunately, less of everything. The sunset and the beach no longer lift my spirits.” She continues: “I sit through church service and sift through the Bible, uninspired. I’m fuzzy. Weird dreams. Crying used to be a release. Now I cannot cry, or laugh. I hate this feeling.” Arlene Holmes, a nurse, wrote that she stopped taking the pills before the trial, telling her doctor she wanted to be able to feel things and to cry if she wanted to. If she had a bad experience with an SSRI antidepressant, what would she make of David Healy’s view of her son’s case? I contacted the couple’s lawyer explaining my own background in investigating antidepressants and suggesting that Arlene and Bob Holmes might hold information that could, ultimately, help prevent future tragedies. A few weeks later an email from Arlene dropped into my inbox. Short and to the point, it requested more information and asked me not to share her contact details with anyone. “Some people bear my family ill will,” she wrote. When we finally spoke on the phone, it became clear Arlene and Bob had never seriously considered the effect antidepressants might have had on their son’s behaviour. In fact, they hadn’t even known of David Healy’s involvement as a pre-trial expert witness. Persuaded that exploring their son’s case in depth may ultimately help others, they reluctantly agreed to a filmed interview. It wouldn’t help their son - they know he will spend the rest of his life in prison. Approaching their low-rise detached home in a neat suburb of San Diego, what struck me was the sheer ordinariness - a man out washing his car, another mowing his lawn, kids playing baseball in the park. Inside, the Holmes’ house is modest, understated – just like Arlene and Bob. “We are an introverted family,” says Arlene. “We are not showy but we like having people around. We care about the larger picture in society and we are Christians, we go to church.” If you had told me this would happen to us I just wouldn’t have believed it.” The couple have struggled to understand how their boy could cause so much hurt and pain to others. “Not in your wildest dreams would you think your son would shoot strangers,” says Arlene. “For someone who loved kids and dogs and always did his homework and his chores. You can’t believe it is possible for anyone to cause that much harm, let alone the man you raised.” She says they never saw any signs of violence, and that her son had not shown any interest in drink or drugs. “In retrospect, I think he was too good. Maybe I should have worried about the fact he was so good, but as a mother you can worry about just about anything.” Bob Holmes, a retired statistician, is a man of few words. “He was never interested in guns or really even a violent kid, that’s why it was surprising. It came out of nowhere. He seemed happy enough, just pretty much a normal everyday kid growing up, so...” Bob’s voice trails off as though he can’t bear to finish the thought. They say there had been ups and downs along the way but little to mark them out from any other family. They moved home when James was 13 and he found the transition hard. He was quiet but he had friends and took part in sports. He cruised through his academic work at school and, later, as an undergraduate. Bob and Arlene speak about taking James to a counsellor: The first real hump in the road was when Holmes applied to six top universities to study for a doctorate in neuroscience. Academically bright, his shyness in interviews appeared to work against him.  He was rejected by all of them. “He came home and he just kind of didn’t do much of anything for a while, and he just kind of hung out,” says Bob. Arlene says her son was sleeping a lot and not going out much. “So I got mad and I said, ‘You are done with college, you need to do something.’” Holmes took his mother's advice and found a job working night shifts in a pill factory while he applied to more universities. In 2011, he accepted an offer to study neuroscience at University of Colorado Denver and started in the autumn. Not his first choice, says his mother, but it all seemed to be working out fine. “He still was happy to be at Colorado, talked to us about eventually settling and he eventually borrowed money to buy a town house on the outskirts of Denver,” she says. So when you hear something like that, the last thing in the world that you would ever think is that something as bad as a shooting could possibly happen. He was planning a future there.” Very few of Holmes's former friends are willing to talk, but one –  a young man who knew him well as an undergraduate –  spoke to me on condition of anonymity.  The Holmes he knew and liked was just as Bob and Arlene described - shy, polite, frugal and smart. They used to play video games together – strategy games, not the violent kind, he says. There was the occasional beer, but no drugs, parties or girls. “We were pretty nerdy,” he says. Discovering someone he was close to could commit mass murder had been “a profound experience”.  When he heard what his friend had done, he knew something must have happened to him. “I still don’t know how to make sense of it,” he says. Hillary Allen Someone who spent time with Holmes in the crucial months before the shootings was Hillary Allen, a fellow graduate student on the neuroscience programme at CU Denver. In class he didn’t really take notes, so that was something that made me jealous because I was vigorously writing notes down… it seemed like he got a lot of work done in his lab and he seemed very successful. I remember thinking like, ‘Wow, James is very smart, he’s very intelligent’” Sometimes the friendship was hard work. “He was kind of quiet and kept to himself.  He did have a kind of a quirky sense of humour,” says Allen. “We were part of a group of scientists so I think everyone’s a bit odd. Maybe he was a little bit more odd than the rest of us, maybe more socially awkward.” Socially awkward.  It's a phrase that comes up time and again to describe Holmes.  It’s what led him to make contact with the university counselling department in the spring of 2012, just months before the shootings. Cracks had started to appear in Holmes’s apparently effortless success. Over the Christmas break he was diagnosed with glandular fever.  Tired and ill for the first couple of months of 2012, he kept going to classes, but his work was going downhill. The shy and anxious Holmes found giving presentations in front of his classmates particularly hard. His first proper relationship with fellow graduate student Gargi Datta had also come to an end.  Datta didn’t want to speak to me, but according to Arlene Holmes the break-up hit her son hard. I think he loved her. He did say that she wanted to still see him again, which he found difficult to understand since they were broken up “It was a cordial break-up. That's the word he used, 'cordial'. They both parted as friends.” It was Datta who suggested Holmes seek help at the campus student wellness centre. On 21 March 2012, James Holmes had his first appointment there with psychiatrist Dr Lynne Fenton. Sifting through the mountain of court testimony and evidence, this date sticks out. Does it – as the prosecution would argue – mark the point at which Holmes first acknowledges he’s struggling mentally in the perfect storm of his relationship breakdown, academic problems and long-standing social anxiety? A storm that explains why he decided he had nothing to lose and everything to gain from killing as many people as he could? Or was that date significant  - as David Healy would say - because it was the day Lynne Fenton prescribed to James Holmes the antidepressant, sertraline? First page of Holmes's notebook In his first meeting with Lynne Fenton, Holmes was hard to engage but described his anxiety around people. And during that 45-minute session worrying details emerged that he’d never talked about with his family. Holmes said he was having thoughts of killing people three or four times a day. Although it sounds alarming, Fenton didn’t regard him as dangerous at that point. The thoughts were abstract, there was no plan or, it seemed, any real intent. She prescribed the antidepressant sertraline to ease his anxiety and obsessive thoughts. Holmes in custody In later prison interviews with court-appointed forensic psychiatrist Dr William Reid, Holmes said he’d had intrusive thoughts like this since his teens. Not of actually killing people, rather of wishing them dead to escape from awkward social situations. According to Reid, these kinds of intrusive thoughts are not uncommon. “He wasn’t talking about a vengeful hatred,” he says. “He was talking about an aversion to mankind. Being around much of mankind was uncomfortable to him and it wasn’t very rewarding to him so he wanted to avoid it.” With hindsight, it provides a clear motive, according to Colorado District Attorney, George Brauchler, who successfully prosecuted the case. He says Holmes had a long-standing hatred of mankind – that’s why he killed so many people. As he puts it, Holmes was “evil”. District Attorney, George Brauchler Brauchler says Holmes kept his evil desires at bay until it became clear he wasn’t going to get what he wanted to be happy. He’s not going to get that PhD, he’s not going to find that woman to love and have that house with those two kids and the dog.  And that’s when he turns his sights on this lifelong passion that he’s had to kill other people and that’s when we see him start to set these things in motion.” It’s a persuasive argument, and one some experts, and ultimately the jurors, had no trouble in accepting. But the timeline of what happened between Holmes’s first prescription of sertraline and the shootings wasn’t explored at trial. When you scrutinise that timeline, it raises serious questions about the role of the widely prescribed antidepressant. Page from Holmes's notebook Just before he carried out the shootings, Holmes posted to Fenton a notebook he had written in. At times rambling, it gives some contemporaneous insight into his troubled mind. Both William Reid and David Healy agree it’s a valuable piece of evidence. Holmes wrote about the initial effects of going on sertraline. No effect when needed. First appearance of mania occurs, not good mania. Anxiety and fear disappears. No more fear, no more fear of failure. Fear of failure drove determination to improve, better and succeed in life. No fear of consequences.” The first evidence that his thoughts of killing were turning real came in an online conversation with Gargi Datta on 25 March, four days after starting on sertraline. At Holmes's trial, Datta testified that at first she thought he was joking. But as she challenged him, the details of his delusional theory spilled out. This theory about increasing his so-called “human capital” by actually killing people was quite different to the abstract thoughts he'd had up until then about wishing people dead to get out of uncomfortable social situations. Psychiatrists I’ve spoken to agree it was delusional, a sign of psychosis. Datta was asked in court if he’d ever said anything delusional before this chat. She confirmed he hadn’t. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Resnick, from Ohio, was engaged as a prosecution expert. He was not called to give evidence at trial. Dr Philip Resnick In his first interview on the subject, he told me the ""human capital"" conversation with Datta was a key moment. “I don’t think we have evidence of a plan to do it [kill] with an intention to do it before the human capital theory,” he says. Holmes went back to see psychiatrist Lynne Fenton two days after telling Datta about human capital but he didn’t mention it to her. He did tell Fenton the medication hadn’t helped his obsessive thoughts. She doubled the dose of sertraline from 50mg to 100mg. David Healy believes this made Holmes’s mental state worse: There’s every evidence that if the drugs are suiting a person that an increase in the dose might be helpful - and I use these drugs even though they can cause a problem.” He adds: “But when they are causing a problem, increasing the dose is a recipe for disaster.” Nearly a fortnight after the dose increase on 9 April, the previously shy and awkward Holmes made a move on his classmate, Hillary Allen. His texts to her became uncharacteristically bold. One hot day he messaged her about the clothes she was wearing in class. “Oh Hillary, Why yuh gotta distract me with those short shorts...?” “I remember receiving that and just like kind of blushing and being like, I don’t remember what I said, but kind of trying to laugh it off and just trying not to create an awkward situation,” she says. For David Healy, this was further evidence of the effect sertraline was having on Holmes. Aside from the fact that you have a guy who is now actively beginning to think and plan about harming others in a way that he just hadn’t been doing before, you have a change of personality. This is a totally different person.” At his fourth appointment with Lynne Fenton on 17 April, Holmes told her his homicidal thoughts had increased, though he still didn’t tell her about his human capital delusion. Fenton’s notes of that meeting documented a decline in his mental state. “Psychotic level thinking… Guarded, paranoid, hostile thoughts he won’t elaborate on,” she wrote. Whatever effect the sertraline was having, it certainly wasn’t helping. Healy firmly believes the psychotic-level thinking Fenton noted was a consequence of the medication. At this appointment, Fenton upped the dose to 150mg. At Holmes's trial she told the court this was the dose she had always been aiming for. “It isn’t on her radar that this drug could be causing the kinds of problems that he’s having,” Healy says. Fenton declined to be interviewed, but a statement from the University of Colorado Denver says patient-doctor confidentiality laws forbid her from talking about Holmes’s care without his consent, which he has not given. By May, Holmes's “mission”, as he later described it, got real. He began spending large amounts of money accumulatingweapons. In the notebook he wrote: Starts small. Buy stungun and folding knife. Research gun laws and mental illness.  Buy handgun. Committed. Shotgun, AR-15, 2nd handgun…” By this time, Holmes’s coursework had badly deteriorated. He gave a disastrous final presentation and then failed his exams.  He was offered the chance to re-sit but on 11 June dropped out of university. Just before that, he had one last meeting with psychiatrist Lynne Fenton and her colleague. Holmes's final presentation They were so concerned by his state of mind at this appointment they offered to keep treating him free of charge, but Holmes refused. Fenton had the power to detain Holmes under a mental health hold, but she told his trial she felt there were insufficient grounds. She did contact the campus security team to ask for criminal-record and weapon-permit checks. Holmes was given the all clear. He never told Fenton about the weapons he’d bought or the plans he was making. Fenton also called Holmes’s mother. “She said, ‘Do you know that he is not going to continue in school?’” Arlene tells me.  “I thought that was the purpose of her phone call, and I said, ‘Did he ask you to call me?’ And she said, ‘No he didn’t want me to call you and he didn’t want you to worry.’ I was reassured by her phone call, rather than alarmed. I said, ‘My husband and I both work, we can pay you out of pocket to keep seeing him, I’m glad he’s getting some help for social anxiety.’   I didn’t know that she would never see him again, which is what happened.” Not only did he stop seeing Fenton, he also stopped taking sertraline. We can’t be sure exactly when he stopped but his final prescription would have run out around 26 June. The shootings were on 20 July. For some experts who believe sertraline may have played a role in reducing Holmes’s fear of consequences and even prompted delusional thinking, this gap in the timeline prevents them from blaming the drug for what happened. The fact that Mr Holmes was off it for three weeks even though he had the abrupt ending, means to me that it was unlikely, or I can’t say impossible, but played a very small role rather than a major role.” The Royal College of Psychiatrists says: “Up to a third of people who stop SSRIs have withdrawal symptoms which can last between two weeks and two months… for a small number of people they can be quite severe.” Prof Peter Tyrer, a UK-based expert on personality disorders who has been involved in evaluating the effectiveness of SSRI antidepressants since they first came on the market three decades ago, says stopping them suddenly is very unwise. Prof Peter Tyrer “It’s well established that you have a withdrawal problem and these adverse effects that you may have had even when starting the drugs. They all come back with a vengeance and if you’re still having them when you stop the drugs they come back even more strongly.” He adds: “It can be six or seven weeks before the effects wear off, and in some cases – and this is one of the problems with these drugs – sometimes they last even longer than that.” After stopping the drugs, Holmes started doing things he’d never done before. He dyed his hair red, created a profile on a swingers’ sex website, and started to draw detailed plans of the shootings in his notebook. Holmes's internet dating profile photo Holmes also visited the cinema in Aurora, and by the beginning of July went to a shooting range in the Rocky Mountains. There he began practising with the weapons he’d bought. On 8 July, classmate Hillary Allen got some odd texts from him. “The floodgates are open... It’s in your best interests to avoid me, am bad news bears,” Holmes wrote. “The next time I actually heard about James at all was when the shooting happened,” says Allen. Holmes brandishing a gun and wearing dark contact lenses I was in complete disbelief that it was actually James. Then immediately my mind goes back to those messages and thinking like, ‘Oh my gosh,’ like this was real, like he was actually like really, really struggling with something.” What Holmes was struggling with – mental illness, the side effects of his legally prescribed medication or a combination of the two – we may never know for sure. I’ve found no evidence Holmes planned to kill before he took antidepressants and plenty afterwards to suggest his mental state went rapidly downhill. Peter Tyrer says: “His symptoms were exactly right for giving sertraline... but with his underlying personality, with that sort of person... some of the underlying predispositions can come out more strongly, and in the case of Holmes these were very dangerous indeed.” In a statement Pfizer, the company that developed sertraline, said: “Based on currently available scientific evidence, a causal link between the use of sertraline and homicidal behaviour has not been established. Sertraline has helped millions of patients diagnosed with major depression and anxiety disorders, including Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.” Many people across the world report that antidepressants have been a lifesaver. But as ever-increasing numbers are prescribed, is it time to recognise that in a rare few cases they could actually contribute to murder? It’s an emotive but important question and one the courts seem ill-equipped to handle. In the course of my research, I’ve found cases in the UK of people, with no previous history of violence, who killed or attempted to kill after taking SSRI antidepressants. The issue was not explored in court and they were jailed for their offences. The guilt and shame of what they’ve done prevents them from talking publicly. Peter Tyrer believes the courts need to take more account of rare but serious side effects. “Although it makes the whole process a bit more complicated, I think that is going to become necessary in the future,” he says. Wendy Burn, of the Royal College of Psychiatry, says: “Any patient who is unsettled… should not abruptly discontinue their prescribed treatment. Instead, they should make an appointment with their family doctor or mental health professional to discuss any concerns they might have. They should together make a joint decision about whether to continue antidepressant treatment. “This decision should be made on their own individual experience and should be informed by how effective their treatment has been in helping to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms, any side effects which might have occurred, and the risks of a recurrence of illness, if treatment is stopped prematurely.” Built with Shorthand"
Did antidepressants help make this man a mass murderer?," He slumps wild-eyed across the desk from detectives, with a mess of badly dyed red hair, his clothes hanging off him. James Holmes looks every inch the monster who coldly executed 12 innocent people and injured dozens more at a midnight screening of the Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. Holmes had carried out the killings with an arsenal of weaponry he had accumulated in the preceding weeks. He had planned the shootings down to the tiniest detail, even booby-trapping his own apartment with home-made bombs to divert police resources while he launched the attack. Watching a recording of his interview at the police station, conducted just hours after he carried out one of the worst mass shootings in recent US history, who could feel anything but loathing for this callous 24-year-old graduate student?  When asked how to spell his surname, Holmes cockily replies, “Like Sherlock”. When left alone with paper bags on his hands to secure forensic evidence, he’s caught on camera using them to talk to one another, like sock puppets. The only hint he may have some inkling of what he’s just done is when he asks a detective, “There wasn’t any children hurt?” In fact, six-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan was the youngest of Holmes’s victims that night in July 2012 - killed as she watched the movie premiere with her mother at the packed cinema in Aurora, Colorado. Americans have become wearily accustomed to mass shootings. Usually, in the days and weeks that follow, some kind of warped explanation emerges - be it terrorism, revenge or a predisposition to violence. It’s highly unusual for the perpetrator to be taken alive. Usually they are killed or kill themselves at the scene. Holmes survived, and as the evidence stacked up it looked like another tragic collision of mental breakdown with America’s lax gun laws. Holmes's Glock 22 Pistol photographed on the bonnet of his car Why else would a clever, shy guy with no history of violence, from a loving home, carry out such a heinous attack?  Holmes had no enemies, no terrorist ideology to drive him on. But the student had been seeing a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado Denver and this was no barrier to him buying a handgun, tear gas, full body armour and a semi-automatic rifle. .223 M&P rifle photographed outside the cinema Before he faced a court of law, Holmes was evaluated by a number of psychiatrists. No two doctors reached exactly the same conclusion. There were diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal disorder – or no diagnosable disorder at all. Some thought Holmes couldn’t legally be held responsible for his crime, on grounds of insanity. Others disagreed, arguing he still knew right from wrong when he carried out the shootings. When these questions came before a jury two years ago, the verdict was unanimous. Holmes was found guilty on all counts of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder. Judge Carlos Samour Jr said: It is the court’s intention that the defendant never set foot in free society again. Get the defendant out of my courtroom please.” He was led from the dock to jeers of “loser”, as his bewildered parents Bob and Arlene looked on, to begin one of the longest prison terms in US history - 12 life sentences plus 3,318 years in prison. He only narrowly escaped the death penalty. Holmes is being held in solitary confinement at a maximum security prison in an undisclosed state, because the nature of his crimes make him a target for other prisoners. That’s how he will spend the rest of his days. Like any other casual observer skimming over the court reporting online, I thought justice had been done, and that this was where Holmes’s story ended. Then I spoke to psycho-pharmacologist and long-time campaigner on the potential dangerous side effects of antidepressants, Prof David Healy. Healy had been hired as an expert witness in the James Holmes case and had visited him in jail before the trial. The public defender appointed to represent Holmes wanted Healy to evaluate whether the antidepressant sertraline (also known as Lustral in the UK and Zoloft in the US), which Holmes had been prescribed, could have played a role in the mass murder. Prof David Healy I have worked with David Healy in the past on a number of investigative films for the BBC’s current affairs programme, Panorama. These films revealed cases where people with no previous history of suicidal thoughts or violence went on to seriously harm themselves or others after being thrown into a state of mental turmoil by the newer generation of SSRI antidepressants, such as paroxetine and fluoxetine. Before meeting Holmes, Healy doubted the pills had played a part. But by the end of his prison visit he had reached a controversial conclusion. He was never called to give evidence at the trial of James Holmes, but he told me in August 2016 that he would have told the court: These killings would never have happened had it not been for the medication James Holmes had been prescribed.” SSRIs are thought to work by boosting serotonin levels to the brain. Stephen Buckley, from mental health charity Mind, says: Millions of people take SSRIs and other antidepressants and many find them useful in managing their mental health problems. Side effects from medication can be serious but it’s important to recognise that severe side effects are incredibly rare.” He adds that no-one should stop taking medication suddenly, without advice from a health professional. “If anyone is concerned that they may be experiencing harmful side effects they should speak to their doctor or pharmacist about alternatives.” Prof Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says: “In all treatments – from cancer to heart disease – medicines which do good can also do harm. This applies in psychiatry. Current evidence from large-scale studies continues to show that for antidepressants the benefits outweigh the risks.” David Healy maintains that while antidepressants can be a lifesaver for some, for others they can cause more harm than the original problems they were prescribed to treat. But what makes a young man plan over months a mass shooting, then carry it out with cold precision? Could antidepressants possibly do that? Arlene and Bob Holmes sat through every day of their son's trial but rejected all approaches to talk in public about their son out of respect for the victims and their families. However, a book that Arlene wrote, When the Focus Shifts: The Prayer Book of Arlene Holmes 2013-2014, gives an insight into her thoughts in the run-up to the trial in April 2015. Arlene and Bob Holmes arrive at the court building In one section, she describes the effects of taking the lowest dose of an SSRI antidepressant in March 2014: I have become fatter, ‘flatter’, dumber, number. Less tearful, yes. Unfortunately, less of everything. The sunset and the beach no longer lift my spirits.” She continues: “I sit through church service and sift through the Bible, uninspired. I’m fuzzy. Weird dreams. Crying used to be a release. Now I cannot cry, or laugh. I hate this feeling.” Arlene Holmes, a nurse, wrote that she stopped taking the pills before the trial, telling her doctor she wanted to be able to feel things and to cry if she wanted to. If she had a bad experience with an SSRI antidepressant, what would she make of David Healy’s view of her son’s case? I contacted the couple’s lawyer explaining my own background in investigating antidepressants and suggesting that Arlene and Bob Holmes might hold information that could, ultimately, help prevent future tragedies. A few weeks later an email from Arlene dropped into my inbox. Short and to the point, it requested more information and asked me not to share her contact details with anyone. “Some people bear my family ill will,” she wrote. When we finally spoke on the phone, it became clear Arlene and Bob had never seriously considered the effect antidepressants might have had on their son’s behaviour. In fact, they hadn’t even known of David Healy’s involvement as a pre-trial expert witness. Persuaded that exploring their son’s case in depth may ultimately help others, they reluctantly agreed to a filmed interview. It wouldn’t help their son - they know he will spend the rest of his life in prison. Approaching their low-rise detached home in a neat suburb of San Diego, what struck me was the sheer ordinariness - a man out washing his car, another mowing his lawn, kids playing baseball in the park. Inside, the Holmes’ house is modest, understated – just like Arlene and Bob. “We are an introverted family,” says Arlene. “We are not showy but we like having people around. We care about the larger picture in society and we are Christians, we go to church.” If you had told me this would happen to us I just wouldn’t have believed it.” The couple have struggled to understand how their boy could cause so much hurt and pain to others. “Not in your wildest dreams would you think your son would shoot strangers,” says Arlene. “For someone who loved kids and dogs and always did his homework and his chores. You can’t believe it is possible for anyone to cause that much harm, let alone the man you raised.” She says they never saw any signs of violence, and that her son had not shown any interest in drink or drugs. “In retrospect, I think he was too good. Maybe I should have worried about the fact he was so good, but as a mother you can worry about just about anything.” Bob Holmes, a retired statistician, is a man of few words. “He was never interested in guns or really even a violent kid, that’s why it was surprising. It came out of nowhere. He seemed happy enough, just pretty much a normal everyday kid growing up, so...” Bob’s voice trails off as though he can’t bear to finish the thought. They say there had been ups and downs along the way but little to mark them out from any other family. They moved home when James was 13 and he found the transition hard. He was quiet but he had friends and took part in sports. He cruised through his academic work at school and, later, as an undergraduate. Bob and Arlene speak about taking James to a counsellor: The first real hump in the road was when Holmes applied to six top universities to study for a doctorate in neuroscience. Academically bright, his shyness in interviews appeared to work against him.  He was rejected by all of them. “He came home and he just kind of didn’t do much of anything for a while, and he just kind of hung out,” says Bob. Arlene says her son was sleeping a lot and not going out much. “So I got mad and I said, ‘You are done with college, you need to do something.’” Holmes took his mother's advice and found a job working night shifts in a pill factory while he applied to more universities. In 2011, he accepted an offer to study neuroscience at University of Colorado Denver and started in the autumn. Not his first choice, says his mother, but it all seemed to be working out fine. “He still was happy to be at Colorado, talked to us about eventually settling and he eventually borrowed money to buy a town house on the outskirts of Denver,” she says. So when you hear something like that, the last thing in the world that you would ever think is that something as bad as a shooting could possibly happen. He was planning a future there.” Very few of Holmes's former friends are willing to talk, but one –  a young man who knew him well as an undergraduate –  spoke to me on condition of anonymity.  The Holmes he knew and liked was just as Bob and Arlene described - shy, polite, frugal and smart. They used to play video games together – strategy games, not the violent kind, he says. There was the occasional beer, but no drugs, parties or girls. “We were pretty nerdy,” he says. Discovering someone he was close to could commit mass murder had been “a profound experience”.  When he heard what his friend had done, he knew something must have happened to him. “I still don’t know how to make sense of it,” he says. Hillary Allen Someone who spent time with Holmes in the crucial months before the shootings was Hillary Allen, a fellow graduate student on the neuroscience programme at CU Denver. In class he didn’t really take notes, so that was something that made me jealous because I was vigorously writing notes down… it seemed like he got a lot of work done in his lab and he seemed very successful. I remember thinking like, ‘Wow, James is very smart, he’s very intelligent’” Sometimes the friendship was hard work. “He was kind of quiet and kept to himself.  He did have a kind of a quirky sense of humour,” says Allen. “We were part of a group of scientists so I think everyone’s a bit odd. Maybe he was a little bit more odd than the rest of us, maybe more socially awkward.” Socially awkward.  It's a phrase that comes up time and again to describe Holmes.  It’s what led him to make contact with the university counselling department in the spring of 2012, just months before the shootings. Cracks had started to appear in Holmes’s apparently effortless success. Over the Christmas break he was diagnosed with glandular fever.  Tired and ill for the first couple of months of 2012, he kept going to classes, but his work was going downhill. The shy and anxious Holmes found giving presentations in front of his classmates particularly hard. His first proper relationship with fellow graduate student Gargi Datta had also come to an end.  Datta didn’t want to speak to me, but according to Arlene Holmes the break-up hit her son hard. I think he loved her. He did say that she wanted to still see him again, which he found difficult to understand since they were broken up “It was a cordial break-up. That's the word he used, 'cordial'. They both parted as friends.” It was Datta who suggested Holmes seek help at the campus student wellness centre. On 21 March 2012, James Holmes had his first appointment there with psychiatrist Dr Lynne Fenton. Sifting through the mountain of court testimony and evidence, this date sticks out. Does it – as the prosecution would argue – mark the point at which Holmes first acknowledges he’s struggling mentally in the perfect storm of his relationship breakdown, academic problems and long-standing social anxiety? A storm that explains why he decided he had nothing to lose and everything to gain from killing as many people as he could? Or was that date significant  - as David Healy would say - because it was the day Lynne Fenton prescribed to James Holmes the antidepressant, sertraline? First page of Holmes's notebook In his first meeting with Lynne Fenton, Holmes was hard to engage but described his anxiety around people. And during that 45-minute session worrying details emerged that he’d never talked about with his family. Holmes said he was having thoughts of killing people three or four times a day. Although it sounds alarming, Fenton didn’t regard him as dangerous at that point. The thoughts were abstract, there was no plan or, it seemed, any real intent. She prescribed the antidepressant sertraline to ease his anxiety and obsessive thoughts. Holmes in custody In later prison interviews with court-appointed forensic psychiatrist Dr William Reid, Holmes said he’d had intrusive thoughts like this since his teens. Not of actually killing people, rather of wishing them dead to escape from awkward social situations. According to Reid, these kinds of intrusive thoughts are not uncommon. “He wasn’t talking about a vengeful hatred,” he says. “He was talking about an aversion to mankind. Being around much of mankind was uncomfortable to him and it wasn’t very rewarding to him so he wanted to avoid it.” With hindsight, it provides a clear motive, according to Colorado District Attorney, George Brauchler, who successfully prosecuted the case. He says Holmes had a long-standing hatred of mankind – that’s why he killed so many people. As he puts it, Holmes was “evil”. District Attorney, George Brauchler Brauchler says Holmes kept his evil desires at bay until it became clear he wasn’t going to get what he wanted to be happy. He’s not going to get that PhD, he’s not going to find that woman to love and have that house with those two kids and the dog.  And that’s when he turns his sights on this lifelong passion that he’s had to kill other people and that’s when we see him start to set these things in motion.” It’s a persuasive argument, and one some experts, and ultimately the jurors, had no trouble in accepting. But the timeline of what happened between Holmes’s first prescription of sertraline and the shootings wasn’t explored at trial. When you scrutinise that timeline, it raises serious questions about the role of the widely prescribed antidepressant. Page from Holmes's notebook Just before he carried out the shootings, Holmes posted to Fenton a notebook he had written in. At times rambling, it gives some contemporaneous insight into his troubled mind. Both William Reid and David Healy agree it’s a valuable piece of evidence. Holmes wrote about the initial effects of going on sertraline. No effect when needed. First appearance of mania occurs, not good mania. Anxiety and fear disappears. No more fear, no more fear of failure. Fear of failure drove determination to improve, better and succeed in life. No fear of consequences.” The first evidence that his thoughts of killing were turning real came in an online conversation with Gargi Datta on 25 March, four days after starting on sertraline. At Holmes's trial, Datta testified that at first she thought he was joking. But as she challenged him, the details of his delusional theory spilled out. This theory about increasing his so-called “human capital” by actually killing people was quite different to the abstract thoughts he'd had up until then about wishing people dead to get out of uncomfortable social situations. Psychiatrists I’ve spoken to agree it was delusional, a sign of psychosis. Datta was asked in court if he’d ever said anything delusional before this chat. She confirmed he hadn’t. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Philip Resnick, from Ohio, was engaged as a prosecution expert. He was not called to give evidence at trial. Dr Philip Resnick In his first interview on the subject, he told me the ""human capital"" conversation with Datta was a key moment. “I don’t think we have evidence of a plan to do it [kill] with an intention to do it before the human capital theory,” he says. Holmes went back to see psychiatrist Lynne Fenton two days after telling Datta about human capital but he didn’t mention it to her. He did tell Fenton the medication hadn’t helped his obsessive thoughts. She doubled the dose of sertraline from 50mg to 100mg. David Healy believes this made Holmes’s mental state worse: There’s every evidence that if the drugs are suiting a person that an increase in the dose might be helpful - and I use these drugs even though they can cause a problem.” He adds: “But when they are causing a problem, increasing the dose is a recipe for disaster.” Nearly a fortnight after the dose increase on 9 April, the previously shy and awkward Holmes made a move on his classmate, Hillary Allen. His texts to her became uncharacteristically bold. One hot day he messaged her about the clothes she was wearing in class. “Oh Hillary, Why yuh gotta distract me with those short shorts...?” “I remember receiving that and just like kind of blushing and being like, I don’t remember what I said, but kind of trying to laugh it off and just trying not to create an awkward situation,” she says. For David Healy, this was further evidence of the effect sertraline was having on Holmes. Aside from the fact that you have a guy who is now actively beginning to think and plan about harming others in a way that he just hadn’t been doing before, you have a change of personality. This is a totally different person.” At his fourth appointment with Lynne Fenton on 17 April, Holmes told her his homicidal thoughts had increased, though he still didn’t tell her about his human capital delusion. Fenton’s notes of that meeting documented a decline in his mental state. “Psychotic level thinking… Guarded, paranoid, hostile thoughts he won’t elaborate on,” she wrote. Whatever effect the sertraline was having, it certainly wasn’t helping. Healy firmly believes the psychotic-level thinking Fenton noted was a consequence of the medication. At this appointment, Fenton upped the dose to 150mg. At Holmes's trial she told the court this was the dose she had always been aiming for. “It isn’t on her radar that this drug could be causing the kinds of problems that he’s having,” Healy says. Fenton declined to be interviewed, but a statement from the University of Colorado Denver says patient-doctor confidentiality laws forbid her from talking about Holmes’s care without his consent, which he has not given. By May, Holmes's “mission”, as he later described it, got real. He began spending large amounts of money accumulatingweapons. In the notebook he wrote: Starts small. Buy stungun and folding knife. Research gun laws and mental illness.  Buy handgun. Committed. Shotgun, AR-15, 2nd handgun…” By this time, Holmes’s coursework had badly deteriorated. He gave a disastrous final presentation and then failed his exams.  He was offered the chance to re-sit but on 11 June dropped out of university. Just before that, he had one last meeting with psychiatrist Lynne Fenton and her colleague. Holmes's final presentation They were so concerned by his state of mind at this appointment they offered to keep treating him free of charge, but Holmes refused. Fenton had the power to detain Holmes under a mental health hold, but she told his trial she felt there were insufficient grounds. She did contact the campus security team to ask for criminal-record and weapon-permit checks. Holmes was given the all clear. He never told Fenton about the weapons he’d bought or the plans he was making. Fenton also called Holmes’s mother. “She said, ‘Do you know that he is not going to continue in school?’” Arlene tells me.  “I thought that was the purpose of her phone call, and I said, ‘Did he ask you to call me?’ And she said, ‘No he didn’t want me to call you and he didn’t want you to worry.’ I was reassured by her phone call, rather than alarmed. I said, ‘My husband and I both work, we can pay you out of pocket to keep seeing him, I’m glad he’s getting some help for social anxiety.’   I didn’t know that she would never see him again, which is what happened.” Not only did he stop seeing Fenton, he also stopped taking sertraline. We can’t be sure exactly when he stopped but his final prescription would have run out around 26 June. The shootings were on 20 July. For some experts who believe sertraline may have played a role in reducing Holmes’s fear of consequences and even prompted delusional thinking, this gap in the timeline prevents them from blaming the drug for what happened. The fact that Mr Holmes was off it for three weeks even though he had the abrupt ending, means to me that it was unlikely, or I can’t say impossible, but played a very small role rather than a major role.” The Royal College of Psychiatrists says: “Up to a third of people who stop SSRIs have withdrawal symptoms which can last between two weeks and two months… for a small number of people they can be quite severe.” Prof Peter Tyrer, a UK-based expert on personality disorders who has been involved in evaluating the effectiveness of SSRI antidepressants since they first came on the market three decades ago, says stopping them suddenly is very unwise.

Deceitful data helps to thwart hackers,"D-Day was aided by a massive disinformation campaign which fooled the Nazi high command In World War II, the Allies employed all kinds of sneaky tricks to deceive their enemies into thinking they had more troops and weapons at their disposal than they actually had. The camouflage techniques of one unit active in North Africa, which on one occasion consulted a stage magician about the way he fooled audiences, proved decisive in several key battles. And the biggest deception of all was Operation Fortitude which fooled the Nazis about where the D-Day landings would actually take place. The same principles of deception and misdirection, albeit on a much smaller scale, are now starting to be used by some organisations to thwart malicious hackers keen to establish a bridgehead on internal networks. ""It's a classic idea of warfare to prevent the adversary from having a real understanding of your reality,"" said Ori Bach from deception technology firm Trapx. ""It's just like the Allies in WWII. They made fake tanks, fake air bases, fake everything."" And just like those ersatz weapons of war, the fakes implanted on a network look just like the real thing. ""We create a shadow network that is mimicking the real network and is constantly changing,"" he said. The use of so-called deception technology has grown out of a realisation that no organisation can mount perfect digital defences. At some point, the attackers are going to worm their way in. Given that, said Mr Bach, it was worth preparing for their arrival by setting up targets that are simply too juicy for the malicious hackers to ignore once they land and start looking around. ""We want our shadow network to be more attractive to the hackers than the real stuff,"" he said. Deception technology has grown out of work on another useful cyber-thief tracking technology known as honey pots, said Joe Stewart of deception firm Cymmetria. Seeding networks with crumbs of valuable data can frustrate attacks A honey pot is a computer that resembles a typical corporate server to the automated tools that many hackers use to scour the net for targets. Many large security firms set up lots of individual honey pots, he said, to gather intelligence about those tools and the malware being used to subvert them. But, said Mr Stewart, the problem with honey pots is that they are passive and only involve a few separate servers. By contrast, deception technology is generally used on quite a grand scale so any attacker that turns up has little clue about what is real and what is fake. Cyber-hacks season: Smart gun hacked with cheap magnets 'Ransomware here to stay' warns Google Facebook: Cyber-security industry 'lacks empathy' North Korea hackers 'want cash not secrets' Typically, said Mr Stewart, the spoofed network will be made to look more attractive to hackers by seeding the real network with ""breadcrumbs"" of information that lead to the fake network. These tantalising chunks of data hint at all kinds of goodies that hackers are keen to steal, such as payment data, customer details, login credentials or intellectual property. But, instead of leading attackers to data they can sell, it leads them down a deep confusing hole that gets them no closer to that elusive, valuable data they crave. He added that as soon as they start following the crumbs and interacting with that fake network, everything they do is recorded. That intelligence can be hugely useful, said Mr Stewart, because it involves what attackers do after their automated tools have got them a toehold on a network. ""The initial intrusion was probably done with something that was just spammed out,"" he said and, as such, would be spotted and logged by many different defence systems. ""What's much more interesting is the second stage persistence tools."" Organisations rarely get a look at these, he said, because once an attacker has compromised a network they usually take steps to erase any evidence of what they did, where they went and what software helped them do that. Organisations do not have to commit huge amounts of resources to deception systems to slow down and thwart hacker gangs, said Kelly Shortridge from the security arm of defence firm BAE. Instead, she said, more straightforward techniques can also help to divert attackers and waste their time. For instance, she said, a lot of malware is now able to detect when it is being run inside a sandbox - a virtual container that helps to ensure that malicious code does not reach real world systems. Many firms use systems that quarantine suspicious files into sandboxes so if they do have malign intent they can do no harm. Often, said Ms Shortridge, malware will not detonate if it believes it has been put into such a sandbox. By mimicking the characteristics of sandboxes more widely it can be possible to trick malware so it never fires, she said. Other tricks include seeding a network with the text and words that attackers look for when they are seeking a way in. Making them chase false leads can help frustrate attackers and prompt them to seek easier targets, she said. ""It's all about making reconnaissance the hardest step."" It is not just the gathering of information about attacks that makes deception systems so useful, said Mr Bach from Trapx. ""By engaging them and providing them with targets they are expending their most valuable resource, which is time,"" he said. Instead of spending time cranking through a real network, any attacker diverted on to the shadow system is, by definition, wasting their time. Emmanuel Macron's election campaign reportedly used fake data to foil hackers In addition, he said, because the shadow system resembles real world desktops and servers, attackers will sometimes use their own valuable assets in a bid to worm their way deep into what they think is a corporate network. Some of the most valuable assets that cyber-thieves possess are the never-before-seen software vulnerabilities that they have bought on dark web markets. ""If they have spent a lot of money acquiring a vulnerability and they have used it to attack a decoy then that's a huge win for the defenders,"" he said. This is because using it reveals information about a previously unknown vulnerability that defenders will then share with others so they can properly patch and prepare for it. Finding and buying software vulnerabilities is a time-consuming and expensive process, said Mr Bach, and undermining it can have long-term consequences for the malicious hacker groups. ""Cyber-thieves are financial operations,"" he said. ""They spend money on R&D and on intelligence on the dark net. If they do not get more money back as a return then that criminal enterprise will ultimately fail."" This week BBC News is taking a close look at all aspects of cyber-security.

Call for review of farmers' tax-breaks,"Tax breaks for UK farmers should be reviewed, the head of a group advising the environment secretary has said. Economist Dieter Helm said the current system of taxpayer-funded support was extremely wasteful and the industry suffered from ""subsidy addiction"". Prof Helm said the exemption of farmland and buildings was used to avoid inheritance tax. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said his ideas were not under consideration. Prof Helm told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Farmers receive not just the Â£3bn of subsidy, they receive a whole range of other benefits that nobody else in the economy gets."" In July, Environment Secretary Michael Gove wrote to Prof Helm thanking him for his ""counsel"" and asking his Natural Capital Committee to advise him on the aims of a 25-year plan for the environment. But Prof Helm stressed he was speaking in a personal capacity. He questioned the exemption of business rates for farmland, and the use on farms of ""red diesel"" which attracts a reduced rate of duty. There were legitimate concerns about making sure farmers could pass on their businesses to their children, and the tax relief should not be entirely abolished, he said. But he added: ""What we're seeing is lots of people using farmland for the benefit of simply getting round a pretty tough tax."" Prof Helm said: ""In this reassessment of support and subsidies for farmland we have to put the industry on a long-term reasonable and fair basis with other perfectly legitimate industries and business in the economy. ""If you're producing 0.7% of output, receiving Â£3bn of subsidies on output of about Â£9bn and being exempted on rates, being exempted on diesel and being exempted on inheritance tax, this is quite a list and we've got there by accident almost."" A Defra spokesman said: ""These ideas are not under consideration. ""The secretary of state has been clear that he wants to go on generously supporting farmers for many more years to come."" Prof Helm said the 25-year plan on which his committee would advise would provide a framework to integrate the different ways the government subsidises groups such as farmers. A government source said it would not advise on the details of farming policy. After Brexit: What happens next for the UK's farmers?

The death of Jimmy Morgan and his mouth organ,"A stretcher-bearing party carrying a wounded soldier through the mud during the battle of Passchendaele War poet Siegfried Sassoon called Passchendaele ""hell"". The battle is remembered as one of the most horrific conflicts of World War One, in which hundreds of thousands died in the stinking mud of Flanders. Relatives of two Scottish soldiers have traced the stories of men involved in the battle and will be at the Menin Gate Memorial on Sunday to mark the centenary. Sara McCann's great-grandfather L/Cpl William George Brough was killed on the first day of Passchendaele, officially known as the Third Battle of Ypres, on 31 July 1917. Her research led to the discovery that the Black Watch soldier, from Dundee, was known to the lads at the front as ""Jimmy Morgan"", a nickname earned through playing the mouth organ in the trenches. Willie Brough was said to be the original Jimmy Morgan in the popular poem The Battle of Passchendaele lasted three months and cost hundreds of thousands of lives A newspaper report on the death of Willie Brough tells how his mouth organ tunes were immortalised in a poem by popular Dundee soldier-poet Joseph Lee. The poet changed the name of the man behind the mouth organ to Jimmy Morgan to help his verse rhyme but always acknowledged that the best player in the battalion was Willie Brough. The newspaper account says the Black Watch soldier had displayed a ""perfect genius"" for the mouth organ since boyhood and that he ""cheered his comrades in billet and in battle"". It says he lightened ""many a weary and trying hour"" with his music, especially Scottish tunes, reminding the troops of home. Willie Brough's name on the Menin Gate Memorial in Belgium Sara McCann told BBC Scotland she was ""incredibly proud"" of her great-grandfather. She said: ""From what I know of the battle it was hideous. People were drowning in the mud because of the rain. It was just the most awful time. ""He was killed on the very first day of Passchendaele and in one way I'm glad he was killed at the start."" She says the story of his mouth organ playing ""brought him to life"" for her and other relatives because it told them about his personality. Sara says: ""What I love most about him is that even in those circumstances, which were hideous, he was able to keep his spirits up and lift others as well. This video can not be played Passchendaele ""He had a positive effect and lifted morale. ""Music must have been one of the few pleasures they had to take their mind off it and remind them of home."" Brough, who was married with four children, had joined the Army in 1914 and seen two years of service in France before Passchendaele, including Arras and the Somme. The newspaper account of Willie Brough's death ends with the hope that his fabled mouth organ would be placed among Dundee's war relics. Unfortunately, in the mud and chaos of the battle 90,000 bodies were never identified. Neither Brough nor his mouth organ were recovered. Sara's research has located where the trenches of the 9th battalion were and she visited the field three years ago. She now plans to go back to Belgium for the 100th anniversary and place a mouth organ at the Black Watch corner at Menin Gate. It reads: ""Lance-corporal William Brough, Black Watch, known to Dundee lads at the front as ""Jimmy Morgan"", has fallen in his country's cause. The lance-corporal from boyhood displayed a perfect genius in playing the mouth organ and when he went on active service he and his humble instrument were continually in requisition. Many a weary and trying hour he lightened with his music. He was the original ""Jimmy Morgan"" in Joe Lee's ""Ballads of Battle"". Sometimes he pipes us grave hopes/Sometimes he pipes us gay/Till broken feet/take up the beat/of quick step or strathspey But he plays upon our heart strings/when he plays a Scottish tune/Hear Jimmy Morgan/and his old mouth organ/ At ""The Banks o' Bonnie Doon"" And now Willie Brough has gone to join many another brave lad in the Great Beyond and his music with which he cheered his comrades in billet and in battle will be heard no more. I trust his little instrument has been preserved, for when we in Dundee come to gather together our war relics Willie Brough's mouth organ should certainly have a place among them."" John McDonald (centre) with a group of soldiers in France during WW1 Passchendaele, like the Somme, has come to symbolise the horrors of World War One. The Allied assault was launched in the early hours of 31 July 1917. Torrential rain meant that the British and Canadian troops were fighting not only the Germans but a quagmire of stinking mud that swallowed up men, horses and tanks. The brutal trench warfare lasted three months before the Allies recaptured the village of Passchendaele. About a third of a million British and Allied soldiers had been killed or wounded in some of the most horrific trench warfare of the conflict. William McDonald's grandfather, John Alexander McDonald, fought in the conflict. He was a 20-year-old grocer from Elgin at the beginning of the war, married with a young son. John McDonald with his wife, Isabella, and his son John, who would be William McDonald's father At the outbreak of WW1, he joined the the 6th battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders, which drew men from the Moray area. After training in Bedford, he went to France in May 1915 and saw two years of action in battles such as Arras and the Somme before moving to take part in Passchendaele. His grandson told BBC Scotland: ""On the day of the battle they were the second wave of attack. They were heading for a stream which was the target to get over for that day. ""It was seemingly freak weather conditions. A lot of rain came on. The artillery had blown up all the drainage so the place was a sea of mud. ""They advanced and the conditions became muddier and muddier. It was a grim time for them all. They were cheerful despite it all and very courageous."" William McDonald's grandfather and great uncle served in the same battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders Mr McDonald adds: ""It must have been quite a scene to see them wearing kilts and charging through, trying to make their objectives."" His grandfather won the Military Medal for his actions on the first day of battle but the circumstances of his bravery are not recorded. The Seaforth Highlander survived three months of the battle at Passchendaele but was killed in another battle in March 1918. Mr McDonald said he had some letters written by John McDonald which gave an insight into his personality. ""I think he was a smart chap,"" he says. William McDonald says his grandfather survived Passchendaele but died in a later conflict ""A keen family man. He missed his son and wife. It was difficult times for them. He talks about missing Elgin and being keen to get home."" ""My dad must have been about two when his father went to war. He only saw him three or four times before he died.""

Cartoon cat calms police crime posters,"Upsi's cartoon campaign appeared on the London Underground Cartoon cats have been used to make police warning messages more memorable and less about trying to scare people into changing their behaviour. The Universities' Police Science Institute (Upsi) in Cardiff ran a trial in London to warn about thieves on bikes stealing mobile phones. The #Copcat trial with Metropolitan Police took place in two areas. Prof Martin Innes from Upsi said early results show the trial was successful and other forces are interested. ""Most crime prevention messages are designed to frighten people into changing their behaviour,"" said Prof Innes. ""We designed an experiment where we ran two campaigns - a very traditional campaign designed to change people's crime prevention behaviour versus our more experimental campaign and saw what results were and how they were different. ""We tried to use humour and cartoons to change how memorable the messages were for members of the public. ""The campaign was about mobile phone thefts by people on mopeds and bicycles which has become quite a problem at the current time. ""When we were looking at it, it was just an emerging problem that was starting to come through, so we thought this was a good thing to test this campaign on."" Both the traditional and cartoon campaigns were on display in underground stations around Camden and Islington boroughs in 2016. Prof Innes said people were exposed to them when they stepped on and off the trains, and officers handed out leaflets at stations while there was also a social media campaign. He added: ""What we saw was people were far more likely to remember the cartoon cat - who we called Copcat - and the advice he gave than they were for a far more traditional police campaign. This video can not be played Prof Martin Innes says early results show the trial was successful The ""complicated"" findings of the campaign are being written up and a way forward is being explored. ""If we can get a campaign that's just as effective in getting people to change their crime prevention behaviours, that doesn't make people afraid, that to us is a good result,"" Prof Innes said. ""The work was done in conjunction with the College of Policing so once we've understood the nuances in our data and our findings, we're hoping that this has got the potential to roll out and go nationwide. ""There's certainly a lot of early interest in it. We've already entered into conversations with some forces about it. ""I would hope over the next six months we'd be in a position to see these sort of techniques and approaches roll out.""

Colombia will not accept Venezuela vote,"""Down with the dictatorship,"" reads graffiti on a Caracas wall Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos says his country will not recognise the result of Sunday's vote in neighbouring Venezuela to elect a new assembly with power to rewrite the constitution. ""The constituent assembly lacks legitimacy and because of that we cannot accept the result,"" he said. Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro called the vote as protests against his government gained momentum in May. The opposition sees it as a move towards dictatorship. The new constituent assembly, comprising 545 members, will rival the National Assembly, currently controlled by the opposition. ""We insist on a peaceful solution for the country's situation,"" said President Santos. Mr Santos has been critical of how the Venezuelan government has handled the crisis Earlier on Friday, police in the Venezuelan capital Caracas fired tear gas and rubber bullets against opposition activists who blocked roads. At least two people were injured. 'Zero hour': Venezuela at breaking point Venezuela crisis: When a simple cut can mean death What is behind the crisis in Venezuela? Crisis-hit Venezuelans leave for Brazil Venezuela has banned protests that could ""disturb or affect"" the vote. Prison terms of between five and 10 years could be imposed on those contravening the ban, Interior Minister NÃ©stor Reverol said on Thursday. The ban on activity will remain in force until Tuesday. Katy Watson, BBC News, Caracas When you drive around Caracas at night, you really notice the lack of street lights - it's very dark and it feels unsafe. A day after the government banned protests ahead of Sunday's vote, the streets of Caracas felt eerily quiet. There were sporadic demonstrations but what stood out were the blockades or ""guarimbas"" as the Venezuelans call them.  Some barricades are just piles of rubbish, others are made with bricks or barbed wire. It's a tactic used by the opposition aimed at halting traffic and causing disruption. And it works - finding a straightforward route is hard, dodging cars driving down the wrong side of the road is the norm, it seems, anything to find a way out of the barricades and get home. More than 100 people have been killed in protest-related violence since April. The situation has worsened to the point that the United States has ordered family members living at the embassy in Caracas to evacuate the country. It also authorised its staff members to leave if they desire. Mr Maduro said his opponents should ""abandon the road to insurrection"" and added that he would be willing to begin a ""roundtable dialogue in the next few hours"". Mr Maduro called Mr Santos a traitor of Latin America and a vassal of the US On Wednesday, theUS imposed sanctionson 13 senior Venezuelan officials, including Mr Reverol. The sanctions freeze the US assets of those targeted and stop American entities from doing business with them. President Donald Trump promised ""strong and swift economic actions"" if the poll goes ahead. Mr Maduro responded by describing the US as imperialists bent on ruling the world and called the sanctions ""illegal, insolent and unprecedented"".

Robot cracks open safe live on stage,"This video can not be played Watch hackers attempt to crack safe Using a cheap robot, a team of hackers has cracked open a leading-brand combination safe, live on stage in Las Vegas. The team from SparkFun Electronics was able to open a SentrySafe safe in around 30 minutes. The robot is able to reduce the number of possible combinations from one million to just 1,000, before quickly and automatically trying the remaining combinations until it breaks in. After the robot discovered the combination was 51.36.93, the safe popped open - to rapturous applause from the audience of several hundred hackers. SparkFunâs Nathan Siedle told the BBC: ""That was one of the scariest things weâve done. Lots of things can go wrong, and this was a very big audience. ""Weâre really happy it opened up.â A spokeswoman for SentrySafe could not be reached on Friday. But speaking to Wired magazineearlier this month,external, when the team demonstrated its method on a smaller safe, a spokeswoman for the safe maker said: ""In this environment, the product accomplished what it was designed to do. â[It] would be realistically very difficult, if not impossible, for the average person to replicate in the field.â The team was relieved to see the safe open up The latest demonstration was performed at Def Con, the largest gathering of underground hackers in the world. The SparkFun team was not able to travel with a weighty safe, and so bought a new one that was opened up for the first time on stage. The robot can be adapted to fit any combination safe by 3D-printing two new parts The team joked the safe could have been cracked sooner - but they had to fill their 45-minute time slot. The robot, which cost around $200 to put together, makes use of 3D-printed parts that can be easily replaced to fit different brands of combination safe. It cannot crack a digital lock - although vulnerabilities in those systems have been exposed by other hacking teams in the past. The teamâs work began when Mr Siedleâs wife Alicia bought a safe on eBay that was cheap due to the previous owner not knowing what the combination was. âShe gave it to me for Christmas,â Mr Siedle said. The mechanism in the safe consists of three dials which, when aligned, allow the safe to be opened. Each dial can be any two digit number - meaning one million potential combinations. The safe was cracked in about 30 minutes But the robot doesnât simply try every combination. It is able to suss out one of the dials within 20 seconds by detecting the size of indents on the dial. In simple terms, the âsolutionâ indent is slightly larger than the âincorrect"" indents. In the demonstration, this method meant the team discovered the third and final number was 93. The other two dials cannot be measured - but eliminating one greatly reduces the number of possible combinations. It was made easier when the team also discovered that the safeâs design allows for a margin of error to compensate for humans getting their combination slightly wrong. For example, if one dial is set to open at 14, using 15 and 13 will work as well. It meant the robot could check every third number, making it possible to quickly test the remaining combinations much faster than a human being. Using this method, they could cut down the number of possible combinations to around 1,000 - a far more manageable challenge. Before the attempt, Mr Siedle told the BBC the robot could be easily adapted to tackle any combination safe. âWe designed it for a particular type of safe, but it doesnât really matter - you can actually 3D-print a coupler that can match any safe that you may have.â Some SentrySafe models come with an additional lock and key, but the team was able to unlock it by using a Bic pen. âNo matter how much money you spend on a safeâ¦ nothing is impervious,â Mr Siedle said. ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Smart gun hacked with cheap magnet.
