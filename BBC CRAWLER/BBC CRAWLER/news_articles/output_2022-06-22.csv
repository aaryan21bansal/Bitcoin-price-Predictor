"Twitter tests 'notes' feature with 2,500 word limit","Twitter is trialling a new feature allowing users to share ""notes"" as long as 2,500 words. The social media platform normally limits posts to 280 characters. Twitter said the move was a response to seeing people use the platform to post pictures of longer announcements and steer followers to outside newsletters. The test will run for two months and involve a small group of writers in Canada, Ghana, the UK and US. The new feature aims to keep audiences in the Twitter eco-system, with readers able to see a headline and access the longer note by clicking on a link. Writers will be able to embed gifs, photos and other features into long-form essays that can be read on and off Twitter. Notes can also be edited after they have been published. ""Since the company's earliest days, writers have depended on Twitter to share their work, get noticed, be read, create conversation - everything but the actual writing,"" the company said, makingthe announcement,externalusing the new Notes product. ""With Notes, the goal is to fill in that missing piece."" The move follows Twitter's purchase last year of Revue, a Dutch newsletter start-up. Elon Musk hints at potential Twitter layoffs Twitter confirms it is working on an edit button Social media expert Dr Laura Toogood said the trial was a significant step for Twitter. She said the feature would encourage people to stay within the platform itself, rather than linking out to other websites that can host long-form content. ""Adding this extra capability means that Twitter is now in a position to compete with some of the popular blogging platforms and potentially attract a new audience and a different type of user,"" she told the BBC. ""It will also encourage existing users to blog within Twitter, rather than move to other websites for this purpose, which will help to retain their audience."" In 2017Twitter increased the maximum number of characters for tweets from 140 to 280, following a trial among a small group of users. The latest move comes amid scrutiny of the Twitter's business prospects, as Elon Musk's planned takeover of the company raises questions about its direction. The firm announced in April it was working on an edit button, shortly after Mr Musk - who had called for such a feature - revealed he had bought a large stake in the company. Twitter said the events were unrelated. Mr Musk has also said he sees potential in a subscription model in which people would pay to use the platform. Dr Nikki Usher, a journalism professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it was hard to know whether Twitter was trying out new formats out of profitability or a genuine desire to try to improve the platform. ""In this case, one of the things we do know is that people do not like to read long texts online,"" they told the BBC. ""So whether giving people 2,500 characters to work with will ultimately make a difference in the quality of the digital public sphere - well, I think it's unlikely.

Lithuania accuses Russia of rail blockade lies,"Ingrida Simonyte said a tiny proportion of Russian goods were affected by EU sanctions Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte has said Russian claims of a rail blockade of its territorial outpost in Kaliningrad are a lie. Kaliningrad is on the Baltic Sea and uses a rail link to Russia via Lithuania for passengers and freight. When Lithuania banned the transit of steel and other ferrous metals under EU sanctions last Saturday, Russia threatened to respond. The Kremlin condemned the sanctions as illegal and unacceptable. Ms Simonyte explained that passengers were still able to travel freely across Lithuanian territory from Russia to Kaliningrad and only about 1% of Russian freight was affected. One senior diplomat in Brussels said that Russian talk of a blockade was disinformation and completely untrue. ""Lithuania is complying with the sanctions imposed by the European Union on Russia for its aggression and war against Ukraine,"" the prime minister said. EU sanctions on steel were imposed in March, but a three-month transition period was allowed for existing contracts to wind down. Russia annexed Kaliningrad after World War Two in 1945 and roughly one million people live there. Diplomats say no goods trains have yet been barred from crossing Lithuania It was not clear what Russian security council chief Nikolai Patrushev meant when he threatened a ""serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania"". The foreign ministry in Moscow said merely that retaliation would be practical as well as diplomatic. Regional governor Anton Alikhanov said that as well as reprisals, Kaliningrad would organise shipments by sea. ROSENBERG:Coming to a standstill in Kaliningrad One option would be to disconnect Lithuania from the electricity network it shares with Russia, Belarus and the other Baltic states, although officials in Vilnius have said for months they are ready to connect through Poland to the West European grid. The Lithuanian prime minister told the BBC that it was important not to overreact, as this was the latest in a series of threats used by Russia or Belarus to threaten their neighbours, such as attempted cyber-attacks on public institutions and utilities. Estonia called on Russia to stop issuing threats and suggested Moscow was flexing its muscles ahead of next week's Nato summit in Madrid, where Sweden and Finland hope to get backing to join the Western defence alliance. As Lithuania is a member of the Nato as well as the EU, the prime minister said lessons needed to be learned  and security had to be in place, given that Russia's neighbour Belarus had acted as an accomplice, allowing its soil to be used as a staging post for invasion of Ukraine. ""We need a significantly higher presence in the region,"" she told the BBC's Katya Adler, citing a 100-km (62-mile) corridor of territory that connects Lithuania and the other two Baltic states to Poland. ""The Suwalki Gap is a place which is crucially important, not only for my country or Poland, but also for Nato, because this is a short corridor and there is a need to take its defence and security seriously."" She was speaking on the eve of an EU summit, where diplomats said the Russian threats were bound to come up. One diplomat told the BBC that when sanctions had been imposed, it was unlikely that they were designed to stop Russia moving goods internally. The European Commission might seek to de-escalate the situation, the source added. However, another senior European diplomat said the legal argument was clear, that there would be no derogation for allowing banned Russian goods from crossing EU territory. Further sanctions are due to come into force in August and December, covering luxury goods and crude oil, so the aim is for the Commission to make a public statement on what is seen as legal and what is not.

Rail strike resumes after talks collapse,"Stations opened later than usual on Wednesday with only 60% of normal services running A second day of rail strikes is under way after talks between the RMT union and railway employers broke down. The RMT accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of ""wrecking"" negotiations by refusing to allow Network Rail to withdraw redundancy threats. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", adding the union was solely to blame for the ""massive disruption"". Thursday's strike is set to have a similar impact as Tuesday's, with just 20% of services running. Millions were affected on Tuesday at the start of the largest strike in decades. Another walkout is due on Saturday. The second day of strikes will see half of the rail network in Britain closed. In London, there are no strikes taking place on the Tube network, though operator TFL has warned of disruption to some services, including the London Overground. It comes as the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms across much of southern England, potentially adding to disruption. What days are the strikes and which trains are running? The breakdown in talks between the RMT and rail companies led to recriminations between the union and the government. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers' union, claimed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had ""wrecked"" negotiations by not allowing Network Rail to withdraw its letter threatening redundancy for 2,900 of our members. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", saying he had no involvement in the letter. The Department of Transport has said the rail industry is leading the negotiations, but a contract seen by the BBC says that train operating companies' handling of strike action is ""subject to the secretary of state's direction"". A Network Rail source told the BBC little progress was made in Wednesday's talks, with the union's position appearing to have hardened. No new pay offer was made. Disruption for millions on rail strike's first day Fans descend on Glastonbury amid travel disruption 'Why I'm losing my wages to go on strike' Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Both sides in this dispute insist that in recent days they had thought progress was being made. But Wednesday's talks again ended without an agreement. As things stand, a deal to avert the third strike going ahead on Saturday isn't looking particularly likely. The RMT union says that in talks, it asked Network Rail to withdraw Monday's letter about pressing ahead with a formal consultation over changes to working practices in maintenance teams - which would entail redundancies. A source at Network Rail, which maintains and operates the tracks, described this as a ""red herring"". They insisted the letter could be ripped up if the union would properly negotiate on the reforms. There wasn't a new pay offer yesterday. So far, both train companies and Network Rail have offered an unconditional 2%, with a further 1% conditional on accepting changes they say are necessary to modernise ways of working. Meanwhile, passengers face another day of travel misery. More rail commuters can switch to working from home than would have been possible in the past, but not everyone has that option and many plans will be disrupted. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the cost of living crisis, as inflation hits 9.1% and is forecast to reach 11% in the autumn. Employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition that the union accepts new working practices. But rail employers said they had suffered a loss of income, with passenger numbers only at 80% of pre-pandemic levels. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, said it wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"", which meant modernising the railway to attract passengers back. On Tuesday, the prime minister urged the country to ""stay the course"" and resist high pay rises he said could further fuel inflation. Services started later than normal on Wednesday as trains were delayed depots On Tuesday about 40,000 RMT members working for Network Rail walked out, leaving many parts of the country with no rail service at all. Disruption continued on Wednesday, with only about 60% of normal services running. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson and the transport secretary of not ""lifting a finger"" to stop the strikes. Mr Johnson responded that the government was doing ""everything we can to prevent these strikes"" and it was up to the railway companies to negotiate. Meanwhile, the government is planning to introduce a new law this week to make itlegal for employers to bring in agency staff to replace striking workers- but it will not impact the planned rail strikes on Thursday and Saturday.

Taliban appeal for aid after deadly earthquake,"This video can not be played WATCH: Body removed from rubble after deadly earthquake hits Afghanistan Doctors in Afghanistan have told the BBC that many children may have been killed in Wednesday's earthquake. More than 1,000 people died in the disaster, and heavy rain, threadbare resources and rugged terrain are hampering rescue workers. Unknown numbers were buried in the rubble of ruined, often mud-built homes by the magnitude 6.1 earthquake. One woman in hospital in Paktika province told reporters she had lost 19 family members. ""Seven in one room, five in another, four in another, then three in another, have all been killed in my family,"" she said from her bed. By Wednesday night Taliban officials said search and rescue operations had finished in most places, although in remoter areas some continued still. ""We can't reach the area - networks are too weak,"" a Taliban spokesman was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying earlier. Five beds between 500 at Afghan quake clinic The United Nations is among those scrambling to provide emergency shelter and food aid to remote areas in Paktika. Survivors and rescuers have told the BBC of villages completely destroyed near the epicentre of the quake, of ruined roads and mobile phone towers - and of their fears that the death toll will rise further.  Some 1,500 people were also injured, officials say. The Taliban authorities have called for more international aid. Villagers and rescue workers examine the damage in Bernal district Most of the casualties found so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts of Paktika. Locals report dozens of villages collapsed. ""There was a rumbling and my bed began to shake,"" a survivor called Shabir told the BBC. ""The ceiling fell down. I was trapped, but I could see the sky. My shoulder was dislocated, my head was hurt but I got out. I am sure that seven or nine people from my family, who were in the same room as me, are dead."" A mother of six who was badly injured in the earthquake told the BBC many in her village had been killed, including seven of her own family members. ""We are very poor. We cannot reconstruct our homes again,"" she said. ""We have nothing to eat."" All her family's food supplies are buried under the rubble. ""There is nowhere to go,"" she added. ""I demand the Taliban rebuild our houses."" All the villagers we meet want to show us the damage to their homes done by the earthquake. They have lost their loved ones, alongside homes and livelihoods. Possessions are scattered amongst the debris: blankets, pots, beds stick out from the rubble. The villagers want the world to see how their lives have been devastated, but also more tangibly, to have their names added to aid distribution schemes. A number of aid agencies have reached the scene but it's clear more help is needed. One man we meet has just arrived back in his village from Pakistan where he works as a labourer. Twenty members of his family were killed in the earthquake including his daughter. Another, elderly man now finds himself responsible for his five young grandchildren - after their father died. The valleys here are overflowing with tragedy. Many of the families are now living in makeshift tents, flanked by the rubble of the homes they had worked so hard to construct. TheTaliban run the country:The hardline Islamists took over Afghanistan last year, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition There's a food crisis:More than a third of people can't meet basic needs and the economy is struggling, as foreign aid and cash dried up when the Taliban took power Women's rights are restricted: They have been ordered to cover their faces in public and teenage girls have not been allowed to go to school Read more about Afghanistan The deadliest earthquake to strike the country in two decadesis a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck early on Wednesday about 44km (27 miles) from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Afghanistan is in the midst of a humanitarian and economic crisis, and Abdul Qahar Balkhi, a senior Taliban official, said the government was ""financially unable to assist the people to the extent that is needed"". Images show true scale of devastation in Afghanistan 'Every street you go you hear mourning' The head of the UN, AntÃ³nio Guterres said the agency had ""fully mobilised"" over the disaster. But Mohammad Amin Huzaifa, head of information for Paktika province, told AFP it was proving ""very difficult"" for rescuers to reach areas ""affected by floods because of heavy rains last night"". Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it is located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. According to the UN, 93% of households in Afghanistan suffer food insecurity. Lucien Christen, from the Red Cross, said Afghanistan's ""dire economic situation"" meant ""they're [Afghan families] not able to put food on the table"".

Queen praises Windrush pioneers as statue unveiled,"This video can not be played WATCH: A Windrush monument is unveiled at Waterloo Station The Queen has praised the Windrush ""pioneers"" for their ""profound contribution"" to British life as a statue to them was unveiled. The monument, at Waterloo Station, pays tribute to the thousands of people who arrived in the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1971. It depicts a man, woman and child standing on top of suitcases and was revealed to mark Windrush Day. The government gave Â£1m to fund the statue, designed by Basil Watson. In a message to mark the occasion, signed Elizabeth R, the Queen said she hoped the statue would ""inspire present and future generations"" as she sent her ""warmest good wishes on this historic occasion"". Windrush Day marks the arrival of Caribbean immigrants to the shores of Britain on 22 June each year - the day HMT Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks in 1948. Windrush generation: Who are they and why are they facing problems? Windrush racism report must be published - lawyer Anger at Home Office over compensation progress The Queen's grandson the Duke of Cambridge helped to unveil the statue, alongside his wife the Duchess of Cambridge, and also paid tribute to the contributions of the Windrush generation, and their descendants to British life. ""Without you all Britain would simply not be what it is today,"" he said. ""I want to say a profound thank you to every member of that generation and the generations that have followed."" But Prince William also talked about how the ""past weighs heavily"" on the people of the Caribbean and the Windrush generation. He said members of the Windrush generation had been victims of racism when they arrived and said ""discrimination remains an all too familiar experience for black men and women in Britain in 2022"". The duke referred to the Windrush scandal, which broke in April 2018, and said it still ""rightly reverberates through the Caribbean community here in the UK"". The scandal, which saw members of the Windrush generation and their children wrongly detained and even deported,led to the UK government apologising for the deportation threats many faced. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, accompanied by Baroness Floella Benjamin, Windrush passengers Alford Gardner and John Richards and children at the unveiling of the National Windrush Monument at Waterloo Station Windrush passengers Alford Gardner and John Richards helped the royals to unveil the statue. Jamaican artist and sculptor Mr Watson has said he was""truly honoured"" to have been chosento create the monument. The government said the statue would ""create a permanent place of reflection and inspiration and be a visible statement of our shared history and heritage"". The Duke of Cambridge paid tribute to the ""profound contribution"" of the Windrush generation to the fabric of British life Earlier to mark Windrush Day, Prince William and Catherine met young British-Caribbean creatives at the Brixton House theatre in south London, with the duchess trying her hand at photography and the duke chatting to R&B musician Abdoulaziz Lelo Ndambi. They also met youth workers at Lambeth Council's Elevate programme and attended a workshop led by production agencies Iconic Steps and Oxygen Art. High-profile names, including actor Lenny Henry and poet Benjamin Zephaniah, have called for next year's Windrush Day to be a ""major national moment"" to mark the 75th anniversary. More than 100 leaders across different sectors have signed a joint letter, published in The Times, starting the one-year countdown to the milestone. The letter reads: ""This is not only black history - it is British history. It should be something we all know and commemorate."" Patrick Vernon, convenor of the Windrush 75 network, which is co-ordinating efforts over the next 12 months, said it was a piece of history ""every child should learn about at school"" and called for it to be commemorated as a major event. Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials after HMT Empire Windrush's arrival in 1948 But not everyone has been supportive of the unveiling of the statue with activist Prof Gus John describing it as ""a monument to unforgivable political illiteracy and an entrenched colonial mindset"". In an open letter to Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, dated 9 June, declining an invitation to the unveiling, he said the ""entire Windrush narrative distorts the history of Caribbean engagement with Britain and of Britain's relentless efforts to keep us out"". Vincent McBean, president of the West Indian Association of Service Personnel, supported the creation of the memorial but said it could have been located in a better place. ""In the heart of Brixton is Windrush Square, what would have been more befitting for it to have been put in the square,"" he said, adding that it had been Lambeth Council which had initially embraced those who arrived from the Caribbean. The government says the location was chosen because thousands of members of the Windrush generation passed through Waterloo Station on their way to start new lives across the UK. They are known as the Windrush generation, in reference to the HMT Empire Windrush, one of the ships that carried them to the UK to fill labour shortages, in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration. Under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. But thousands of the Windrush generation arrived in the UK as children and did not have official documentation.  Following immigration law changes in 2014, many were told they were in the UK illegally, despite living and working in the country for decades.

UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump,"Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years with food costs, particularly for bread, cereal and meat, climbing. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, edged up to 9.1% in the 12 months to May, from 9% in April,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. Fuel and energy prices are the biggest drivers of inflation, but the ONS said food costs had pushed it up further. Workers and unions are pushing for pay rises to cope with higher prices. But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"" where firms hike wages and thenpass the cost on to customers through higher prices. Currently, inflation is at the highest level since March 1982, when it also stood at 9.1% and the Bank of England has warned it will reach 11% this year. Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%. In a BBC-commissioned survey of more than 4,000 people, 82% said they thought their wages should increase to match the rising price of goods and services. Households were hit by an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase in energy costs in April, and fuel price rises in June mean it costs more than Â£100 to fill an average family car with petrol. Rail workers walked out on Tuesday causing severe disruption, with further strikes planned for Thursday and Saturday in a dispute over pay, jobs and conditions. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%. Unison, which represents public sector workers, accused ministers of ""living on another planet"" over ""talks of public sector pay restraint"". ""Under-pressure health, care, school and council services desperately need staff to be given a pay boost that matches runaway prices,"" assistant general secretary Jon Richards said. The biggest teachers' union is also warning of potential industrial action over pay. The National Education Union has criticised government proposals for a 3% pay increase for most teachers in England, and called for an ""inflation-plus increase for all teachers"". But Dominic Raab told the BBC's Today programme: ""We have got to stop making the problem worse by fuelling pay demands that will only see inflation stay higher for longer and that only hurts the poorest the worst."" Why are prices rising so quickly? Ukraine war causes 'giant leap' in food prices The ONS said rising prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages helped fuel inflation in May. Russia's war in Ukraine has severely restricted wheat and maize supplies, which are used to make bread and cereals, from two of the world's biggest exporters. Ukraine is also a major producer of sunflower oil, meaning the costs of alternatives have also climbed. Market research firm Kantar has forecast that theaverage annual grocery bill in the UK is set to rise by Â£380 this year. Supermarket Asda told the BBC some shoppers are setting Â£30 limits at checkouts and petrol pumps, with customers putting less in their baskets and switching to budget ranges. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said ""widespread food price rises"" meant the cost of goods leaving factories had risen at their fastest rate in 45 years in May, with the cost of raw materials at the highest on record. But he said the steep rises in food and record high petrol prices in May had been stemmed by the price of clothes rising less than they did this time last year, along with a drop in computer game costs. The ONS also revealed average UK house prices increased by 12.4% in the year to April, with average prices now Â£281,000, Â£31,000 higher than this time last year. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, said after families paid for essentials, ""the amount of spare cash left over to spending on days out, socialising and other treats is shrinking at an astonishing rate"". Georgia looks for low-cost ways to have a day out, preferably not travelling by car Mum Georgia, from Birmingham, said she was having to cut back on trips with her daughter Harper-Faye as a result of prices rises. ""I haven't got the money to go to Sea Life Centres and stuff. That's like, Â£25 a ticket,"" said she said. ""I can't go out as much as I used to, not a chance. I can't afford it."" Responding to the latest inflation rate, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was ""using all the tools at our disposal to bring inflation down and combat rising prices"". The governmenthas provided a  package of measures,worth Â£15bn in total, to help people cope with soaring prices. But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor said the country needed ""more than sticking plasters to get us back on course - we need a stronger, and more secure economy"". Liberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called for a cut in VAT, adding: ""This chancellor has hiked taxes time and time again, refusing to slash them to help with the cost of living emergency."" There's no respite from the relentless rise in prices. While at least the rate of rise in inflation appears to have slowed, this is just a pause for breath. Further records in petrol prices and a renewed surge in the price of internationally traded gas after a fire at a key US gas terminal, mean a hot summer, and tricky autumn. Right now we are also seeing the impact of a notable fall in sterling, compounding the global inflationary pressures, and helping to explain why UK inflation is higher than the rest of the G7. Inflation this high is disastrous for the personal finances of millions of households, especially as food prices are unarguably surging. ""Squeeze"" doesn't quite capture how some working families are seeing their entire disposable income wiped out by monthly energy direct debits, or turning up at supermarkets asking the cashiers to stop the till at Â£30 or Â£40. The Bank of England may not see this data as a reason to ""act forcefully"" which many see as code for a half a per cent rise in August. They will continue to watch the evolution of wage settlements. While there is little evidence of a spiral in wages and prices so far, it is clear we are at a critical moment for the jobs market. With vacancies at record levels, unions see a one-off opportunity to increase wages, and will continue to push for double digit rises, for examplerejecting Rolls Royce's Â£2,000 cost of living payment. Employers including the government will resist, but workers may find some wind in their sails in negotiations. One way to try to control how fast prices are rising is to raise interest rates. The aim of this is to increase the cost of borrowing and encourage people to borrow and spend less, and save more. In a bid to stem the pace of soaring prices, the Bank of England recently increasedUK interest rates from 1% to 1.25%. How have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Twitter tests 'notes' feature with 2,500 word limitThe trial will let some users share ""notes"" beyond the normal 280-character limit for posts.Business","Twitter is trialling a new feature allowing users to share ""notes"" as long as 2,500 words. The social media platform normally limits posts to 280 characters. Twitter said the move was a response to seeing people use the platform to post pictures of longer announcements and steer followers to outside newsletters. The test will run for two months and involve a small group of writers in Canada, Ghana, the UK and US. The new feature aims to keep audiences in the Twitter eco-system, with readers able to see a headline and access the longer note by clicking on a link. Writers will be able to embed gifs, photos and other features into long-form essays that can be read on and off Twitter. Notes can also be edited after they have been published.

""With Notes, the goal is to fill in that missing piece."" The move follows Twitter's purchase last year of Revue, a Dutch newsletter start-up. Elon Musk hints at potential Twitter layoffs Twitter confirms it is working on an edit button Social media expert Dr Laura Toogood said the trial was a significant step for Twitter. She said the feature would encourage people to stay within the platform itself, rather than linking out to other websites that can host long-form content. ""Adding this extra capability means that Twitter is now in a position to compete with some of the popular blogging platforms and potentially attract a new audience and a different type of user,"" she told the BBC. ""It will also encourage existing users to blog within Twitter, rather than move to other websites for this purpose, which will help to retain their audience."" In 2017Twitter increased the maximum number of characters for tweets from 140 to 280, following a trial among a small group of users. The latest move comes amid scrutiny of the Twitter's business prospects, as Elon Musk's planned takeover of the company raises questions about its direction. The firm announced in April it was working on an edit button, shortly after Mr Musk - who had called for such a feature - revealed he had bought a large stake in the company. Twitter said the events were unrelated. Mr Musk has also said he sees potential in a subscription model in which people would pay to use the platform. Dr Nikki Usher, a journalism professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it was hard to know whether Twitter was trying out new formats out of profitability or a genuine desire to try to improve the platform. ""In this case, one of the things we do know is that people do not like to read long texts online,"" they told the BBC.

Modern slavery victims recount 'horrendous' abuse,"The Bristol couple kept modern-day slaves to run their car wash A pregnant woman has recounted the ""horrendous"" conditions she endured as a modern slavery victim. Maros Tancos tricked the victim and numerous other vulnerable Slovaks into coming to the UK with the promise of a better life. But instead Tancos and co-conspirator Joanna Gomulska, of Bristol, used them as slaves. The pair were jailed on Wednesday after being found guilty of modern slavery and human trafficking offences. The woman, who gave birth while working for the couple, said: ""I knew I could not leave, there was nothing I could do."" She spoke as Tancos was jailed for 16 years and Gomulska nine years at Bristol Crown Court. The trial heard how they kept vulnerable Slovakians as slaves - forcing them to work at their car wash during the day and other jobs at night - and spent their earnings on gambling, buying cars and funding their lavish lifestyles. One female victim said they had ""no life"" under the couple's control and were kept in a squalid bedroom National Crime Agency investigators found that Tancos and Gomulska failed to pay a minimum of Â£923,835 in wages, calculated as if Tancos had paid his victims minimum wage for eight hours a day Jailing them, Judge Martin Picton said their victims ""represented a cash value to you in a way cattle would to a farm"". The pair ""trapped"" their victims into forced labour ""solely for the financial benefit"" of themselves, he added. The woman - who has since returned to her home country - said that she had a ""good life"" in Slovakia and came to the UK to get a better job. She said she did not know Tancos or Gomulska before arriving but was told that ""everything will be provided"". Despite her working numerous jobs, Tancos - who controlled his victims' bank accounts - only ever paid her â¬200 (Â£171). ""We didn't have time to sleep,"" she explained. ""We were working, we had some food then we went to bed and then we had to go to work."" Tancos and Gomulska were told they'd seen their victims in terms of their cash value - using them like ""cattle on a farm"". The pair used the proceeds to pay for cars and second homes while their victims lived in squalid conditions. Police believe the victims are owed at least Â£1million in lost earnings that Tancos and Gomulska stole from them. Today marks the end of a five-year investigation by the NCA into their crimes and will hopefully give their victims at least some sense that justice has been served. The woman said she slept in one room with five or six other women, while between six and seven men slept in the attic. Tancos controlled their lives so much that they had to ask permission to go to the shop, she said. All this abuse meant that her daughter was ""very poorly"" when she was born because they were living in a room with no bed and only a ""mattress on the floor"". ""When my baby was born it was undernourished, it was horrendous,"" she explained. ""I was always waiting for things to get better (but) I knew deep inside he was a fraudster."" The slavery victims were made to sleep in cramped conditions Another victim said the house appeared nice at first but it soon ""became a gate to hell"" when they discovered that life would not be as they imagined. ""I went there because I wanted to provide for my family and give them more than what they had in Slovakia but the life that I had in Maros' house changed my life completely."" The victims would work all day in the car wash then have other jobs during the evening Speaking since escaping the couples' control, the woman said she is ""very happy"" because her daughter was ""very poorly"" but has since recovered. Couple used slaves as car wash workers Man charged with human trafficking offences The trial heard that on arrival in the UK, the couple took their victims' identity documents and phones, meaning they could not travel independently or leave. They were forced to work at the couple's car wash business during the day and perform other jobs at night. Tancos and Gomulska kept their victims' bank cards and forced them to open bank accounts. They also applied for loans and credit cards in their names. Between 2010 and 2017, almost Â£300,000 was transferred from their victims' accounts.

"Powerful quake kills 1,000 in Afghanistan","This video can not be played Watch: People injured in the earthquake are rushed to a rescue helicopter A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC. The Taliban appealed for international help for the rescue effort as pictures showed landslides and ruined mud-built homes in the province of Paktika. The quake struck shortly after 01:30 (21:00 GMT Tuesday) as people slept. Hundreds of houses were destroyed by the magnitude 6.1 event, which occurred at a depth of 51km (32 miles). It is the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades and a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Taliban officials asked the UN to ""support them in terms of assessing the needs and responding to those affected"", Sam Mort from Unicef's Kabul unit told the BBC. The UK's special representative to Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, said the UK was in touch with the UN and was ""ready to contribute to the international response"". Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. Speaking to Reuters news agency, locals described horrific scenes of death and destruction in the aftermath of the late-night earthquake. ""The kids and I screamed,"" said Fatima. ""One of our rooms was destroyed. Our neighbours screamed and we saw everyone's rooms."" ""It destroyed the houses of our neighbours,"" Faisal said. ""When we arrived there were many dead and wounded. They sent us to the hospital. I also saw many dead bodies."" ""Every street you go, you hear people mourning the deaths of their beloved ones,"" a journalist in Paktika province told the BBC. Local farmer Alem Wafa cried as he told the BBC that official rescue teams had yet to reach the remote village of Gyan - one of the worst hit. ""There are no official aid workers, but people from neighbouring cities and villages came here to rescue people,"" he said. ""I arrived this morning, and I - myself - found 40 dead bodies."" Most of the dead, he said, were ""very young children"". The local hospital just did not have the capacity to deal with such a disaster, the farmer added. 'Every street you go you hear mourning' In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. ""We didn't have enough people and facilities before the earthquake, and now the earthquake has ruined the little we had,"" they said. ""I don't know how many of our colleagues are still alive."" Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. ""Many people are not aware of the well-being of their relatives because their phones are not working,"" he said. ""My brother and his family died, and I just learned it after many hours. Many villages have been destroyed."" Most of the casualties so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts in Paktika, a local doctor told the BBC. Local media site Etilaat-e Roz reported a whole village in Gayan had been destroyed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Decades of conflict have made it difficult for the impoverished country to improve its protections against earthquakes and other natural disasters - despite efforts by aid agencies to reinforce some buildings over the years. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Most recently,back-to-back earthquakes in the country's westin January killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of houses. TheTaliban run the country:The hardline Islamists took over Afghanistan last year, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition There's a food crisis:More than a third of people can't meet basic needs and the economy is struggling, as foreign aid and cash dried up when the Taliban took power Women's rights are restricted: They have been ordered to cover their faces in public and teenage girls have not been allowed to go to school Read more about Afghanistan Have you been affected by the earthquake?

Sunak defends likely pensions rise,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended restoring the triple lock, which could see pensions rise by 10% in line with inflation. It comes as the government warns workers not to expect pay rises to keep pace with increasing costs. Economist and Labour adviser Jim O'Neill said the ""constant protection of pensioners"" was ""ludicrous"". But Mr Sunak said pensioners were ""among the most vulnerable in society"" and needed to be protected. Inflation - the rate at which the price of things like food and fuel rise -has hit a 40-year highof 9.1% and the Bank of England has predicted it will grow to 11% later this year. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward Prices continue to rise at fastest rate for 40 years Strike talks resume as travellers face more delays Many trade unions have called for pay rises to help workers with increasing costs and the RMT union, which represents rail workers, are holding strikes in part to secure better wages. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%. Elsewhere barristers have voted to strike over pay and conditions, while two teaching unions are considering asking their members if they want to strike over pay. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was ""right that we reward our hard working public sector workers with a pay rise"" but added that it needed to be ""proportionate and balanced with the need not to make the inflationary pressures worse and what's affordable for the taxpayer"". He argued that it was right to restore the pensions triple lock, which ensures that the state pension will always increase each year in line with either inflation, the average wage increase or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. The triple lock was introduced in 2010 and the Conservatives promised in their 2019 election manifesto to keep it in place. However, the government suspended it for one year between 2022-2023 citing the pressures of the pandemic on public finances. Downing Street has confirmed that the triple lock will be restored. The rise will match the inflation rate in September but will only be paid from April 2023. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Lord O'Neill - who served as a Treasury minister in a Conservative government but is now working on a review of business start-ups for Labour - said he had ""no idea"" why the triple lock had been restored. ""The constant protection of pensioners seems ludicrous in itself and in these circumstances is particularly crazy,"" he said. Mr Sunak said the government had provided a support package which was ""generous and well-targeted at those who need our help"". He said the ""most vulnerable in our society"" would receive Â£1,200 of support adding: ""There is help available for everyone."" He also argued that pension increases would not add to inflation in the same way as pay rises. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, former Conservative Chancellor Ken Clarke said the government should: ""Stop giving me money."" ""I've got Â£1,100 out of the latest package from the government - it's absurd, I've got two houses... I don't need it."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said Lord Clarke could ""send a cheque back to HMRC if he feels that strongly about it"". Asked if the triple lock was motivated by the fact that older people are more likely to vote, Ms Coffey said: ""When politicians make a decisions we think about the individuals, we think about the people who are worried if they have enough money to heat their homes."" The UK's welfare bill of about Â£250bn a year is always going to be a hotly-debated political issue - but, at its heart, it remains vital to the everyday finances of millions of people. The basic state pension in the UK is far from the most generous compared with entitlements in other European countries, although the Pension Credit top-up does assist lower-income pensioners. A potential double-digit increase in April for pensions and benefits may raise eyebrows, but it still reflects the higher prices people will be paying for many months beforehand. That is why there had been calls tobring forward part of this increaseto tackle the financial strain being felt now. Instead, the chancellor decided ona system of targeted cash paymentsaimed at helping households cover energy bills and the soaring cost of living in general.

'My kids cried every night asking if we'd die',"This video can not be played Marta Burak is one of more than 220 Ukrainian refugees living at a Welsh government centre It's having her children not crying every night and asking if they will be killed is why Kateryna Halenda knows it was the right call to flee Ukraine. Leaving a country torn apart by war may seem like an easy decision but husband Oleh had to persuade her to leave with their two young children because she didn't want to leave him behind. Kateryna now knows she and her kids are safe but still gets mobile phone alerts when air raids are happening back home. Her worries remain, hoping Oleh is ok. The 32-year-old teacher and her two sons Oleksander, nine, and four-year-old Artem are three of the more thanfive million refugees to have fled Ukrainewhile worried about the family they've left behind. For many like Kateryna and her two boys, they lived in shelters or blacked out windows of their homes back in Ukraine due to the war Ukrainian families who didn't know each other before arriving in Wales are supporting each other through their move to the UK But unlike many of the60,000 Ukrainian refugeesthat have arrived in the UK since Russia invaded Ukraine, Kateryna and her boys have not been taken in by kind families wanting to help. They are one of 60 families who are in a unique Ukrainian community thousands of miles from their homeland in a specialist camp - offering a place to stay, food, education and advice - in the sanctuary of Wales. 'Children drank rainwater from puddles to survive' 'The war has destroyed three generations' Ukraine war could last for years, warns Nato chief ""It's like a big family here. we're all looking out for each other,"" said Kateryna. ""We were amazed when we came here. It's very new but they're now completely happy, they're playing with other children every day and going to school every day. And they feel safe here - and that's important."" Parents who couldn't let their children outside for the fear of Russian bombing can now let their kids play in safety Kateryna is one of 222Ukrainian refugees at the camprun the the Welsh youth organisationUrdd Gobaith Cymru,externaland supported by the Welsh government where more than 100 children displaced from home can now play and learn safely. Yet while their parents and grandparents enjoy this haven from war, home and family is never far from their thoughts - and that explains why they didn't escape Ukraine sooner. Children staying at the centre get opportunities to try out everything from go-karting to rope climbing. ""We waited for 100 days because we didn't want to leave at first but my husband made us go,"" said Kateryna. ""It wasn't safe. We were just so often in our basement because of those air raid sirens all of the time, including at night when I had to wake up my kids. ""But we decided to leave just to find a safe place for my kids."" Four-year-old Artem and Oleksander, 9, miss their dad Oleh who has to remain in Ukraine Kateryna didn't know Olena Andrshchuk before they arrived at the centre in Wales two weeks ago. But now the mums have become friends and support each other with their husbands still back in Ukraine. How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? Fears over lack of homes for Ukrainian refugees Olena's husband Pavlo also made his wife leave their home in the capital Kyiv for the safety of her and their two children. ""It's still not safe,"" said the 36-year-old website content writer. With a heavy heart, Olena left her husband behind in Ukraine to flee to Wales with their two children ""The very day we were leaving, very close to where we live I woke up in the middle of the night because of really big bombing. ""It still wasn't an easy decision to leave because I still had to leave my home town, my husband, everything I have - but I left for my kids."" Ukraine war in maps: Battles raging in the east 'Ukraine war means I'll miss my son's wedding' 'I keep telling them, time will come when we meet' Olena says she ""loves"" it in Wales and likens the centre to a ""holiday resort"" with lots of new friends with shared experiences - but the harsh reminders of what's happening at home aren't too far away. ""I have an app on my phone and I still get the alert for the sirens in Ukraine and they are quite frequent,"" said Kateryna, whose husband Oleh is a volunteer back in their home city of Ternopil in western Ukraine. Activities and learning and now part of these Ukrainian children's day once again ""So I know when to call my husband to ask how he is."" The Urdd centre normally hosts Welsh schools but its Ukrainian children who have been living, learning, and laughing in this small corner of the Welsh countryside for the last two months - enjoying the fact they're free to simply play and have fun safely again. ""My kids didn't attend school for up to three months because it wasn't safe,"" said Kateryna. ""But now they're happy as they go to school every day and feel safe."" Children at the centre can play with kids of their own age safely free from the horrors of war Olena agreed as her youngest Leonard, aged four, struggled with a lack of social interaction with children of his own age because most were kept inside because people were ""too afraid"" to let them play outside with air raid sirens bellowing all around. ""It was a big problem for my little one back in Ukraine,"" she said. ""Now we've come here, the kids can socialise, communicate with each other and they're open to all kinds of activities, which they were missing for so long so they just they're happy. For mums like Olena and Kateryna, who've had to leave their husbands behind in Ukraine, they get support to help find work and access benefits and healthcare. ""Of course they are missing their father and grandparents but this is the better reality than what we had in Ukraine."" While the children enjoy there are daily lessons - in English and Welsh - and a world of activities, their parents can concentrate on finding work, accessing benefits and figuring out where they go next. All of that expert help for refugee families is provided on-site in a one-stop shop that also offered health checks to everyone that arrived - much to the delight of grandmother Marta Burak. ""I was so happy because my grandson was tested for an illness here that we were not able to do back at home,"" said the 64-year-old retired teacher. ""Now he's on three months medication. That was very important for me."" New UK Army chief issues Russia rallying cry How many Ukrainian refugees now have UK visas? Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone? While her daughter Khrystyna gets intensive English lessons provided by the local college, Marta, who is in her fifth week in the centre, is getting help and advice from on-site authorities to remain in the UK. ""While we are doing the necessary legal things to stay in the UK, we would love to stay here forever,"" she said. ""But one day, we'll have to move on."" Yet Marta says ""while half of her heart is in Wales, half is left in Ukraine"". The Welsh Government Welcome Centre at the Urdd camp sees the blue and yellow Ukraine flag flying alongside the Welsh dragon ""My son, my daughter-in-law and my son-in law remain in Ukraine and my grandchildren miss their father every day. ""They cannot properly speak with him because they start crying but we are safe here, that is the most important thing. ""Yesterday I got such sad news because the only son of my friend's family got killed and he was only 30. He was such a handsome, positive young man and it is sad young people are still dying in this war and this must be stopped."" Marta loves her new life in Wales but she is worried about her family back in war-torn Ukraine Home is never far people's thoughts but the support of locals draping Ukrainian flags in their windows gives the refugees hope. And in the camp car park there are a handful of cars with Ukrainian registration plates while one family had to drive through Russia in order to avoid fighting on the frontline before eventually finding their way to Wales. People inWales have so far raised millions of poundsfor theUkraine humanitarian fund,externaland Wales has housedmore than 2,500 refugees,external, Marta met Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford on a his visit to meet the refugees and see their camp The Welsh government has directly sponsored nearly 3,000 people to come to Wales and most are yet to arrive butthe scheme has been pausedto allow people to move on from their 'welcome centres'. Mark Drakeford wants Wales to be a ""nation of sanctuary"" and to help Ukrainian refugees ""re-establish their lives"". But Wales' first minister acknowledged the ""challenge for the coming weeks"" is to help more people leave the centre and into more permanent placements so more refugees can be housed and helped. ""Our focus has been on the arrival of people but now we have 4,000 people wanting to come to Wales when we originally expected 1,000,"" he said on a visit to the camp. ""We've got to focus on people moving on from our centres so there are long-term prospects for people who are here temporarily.""

Inflation pressures squeezing food producers,"Victoria Shervington-Jones says she has never seen pressures like she's experiencing now Soaring costs are threatening to put some Welsh food producers out of business, farmers have warned. Thelatest inflation rate figuresshow prices are now rising by 9.1% in the year up to May, their highest level for 40 years. The knock-on effect is being felt by producers, and egg farmer Victoria Shervington-Jones warned of shortages of eggs as farms go bust. A supermarket boss said shoppers were buying less as prices rise. Prices of fuel and food are affecting household budgets, but the same pressures are hitting farmers as they rear animals and grow crops. Fertiliser, animal feed and diesel costs mean some farmers are losing thousands of pounds a month, while some are planning to produce less food in order to offset their rising bills. Rising costs for chicken feed is one of the issues At St Brides Wentloog, near Newport, there are almost 40,000 hens laying eggs at the farm run by Ms Shervington-Jones. They produce almost as many eggs every day, which are delivered to restaurants, supermarkets, corner shops and hotels, including the Celtic Manor. ""I've been running it for 15 years now,"" Ms Shervington-Jones said. ""I inherited it when my dad passed away. I've been here all my life."" But the farm has never known price pressures like those seen currently. ""Our three biggest increased costs at the moment would be diesel, packaging and chicken feed,"" she said. ""Chicken feed has doubled in the last year. Diesel is just ridiculous, and our electricity to run the chicken sheds - it is quite frightening how much everything has gone up recently."" Food bills are set to soar by Â£380 this year People cut back on food and fuel as prices rise Three things we're cutting back on as prices rise Why are prices rising so quickly? The price of an egg has not risen as much as the costs facing Victoria and other farmers, and the only option facing some farms is to spend less and cut production. ""We've just got to ride it out, hope it improves, and that we can survive on the other side,"" she said. Ms Shervington-Jones fears other farms may not last as long. She said: ""There are a lot of egg producers going out of business at the moment because they can't afford to keep going. ""So there's an anticipated shortage of eggs in the autumn, and meat and other things within the industry. There will be shortages on the shelves, but by the time it gets there, it will be too late to do anything about it by then."" Prices are already rising in supermarkets, though not by enough to cover the costs facing the producers. The latest figures released on Wednesday show UK inflation edged up to 9.1% in the 12 months to May, up from 9% in April, and is now at the highest level since March 1982. The Bank of England has warned inflation will reach 11% later this year. Caroline Hull says customers have been understanding Caroline Hull works on a farm in Llanllechid near Bethesda, Gwynedd, and helps to grow, harvest and deliver boxes of vegetables to people nearby. Customers vary between young students in Bangor to vulnerable, elderly people in more remote areas. Ms Hull said: ""I have mentioned that we have had rising costs, and they know that it is across the board. ""We have tried to keep our costs down for the customer, but they have been very understanding. ""It is just the way that it is at the moment, isn't it?"" Her boss, Chris Jones, has had to increase the cost of a box of vegetables by Â£1 this year. The price of a box has only risen by Â£3 in the past 10 years, but this year the cost of fuel and fertiliser has forced the farm to pass on some of the expense to customers. ""Fertiliser has gone up 300%, diesel in the vans is horrendous,"" Mr Jones said. He has doubled the wages he pays to Caroline, who is his only member of staff, and will try to absorb around half of the increased costs his farm is facing. ""We had to do something this year to survive. We have built up the business, no grant aid, all by ourselves. So we don't want to lose it,"" he said. At Filco in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, the price of milk is reviewed every four weeks, as the company has to support its suppliers while keeping prices low for customers. ""We get regular and repeated requests for cost rises from suppliers, so it is a daily occurrence now. Some things will go up week to week,"" said Filco director Matthew Hunt. Mr Hunt said it was ""inevitable"" some of the increased costs would be passed on to customers. Spending patterns have changed, too. ""We are adjusting our ranges to suit the demand of the consumer,"" Mr Hunt added. The company tracks the average basket cost of its customers. ""That has been fairly steady, which suggests that there is actually a decline in the number of items in the basket because, as we know, prices have gone up,"" he added.

Rotherham abuse report branded a let-down,"Sammy Woodhouse, who was abused in Rotherham as a teenager, has criticised the new report A woman raped by Rotherham grooming gangs as a teenager says she is ""disgusted"" by the failure of a new report to hold any officers to account. The police watchdog's eight-year investigation criticises the South Yorkshire force's approach to the abuse of more than 1,400 girls in the town None of the 47 officers investigated were sacked due to the findings. Sammy Woodhouse, who was abused from age 14, said no-one had been held to account despite ""report after report"". The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) was tasked with examining the force's response to organised sexual abuse between 1997 and 2013. A total of 47 current and former officers were investigated after the watchdog received 265 separate allegations from more than 50 complainants. It said its investigation, dubbed Operation Linden, was one of the ""largest and most complex"" it had ever undertaken, second only to its investigations into policing of the Hillsborough stadium disaster. It followed areport by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, which detailed how girls as young as 11 were raped, trafficked, abducted, beaten and intimidated, predominantly by men of Pakistani-heritage. 'I don't tell people I'm from Rotherham' How we got here: Rotherham abuse scandal 'We became known as terrorists and groomers' IOPC investigators have found there were ""systemic problems"" within South Yorkshire Police that meant ""like other agencies in Rotherham at that time, it was simply not equipped to deal with the abuse and organised grooming of young girls on the scale we encountered"". In one illustrative example, the watchdog said one parent concerned about a missing daughter said an officer told them ""it was a 'fashion accessory' for girls in Rotherham to have an 'older Asian boyfriend' and that she would grow out of it"". Criticisms in the new report include a failure by police to recognise children and young people as victims, and a willingness by officers to accept what they were told by suspects at face value. This was echoed by Ms Woodhouse, who said police had ""missed opportunities"" to stop her abuser, who was later jailed for 35 years. ""If they would have acted when I was making statements at 16 it could have prevented other people from even being abused,"" she said. ""The fact that they were ignoring it for so long just encouraged him, not just him but other people."" South Yorkshire Police failed to grasp the scale of child sex abuse in Rotherham, a report has found Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings said the report failed to ""identify individual accountability"" and contained ""few new findings"" despite years of ""costly investigations"". Investigators also found: The small team investigating the abuse had inadequate resources and was sometimes overwhelmed A failure to recognise children and young people as victims, and viewing them as ""consenting"" to their own exploitation Failures to understand that children being groomed and abused did not always view themselves as victims Officers showed a ""lack of professional curiosity"" by accepting at face value what they were told by perpetrators and victims A lack of awareness meant officers showed insufficient empathy towards survivors Performance targets at the time prioritised burglary and vehicle crime ""at the expense of other types of crimes including child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSA/E)"" The report also identified ""ineffective working with other agencies"" and an unwillingness to pursue cases where the victim did not make a complaint to police because ""the feeling was there would be insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution"". It also criticised the computer system used to share intelligence as being ""not fit for purpose"". ""We found many instances where crimes were not recorded when they should have been, including reports of sexual assault and sexual activity with a child,"" the report said. In a foreword IOPC director general Michael Lockwood said it made ""uncomfortable reading"". ""No child, or young person can ever consent to their own abuse or exploitation, nor should be seen as bringing matters upon themselves. Your protection should not have be seen as a lesser policing priority,"" he wrote. One survivor, who was abused from the age of 14, told the IOPC  she came into contact with police officers ""three or four times a week"". ""When I look back now I can't believe how many times I came into contact with the police and how many chances they had to question me... but didn't,"" she told investigators. Another said: ""I was told repeatedly by the police that I was responsible for my own actions, allowing myself to be a victim."" Ms Woodhouse recalled one instance when police found her at a flat after being reported missing from home. She said officers ""told me to write a note to him to tell him where I was because they didn't want him to worry about me"".""I would have contact with the police on a daily basis,"" she said ""I was never treated as a victim I was treated as somebody who was his mistress, his girlfriend  as somebody who was part of his gang. I was victim blamed."" The IOPC made 13 recommendations, including improved training and support for officers. South Yorkshire Police said it accepted the findings and was ""deeply sorry"", adding: ""Victims deserved better from us."" Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings said he was disappointed that ""eight years of costly investigations"" had resulted in ""few new findings or accountability"". He said most of the report's recommendations had been made and implemented after previous investigations, and that the latest had failed ""to identify any individual accountability"". ""As a result, it lets down victims and survivors,"" he said. The watchdog also upheld 43 complaints against individual officers, with eight facing misconduct and six facing gross misconduct charges. Following disciplinary hearings held by the force,no officers have lost their jobs or faced criminal charges. Ms Woodhouse said she was angered by ""the fact that all this has happened and not one person will ever be held to account on a professional level"". ""Lives have been ruined. Nothing can happen to replace all the damage that's been done. We're just left to get on with things,"" she said. ""I feel like they've chucked us a little bit of money in compensation. Police officers have just retired, if anything they've been rewarded."" Dr Billings said it was unfair for officers to have had allegations of misconduct ""hanging over them for so long"", but said the force was now ""on a path of continuous improvement"". ""We are committed to supporting victims of child sexual exploitation and abuse, listening to their accounts and gathering evidence for consideration of prosecution by the CPS, no matter how long or how challenging investigations are."" The pledge from the National Crime Agency which is currently working to bring the Rotherham perpetrators to justice. Its team, headed by senior investigating officer, Philip Marshall, is probing crimes which, in some cases, go back 25 years. Known as Operation Stovewood, it's the single largest law enforcement investigation into non-familial child sexual exploitation and abuse in the UK. The Stovewood team is looking at allegations in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. The South Yorkshire force, heavily criticised by the police watchdog for its failings over Rotherham, is funding Stovewood. But it's the National Crime Agency which has the twin tasks of winning the trust of victims and putting the abusers behind bars. So far Stovewood has seen 20 sex offenders convicted and jailed for a total of 256 years. More than two hundred people have been arrested or attended a police station voluntarily. Four are awaiting trial. They include two brothers, in their thirties, who made their first court appearance earlier this month. They are charged with raping and sexually assaulting three girls - aged 13 to 15 - between 2006 and 2009. The National Crime Agency says that in some cases it's been engaging with victims for years and there are around 40 separate Stovewood investigations. Its prioritising those who have caused the most harm in the past and - disturbingly - those who may still be active in Rotherham or elsewhere. It acknowledges that one of its key tasks is ""to work with local partners and communities to rebuild public confidence in agencies."" This report by the police watchdog underlines the scale of the challenge. The town's Labour MP Sarah Champion said the report ""lays bare the appalling systemic failures at South Yorkshire Police"". 'It has taken eight long years, but the truth is now out for all to see,"" she said. ""I know from conversations with survivors of abuse that their main motivation for engaging with this process was to ensure that no other children will be put through the hell they endured. We owe it to them now to make certain that that is the case."" She added: ""South Yorkshire Police has improved, but there is still a long way to go before trust is rebuilt, ensuring the people of South Yorkshire have confidence in their police force again."" Sarah Champion said South Yorkshire Police needed to rebuild trust In response to the report, Deputy Chief Constable Tim Forber said: ""We let victims of CSE down. We failed to recognise their vulnerability and failed to see them as victims, for that I am deeply sorry. ""They deserved better from us. ""The brave accounts of these girls caused a seismic change in policing crimes of this nature for South Yorkshire Police and the wider police service.""

"Glastonbury opens as fans endure travel disruptionWorthy Farm will welcome more than 200,000 festival-goers, but some have had to change their plans.Entertainment & Arts","The sun shone as fans arrived on Wednesday - but rain could arrive in the coming days Fans are descending on the Glastonbury Festival for the first time in three years, although travel disruption has caused problems for some. More than 200,000 festival-goers will arrive at Worthy Farm in Somerset for the event, headlined by Billie Eilish, Sir Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar. But train travel has been hindered by a strike on Tuesday, with two more planned for Thursday and Saturday. One fan, Sarah Hogg, said she was now ""nervous"" about making the trip. The 33-year-old from Newcastle had booked a seat on a train to London on Thursday morning, which would have got her there in time to catch a pre-booked coach to the festival. But she's now going to have to leave after work on Wednesday evening to get the last train to London, where she'll then have to crash on a friend's sofa. Allow Twitter content?

Sarah's slickly-planned journey has turned into a 24-hour endurance test, involving an extra day hanging around in London. ""It's made me incredibly nervous about it and it's just added stress. ""It wasn't that long ago when they announced that this [strike] was all happening, at a point where everyone who's going to the festival had already planned how to get there. ""I'm not particularly happy about it, but come hell or high water I will get myself to Worthy Farm."" Is it worth the added stress and cost? ""Of course,"" said the seven-time Glastonbury ticket-holder. ""It's my favourite place on this planet."" Sarah Hogg (left) has been to Glastonbury six times before but has had to change her plans to make it to this year's event Festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis were there to greet festival-goers, many of whom had queued outside since Tuesday, as the gates opened at 08:00 BST on Wednesday. Emily said it had been quite an ""emotional"" morning, after the pandemic put paid to the event for the past two years. ""It's more spectacular this year,"" she told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson. ""The wait has been so long and it's just the biggest build-up we've ever had. The festival is the brainchild of father and daughter team Michael and Emily Eavis ""Everyone's feeling very happy and a little bit emotional about opening the gates."" Her father, the festival's founder, agreed, saying: ""It's all so exciting, you'd never believe it."" However, another possible worry could be the weekend's weather afterthe Met Office issued a yellow weather warning,externalfor thunderstorms and torrential downpours across southern England, including the festival site in Pilton, which could lead to flooding in some places. BBC Weather forecast for Glastonbury Festival Follow Glastonbury from home on the BBC Rail strike: When is it and which trains are running? Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton, south London, has been to Glastonbury ""five or six times"" and usually gets the train to Castle Cary, the closest station to the Somerset festival, on the Thursday. Like Sarah, he bought his tickets in late 2019 and kept hold of them, as the summer event was postponed twice due to Covid. There were long queues to get into the site on Wednesday morning Now that it's finally here, the McCartney fan and his friends will have to take an extra day off work, spend more cash and go the long way around in order to avoid disruption. ""It's annoying but I'm just going to stay positive at the moment,"" he said. ""I'm generally supportive of the strike but I'd prefer it if it wasn't this week. ""It will cost me more, and it's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this, I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money."" Early arrivals are spending Wednesday setting up camp Allan Clifford, a teacher from Leeds, is still hoping to get to Glastonbury on Thursday but has had to rethink his plans. He was a regular at the festival when he was younger and was looking forward to channelling his inner ""hippy"" once again in his 50s, but wasn't sure how he would get there because of the rail strikes. That was until ""a wonderful and generous person called Alice, who I've never met before, offered to let me hop in her car and drive down with her"". ""What has happened is a lot of people getting online and organising car shares,"" he explained. Traffic en route to the festival site Those arriving on Wednesday are spending the day setting up camp, with a number of smaller stages - particularly dance areas - opening on Thursday, before the main stages get going on Friday. One of the bands Allan had been looking forward to seeing, The Damned, were forced on Tuesday to cancel their headline slot on Glastonbury's Avalon Stage due to Covid, but he said he won't let that news dampen his spirits, with 3,000 acts to choose from across the weekend. They will include The Kalush Orchestra, winners of the recent Eurovision Song Contest, for what will be the Ukrainian collective's first ever UK performance. Festival lover attends his 35th Glastonbury Glastonbury Festival reveals 2022 line-up At 07:00 on Wednesday, Travel Somerset reported it was taking 28 minutes to reach the festival site from Castle Cary station. It said it expected travellers to take an hour from the A361/A39 Pipers Inn, and 28 minutes from the A37/A39 Rush Hill, while for those travelling from A303 Podimore to Pylle the journey would be 18 minutes. Glastonbury is by no means the only major music event affected by the travel disruption. The Rolling Stones will play at London's Hyde Park this weekend as part of its British Summer Time series, Green Day will perform in Huddersfield and London, and Ed Sheeran will walk out at Wembley Stadium. California funk rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers also have gigs in Manchester and London over the coming days. Jon Collins, chief executive of Live, which represents the UK's live music sector, is warning fans to beware of ""severe delays and potential safety risks"" when taking alternative routes. ""This is one of the biggest weekends of the year for live music fans, with Glastonbury and British Summer Time both taking place for the first time in three years,"" he said. While his organisation does ""recognise the legitimacy"" of the strike action, Mr Collins stressed that the recently resurrected sector ""is facing a perfect storm of fragile consumer confidence, rising costs, inflation and supply chain issues, meaning we frankly cannot take the impact of further strikes threatened this autumn"".

"Rail strike on Thursday to go ahead, says union","Stations opened later than usual on Wednesday with only 60% of normal services running A second day of rail strikes is under way after talks between the RMT union and railway employers broke down. The RMT accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of ""wrecking"" negotiations by refusing to allow Network Rail to withdraw redundancy threats. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", adding the union was solely to blame for the ""massive disruption"". Thursday's strike is set to have a similar impact as Tuesday's, with just 20% of services running. Millions were affected on Tuesday at the start of the largest strike in decades. Another walkout is due on Saturday. The second day of strikes will see half of the rail network in Britain closed. In London, there are no strikes taking place on the Tube network, though operator TFL has warned of disruption to some services, including the London Overground. It comes as the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms across much of southern England, potentially adding to disruption. What days are the strikes and which trains are running? The breakdown in talks between the RMT and rail companies led to recriminations between the union and the government. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers' union, claimed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had ""wrecked"" negotiations by not allowing Network Rail to withdraw its letter threatening redundancy for 2,900 of our members. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", saying he had no involvement in the letter. The Department of Transport has said the rail industry is leading the negotiations, but a contract seen by the BBC says that train operating companies' handling of strike action is ""subject to the secretary of state's direction"". A Network Rail source told the BBC little progress was made in Wednesday's talks, with the union's position appearing to have hardened. No new pay offer was made. Disruption for millions on rail strike's first day Fans descend on Glastonbury amid travel disruption 'Why I'm losing my wages to go on strike' Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Both sides in this dispute insist that in recent days they had thought progress was being made. But Wednesday's talks again ended without an agreement. As things stand, a deal to avert the third strike going ahead on Saturday isn't looking particularly likely. The RMT union says that in talks, it asked Network Rail to withdraw Monday's letter about pressing ahead with a formal consultation over changes to working practices in maintenance teams - which would entail redundancies. A source at Network Rail, which maintains and operates the tracks, described this as a ""red herring"". They insisted the letter could be ripped up if the union would properly negotiate on the reforms. There wasn't a new pay offer yesterday. So far, both train companies and Network Rail have offered an unconditional 2%, with a further 1% conditional on accepting changes they say are necessary to modernise ways of working. Meanwhile, passengers face another day of travel misery. More rail commuters can switch to working from home than would have been possible in the past, but not everyone has that option and many plans will be disrupted. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the cost of living crisis, as inflation hits 9.1% and is forecast to reach 11% in the autumn. Employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition that the union accepts new working practices. But rail employers said they had suffered a loss of income, with passenger numbers only at 80% of pre-pandemic levels. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, said it wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"", which meant modernising the railway to attract passengers back. On Tuesday, the prime minister urged the country to ""stay the course"" and resist high pay rises he said could further fuel inflation. Services started later than normal on Wednesday as trains were delayed depots On Tuesday about 40,000 RMT members working for Network Rail walked out, leaving many parts of the country with no rail service at all. Disruption continued on Wednesday, with only about 60% of normal services running. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson and the transport secretary of not ""lifting a finger"" to stop the strikes. Mr Johnson responded that the government was doing ""everything we can to prevent these strikes"" and it was up to the railway companies to negotiate. Meanwhile, the government is planning to introduce a new law this week to make itlegal for employers to bring in agency staff to replace striking workers- but it will not impact the planned rail strikes on Thursday and Saturday.

Glastonbury opens as fans endure travel disruption,"The sun shone as fans arrived on Wednesday - but rain could arrive in the coming days Fans are descending on the Glastonbury Festival for the first time in three years, although travel disruption has caused problems for some. More than 200,000 festival-goers will arrive at Worthy Farm in Somerset for the event, headlined by Billie Eilish, Sir Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar. But train travel has been hindered by a strike on Tuesday, with two more planned for Thursday and Saturday. One fan, Sarah Hogg, said she was now ""nervous"" about making the trip. The 33-year-old from Newcastle had booked a seat on a train to London on Thursday morning, which would have got her there in time to catch a pre-booked coach to the festival. But she's now going to have to leave after work on Wednesday evening to get the last train to London, where she'll then have to crash on a friend's sofa. Allow Twitter content?

Sarah's slickly-planned journey has turned into a 24-hour endurance test, involving an extra day hanging around in London. ""It's made me incredibly nervous about it and it's just added stress. ""It wasn't that long ago when they announced that this [strike] was all happening, at a point where everyone who's going to the festival had already planned how to get there. ""I'm not particularly happy about it, but come hell or high water I will get myself to Worthy Farm."" Is it worth the added stress and cost? ""Of course,"" said the seven-time Glastonbury ticket-holder. ""It's my favourite place on this planet."" Sarah Hogg (left) has been to Glastonbury six times before but has had to change her plans to make it to this year's event Festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis were there to greet festival-goers, many of whom had queued outside since Tuesday, as the gates opened at 08:00 BST on Wednesday. Emily said it had been quite an ""emotional"" morning, after the pandemic put paid to the event for the past two years. ""It's more spectacular this year,"" she told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson. ""The wait has been so long and it's just the biggest build-up we've ever had. The festival is the brainchild of father and daughter team Michael and Emily Eavis ""Everyone's feeling very happy and a little bit emotional about opening the gates."" Her father, the festival's founder, agreed, saying: ""It's all so exciting, you'd never believe it."" However, another possible worry could be the weekend's weather afterthe Met Office issued a yellow weather warning,externalfor thunderstorms and torrential downpours across southern England, including the festival site in Pilton, which could lead to flooding in some places. BBC Weather forecast for Glastonbury Festival Follow Glastonbury from home on the BBC Rail strike: When is it and which trains are running? Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton, south London, has been to Glastonbury ""five or six times"" and usually gets the train to Castle Cary, the closest station to the Somerset festival, on the Thursday. Like Sarah, he bought his tickets in late 2019 and kept hold of them, as the summer event was postponed twice due to Covid. There were long queues to get into the site on Wednesday morning Now that it's finally here, the McCartney fan and his friends will have to take an extra day off work, spend more cash and go the long way around in order to avoid disruption. ""It's annoying but I'm just going to stay positive at the moment,"" he said. ""I'm generally supportive of the strike but I'd prefer it if it wasn't this week. ""It will cost me more, and it's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this, I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money."" Early arrivals are spending Wednesday setting up camp Allan Clifford, a teacher from Leeds, is still hoping to get to Glastonbury on Thursday but has had to rethink his plans. He was a regular at the festival when he was younger and was looking forward to channelling his inner ""hippy"" once again in his 50s, but wasn't sure how he would get there because of the rail strikes. That was until ""a wonderful and generous person called Alice, who I've never met before, offered to let me hop in her car and drive down with her"". ""What has happened is a lot of people getting online and organising car shares,"" he explained. Traffic en route to the festival site Those arriving on Wednesday are spending the day setting up camp, with a number of smaller stages - particularly dance areas - opening on Thursday, before the main stages get going on Friday. One of the bands Allan had been looking forward to seeing, The Damned, were forced on Tuesday to cancel their headline slot on Glastonbury's Avalon Stage due to Covid, but he said he won't let that news dampen his spirits, with 3,000 acts to choose from across the weekend. They will include The Kalush Orchestra, winners of the recent Eurovision Song Contest, for what will be the Ukrainian collective's first ever UK performance. Festival lover attends his 35th Glastonbury Glastonbury Festival reveals 2022 line-up At 07:00 on Wednesday, Travel Somerset reported it was taking 28 minutes to reach the festival site from Castle Cary station. It said it expected travellers to take an hour from the A361/A39 Pipers Inn, and 28 minutes from the A37/A39 Rush Hill, while for those travelling from A303 Podimore to Pylle the journey would be 18 minutes. Glastonbury is by no means the only major music event affected by the travel disruption. The Rolling Stones will play at London's Hyde Park this weekend as part of its British Summer Time series, Green Day will perform in Huddersfield and London, and Ed Sheeran will walk out at Wembley Stadium. California funk rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers also have gigs in Manchester and London over the coming days. Jon Collins, chief executive of Live, which represents the UK's live music sector, is warning fans to beware of ""severe delays and potential safety risks"" when taking alternative routes. ""This is one of the biggest weekends of the year for live music fans, with Glastonbury and British Summer Time both taking place for the first time in three years,"" he said. While his organisation does ""recognise the legitimacy"" of the strike action, Mr Collins stressed that the recently resurrected sector ""is facing a perfect storm of fragile consumer confidence, rising costs, inflation and supply chain issues, meaning we frankly cannot take the impact of further strikes threatened this autumn"".

Australian state bans display of Nazi swastika,"Australia has seen demonstrations for and against the far right in recent years Victoria has become Australia's first state to specifically ban the display of the Nazi swastika. Under a new law, people who intentionally exhibit the symbol face up to a year in jail or a A$22,000 (Â£12,300; $15,000) fine. Victorian Premier Dan Andrews said ""nobody has the right to spread racism, hate or anti-Semitism"". Like many places globally, Australia has seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents in recent times. Victoria already has anti-hate speech laws - but they have been criticised for having ""gaps"". A push for reform intensified in 2020 when a couple raised a swastika flag above their home, angering the local community. State officials called the new legislation a ""proud moment"".  Three other states have said they will introduce similar laws. ""The Nazi symbol glorifies one of the most hateful ideologies in history - its public display does nothing but cause further pain and division,"" said Victorian Attorney-General Jaclyn Symes in a statement. There are exemptions for showing the symbol in historical, educational and artistic contexts. It can also be used in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious contexts - as it has been for millennia. The world loved the swastika - until Nazis stole it The chilling day the swastika flew in Britain People will be prosecuted only if they defy a first request to remove the symbol. Anti-Defamation Commission chairman Dvir Abramovich - who campaigned for the law - called it a ""thunderous blow"" to the neo-Nazi movement. ""As our nation confronts the deep stain of a resurgent white-supremacist movement that peddles a dangerous and dehumanising agenda, this parliament has declared that the symbol of Nazism will never find a safe harbour in our state,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The number of anti-Semitic incidents around the world dramatically increased last year, according toa study by Tel Aviv University. Australia had 88 in one month alone - a national record. In 2020,Australia's intelligence chief warned of a ""real threat""to the country's security from neo-Nazis. He said ""small cells"" of right-wing extremists were meeting regularly to salute Nazi flags and share their ideology. Since the pandemic began, unions and others have also accused far-right groups of ""infiltrating"" large protests about lockdowns and other restrictions. The new laws will come into effect in six months.

"Powerful earthquake kills 1,000 in Afghanistan","This video can not be played Watch: People injured in the earthquake are rushed to a rescue helicopter A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC. The Taliban appealed for international help for the rescue effort as pictures showed landslides and ruined mud-built homes in the province of Paktika. The quake struck shortly after 01:30 (21:00 GMT Tuesday) as people slept. Hundreds of houses were destroyed by the magnitude 6.1 event, which occurred at a depth of 51km (32 miles). It is the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades and a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Taliban officials asked the UN to ""support them in terms of assessing the needs and responding to those affected"", Sam Mort from Unicef's Kabul unit told the BBC. The UK's special representative to Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, said the UK was in touch with the UN and was ""ready to contribute to the international response"". Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. Speaking to Reuters news agency, locals described horrific scenes of death and destruction in the aftermath of the late-night earthquake. ""The kids and I screamed,"" said Fatima. ""One of our rooms was destroyed. Our neighbours screamed and we saw everyone's rooms."" ""It destroyed the houses of our neighbours,"" Faisal said. ""When we arrived there were many dead and wounded. They sent us to the hospital. I also saw many dead bodies."" ""Every street you go, you hear people mourning the deaths of their beloved ones,"" a journalist in Paktika province told the BBC. Local farmer Alem Wafa cried as he told the BBC that official rescue teams had yet to reach the remote village of Gyan - one of the worst hit. ""There are no official aid workers, but people from neighbouring cities and villages came here to rescue people,"" he said. ""I arrived this morning, and I - myself - found 40 dead bodies."" Most of the dead, he said, were ""very young children"". The local hospital just did not have the capacity to deal with such a disaster, the farmer added. 'Every street you go you hear mourning' In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. ""We didn't have enough people and facilities before the earthquake, and now the earthquake has ruined the little we had,"" they said. ""I don't know how many of our colleagues are still alive."" Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. ""Many people are not aware of the well-being of their relatives because their phones are not working,"" he said. ""My brother and his family died, and I just learned it after many hours. Many villages have been destroyed."" Most of the casualties so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts in Paktika, a local doctor told the BBC. Local media site Etilaat-e Roz reported a whole village in Gayan had been destroyed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Decades of conflict have made it difficult for the impoverished country to improve its protections against earthquakes and other natural disasters - despite efforts by aid agencies to reinforce some buildings over the years. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Most recently,back-to-back earthquakes in the country's westin January killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of houses. TheTaliban run the country:The hardline Islamists took over Afghanistan last year, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition There's a food crisis:More than a third of people can't meet basic needs and the economy is struggling, as foreign aid and cash dried up when the Taliban took power Women's rights are restricted: They have been ordered to cover their faces in public and teenage girls have not been allowed to go to school Read more about Afghanistan Have you been affected by the earthquake?

NI economy UK's least impacted by Brexit - study,"Northern Ireland will be the UK regional economy least impacted by Brexit, partially due to the NI Protocol, new analysis has suggested. Researchers at the London School of Economics and the Resolution Foundationused modelling to estimate the longer-run impacts of Brexit.,external The model assesses the impact of post-Brexit trade barriers with the EU. It estimates the UK economy will be 1.3% smaller compared to no Brexit, with a 0.7% hit to the NI economy. However even without the protocol the impact on the Northern Ireland economy is smaller than the UK average. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods giving Northern Ireland manufacturers better access to the EU than companies in other parts of the UK. It also means there are checks and controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, leading to added cost and complexity for importing businesses. Economic models are tools which can help us to understand an economy and estimate the impact of different policies. They generally consist of a set of mathematical equations that describe a theory of economic behaviour. With any piece of economic modelling, the underpinning assumptions are key. So it's important to note that this new work is based on the current implementation of the protocol. This is a heavily mitigated version of the protocol compared to the one which was originally negotiated. So if the protocol was implemented in full it may produce a less favourable economic impact. The economic modelling attempts to assess the impact of those new GB-NI controls as currently being implemented. It finds that the hit to regional output ranges from almost 2% in the north east of England to 0.7% in Northern Ireland. It concludes that Northern Ireland ""looks set to fare less badly than most, driven by the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP) with total output declining by just 0.7% relative to the baseline"". ""When the NIP is removed, Northern Ireland falls to the fourth least affected, with an output shock of 1.1% which is still better than the UK average of 1.3%. ""For all other regions, the NIP has a very small positive effect, reducing the fall in output by approximately 0.01 percentage points."" This is the second piece of academic modelling that attempts to quantify the impact of Brexit and the protocol on the Northern Ireland economy. Brexit deal plan is economic vandalism - Irish PM Truss urges DUP to return to power sharing The earlier study by the Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI) at Strathclyde University assessed that Northern Ireland's economy would take a bigger hit than that suggested by the LSE/Resolution Foundation. It suggested that the hit would rangefrom 1.5% to 3.5%, with a central scenario of 2.6%, compared to no Brexit. The FAI work looked only at Northern Ireland and did not attempt to compare the impacts on other UK regions. A previous FAI study suggested the least damaging Brexit outcome for Northern Ireland would have been a soft Brexit for all of the UK. That 2019 study suggested a ""Norway-style"" arrangement for the whole of the UK would have would cost Northern Ireland's economy an estimated 1.1% of GDP compared with no Brexit. The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated that Brexit will reduce the UK's potential GDP by about 4% in the long term compared to no Brexit. The trade deal governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and was agreed by the UK government and the European Union following the Brexit vote in 2019. It was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland when the UK left the European Union. The protocol led to the creation of new goods checks at Northern Ireland sea ports on some products from Great Britain, effectively creating a new trade border in the Irish Sea. Unionist parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), argue that this has led to extra costs and unnecessary delays, as well as undermining the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

Joe Lycett police complaint came from Belfast show,"Lycett said the joke - which he considers one of his best - would remain in his routine A police complaint about a joke by comedian Joe Lycett was made in Belfast, it has emerged. The stand-up wrote in an Instagram post thata complaint was filed about a segment from one of his showsthat referenced a donkey, but did not identify where it was made. The Police Service of Northern Ireland  has confirmed it received a complaint after a show in Belfast on 8 June. Lycett performed at Belfast's Waterfront Hall on 8 and 10 June. The PSNI statement, first reported by journalist Amanda Ferguson, added that enquiries were made and no offences found. Lycett wrote in hisoriginal Instagram post,external: ""To be fair to them the fuzz were very nice about it all but felt they had a duty to investigate."" The 33-year-old comic, who is from Birmingham, said he was asked to explain the context of the joke to the police. He said the joke, which he considered ""one of the best I've ever written"", would remain in his routine and that he hoped the police were ""charmed and hopefully amused"" by his response. ""The tour continues until September, unless I am jailed,"" he wrote. He shared an image of the police statement telling him the matter was considered closed. Lycett has appeared in comedy shows including Taskmaster, 8 Out of 10 Cats and QI, and became known for his stand-up routines in which he would recall humorous email exchanges when handling issues such as parking fines and scammers. He went on to host a Channel 4 consumer rights show and also has performed a number of public stunts in recent years, includingstorming off the set of Steph's Packed Lunch in 2021andchanging his name to Hugo Bossin 2020.

More rail strikes are planned for Thursday and Saturday You can watch the debate by clicking on the play button at the top of the page Edited by Chris Giles & Nathan Williams Today's coverage was brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, James Harness, Sam Hancock, Jack Burgess, Adam Durbin, Chas Geiger, Richard Morris, Nathan Williams, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Chris Giles. We're closing this page shortly, but before we go here's a reminder of Justice Secretary Dominic Raab's proposed British Bill of Rights. Raab's statement: Labour's response:  More from the Commons now, where the MP for Dover and Deal has called for assurances that the new Bill of Rights will not allow the European Court to have as much ""overreach"" as she says it currently does. It comes after thecancellation of a Home Office refugee flight to Rwanda last week, following a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights. Tory MP Natalie Elphicke says the move ""raised considerable concerns in my constituency that it will simply encourage the people traffickers, people who have no respect for the rights of others, including human life or the laws of our land"". Raab responds by saying the ""real threat to human life is allowing - and not cracking down on - this trade in human misery"". He tells Elphicke the new bill will see UK courts diverge from those in Strasbourg. Chris MasonPolitical editor At the root of plenty of Conservative gripes about all this is the Human Rights Act introduced by Labour in 1998. It introduced the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. An organisation called the Council of Europe is behind the convention. It, confusingly, has nothing to do with the European Union. Labour's rationale at the time was that being subject to the convention without a domestic Human Rights Act meant the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, France, couldn't be moderated by the UK courts. But the government's rationale now is that the effect of the Human Rights Act has been to gold-plate the decisions of the court. Find out morehere. Former cabinet minister David Davis resigned as an MP in 2008 â to
force a by-election and a wider public debate about what he saw as the erosion
of civil liberties in the UK. He says the Bill of Rights will have to pass two Conservative tests. Can the powers of the state be curbed by an independent body? And can people's fundamental freedoms be protected by an independent judiciary? Mr Davis says this must mean that the new system will offer better protection of human rights than the current one. Dominic Raab says fundamental freedoms are not being trashed, but safeguarded; judicial independence is being strengthened; and democratic accountability is being increased because elected MPs will have the final say on matters of public policy. Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent The most significant new proposal in the Bill of Rights - to ignore European Court of Human Rights injunctions - follows last week's row over the Home Office's abandoned flight to Rwanda. The Strasbourg court, which is nothing to do with the European Union, issued an injunction blocking the home secretary from putting an asylum seeker on the flight, despite earlier decisions by judges in London not to intervene. That decision triggered other appeals and ultimately the cancellation of the flight. Under the government's proposed Bill of Rights, ministers would be able to ignore such injunctions, known as Rule 39 orders, because they are not technically part of international law. The government's proposals, unveiled in December, have been criticised by lawyers as confusing and arguably unnecessary, because British courts can already ignore rulings from Strasbourg. Raab described his proposals as a ""very British approach, a UK-wide approach to human rights"". He told the BBC the UK Supreme Court would not be ""subordinated to Strasbourg but has the last word on interpretation of law"". Read morehere Barry Sheerman, British Labour and Co-operative MP, has asked Dominic Raab to share ""the level of support he has got for this legislation from the people who will make it work - the lawyers, the judges"". Dominic Raab responds saying he doesn't believe there's any greater authority than Lord Sumption, former justice of the Supreme Court, or Jonathan Fisher QC. Laura Farris, Conservative MP for Newbury, quotes a letter from Raab saying the bill will prevent human rights being used to bring claims against overseas military operations. But she says some of the gravest crimes of the Iraq war were only revealed through recourse to the Human Rights Act in domestic courts - including cases of torture of detainees. She asks Raab if he's able to give reassurance that the new Bill of Rights will not suppress such abuses coming to light in future. Raab says we need to have proper accountability. But he says we have the international law of armed conflict for this purpose, and an extra tier of human rights obligations on top of that has been unhelpful and created legal uncertainty and uncertainty for our armed forces. He says the government will make sure there is accountability, but that the current situation has encouraged litigation, including spurious claims, as well as the cases she mentions. Back to the debate on new UK Bill of Rights. The SNP's Anne McLaughlin says the Bill is the culmination of
multiple pieces of human rights legislation in the last year - all about
""removing human rights from human beings"". She accuses the government of targeting - in turn - refugees,
those who question decisions by public bodies, voters less likely to vote
Conservative in the Elections Bill, and gypsy-Roma travellers. Ms McLaughlin says the Bill will force more people to seek justice in Strasbourg, and will be opposed by the Scottish and Welsh governments ""in its entirety"". Dominic Raab says no country is ""more big-hearted"" than the UK in helping those fleeing persecution, and cites recent schemes to take in refugees from Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Ukraine. He points out that when Boris Johnson addressed the Ukrainian parliament, Union flags were flying there. But, he adds, the government also has to stop the ""trade in human misery"" across the Channel, and to stand up for victims by deporting more foreign criminals. He says people in all UK nations should back this and what he describes as a ""common sense rebalancing of the system"". Let's get a full roundup of what was said at this week's PMQs. By-elections  Rail strikes  Bankers' bonuses  Inflation   Chris MasonPolitical editor What struck me today was the smorgasbord of topics that
were covered - not just in the exchanges between Sir Ker Starmer and the PM but
also the backbenches. There was also less prominence given to the rail strikes than
people may have expected. And what about Sir Keir Starmer's claim that Boris Johnson was
too busy holding meetings about ending the cap on bankers' bonuses to find time
for a meeting to end the rail strike? There is confusion around the legitimacy of these claims,
followingreports yesterday,external, and the
Treasury has said it's ""puzzled"". It seems this
issue is a little more complicated than some of the headlines connected to it. In case you missed Prime Minister's Questions, here's Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer going head-to-head. Johnson and Starmer paid tribute to the new Windrush Day monument and to the armed forces for their services to the country, then the debate quickly focused on the Wakefield by-election, rail strikes and the rising cost of living. This video can not be played Missed PMQs? Watch Johnson and Starmer battle it out Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she is ""disgusted"" by Ellie Reeves' comments about the government being soft on rapists. She says it's a ""shameful"" thing to say and undermines the confidence of women in the judicial system. We can be incredibly confident in the years and centuries of our UK judicial system to represent everybody in this country, she says. She also speaks of sadness that so many on the opposition benches would ""throw our sovereignty away to anyone who would have it"". Reeves says the Bill of Rights is not just an attack on victims of crime, it's an attack on women. Woman have used the Human Rights Act to challenge the police when they have failed or refused to investigate abuse or rape cases, she says. She says the government has ""effectively decriminalised rape"". It has made pitiful progress on record low rape convictions under this government, with waits for cases to complete in court reaching three or four years, and the number of rape trials postponed in crown courts rising four-fold, she says. This bill of rights will stop them for forcing our under-resourced police to investigate, she adds. The government is soft on rape, soft on rapists and hard on survivors, she says - ""they want to take away the final backstop available for victims to get justice"". This video can not be played Labour's Ellie Reeves: This is not a Bill of Rights, it's a con Labour call the Tory proposals to remove the Human Rights Act
""a gimmick"". Shadow justice minister Ellie Reeves calls the act, which was
introduced by Labour in 1998, ""a beacon of hope"" for those trampled
by strong men and dictators - and suggests the government's support for the beleaguered
people of Ukraine is hypocritical as it ""snatches rights away at
home"". Shadow justice minister, Labour's Ellie Reeves says this is a
dark day for victims of crime, for women, for people in care, for people who
rely on the state to protect them from harm. It's not a bill of rights it's a con, she says. We know it will take away the duty of the state to protect
everyone from harm by removing the positive obligations set out in the human
rights act. It will force victims of crime to schlep to Strasbourg, creating
endless delays and face red tape, she says. Under the Bill, Raab says, the behaviour of human rights claimants will be given greater weight by British courts - as will the public interest and the protection of the public. He says this will mean that more foreign offenders can be deported, especially those currently claiming the right to a family life. Reform of the parole system will also be made easier, he argues. Mr Raab says the Bill will strengthen the UK's ""proud tradition of freedom"", result in greater respect being shown for democratic institutions, and make Britain's streets safer. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: Expansions of human rights must be agreed by MPs The justice secretary says the tradition of human rights in the
UK stretches back to Magna Carta, not to the 1998 Human Rights Act. Dominic Raab says the European Court of Human Rights'
""elastic interpretation"" of the Act and an expansion in the scope of
its rulings have caused a variety of problems, not least a lack of democratic
oversight. He wants to reinforce ""quintessentially UK rights"" like
freedom of speech and jury trial. He says the Bill will make clear the supremacy of the UK Supreme
Court and its freedom to diverge from ECHR case law. Otherwise, asks Mr Raab,
what is the point of the Court? Parliament will have the ""last word""
on the ""laws of the land"", he adds.  Ahead of Justice Secretary Dominic Raab's statement on plans for a new UK bill of rights, Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsey Hoyle has admonished the government for again announcing policy in the media. In an uncharacteristically irate and emotional statement, Hoyle says he is once again ""extremely disappointed"" the plans to reform the role of European courts were sent to the press before informing MPs in the chamber. ""Why the BBC and Sky News is more important I will never know"", he says. Hoyle describes the situation as ""simply unacceptable"", given the requirement under the ministerial code to make important policy announcements in the Commons. ""Please, respect this house, respect members of every political party. They're elected to hear it here, not via the news,"" he adds before Raab gets up to speak. And with that, the PM's weekly question and answer session in the House of Commons has come to a close. We're now hearing from Justice Secretary Dominic Raab on the British Bill of Rights. He is presenting proposals that would override the power of the European Court of Human Rights. Â© 2025 BBC.

""Please, respect this house, respect members of every political party. They're elected to hear it here, not via the news,"" he adds before Raab gets up to speak. And with that, the PM's weekly question and answer session in the House of Commons has come to a close. We're now hearing from Justice Secretary Dominic Raab on the British Bill of Rights. He is presenting proposals that would override the power of the European Court of Human Rights. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Powerful earthquake kills 1,000 in AfghanistanThe country's deadliest quake in two decades struck overnight as many people slept in their beds.","This video can not be played Watch: People injured in the earthquake are rushed to a rescue helicopter A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC. The Taliban appealed for international help for the rescue effort as pictures showed landslides and ruined mud-built homes in the province of Paktika. The quake struck shortly after 01:30 (21:00 GMT Tuesday) as people slept. Hundreds of houses were destroyed by the magnitude 6.1 event, which occurred at a depth of 51km (32 miles). It is the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades and a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Taliban officials asked the UN to ""support them in terms of assessing the needs and responding to those affected"", Sam Mort from Unicef's Kabul unit told the BBC. The UK's special representative to Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, said the UK was in touch with the UN and was ""ready to contribute to the international response"". Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. Speaking to Reuters news agency, locals described horrific scenes of death and destruction in the aftermath of the late-night earthquake. ""The kids and I screamed,"" said Fatima. ""One of our rooms was destroyed. Our neighbours screamed and we saw everyone's rooms."" ""It destroyed the houses of our neighbours,"" Faisal said. ""When we arrived there were many dead and wounded. They sent us to the hospital. I also saw many dead bodies."" ""Every street you go, you hear people mourning the deaths of their beloved ones,"" a journalist in Paktika province told the BBC. Local farmer Alem Wafa cried as he told the BBC that official rescue teams had yet to reach the remote village of Gyan - one of the worst hit. ""There are no official aid workers, but people from neighbouring cities and villages came here to rescue people,"" he said. ""I arrived this morning, and I - myself - found 40 dead bodies."" Most of the dead, he said, were ""very young children"". The local hospital just did not have the capacity to deal with such a disaster, the farmer added. 'Every street you go you hear mourning' In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. ""We didn't have enough people and facilities before the earthquake, and now the earthquake has ruined the little we had,"" they said. ""I don't know how many of our colleagues are still alive."" Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. ""Many people are not aware of the well-being of their relatives because their phones are not working,"" he said. ""My brother and his family died, and I just learned it after many hours. Many villages have been destroyed."" Most of the casualties so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts in Paktika, a local doctor told the BBC. Local media site Etilaat-e Roz reported a whole village in Gayan had been destroyed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Decades of conflict have made it difficult for the impoverished country to improve its protections against earthquakes and other natural disasters - despite efforts by aid agencies to reinforce some buildings over the years. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Most recently,back-to-back earthquakes in the country's westin January killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of houses. TheTaliban run the country:The hardline Islamists took over Afghanistan last year, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition There's a food crisis:More than a third of people can't meet basic needs and the economy is struggling, as foreign aid and cash dried up when the Taliban took power Women's rights are restricted: They have been ordered to cover their faces in public and teenage girls have not been allowed to go to school Read more about Afghanistan Have you been affected by the earthquake?

Rotherham abuse report a let-down - police boss,"Sammy Woodhouse, who was abused in Rotherham as a teenager, has criticised the new report A woman raped by Rotherham grooming gangs as a teenager says she is ""disgusted"" by the failure of a new report to hold any officers to account. The police watchdog's eight-year investigation criticises the South Yorkshire force's approach to the abuse of more than 1,400 girls in the town None of the 47 officers investigated were sacked due to the findings. Sammy Woodhouse, who was abused from age 14, said no-one had been held to account despite ""report after report"". The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) was tasked with examining the force's response to organised sexual abuse between 1997 and 2013. A total of 47 current and former officers were investigated after the watchdog received 265 separate allegations from more than 50 complainants. It said its investigation, dubbed Operation Linden, was one of the ""largest and most complex"" it had ever undertaken, second only to its investigations into policing of the Hillsborough stadium disaster. It followed areport by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, which detailed how girls as young as 11 were raped, trafficked, abducted, beaten and intimidated, predominantly by men of Pakistani-heritage. 'I don't tell people I'm from Rotherham' How we got here: Rotherham abuse scandal 'We became known as terrorists and groomers' IOPC investigators have found there were ""systemic problems"" within South Yorkshire Police that meant ""like other agencies in Rotherham at that time, it was simply not equipped to deal with the abuse and organised grooming of young girls on the scale we encountered"". In one illustrative example, the watchdog said one parent concerned about a missing daughter said an officer told them ""it was a 'fashion accessory' for girls in Rotherham to have an 'older Asian boyfriend' and that she would grow out of it"". Criticisms in the new report include a failure by police to recognise children and young people as victims, and a willingness by officers to accept what they were told by suspects at face value. This was echoed by Ms Woodhouse, who said police had ""missed opportunities"" to stop her abuser, who was later jailed for 35 years. ""If they would have acted when I was making statements at 16 it could have prevented other people from even being abused,"" she said. ""The fact that they were ignoring it for so long just encouraged him, not just him but other people."" South Yorkshire Police failed to grasp the scale of child sex abuse in Rotherham, a report has found Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings said the report failed to ""identify individual accountability"" and contained ""few new findings"" despite years of ""costly investigations"". Investigators also found: The small team investigating the abuse had inadequate resources and was sometimes overwhelmed A failure to recognise children and young people as victims, and viewing them as ""consenting"" to their own exploitation Failures to understand that children being groomed and abused did not always view themselves as victims Officers showed a ""lack of professional curiosity"" by accepting at face value what they were told by perpetrators and victims A lack of awareness meant officers showed insufficient empathy towards survivors Performance targets at the time prioritised burglary and vehicle crime ""at the expense of other types of crimes including child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSA/E)"" The report also identified ""ineffective working with other agencies"" and an unwillingness to pursue cases where the victim did not make a complaint to police because ""the feeling was there would be insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution"". It also criticised the computer system used to share intelligence as being ""not fit for purpose"". ""We found many instances where crimes were not recorded when they should have been, including reports of sexual assault and sexual activity with a child,"" the report said. In a foreword IOPC director general Michael Lockwood said it made ""uncomfortable reading"". ""No child, or young person can ever consent to their own abuse or exploitation, nor should be seen as bringing matters upon themselves. Your protection should not have be seen as a lesser policing priority,"" he wrote. One survivor, who was abused from the age of 14, told the IOPC  she came into contact with police officers ""three or four times a week"". ""When I look back now I can't believe how many times I came into contact with the police and how many chances they had to question me... but didn't,"" she told investigators. Another said: ""I was told repeatedly by the police that I was responsible for my own actions, allowing myself to be a victim."" Ms Woodhouse recalled one instance when police found her at a flat after being reported missing from home. She said officers ""told me to write a note to him to tell him where I was because they didn't want him to worry about me"".""I would have contact with the police on a daily basis,"" she said ""I was never treated as a victim I was treated as somebody who was his mistress, his girlfriend  as somebody who was part of his gang. I was victim blamed."" The IOPC made 13 recommendations, including improved training and support for officers. South Yorkshire Police said it accepted the findings and was ""deeply sorry"", adding: ""Victims deserved better from us."" Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings said he was disappointed that ""eight years of costly investigations"" had resulted in ""few new findings or accountability"". He said most of the report's recommendations had been made and implemented after previous investigations, and that the latest had failed ""to identify any individual accountability"". ""As a result, it lets down victims and survivors,"" he said. The watchdog also upheld 43 complaints against individual officers, with eight facing misconduct and six facing gross misconduct charges. Following disciplinary hearings held by the force,no officers have lost their jobs or faced criminal charges. Ms Woodhouse said she was angered by ""the fact that all this has happened and not one person will ever be held to account on a professional level"". ""Lives have been ruined. Nothing can happen to replace all the damage that's been done. We're just left to get on with things,"" she said. ""I feel like they've chucked us a little bit of money in compensation. Police officers have just retired, if anything they've been rewarded."" Dr Billings said it was unfair for officers to have had allegations of misconduct ""hanging over them for so long"", but said the force was now ""on a path of continuous improvement"". ""We are committed to supporting victims of child sexual exploitation and abuse, listening to their accounts and gathering evidence for consideration of prosecution by the CPS, no matter how long or how challenging investigations are."" The pledge from the National Crime Agency which is currently working to bring the Rotherham perpetrators to justice. Its team, headed by senior investigating officer, Philip Marshall, is probing crimes which, in some cases, go back 25 years. Known as Operation Stovewood, it's the single largest law enforcement investigation into non-familial child sexual exploitation and abuse in the UK. The Stovewood team is looking at allegations in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. The South Yorkshire force, heavily criticised by the police watchdog for its failings over Rotherham, is funding Stovewood. But it's the National Crime Agency which has the twin tasks of winning the trust of victims and putting the abusers behind bars. So far Stovewood has seen 20 sex offenders convicted and jailed for a total of 256 years. More than two hundred people have been arrested or attended a police station voluntarily. Four are awaiting trial. They include two brothers, in their thirties, who made their first court appearance earlier this month. They are charged with raping and sexually assaulting three girls - aged 13 to 15 - between 2006 and 2009. The National Crime Agency says that in some cases it's been engaging with victims for years and there are around 40 separate Stovewood investigations. Its prioritising those who have caused the most harm in the past and - disturbingly - those who may still be active in Rotherham or elsewhere. It acknowledges that one of its key tasks is ""to work with local partners and communities to rebuild public confidence in agencies."" This report by the police watchdog underlines the scale of the challenge. The town's Labour MP Sarah Champion said the report ""lays bare the appalling systemic failures at South Yorkshire Police"". 'It has taken eight long years, but the truth is now out for all to see,"" she said. ""I know from conversations with survivors of abuse that their main motivation for engaging with this process was to ensure that no other children will be put through the hell they endured. We owe it to them now to make certain that that is the case."" She added: ""South Yorkshire Police has improved, but there is still a long way to go before trust is rebuilt, ensuring the people of South Yorkshire have confidence in their police force again."" Sarah Champion said South Yorkshire Police needed to rebuild trust In response to the report, Deputy Chief Constable Tim Forber said: ""We let victims of CSE down. We failed to recognise their vulnerability and failed to see them as victims, for that I am deeply sorry. ""They deserved better from us. ""The brave accounts of these girls caused a seismic change in policing crimes of this nature for South Yorkshire Police and the wider police service.""

Sunak defends likely pensions riseThere's criticism of the move as ministers warn workers not to expect pay rises to match increasing costs.,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended restoring the triple lock, which could see pensions rise by 10% in line with inflation. It comes as the government warns workers not to expect pay rises to keep pace with increasing costs. Economist and Labour adviser Jim O'Neill said the ""constant protection of pensioners"" was ""ludicrous"". But Mr Sunak said pensioners were ""among the most vulnerable in society"" and needed to be protected. Inflation - the rate at which the price of things like food and fuel rise -has hit a 40-year highof 9.1% and the Bank of England has predicted it will grow to 11% later this year. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward Prices continue to rise at fastest rate for 40 years Strike talks resume as travellers face more delays Many trade unions have called for pay rises to help workers with increasing costs and the RMT union, which represents rail workers, are holding strikes in part to secure better wages. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%. Elsewhere barristers have voted to strike over pay and conditions, while two teaching unions are considering asking their members if they want to strike over pay. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was ""right that we reward our hard working public sector workers with a pay rise"" but added that it needed to be ""proportionate and balanced with the need not to make the inflationary pressures worse and what's affordable for the taxpayer"". He argued that it was right to restore the pensions triple lock, which ensures that the state pension will always increase each year in line with either inflation, the average wage increase or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. The triple lock was introduced in 2010 and the Conservatives promised in their 2019 election manifesto to keep it in place. However, the government suspended it for one year between 2022-2023 citing the pressures of the pandemic on public finances. Downing Street has confirmed that the triple lock will be restored. The rise will match the inflation rate in September but will only be paid from April 2023. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Lord O'Neill - who served as a Treasury minister in a Conservative government but is now working on a review of business start-ups for Labour - said he had ""no idea"" why the triple lock had been restored. ""The constant protection of pensioners seems ludicrous in itself and in these circumstances is particularly crazy,"" he said. Mr Sunak said the government had provided a support package which was ""generous and well-targeted at those who need our help"". He said the ""most vulnerable in our society"" would receive Â£1,200 of support adding: ""There is help available for everyone."" He also argued that pension increases would not add to inflation in the same way as pay rises. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, former Conservative Chancellor Ken Clarke said the government should: ""Stop giving me money."" ""I've got Â£1,100 out of the latest package from the government - it's absurd, I've got two houses... I don't need it."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said Lord Clarke could ""send a cheque back to HMRC if he feels that strongly about it"". Asked if the triple lock was motivated by the fact that older people are more likely to vote, Ms Coffey said: ""When politicians make a decisions we think about the individuals, we think about the people who are worried if they have enough money to heat their homes."" The UK's welfare bill of about Â£250bn a year is always going to be a hotly-debated political issue - but, at its heart, it remains vital to the everyday finances of millions of people. The basic state pension in the UK is far from the most generous compared with entitlements in other European countries, although the Pension Credit top-up does assist lower-income pensioners. A potential double-digit increase in April for pensions and benefits may raise eyebrows, but it still reflects the higher prices people will be paying for many months beforehand. That is why there had been calls tobring forward part of this increaseto tackle the financial strain being felt now. Instead, the chancellor decided ona system of targeted cash paymentsaimed at helping households cover energy bills and the soaring cost of living in general.

The Glasgow vegan who teamed up with a Kardashian,"Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker posted photos to their millions of followers Ross Mackay set up his plant-based chicken substitute company in Glasgow four years ago but he is now based in California and working with famous influencer Kourtney Kardashian and her rock star husband Travis Barker. Ross says it has been two-and-a-half years since his mum and dad dropped him off at the airport and he went to the US in a bid to break into its lucrative meat-free food market. He had founded Daring Foods in 2018 but told BBC Radio Scotland'sMornings with Kaye Adamshe was not finding much success in the UK. ""It was maybe a little bit too early if I look back now but the US is obviously advanced in many areas and the consumer demand for plant-based meat had already started,"" 30-year-old Ross says. He says that past couple of years have seen a rapid expansion for his company, which now has its products stocked in thousands of stores across America. And last week it resulted in a collaboration with Kardashian and Barker being posted to their millions of social media followers. Glasgow entrepreneur Ross Mackay moved to the US two years ago The connection came about after a mutual friend told Ross that Barker, the drummer in rock band Blink-182, was a big fan of the Daring brand. The 46-year-old rocker went fully vegan 15 years ago although he says he has not eaten meat since he was 13. It was Ross's fiancÃ©e who had the idea to run a campaign featuring Barker and his new wife. Images in the photoshoot, taken by renowned photographer Ellen Von Unwerth, show Barker and Kardashian in a series of poses such as snacking on a bucket of fried breaded plant chicken in the back of a limo. Another has Barker feeding his wife spaghetti by hand as she sits on a room service table pressed against a window at the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood. The pair posted the images to their Instagram accounts and the worldwide reaction has been massive, Ross says. Kourtney Kardashian has 185m Instagram followers and her husband almost eight million, which dwarf the 59,000 on the official Daring foods account. Ross says he cannot claim to have spent a lot of time with the couple but he respects their work. ""I'm not going to sit here and pretend we hang out all the time,"" he says. ""But we have nothing but great words to say for them. They showed up with great energy and did a great job."" Ross, a former competitive tennis player, started the company in Glasgow in 2018, with ex-corporate banker Eliott Kessas. He has previously said he grew up as a ""steak and eggs for breakfast kind of guy"" but became a vegan after a fellow athlete ""dared"" him to try a vegan diet for a week. He says what started as a dare a decade ago has become his absolute passion and business. The company got early deals supplying venues in Glasgow's west end and some distribution deals to supply schools and supermarkets. But despite the huge growth in the market for meat-free products, which even saw high street baker Greggs launch a vegan sausage roll, Ross decided to relocate his business to the US at the start of 2020. He has since raised more than $120m from high-profile investors and rapidly expanded retail distribution from 200 to 9,000 stores. ""It's a great place to do what we do."" he says. ""People in America  eat a lot of chicken and our mission is to rethink chicken and bring them something potentially more healthy and better for the planet."" He looks to the success of plant-based milk products in recent years and hopes to achieve the same kind of penetration for his chicken substitutes,. But he said it would take a lot more innovation, investment and brand awareness to bring in more consumers.

Asda says shoppers asking cashiers to stop at Â£30,"This video can not be played Asda chairman: Inflation is sparking a ""massive change in behaviour"" amongst shoppers Some Asda shoppers are asking cashiers to stop scanning items when the till total hits Â£30 as they try to cut costs, the supermarket's chairman says. As well as putting less in their baskets, Lord Rose said more customers were switching to budget ranges with people worried about rising prices. ""What we're seeing is a massive change in behaviour,"" he told the BBC. It comes after food and fuel costs soar, with UK  inflation, the rate at which prices rise,hitting 9.1% in May. Lord Rose said he saw the inflation rise coming last year like a ""train coming through a tunnel with a big flashing light on the top"". Now it's time to ""fasten our seatbelts"", he said. ""People are trading back. They are worried about spending,"" he said. ""They've got a limit that they've set out, too. They say Â£30 is one limit... and if they get to more than Â£30 then that's it, stop. It's the same with petrol."" Lord Rose said the country was facing some very tough times and urged the government to do more to help low income households. But the Treasury said it understood people were struggling with rising prices and it was makingcost of living payments of Â£1,200to those on the lowest incomes. Lord Rose also addressed government concerns thatsupermarkets were not passing on March's 5p per litre cut in fuel duty, insisting Asda price changes were ""done the same day"". Asda customers are trading down to budget ranges, the supermarket's chairman says The retail veteran has some 50 years of industry experience under his belt. He remembers the runaway inflation of the 1970s and said this bout of rising prices has come as a very nasty surprise for consumers. ""I'm of the generation that remembers what it was like last time. And once [inflation] gets hold, it's quite pernicious,"" he said. ""And it takes a long time to eradicate... We're in danger of being in a place that it's very difficult to extricate ourselves from. ""What's rather sad is that the country, the government, perhaps the Bank of England didn't see inflation coming quickly. They've now recognised that."" Why are prices rising so quickly? Food bills are set to soar by Â£380 this year Fuel cost: How to save petrol and diesel Asda has been tracking disposable income since the financial crisis in 2008 and is all too aware of the squeeze on consumers. Its latest data shows households had, on average, Â£44 less a week in discretionary income in May compared with a year ago - a fall of nearly 18%.  This is the amount of money left over after taxes and essential bills have been deducted and it is the third month in a row where disposable incomes have dropped to record levels. Like other supermarkets, Asda is having to grapple with its own soaring costs and decide how much of this to absorb and how much to pass on to shoppers. All the big grocers are in a battle to keep prices as low as possible on the most popular everyday items because they know customers will vote with their feet and shop around. The UK's third biggest grocer has expanded its cut price groceries with a new range, Just Essentials, covering some 300 products. It has also launched Dropped and Locked, an initiative to lower prices on 100 items and keep them at the same price for the rest of the year. ""We're doing everything we can. We've invested nearly Â£100m in the last month or so making sure customers get essentials at very, very attractive prices to try and help them,"" said Lord Rose. But will it be enough? Asda has recently been performing less well than its rivals. Lord Rose said he was not too worried about market share in the short and medium term. ""It goes up a bit, and down a bit, you'll see the monthly changes and that's always been the case in retail... We will do what we need to do to look after our customers,"" he said. ""Secondly, because we've had a change of ownership - my colleagues and I only took over the business a year ago -  we're doing things which we think will affect the long term of the business which will give customers a better Asda."" The Asda chairman and former M&S boss said he did not want to predict where food prices will get to by the end of the year but would like to see more government support for those most in need. ""I would urge them to do more for those people at the bottom end of the earnings income scale,"" he said. He suggested a VAT reduction or another reduction in fuel tax would be ""helpful"". He acknowledged the government now has a difficult balancing act between tackling rising prices without scuppering economic growth. But he knows what he would do. ""I would say the most important priority in the short term is to kill inflation, because once inflation gets embedded, it's very, very hard to kill.

First openly gay judge to lead LGBT veterans probeCampaigners hope the outcome of review into the pre-2000 ban will entitle them to compensation.,"Lord Etherton will be asked to recommend how the government can redress veterans affected by the pre-2000 ban Britain's first openly gay senior judge will lead a review into the impact of a historical ban on LGBT people serving in the armed forces. Lord Etherton's inquiry will look at how those affected can be redressed. Campaigners are hoping for compensation for lost livelihoods and suffering as well as mental health support. The review will apply to veterans who served between 1967, when homosexual acts began to be decriminalised, and 2000. Until then it was illegal to be gay in the British military - with more than 5,000 people in the armed forces thought to be affected. Those who were, or perceived to be, homosexual faced intrusive investigations and were dismissed or otherwise forced to leave the military. Many still have the conviction on their criminal record. Some veterans say it meant a complete loss of income which still affects them today, due to years of missed pension contributions. In the review, expected to start in the next few weeks, Lord Etherton will be asked to recommend ways in which the government could ""seek to mitigate any impacts, including any financial impact"", the BBC has learned. Gay veteran's flashbacks over 'sadistic' treatment LGBT in the forces: 'It was a very scary time' 'I was marched off RAF base for being gay' People with HIV to be allowed to join armed forces The independent review was launched as part of the government'sVeterans' Strategy Action Plan,external. Lord Etherton was appointed by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and the prime minister's chief aide, Steve Barclay. Lord Etherton said he wants to provide a ""safe space"" for veterans to share their stories. ""This will allow me to make measured recommendations as to how the government can meet their commitment to ensure that all veterans' experiences are understood and valued,"" he added. David Bonney served four months in a military prison in Colchester in 1995 after being convicted of ""homosexual conduct"" while working for the RAF as a medic. He told the BBC he welcomed the announcement of the chairman, but that he hoped the review would be carried out quickly. David Bonney was jailed after it was found out he was gay while serving in the RAF The BBC understands the review could take as long as 12 months. ""There are people with serious issues, cancers and such,"" Mr Bonney said. ""It would be nice if they could get everything resolved before they die."" He added that Lord Etherton would be ""more likely to reach the right conclusions"" as someone who ""knows what it's like to hide your true self"". Mr Bonney's conviction is still on his criminal record despite the law change in 2000 The review comes after years of campaigning by veterans and charities. The CEOs of charity Fighting with Pride, Caroline Paige and Craig Jones, told the BBC the announcement ""brings hope to veterans who served at a time when they were not welcomed in the armed forces as LGBT personnel are today"". ""They have faced immense challenges in their lives in consequence of the ban and today's announcement brings hope for a better future,"" they said in a joint statement. Since theBBC first reported on the review, around 400 veterans have come forward to share their stories with the charity.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak defends likely pensions rise,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended restoring the triple lock, which could see pensions rise by 10% in line with inflation. It comes as the government warns workers not to expect pay rises to keep pace with increasing costs. Economist and Labour adviser Jim O'Neill said the ""constant protection of pensioners"" was ""ludicrous"". But Mr Sunak said pensioners were ""among the most vulnerable in society"" and needed to be protected. Inflation - the rate at which the price of things like food and fuel rise -has hit a 40-year highof 9.1% and the Bank of England has predicted it will grow to 11% later this year. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward Prices continue to rise at fastest rate for 40 years Strike talks resume as travellers face more delays Many trade unions have called for pay rises to help workers with increasing costs and the RMT union, which represents rail workers, are holding strikes in part to secure better wages. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%. Elsewhere barristers have voted to strike over pay and conditions, while two teaching unions are considering asking their members if they want to strike over pay. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was ""right that we reward our hard working public sector workers with a pay rise"" but added that it needed to be ""proportionate and balanced with the need not to make the inflationary pressures worse and what's affordable for the taxpayer"". He argued that it was right to restore the pensions triple lock, which ensures that the state pension will always increase each year in line with either inflation, the average wage increase or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. The triple lock was introduced in 2010 and the Conservatives promised in their 2019 election manifesto to keep it in place. However, the government suspended it for one year between 2022-2023 citing the pressures of the pandemic on public finances. Downing Street has confirmed that the triple lock will be restored. The rise will match the inflation rate in September but will only be paid from April 2023. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Lord O'Neill - who served as a Treasury minister in a Conservative government but is now working on a review of business start-ups for Labour - said he had ""no idea"" why the triple lock had been restored. ""The constant protection of pensioners seems ludicrous in itself and in these circumstances is particularly crazy,"" he said. Mr Sunak said the government had provided a support package which was ""generous and well-targeted at those who need our help"". He said the ""most vulnerable in our society"" would receive Â£1,200 of support adding: ""There is help available for everyone."" He also argued that pension increases would not add to inflation in the same way as pay rises. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, former Conservative Chancellor Ken Clarke said the government should: ""Stop giving me money."" ""I've got Â£1,100 out of the latest package from the government - it's absurd, I've got two houses... I don't need it."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said Lord Clarke could ""send a cheque back to HMRC if he feels that strongly about it"". Asked if the triple lock was motivated by the fact that older people are more likely to vote, Ms Coffey said: ""When politicians make a decisions we think about the individuals, we think about the people who are worried if they have enough money to heat their homes."" The UK's welfare bill of about Â£250bn a year is always going to be a hotly-debated political issue - but, at its heart, it remains vital to the everyday finances of millions of people. The basic state pension in the UK is far from the most generous compared with entitlements in other European countries, although the Pension Credit top-up does assist lower-income pensioners. A potential double-digit increase in April for pensions and benefits may raise eyebrows, but it still reflects the higher prices people will be paying for many months beforehand. That is why there had been calls tobring forward part of this increaseto tackle the financial strain being felt now. Instead, the chancellor decided ona system of targeted cash paymentsaimed at helping households cover energy bills and the soaring cost of living in general.

"Strike talks resume as travellers face more delaysThe RMT are meeting rail bosses to try to resolve the dispute over jobs, pay and conditions.UK","Stations opened later than usual on Wednesday with only 60% of normal services running A second day of rail strikes is under way after talks between the RMT union and railway employers broke down. The RMT accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of ""wrecking"" negotiations by refusing to allow Network Rail to withdraw redundancy threats. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", adding the union was solely to blame for the ""massive disruption"". Thursday's strike is set to have a similar impact as Tuesday's, with just 20% of services running. Millions were affected on Tuesday at the start of the largest strike in decades. Another walkout is due on Saturday. The second day of strikes will see half of the rail network in Britain closed. In London, there are no strikes taking place on the Tube network, though operator TFL has warned of disruption to some services, including the London Overground. It comes as the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms across much of southern England, potentially adding to disruption. What days are the strikes and which trains are running? The breakdown in talks between the RMT and rail companies led to recriminations between the union and the government. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers' union, claimed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had ""wrecked"" negotiations by not allowing Network Rail to withdraw its letter threatening redundancy for 2,900 of our members. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", saying he had no involvement in the letter. The Department of Transport has said the rail industry is leading the negotiations, but a contract seen by the BBC says that train operating companies' handling of strike action is ""subject to the secretary of state's direction"". A Network Rail source told the BBC little progress was made in Wednesday's talks, with the union's position appearing to have hardened. No new pay offer was made. Disruption for millions on rail strike's first day Fans descend on Glastonbury amid travel disruption 'Why I'm losing my wages to go on strike' Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Both sides in this dispute insist that in recent days they had thought progress was being made. But Wednesday's talks again ended without an agreement. As things stand, a deal to avert the third strike going ahead on Saturday isn't looking particularly likely. The RMT union says that in talks, it asked Network Rail to withdraw Monday's letter about pressing ahead with a formal consultation over changes to working practices in maintenance teams - which would entail redundancies. A source at Network Rail, which maintains and operates the tracks, described this as a ""red herring"". They insisted the letter could be ripped up if the union would properly negotiate on the reforms. There wasn't a new pay offer yesterday. So far, both train companies and Network Rail have offered an unconditional 2%, with a further 1% conditional on accepting changes they say are necessary to modernise ways of working. Meanwhile, passengers face another day of travel misery. More rail commuters can switch to working from home than would have been possible in the past, but not everyone has that option and many plans will be disrupted. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the cost of living crisis, as inflation hits 9.1% and is forecast to reach 11% in the autumn. Employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition that the union accepts new working practices. But rail employers said they had suffered a loss of income, with passenger numbers only at 80% of pre-pandemic levels. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, said it wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"", which meant modernising the railway to attract passengers back. On Tuesday, the prime minister urged the country to ""stay the course"" and resist high pay rises he said could further fuel inflation. Services started later than normal on Wednesday as trains were delayed depots On Tuesday about 40,000 RMT members working for Network Rail walked out, leaving many parts of the country with no rail service at all. Disruption continued on Wednesday, with only about 60% of normal services running. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson and the transport secretary of not ""lifting a finger"" to stop the strikes. Mr Johnson responded that the government was doing ""everything we can to prevent these strikes"" and it was up to the railway companies to negotiate. Meanwhile, the government is planning to introduce a new law this week to make itlegal for employers to bring in agency staff to replace striking workers- but it will not impact the planned rail strikes on Thursday and Saturday.

Rotherham abuse report a let-down - police bossA long-awaited report into police failings is published but is criticised for a lack of new findings.Sheffield & South Yorkshire,"Sammy Woodhouse, who was abused in Rotherham as a teenager, has criticised the new report A woman raped by Rotherham grooming gangs as a teenager says she is ""disgusted"" by the failure of a new report to hold any officers to account. The police watchdog's eight-year investigation criticises the South Yorkshire force's approach to the abuse of more than 1,400 girls in the town None of the 47 officers investigated were sacked due to the findings. Sammy Woodhouse, who was abused from age 14, said no-one had been held to account despite ""report after report"". The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) was tasked with examining the force's response to organised sexual abuse between 1997 and 2013. A total of 47 current and former officers were investigated after the watchdog received 265 separate allegations from more than 50 complainants. It said its investigation, dubbed Operation Linden, was one of the ""largest and most complex"" it had ever undertaken, second only to its investigations into policing of the Hillsborough stadium disaster. It followed areport by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, which detailed how girls as young as 11 were raped, trafficked, abducted, beaten and intimidated, predominantly by men of Pakistani-heritage. 'I don't tell people I'm from Rotherham' How we got here: Rotherham abuse scandal 'We became known as terrorists and groomers' IOPC investigators have found there were ""systemic problems"" within South Yorkshire Police that meant ""like other agencies in Rotherham at that time, it was simply not equipped to deal with the abuse and organised grooming of young girls on the scale we encountered"". In one illustrative example, the watchdog said one parent concerned about a missing daughter said an officer told them ""it was a 'fashion accessory' for girls in Rotherham to have an 'older Asian boyfriend' and that she would grow out of it"". Criticisms in the new report include a failure by police to recognise children and young people as victims, and a willingness by officers to accept what they were told by suspects at face value. This was echoed by Ms Woodhouse, who said police had ""missed opportunities"" to stop her abuser, who was later jailed for 35 years. ""If they would have acted when I was making statements at 16 it could have prevented other people from even being abused,"" she said. ""The fact that they were ignoring it for so long just encouraged him, not just him but other people."" South Yorkshire Police failed to grasp the scale of child sex abuse in Rotherham, a report has found Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings said the report failed to ""identify individual accountability"" and contained ""few new findings"" despite years of ""costly investigations"". Investigators also found: The small team investigating the abuse had inadequate resources and was sometimes overwhelmed A failure to recognise children and young people as victims, and viewing them as ""consenting"" to their own exploitation Failures to understand that children being groomed and abused did not always view themselves as victims Officers showed a ""lack of professional curiosity"" by accepting at face value what they were told by perpetrators and victims A lack of awareness meant officers showed insufficient empathy towards survivors Performance targets at the time prioritised burglary and vehicle crime ""at the expense of other types of crimes including child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSA/E)"" The report also identified ""ineffective working with other agencies"" and an unwillingness to pursue cases where the victim did not make a complaint to police because ""the feeling was there would be insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution"". It also criticised the computer system used to share intelligence as being ""not fit for purpose"". ""We found many instances where crimes were not recorded when they should have been, including reports of sexual assault and sexual activity with a child,"" the report said. In a foreword IOPC director general Michael Lockwood said it made ""uncomfortable reading"". ""No child, or young person can ever consent to their own abuse or exploitation, nor should be seen as bringing matters upon themselves. Your protection should not have be seen as a lesser policing priority,"" he wrote. One survivor, who was abused from the age of 14, told the IOPC  she came into contact with police officers ""three or four times a week"". ""When I look back now I can't believe how many times I came into contact with the police and how many chances they had to question me... but didn't,"" she told investigators. Another said: ""I was told repeatedly by the police that I was responsible for my own actions, allowing myself to be a victim."" Ms Woodhouse recalled one instance when police found her at a flat after being reported missing from home. She said officers ""told me to write a note to him to tell him where I was because they didn't want him to worry about me"".""I would have contact with the police on a daily basis,"" she said ""I was never treated as a victim I was treated as somebody who was his mistress, his girlfriend  as somebody who was part of his gang. I was victim blamed."" The IOPC made 13 recommendations, including improved training and support for officers. South Yorkshire Police said it accepted the findings and was ""deeply sorry"", adding: ""Victims deserved better from us."" Police and Crime Commissioner Dr Alan Billings said he was disappointed that ""eight years of costly investigations"" had resulted in ""few new findings or accountability"". He said most of the report's recommendations had been made and implemented after previous investigations, and that the latest had failed ""to identify any individual accountability"". ""As a result, it lets down victims and survivors,"" he said. The watchdog also upheld 43 complaints against individual officers, with eight facing misconduct and six facing gross misconduct charges. Following disciplinary hearings held by the force,no officers have lost their jobs or faced criminal charges. Ms Woodhouse said she was angered by ""the fact that all this has happened and not one person will ever be held to account on a professional level"". ""Lives have been ruined. Nothing can happen to replace all the damage that's been done. We're just left to get on with things,"" she said. ""I feel like they've chucked us a little bit of money in compensation. Police officers have just retired, if anything they've been rewarded."" Dr Billings said it was unfair for officers to have had allegations of misconduct ""hanging over them for so long"", but said the force was now ""on a path of continuous improvement"". ""We are committed to supporting victims of child sexual exploitation and abuse, listening to their accounts and gathering evidence for consideration of prosecution by the CPS, no matter how long or how challenging investigations are."" The pledge from the National Crime Agency which is currently working to bring the Rotherham perpetrators to justice. Its team, headed by senior investigating officer, Philip Marshall, is probing crimes which, in some cases, go back 25 years. Known as Operation Stovewood, it's the single largest law enforcement investigation into non-familial child sexual exploitation and abuse in the UK. The Stovewood team is looking at allegations in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. The South Yorkshire force, heavily criticised by the police watchdog for its failings over Rotherham, is funding Stovewood. But it's the National Crime Agency which has the twin tasks of winning the trust of victims and putting the abusers behind bars. So far Stovewood has seen 20 sex offenders convicted and jailed for a total of 256 years. More than two hundred people have been arrested or attended a police station voluntarily. Four are awaiting trial. They include two brothers, in their thirties, who made their first court appearance earlier this month. They are charged with raping and sexually assaulting three girls - aged 13 to 15 - between 2006 and 2009. The National Crime Agency says that in some cases it's been engaging with victims for years and there are around 40 separate Stovewood investigations. Its prioritising those who have caused the most harm in the past and - disturbingly - those who may still be active in Rotherham or elsewhere. It acknowledges that one of its key tasks is ""to work with local partners and communities to rebuild public confidence in agencies."" This report by the police watchdog underlines the scale of the challenge. The town's Labour MP Sarah Champion said the report ""lays bare the appalling systemic failures at South Yorkshire Police"". 'It has taken eight long years, but the truth is now out for all to see,"" she said. ""I know from conversations with survivors of abuse that their main motivation for engaging with this process was to ensure that no other children will be put through the hell they endured. We owe it to them now to make certain that that is the case."" She added: ""South Yorkshire Police has improved, but there is still a long way to go before trust is rebuilt, ensuring the people of South Yorkshire have confidence in their police force again."" Sarah Champion said South Yorkshire Police needed to rebuild trust In response to the report, Deputy Chief Constable Tim Forber said: ""We let victims of CSE down. We failed to recognise their vulnerability and failed to see them as victims, for that I am deeply sorry. ""They deserved better from us. ""The brave accounts of these girls caused a seismic change in policing crimes of this nature for South Yorkshire Police and the wider police service.""

"Powerful earthquake kills 920 people in AfghanistanThe quake struck overnight as many people slept in their beds, and was felt as far away as India.Asia","This video can not be played Watch: People injured in the earthquake are rushed to a rescue helicopter A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC. The Taliban appealed for international help for the rescue effort as pictures showed landslides and ruined mud-built homes in the province of Paktika. The quake struck shortly after 01:30 (21:00 GMT Tuesday) as people slept. Hundreds of houses were destroyed by the magnitude 6.1 event, which occurred at a depth of 51km (32 miles). It is the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades and a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Taliban officials asked the UN to ""support them in terms of assessing the needs and responding to those affected"", Sam Mort from Unicef's Kabul unit told the BBC. The UK's special representative to Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, said the UK was in touch with the UN and was ""ready to contribute to the international response"". Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. Speaking to Reuters news agency, locals described horrific scenes of death and destruction in the aftermath of the late-night earthquake. ""The kids and I screamed,"" said Fatima. ""One of our rooms was destroyed. Our neighbours screamed and we saw everyone's rooms."" ""It destroyed the houses of our neighbours,"" Faisal said. ""When we arrived there were many dead and wounded. They sent us to the hospital. I also saw many dead bodies."" ""Every street you go, you hear people mourning the deaths of their beloved ones,"" a journalist in Paktika province told the BBC. Local farmer Alem Wafa cried as he told the BBC that official rescue teams had yet to reach the remote village of Gyan - one of the worst hit. ""There are no official aid workers, but people from neighbouring cities and villages came here to rescue people,"" he said. ""I arrived this morning, and I - myself - found 40 dead bodies."" Most of the dead, he said, were ""very young children"". The local hospital just did not have the capacity to deal with such a disaster, the farmer added. 'Every street you go you hear mourning' In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. ""We didn't have enough people and facilities before the earthquake, and now the earthquake has ruined the little we had,"" they said. ""I don't know how many of our colleagues are still alive."" Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. ""Many people are not aware of the well-being of their relatives because their phones are not working,"" he said. ""My brother and his family died, and I just learned it after many hours. Many villages have been destroyed."" Most of the casualties so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts in Paktika, a local doctor told the BBC. Local media site Etilaat-e Roz reported a whole village in Gayan had been destroyed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Decades of conflict have made it difficult for the impoverished country to improve its protections against earthquakes and other natural disasters - despite efforts by aid agencies to reinforce some buildings over the years. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault.

"Powerful earthquake kills 920 people in AfghanistanThe quake struck overnight as many people slept in their beds, and was felt as far away as India.AsiaScotland has highest drowning rate in UKAccidental drownings rose sharply last year, three years into a strategy to cut water deaths in half.Scotland","This video can not be played Watch: People injured in the earthquake are rushed to a rescue helicopter A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC. The Taliban appealed for international help for the rescue effort as pictures showed landslides and ruined mud-built homes in the province of Paktika. The quake struck shortly after 01:30 (21:00 GMT Tuesday) as people slept. Hundreds of houses were destroyed by the magnitude 6.1 event, which occurred at a depth of 51km (32 miles). It is the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades and a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Taliban officials asked the UN to ""support them in terms of assessing the needs and responding to those affected"", Sam Mort from Unicef's Kabul unit told the BBC. The UK's special representative to Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, said the UK was in touch with the UN and was ""ready to contribute to the international response"". Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. Speaking to Reuters news agency, locals described horrific scenes of death and destruction in the aftermath of the late-night earthquake. ""The kids and I screamed,"" said Fatima. ""One of our rooms was destroyed. Our neighbours screamed and we saw everyone's rooms."" ""It destroyed the houses of our neighbours,"" Faisal said. ""When we arrived there were many dead and wounded. They sent us to the hospital. I also saw many dead bodies."" ""Every street you go, you hear people mourning the deaths of their beloved ones,"" a journalist in Paktika province told the BBC. Local farmer Alem Wafa cried as he told the BBC that official rescue teams had yet to reach the remote village of Gyan - one of the worst hit. ""There are no official aid workers, but people from neighbouring cities and villages came here to rescue people,"" he said. ""I arrived this morning, and I - myself - found 40 dead bodies."" Most of the dead, he said, were ""very young children"". The local hospital just did not have the capacity to deal with such a disaster, the farmer added. 'Every street you go you hear mourning' In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. ""We didn't have enough people and facilities before the earthquake, and now the earthquake has ruined the little we had,"" they said. ""I don't know how many of our colleagues are still alive."" Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. ""Many people are not aware of the well-being of their relatives because their phones are not working,"" he said. ""My brother and his family died, and I just learned it after many hours. Many villages have been destroyed."" Most of the casualties so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts in Paktika, a local doctor told the BBC. Local media site Etilaat-e Roz reported a whole village in Gayan had been destroyed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Decades of conflict have made it difficult for the impoverished country to improve its protections against earthquakes and other natural disasters - despite efforts by aid agencies to reinforce some buildings over the years. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault.

We're closing this page shortly, but before we go here's a reminder of Justice Secretary Dominic Raab's proposed British Bill of Rights. Raab's statement: Labour's response:  More from the Commons now, where the MP for Dover and Deal has called for assurances that the new Bill of Rights will not allow the European Court to have as much ""overreach"" as she says it currently does. It comes after thecancellation of a Home Office refugee flight to Rwanda last week, following a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights. Tory MP Natalie Elphicke says the move ""raised considerable concerns in my constituency that it will simply encourage the people traffickers, people who have no respect for the rights of others, including human life or the laws of our land"". Raab responds by saying the ""real threat to human life is allowing - and not cracking down on - this trade in human misery"". He tells Elphicke the new bill will see UK courts diverge from those in Strasbourg. Chris MasonPolitical editor At the root of plenty of Conservative gripes about all this is the Human Rights Act introduced by Labour in 1998. It introduced the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. An organisation called the Council of Europe is behind the convention. It, confusingly, has nothing to do with the European Union. Labour's rationale at the time was that being subject to the convention without a domestic Human Rights Act meant the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, France, couldn't be moderated by the UK courts. But the government's rationale now is that the effect of the Human Rights Act has been to gold-plate the decisions of the court. Find out morehere. Former cabinet minister David Davis resigned as an MP in 2008 â to
force a by-election and a wider public debate about what he saw as the erosion
of civil liberties in the UK. He says the Bill of Rights will have to pass two Conservative tests. Can the powers of the state be curbed by an independent body? And can people's fundamental freedoms be protected by an independent judiciary? Mr Davis says this must mean that the new system will offer better protection of human rights than the current one. Dominic Raab says fundamental freedoms are not being trashed, but safeguarded; judicial independence is being strengthened; and democratic accountability is being increased because elected MPs will have the final say on matters of public policy. Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent The most significant new proposal in the Bill of Rights - to ignore European Court of Human Rights injunctions - follows last week's row over the Home Office's abandoned flight to Rwanda. The Strasbourg court, which is nothing to do with the European Union, issued an injunction blocking the home secretary from putting an asylum seeker on the flight, despite earlier decisions by judges in London not to intervene. That decision triggered other appeals and ultimately the cancellation of the flight. Under the government's proposed Bill of Rights, ministers would be able to ignore such injunctions, known as Rule 39 orders, because they are not technically part of international law. The government's proposals, unveiled in December, have been criticised by lawyers as confusing and arguably unnecessary, because British courts can already ignore rulings from Strasbourg. Raab described his proposals as a ""very British approach, a UK-wide approach to human rights"". He told the BBC the UK Supreme Court would not be ""subordinated to Strasbourg but has the last word on interpretation of law"". Read morehere Barry Sheerman, British Labour and Co-operative MP, has asked Dominic Raab to share ""the level of support he has got for this legislation from the people who will make it work - the lawyers, the judges"". Dominic Raab responds saying he doesn't believe there's any greater authority than Lord Sumption, former justice of the Supreme Court, or Jonathan Fisher QC. Laura Farris, Conservative MP for Newbury, quotes a letter from Raab saying the bill will prevent human rights being used to bring claims against overseas military operations. But she says some of the gravest crimes of the Iraq war were only revealed through recourse to the Human Rights Act in domestic courts - including cases of torture of detainees. She asks Raab if he's able to give reassurance that the new Bill of Rights will not suppress such abuses coming to light in future. Raab says we need to have proper accountability. But he says we have the international law of armed conflict for this purpose, and an extra tier of human rights obligations on top of that has been unhelpful and created legal uncertainty and uncertainty for our armed forces. He says the government will make sure there is accountability, but that the current situation has encouraged litigation, including spurious claims, as well as the cases she mentions. Back to the debate on new UK Bill of Rights. The SNP's Anne McLaughlin says the Bill is the culmination of
multiple pieces of human rights legislation in the last year - all about
""removing human rights from human beings"". She accuses the government of targeting - in turn - refugees,
those who question decisions by public bodies, voters less likely to vote
Conservative in the Elections Bill, and gypsy-Roma travellers. Ms McLaughlin says the Bill will force more people to seek justice in Strasbourg, and will be opposed by the Scottish and Welsh governments ""in its entirety"". Dominic Raab says no country is ""more big-hearted"" than the UK in helping those fleeing persecution, and cites recent schemes to take in refugees from Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Ukraine. He points out that when Boris Johnson addressed the Ukrainian parliament, Union flags were flying there. But, he adds, the government also has to stop the ""trade in human misery"" across the Channel, and to stand up for victims by deporting more foreign criminals. He says people in all UK nations should back this and what he describes as a ""common sense rebalancing of the system"". Let's get a full roundup of what was said at this week's PMQs. By-elections  Rail strikes  Bankers' bonuses  Inflation   Chris MasonPolitical editor What struck me today was the smorgasbord of topics that
were covered - not just in the exchanges between Sir Ker Starmer and the PM but
also the backbenches. There was also less prominence given to the rail strikes than
people may have expected. And what about Sir Keir Starmer's claim that Boris Johnson was
too busy holding meetings about ending the cap on bankers' bonuses to find time
for a meeting to end the rail strike? There is confusion around the legitimacy of these claims,
followingreports yesterday,external, and the
Treasury has said it's ""puzzled"". It seems this
issue is a little more complicated than some of the headlines connected to it. In case you missed Prime Minister's Questions, here's Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer going head-to-head. Johnson and Starmer paid tribute to the new Windrush Day monument and to the armed forces for their services to the country, then the debate quickly focused on the Wakefield by-election, rail strikes and the rising cost of living. This video can not be played Missed PMQs? Watch Johnson and Starmer battle it out Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she is ""disgusted"" by Ellie Reeves' comments about the government being soft on rapists. She says it's a ""shameful"" thing to say and undermines the confidence of women in the judicial system. We can be incredibly confident in the years and centuries of our UK judicial system to represent everybody in this country, she says. She also speaks of sadness that so many on the opposition benches would ""throw our sovereignty away to anyone who would have it"". Reeves says the Bill of Rights is not just an attack on victims of crime, it's an attack on women. Woman have used the Human Rights Act to challenge the police when they have failed or refused to investigate abuse or rape cases, she says. She says the government has ""effectively decriminalised rape"". It has made pitiful progress on record low rape convictions under this government, with waits for cases to complete in court reaching three or four years, and the number of rape trials postponed in crown courts rising four-fold, she says. This bill of rights will stop them for forcing our under-resourced police to investigate, she adds. The government is soft on rape, soft on rapists and hard on survivors, she says - ""they want to take away the final backstop available for victims to get justice"". This video can not be played Labour's Ellie Reeves: This is not a Bill of Rights, it's a con Labour call the Tory proposals to remove the Human Rights Act
""a gimmick"". Shadow justice minister Ellie Reeves calls the act, which was
introduced by Labour in 1998, ""a beacon of hope"" for those trampled
by strong men and dictators - and suggests the government's support for the beleaguered
people of Ukraine is hypocritical as it ""snatches rights away at
home"". Shadow justice minister, Labour's Ellie Reeves says this is a
dark day for victims of crime, for women, for people in care, for people who
rely on the state to protect them from harm. It's not a bill of rights it's a con, she says. We know it will take away the duty of the state to protect
everyone from harm by removing the positive obligations set out in the human
rights act. It will force victims of crime to schlep to Strasbourg, creating
endless delays and face red tape, she says. Under the Bill, Raab says, the behaviour of human rights claimants will be given greater weight by British courts - as will the public interest and the protection of the public. He says this will mean that more foreign offenders can be deported, especially those currently claiming the right to a family life. Reform of the parole system will also be made easier, he argues. Mr Raab says the Bill will strengthen the UK's ""proud tradition of freedom"", result in greater respect being shown for democratic institutions, and make Britain's streets safer. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: Expansions of human rights must be agreed by MPs The justice secretary says the tradition of human rights in the
UK stretches back to Magna Carta, not to the 1998 Human Rights Act. Dominic Raab says the European Court of Human Rights'
""elastic interpretation"" of the Act and an expansion in the scope of
its rulings have caused a variety of problems, not least a lack of democratic
oversight. He wants to reinforce ""quintessentially UK rights"" like
freedom of speech and jury trial. He says the Bill will make clear the supremacy of the UK Supreme
Court and its freedom to diverge from ECHR case law. Otherwise, asks Mr Raab,
what is the point of the Court? Parliament will have the ""last word""
on the ""laws of the land"", he adds.  Ahead of Justice Secretary Dominic Raab's statement on plans for a new UK bill of rights, Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsey Hoyle has admonished the government for again announcing policy in the media. In an uncharacteristically irate and emotional statement, Hoyle says he is once again ""extremely disappointed"" the plans to reform the role of European courts were sent to the press before informing MPs in the chamber. ""Why the BBC and Sky News is more important I will never know"", he says. Hoyle describes the situation as ""simply unacceptable"", given the requirement under the ministerial code to make important policy announcements in the Commons. ""Please, respect this house, respect members of every political party. They're elected to hear it here, not via the news,"" he adds before Raab gets up to speak. And with that, the PM's weekly question and answer session in the House of Commons has come to a close. We're now hearing from Justice Secretary Dominic Raab on the British Bill of Rights. He is presenting proposals that would override the power of the European Court of Human Rights. Â© 2025 BBC.

Dominic Raab responds saying he doesn't believe there's any greater authority than Lord Sumption, former justice of the Supreme Court, or Jonathan Fisher QC. Laura Farris, Conservative MP for Newbury, quotes a letter from Raab saying the bill will prevent human rights being used to bring claims against overseas military operations. But she says some of the gravest crimes of the Iraq war were only revealed through recourse to the Human Rights Act in domestic courts - including cases of torture of detainees. She asks Raab if he's able to give reassurance that the new Bill of Rights will not suppress such abuses coming to light in future. Raab says we need to have proper accountability. But he says we have the international law of armed conflict for this purpose, and an extra tier of human rights obligations on top of that has been unhelpful and created legal uncertainty and uncertainty for our armed forces. He says the government will make sure there is accountability, but that the current situation has encouraged litigation, including spurious claims, as well as the cases she mentions. Back to the debate on new UK Bill of Rights. The SNP's Anne McLaughlin says the Bill is the culmination of
multiple pieces of human rights legislation in the last year - all about
""removing human rights from human beings"". She accuses the government of targeting - in turn - refugees,
those who question decisions by public bodies, voters less likely to vote
Conservative in the Elections Bill, and gypsy-Roma travellers. Ms McLaughlin says the Bill will force more people to seek justice in Strasbourg, and will be opposed by the Scottish and Welsh governments ""in its entirety"". Dominic Raab says no country is ""more big-hearted"" than the UK in helping those fleeing persecution, and cites recent schemes to take in refugees from Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Ukraine. He points out that when Boris Johnson addressed the Ukrainian parliament, Union flags were flying there. But, he adds, the government also has to stop the ""trade in human misery"" across the Channel, and to stand up for victims by deporting more foreign criminals. He says people in all UK nations should back this and what he describes as a ""common sense rebalancing of the system"". Let's get a full roundup of what was said at this week's PMQs. By-elections  Rail strikes  Bankers' bonuses  Inflation   Chris MasonPolitical editor What struck me today was the smorgasbord of topics that
were covered - not just in the exchanges between Sir Ker Starmer and the PM but
also the backbenches. There was also less prominence given to the rail strikes than
people may have expected. And what about Sir Keir Starmer's claim that Boris Johnson was
too busy holding meetings about ending the cap on bankers' bonuses to find time
for a meeting to end the rail strike? There is confusion around the legitimacy of these claims,
followingreports yesterday,external, and the
Treasury has said it's ""puzzled"". It seems this
issue is a little more complicated than some of the headlines connected to it. In case you missed Prime Minister's Questions, here's Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer going head-to-head. Johnson and Starmer paid tribute to the new Windrush Day monument and to the armed forces for their services to the country, then the debate quickly focused on the Wakefield by-election, rail strikes and the rising cost of living. This video can not be played Missed PMQs? Watch Johnson and Starmer battle it out Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she is ""disgusted"" by Ellie Reeves' comments about the government being soft on rapists. She says it's a ""shameful"" thing to say and undermines the confidence of women in the judicial system. We can be incredibly confident in the years and centuries of our UK judicial system to represent everybody in this country, she says. She also speaks of sadness that so many on the opposition benches would ""throw our sovereignty away to anyone who would have it"". Reeves says the Bill of Rights is not just an attack on victims of crime, it's an attack on women. Woman have used the Human Rights Act to challenge the police when they have failed or refused to investigate abuse or rape cases, she says. She says the government has ""effectively decriminalised rape"". It has made pitiful progress on record low rape convictions under this government, with waits for cases to complete in court reaching three or four years, and the number of rape trials postponed in crown courts rising four-fold, she says. This bill of rights will stop them for forcing our under-resourced police to investigate, she adds. The government is soft on rape, soft on rapists and hard on survivors, she says - ""they want to take away the final backstop available for victims to get justice"". This video can not be played Labour's Ellie Reeves: This is not a Bill of Rights, it's a con Labour call the Tory proposals to remove the Human Rights Act
""a gimmick"". Shadow justice minister Ellie Reeves calls the act, which was
introduced by Labour in 1998, ""a beacon of hope"" for those trampled
by strong men and dictators - and suggests the government's support for the beleaguered
people of Ukraine is hypocritical as it ""snatches rights away at
home"". Shadow justice minister, Labour's Ellie Reeves says this is a
dark day for victims of crime, for women, for people in care, for people who
rely on the state to protect them from harm. It's not a bill of rights it's a con, she says. We know it will take away the duty of the state to protect
everyone from harm by removing the positive obligations set out in the human
rights act. It will force victims of crime to schlep to Strasbourg, creating
endless delays and face red tape, she says. Under the Bill, Raab says, the behaviour of human rights claimants will be given greater weight by British courts - as will the public interest and the protection of the public. He says this will mean that more foreign offenders can be deported, especially those currently claiming the right to a family life. Reform of the parole system will also be made easier, he argues. Mr Raab says the Bill will strengthen the UK's ""proud tradition of freedom"", result in greater respect being shown for democratic institutions, and make Britain's streets safer. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: Expansions of human rights must be agreed by MPs The justice secretary says the tradition of human rights in the
UK stretches back to Magna Carta, not to the 1998 Human Rights Act. Dominic Raab says the European Court of Human Rights'
""elastic interpretation"" of the Act and an expansion in the scope of
its rulings have caused a variety of problems, not least a lack of democratic
oversight. He wants to reinforce ""quintessentially UK rights"" like
freedom of speech and jury trial. He says the Bill will make clear the supremacy of the UK Supreme
Court and its freedom to diverge from ECHR case law. Otherwise, asks Mr Raab,
what is the point of the Court? Parliament will have the ""last word""
on the ""laws of the land"", he adds.  Ahead of Justice Secretary Dominic Raab's statement on plans for a new UK bill of rights, Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsey Hoyle has admonished the government for again announcing policy in the media. In an uncharacteristically irate and emotional statement, Hoyle says he is once again ""extremely disappointed"" the plans to reform the role of European courts were sent to the press before informing MPs in the chamber. ""Why the BBC and Sky News is more important I will never know"", he says. Hoyle describes the situation as ""simply unacceptable"", given the requirement under the ministerial code to make important policy announcements in the Commons. ""Please, respect this house, respect members of every political party. They're elected to hear it here, not via the news,"" he adds before Raab gets up to speak. And with that, the PM's weekly question and answer session in the House of Commons has come to a close. We're now hearing from Justice Secretary Dominic Raab on the British Bill of Rights. He is presenting proposals that would override the power of the European Court of Human Rights. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Strike talks resume as travellers face more delaysThe RMT are meeting rail bosses to try to resolve the dispute over jobs, pay and conditions.","Stations opened later than usual on Wednesday with only 60% of normal services running A second day of rail strikes is under way after talks between the RMT union and railway employers broke down. The RMT accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of ""wrecking"" negotiations by refusing to allow Network Rail to withdraw redundancy threats. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", adding the union was solely to blame for the ""massive disruption"". Thursday's strike is set to have a similar impact as Tuesday's, with just 20% of services running. Millions were affected on Tuesday at the start of the largest strike in decades. Another walkout is due on Saturday. The second day of strikes will see half of the rail network in Britain closed. In London, there are no strikes taking place on the Tube network, though operator TFL has warned of disruption to some services, including the London Overground. It comes as the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms across much of southern England, potentially adding to disruption. What days are the strikes and which trains are running? The breakdown in talks between the RMT and rail companies led to recriminations between the union and the government. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers' union, claimed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had ""wrecked"" negotiations by not allowing Network Rail to withdraw its letter threatening redundancy for 2,900 of our members. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", saying he had no involvement in the letter. The Department of Transport has said the rail industry is leading the negotiations, but a contract seen by the BBC says that train operating companies' handling of strike action is ""subject to the secretary of state's direction"". A Network Rail source told the BBC little progress was made in Wednesday's talks, with the union's position appearing to have hardened. No new pay offer was made. Disruption for millions on rail strike's first day Fans descend on Glastonbury amid travel disruption 'Why I'm losing my wages to go on strike' Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Both sides in this dispute insist that in recent days they had thought progress was being made. But Wednesday's talks again ended without an agreement. As things stand, a deal to avert the third strike going ahead on Saturday isn't looking particularly likely. The RMT union says that in talks, it asked Network Rail to withdraw Monday's letter about pressing ahead with a formal consultation over changes to working practices in maintenance teams - which would entail redundancies. A source at Network Rail, which maintains and operates the tracks, described this as a ""red herring"". They insisted the letter could be ripped up if the union would properly negotiate on the reforms. There wasn't a new pay offer yesterday. So far, both train companies and Network Rail have offered an unconditional 2%, with a further 1% conditional on accepting changes they say are necessary to modernise ways of working. Meanwhile, passengers face another day of travel misery. More rail commuters can switch to working from home than would have been possible in the past, but not everyone has that option and many plans will be disrupted. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the cost of living crisis, as inflation hits 9.1% and is forecast to reach 11% in the autumn. Employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition that the union accepts new working practices. But rail employers said they had suffered a loss of income, with passenger numbers only at 80% of pre-pandemic levels. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, said it wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"", which meant modernising the railway to attract passengers back. On Tuesday, the prime minister urged the country to ""stay the course"" and resist high pay rises he said could further fuel inflation. Services started later than normal on Wednesday as trains were delayed depots On Tuesday about 40,000 RMT members working for Network Rail walked out, leaving many parts of the country with no rail service at all. Disruption continued on Wednesday, with only about 60% of normal services running. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson and the transport secretary of not ""lifting a finger"" to stop the strikes. Mr Johnson responded that the government was doing ""everything we can to prevent these strikes"" and it was up to the railway companies to negotiate. Meanwhile, the government is planning to introduce a new law this week to make itlegal for employers to bring in agency staff to replace striking workers- but it will not impact the planned rail strikes on Thursday and Saturday.

First openly gay judge to lead LGBT veterans probe,"Lord Etherton will be asked to recommend how the government can redress veterans affected by the pre-2000 ban Britain's first openly gay senior judge will lead a review into the impact of a historical ban on LGBT people serving in the armed forces. Lord Etherton's inquiry will look at how those affected can be redressed. Campaigners are hoping for compensation for lost livelihoods and suffering as well as mental health support. The review will apply to veterans who served between 1967, when homosexual acts began to be decriminalised, and 2000. Until then it was illegal to be gay in the British military - with more than 5,000 people in the armed forces thought to be affected. Those who were, or perceived to be, homosexual faced intrusive investigations and were dismissed or otherwise forced to leave the military. Many still have the conviction on their criminal record. Some veterans say it meant a complete loss of income which still affects them today, due to years of missed pension contributions. In the review, expected to start in the next few weeks, Lord Etherton will be asked to recommend ways in which the government could ""seek to mitigate any impacts, including any financial impact"", the BBC has learned. Gay veteran's flashbacks over 'sadistic' treatment LGBT in the forces: 'It was a very scary time' 'I was marched off RAF base for being gay' People with HIV to be allowed to join armed forces The independent review was launched as part of the government'sVeterans' Strategy Action Plan,external. Lord Etherton was appointed by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and the prime minister's chief aide, Steve Barclay. Lord Etherton said he wants to provide a ""safe space"" for veterans to share their stories. ""This will allow me to make measured recommendations as to how the government can meet their commitment to ensure that all veterans' experiences are understood and valued,"" he added. David Bonney served four months in a military prison in Colchester in 1995 after being convicted of ""homosexual conduct"" while working for the RAF as a medic. He told the BBC he welcomed the announcement of the chairman, but that he hoped the review would be carried out quickly. David Bonney was jailed after it was found out he was gay while serving in the RAF The BBC understands the review could take as long as 12 months. ""There are people with serious issues, cancers and such,"" Mr Bonney said. ""It would be nice if they could get everything resolved before they die."" He added that Lord Etherton would be ""more likely to reach the right conclusions"" as someone who ""knows what it's like to hide your true self"". Mr Bonney's conviction is still on his criminal record despite the law change in 2000 The review comes after years of campaigning by veterans and charities. The CEOs of charity Fighting with Pride, Caroline Paige and Craig Jones, told the BBC the announcement ""brings hope to veterans who served at a time when they were not welcomed in the armed forces as LGBT personnel are today"". ""They have faced immense challenges in their lives in consequence of the ban and today's announcement brings hope for a better future,"" they said in a joint statement. Since theBBC first reported on the review, around 400 veterans have come forward to share their stories with the charity.

Powerful earthquake kills 920 people in Afghanistan,"This video can not be played Watch: People injured in the earthquake are rushed to a rescue helicopter A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC. The Taliban appealed for international help for the rescue effort as pictures showed landslides and ruined mud-built homes in the province of Paktika. The quake struck shortly after 01:30 (21:00 GMT Tuesday) as people slept. Hundreds of houses were destroyed by the magnitude 6.1 event, which occurred at a depth of 51km (32 miles). It is the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades and a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Taliban officials asked the UN to ""support them in terms of assessing the needs and responding to those affected"", Sam Mort from Unicef's Kabul unit told the BBC. The UK's special representative to Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, said the UK was in touch with the UN and was ""ready to contribute to the international response"". Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. Speaking to Reuters news agency, locals described horrific scenes of death and destruction in the aftermath of the late-night earthquake. ""The kids and I screamed,"" said Fatima. ""One of our rooms was destroyed. Our neighbours screamed and we saw everyone's rooms."" ""It destroyed the houses of our neighbours,"" Faisal said. ""When we arrived there were many dead and wounded. They sent us to the hospital. I also saw many dead bodies."" ""Every street you go, you hear people mourning the deaths of their beloved ones,"" a journalist in Paktika province told the BBC. Local farmer Alem Wafa cried as he told the BBC that official rescue teams had yet to reach the remote village of Gyan - one of the worst hit. ""There are no official aid workers, but people from neighbouring cities and villages came here to rescue people,"" he said. ""I arrived this morning, and I - myself - found 40 dead bodies."" Most of the dead, he said, were ""very young children"". The local hospital just did not have the capacity to deal with such a disaster, the farmer added. 'Every street you go you hear mourning' In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. ""We didn't have enough people and facilities before the earthquake, and now the earthquake has ruined the little we had,"" they said. ""I don't know how many of our colleagues are still alive."" Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. ""Many people are not aware of the well-being of their relatives because their phones are not working,"" he said. ""My brother and his family died, and I just learned it after many hours. Many villages have been destroyed."" Most of the casualties so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts in Paktika, a local doctor told the BBC. Local media site Etilaat-e Roz reported a whole village in Gayan had been destroyed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Decades of conflict have made it difficult for the impoverished country to improve its protections against earthquakes and other natural disasters - despite efforts by aid agencies to reinforce some buildings over the years. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Most recently,back-to-back earthquakes in the country's westin January killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.

It is the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades and a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Taliban officials asked the UN to ""support them in terms of assessing the needs and responding to those affected"", Sam Mort from Unicef's Kabul unit told the BBC. The UK's special representative to Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, said the UK was in touch with the UN and was ""ready to contribute to the international response"". Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. Speaking to Reuters news agency, locals described horrific scenes of death and destruction in the aftermath of the late-night earthquake. ""The kids and I screamed,"" said Fatima. ""One of our rooms was destroyed. Our neighbours screamed and we saw everyone's rooms."" ""It destroyed the houses of our neighbours,"" Faisal said. ""When we arrived there were many dead and wounded. They sent us to the hospital. I also saw many dead bodies."" ""Every street you go, you hear people mourning the deaths of their beloved ones,"" a journalist in Paktika province told the BBC. Local farmer Alem Wafa cried as he told the BBC that official rescue teams had yet to reach the remote village of Gyan - one of the worst hit. ""There are no official aid workers, but people from neighbouring cities and villages came here to rescue people,"" he said. ""I arrived this morning, and I - myself - found 40 dead bodies."" Most of the dead, he said, were ""very young children"". The local hospital just did not have the capacity to deal with such a disaster, the farmer added. 'Every street you go you hear mourning' In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. ""We didn't have enough people and facilities before the earthquake, and now the earthquake has ruined the little we had,"" they said. ""I don't know how many of our colleagues are still alive."" Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. ""Many people are not aware of the well-being of their relatives because their phones are not working,"" he said. ""My brother and his family died, and I just learned it after many hours. Many villages have been destroyed."" Most of the casualties so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts in Paktika, a local doctor told the BBC. Local media site Etilaat-e Roz reported a whole village in Gayan had been destroyed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Decades of conflict have made it difficult for the impoverished country to improve its protections against earthquakes and other natural disasters - despite efforts by aid agencies to reinforce some buildings over the years. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Most recently,back-to-back earthquakes in the country's westin January killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.

Fans descend on Glastonbury amid travel disruption,"The sun shone as fans arrived on Wednesday - but rain could arrive in the coming days Fans are descending on the Glastonbury Festival for the first time in three years, although travel disruption has caused problems for some. More than 200,000 festival-goers will arrive at Worthy Farm in Somerset for the event, headlined by Billie Eilish, Sir Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar. But train travel has been hindered by a strike on Tuesday, with two more planned for Thursday and Saturday. One fan, Sarah Hogg, said she was now ""nervous"" about making the trip. The 33-year-old from Newcastle had booked a seat on a train to London on Thursday morning, which would have got her there in time to catch a pre-booked coach to the festival. But she's now going to have to leave after work on Wednesday evening to get the last train to London, where she'll then have to crash on a friend's sofa. Allow Twitter content?

Sarah's slickly-planned journey has turned into a 24-hour endurance test, involving an extra day hanging around in London. ""It's made me incredibly nervous about it and it's just added stress. ""It wasn't that long ago when they announced that this [strike] was all happening, at a point where everyone who's going to the festival had already planned how to get there. ""I'm not particularly happy about it, but come hell or high water I will get myself to Worthy Farm."" Is it worth the added stress and cost? ""Of course,"" said the seven-time Glastonbury ticket-holder. ""It's my favourite place on this planet."" Sarah Hogg (left) has been to Glastonbury six times before but has had to change her plans to make it to this year's event Festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis were there to greet festival-goers, many of whom had queued outside since Tuesday, as the gates opened at 08:00 BST on Wednesday. Emily said it had been quite an ""emotional"" morning, after the pandemic put paid to the event for the past two years. ""It's more spectacular this year,"" she told BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson. ""The wait has been so long and it's just the biggest build-up we've ever had. The festival is the brainchild of father and daughter team Michael and Emily Eavis ""Everyone's feeling very happy and a little bit emotional about opening the gates."" Her father, the festival's founder, agreed, saying: ""It's all so exciting, you'd never believe it."" However, another possible worry could be the weekend's weather afterthe Met Office issued a yellow weather warning,externalfor thunderstorms and torrential downpours across southern England, including the festival site in Pilton, which could lead to flooding in some places. BBC Weather forecast for Glastonbury Festival Follow Glastonbury from home on the BBC Rail strike: When is it and which trains are running? Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton, south London, has been to Glastonbury ""five or six times"" and usually gets the train to Castle Cary, the closest station to the Somerset festival, on the Thursday. Like Sarah, he bought his tickets in late 2019 and kept hold of them, as the summer event was postponed twice due to Covid. There were long queues to get into the site on Wednesday morning Now that it's finally here, the McCartney fan and his friends will have to take an extra day off work, spend more cash and go the long way around in order to avoid disruption. ""It's annoying but I'm just going to stay positive at the moment,"" he said. ""I'm generally supportive of the strike but I'd prefer it if it wasn't this week. ""It will cost me more, and it's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this, I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money."" Early arrivals are spending Wednesday setting up camp Allan Clifford, a teacher from Leeds, is still hoping to get to Glastonbury on Thursday but has had to rethink his plans. He was a regular at the festival when he was younger and was looking forward to channelling his inner ""hippy"" once again in his 50s, but wasn't sure how he would get there because of the rail strikes. That was until ""a wonderful and generous person called Alice, who I've never met before, offered to let me hop in her car and drive down with her"". ""What has happened is a lot of people getting online and organising car shares,"" he explained. Traffic en route to the festival site Those arriving on Wednesday are spending the day setting up camp, with a number of smaller stages - particularly dance areas - opening on Thursday, before the main stages get going on Friday. One of the bands Allan had been looking forward to seeing, The Damned, were forced on Tuesday to cancel their headline slot on Glastonbury's Avalon Stage due to Covid, but he said he won't let that news dampen his spirits, with 3,000 acts to choose from across the weekend. They will include The Kalush Orchestra, winners of the recent Eurovision Song Contest, for what will be the Ukrainian collective's first ever UK performance. Festival lover attends his 35th Glastonbury Glastonbury Festival reveals 2022 line-up At 07:00 on Wednesday, Travel Somerset reported it was taking 28 minutes to reach the festival site from Castle Cary station. It said it expected travellers to take an hour from the A361/A39 Pipers Inn, and 28 minutes from the A37/A39 Rush Hill, while for those travelling from A303 Podimore to Pylle the journey would be 18 minutes. Glastonbury is by no means the only major music event affected by the travel disruption. The Rolling Stones will play at London's Hyde Park this weekend as part of its British Summer Time series, Green Day will perform in Huddersfield and London, and Ed Sheeran will walk out at Wembley Stadium. California funk rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers also have gigs in Manchester and London over the coming days. Jon Collins, chief executive of Live, which represents the UK's live music sector, is warning fans to beware of ""severe delays and potential safety risks"" when taking alternative routes. ""This is one of the biggest weekends of the year for live music fans, with Glastonbury and British Summer Time both taking place for the first time in three years,"" he said. While his organisation does ""recognise the legitimacy"" of the strike action, Mr Collins stressed that the recently resurrected sector ""is facing a perfect storm of fragile consumer confidence, rising costs, inflation and supply chain issues, meaning we frankly cannot take the impact of further strikes threatened this autumn"".

At least 280 killed as earthquake hits Afghanistan,"This video can not be played Watch: People injured in the earthquake are rushed to a rescue helicopter A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC.

"Rail disruption to continue as talks resumeThe RMT will meet rail bosses in an attempt to resolve the dispute over jobs, pay and conditions.UK","Stations opened later than usual on Wednesday with only 60% of normal services running A second day of rail strikes is under way after talks between the RMT union and railway employers broke down. The RMT accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of ""wrecking"" negotiations by refusing to allow Network Rail to withdraw redundancy threats. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", adding the union was solely to blame for the ""massive disruption"". Thursday's strike is set to have a similar impact as Tuesday's, with just 20% of services running. Millions were affected on Tuesday at the start of the largest strike in decades. Another walkout is due on Saturday. The second day of strikes will see half of the rail network in Britain closed. In London, there are no strikes taking place on the Tube network, though operator TFL has warned of disruption to some services, including the London Overground. It comes as the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms across much of southern England, potentially adding to disruption. What days are the strikes and which trains are running? The breakdown in talks between the RMT and rail companies led to recriminations between the union and the government. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers' union, claimed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had ""wrecked"" negotiations by not allowing Network Rail to withdraw its letter threatening redundancy for 2,900 of our members. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", saying he had no involvement in the letter. The Department of Transport has said the rail industry is leading the negotiations, but a contract seen by the BBC says that train operating companies' handling of strike action is ""subject to the secretary of state's direction"". A Network Rail source told the BBC little progress was made in Wednesday's talks, with the union's position appearing to have hardened. No new pay offer was made. Disruption for millions on rail strike's first day Fans descend on Glastonbury amid travel disruption 'Why I'm losing my wages to go on strike' Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Both sides in this dispute insist that in recent days they had thought progress was being made. But Wednesday's talks again ended without an agreement. As things stand, a deal to avert the third strike going ahead on Saturday isn't looking particularly likely. The RMT union says that in talks, it asked Network Rail to withdraw Monday's letter about pressing ahead with a formal consultation over changes to working practices in maintenance teams - which would entail redundancies. A source at Network Rail, which maintains and operates the tracks, described this as a ""red herring"". They insisted the letter could be ripped up if the union would properly negotiate on the reforms. There wasn't a new pay offer yesterday. So far, both train companies and Network Rail have offered an unconditional 2%, with a further 1% conditional on accepting changes they say are necessary to modernise ways of working. Meanwhile, passengers face another day of travel misery. More rail commuters can switch to working from home than would have been possible in the past, but not everyone has that option and many plans will be disrupted. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the cost of living crisis, as inflation hits 9.1% and is forecast to reach 11% in the autumn. Employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition that the union accepts new working practices. But rail employers said they had suffered a loss of income, with passenger numbers only at 80% of pre-pandemic levels. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, said it wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"", which meant modernising the railway to attract passengers back. On Tuesday, the prime minister urged the country to ""stay the course"" and resist high pay rises he said could further fuel inflation. Services started later than normal on Wednesday as trains were delayed depots On Tuesday about 40,000 RMT members working for Network Rail walked out, leaving many parts of the country with no rail service at all. Disruption continued on Wednesday, with only about 60% of normal services running. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson and the transport secretary of not ""lifting a finger"" to stop the strikes. Mr Johnson responded that the government was doing ""everything we can to prevent these strikes"" and it was up to the railway companies to negotiate. Meanwhile, the government is planning to introduce a new law this week to make itlegal for employers to bring in agency staff to replace striking workers- but it will not impact the planned rail strikes on Thursday and Saturday.

At least 250 killed as earthquake hits Afghanistan,"This video can not be played Watch: People injured in the earthquake are rushed to a rescue helicopter A powerful earthquake has killed at least 1,000 people and injured 1,500 in eastern Afghanistan, an official of the ruling Taliban told the BBC. The Taliban appealed for international help for the rescue effort as pictures showed landslides and ruined mud-built homes in the province of Paktika. The quake struck shortly after 01:30 (21:00 GMT Tuesday) as people slept. Hundreds of houses were destroyed by the magnitude 6.1 event, which occurred at a depth of 51km (32 miles). It is the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in two decades and a major challenge for the Taliban, the Islamist movement which regained power last year after the Western-backed government collapsed. The earthquake struck about 44km from the city of Khost and tremors were felt as far away as Pakistan and India. Witnesses reported feeling the quake in both Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Taliban officials asked the UN to ""support them in terms of assessing the needs and responding to those affected"", Sam Mort from Unicef's Kabul unit told the BBC. The UK's special representative to Afghanistan, Nigel Casey, said the UK was in touch with the UN and was ""ready to contribute to the international response"". Earthquakes tend to cause significant damage in Afghanistan, where dwellings in many rural areas are unstable or poorly built. Speaking to Reuters news agency, locals described horrific scenes of death and destruction in the aftermath of the late-night earthquake. ""The kids and I screamed,"" said Fatima. ""One of our rooms was destroyed. Our neighbours screamed and we saw everyone's rooms."" ""It destroyed the houses of our neighbours,"" Faisal said. ""When we arrived there were many dead and wounded. They sent us to the hospital. I also saw many dead bodies."" ""Every street you go, you hear people mourning the deaths of their beloved ones,"" a journalist in Paktika province told the BBC. Local farmer Alem Wafa cried as he told the BBC that official rescue teams had yet to reach the remote village of Gyan - one of the worst hit. ""There are no official aid workers, but people from neighbouring cities and villages came here to rescue people,"" he said. ""I arrived this morning, and I - myself - found 40 dead bodies."" Most of the dead, he said, were ""very young children"". The local hospital just did not have the capacity to deal with such a disaster, the farmer added. 'Every street you go you hear mourning' In remote areas, helicopters have been ferrying victims to hospitals. Even before the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan's emergency services were stretched to deal with natural disasters - with few aircraft and helicopters available to rescuers. Speaking to the BBC, a doctor in Paktika said medical workers were among the victims. ""We didn't have enough people and facilities before the earthquake, and now the earthquake has ruined the little we had,"" they said. ""I don't know how many of our colleagues are still alive."" Communication following the quake is difficult because of damage to mobile phone towers and the death toll could rise further still, another local journalist in the area told the BBC. ""Many people are not aware of the well-being of their relatives because their phones are not working,"" he said. ""My brother and his family died, and I just learned it after many hours. Many villages have been destroyed."" Most of the casualties so far have been in the Gayan and Barmal districts in Paktika, a local doctor told the BBC. Local media site Etilaat-e Roz reported a whole village in Gayan had been destroyed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage in Pakistan, according to BBC Urdu. Decades of conflict have made it difficult for the impoverished country to improve its protections against earthquakes and other natural disasters - despite efforts by aid agencies to reinforce some buildings over the years. Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Most recently,back-to-back earthquakes in the country's westin January killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.

Afghanistan is prone to quakes, as it's located in a tectonically active region, over a number of fault lines including the Chaman fault, the Hari Rud fault, the Central Badakhshan fault and the Darvaz fault. Over the past decade more than 7,000 people have been killed in earthquakes in the country, the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports. There are an average of 560 deaths a year from earthquakes. Most recently,back-to-back earthquakes in the country's westin January killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.

"Windrush statue to be unveiled at Waterloo StationThe monument pays tribute to the Windrush generation's ""dreams, ambition, courage and resilience"".UK","This video can not be played WATCH: A Windrush monument is unveiled at Waterloo Station The Queen has praised the Windrush ""pioneers"" for their ""profound contribution"" to British life as a statue to them was unveiled. The monument, at Waterloo Station, pays tribute to the thousands of people who arrived in the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1971. It depicts a man, woman and child standing on top of suitcases and was revealed to mark Windrush Day. The government gave Â£1m to fund the statue, designed by Basil Watson. In a message to mark the occasion, signed Elizabeth R, the Queen said she hoped the statue would ""inspire present and future generations"" as she sent her ""warmest good wishes on this historic occasion"". Windrush Day marks the arrival of Caribbean immigrants to the shores of Britain on 22 June each year - the day HMT Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks in 1948. Windrush generation: Who are they and why are they facing problems? Windrush racism report must be published - lawyer Anger at Home Office over compensation progress The Queen's grandson the Duke of Cambridge helped to unveil the statue, alongside his wife the Duchess of Cambridge, and also paid tribute to the contributions of the Windrush generation, and their descendants to British life. ""Without you all Britain would simply not be what it is today,"" he said. ""I want to say a profound thank you to every member of that generation and the generations that have followed."" But Prince William also talked about how the ""past weighs heavily"" on the people of the Caribbean and the Windrush generation. He said members of the Windrush generation had been victims of racism when they arrived and said ""discrimination remains an all too familiar experience for black men and women in Britain in 2022"". The duke referred to the Windrush scandal, which broke in April 2018, and said it still ""rightly reverberates through the Caribbean community here in the UK"". The scandal, which saw members of the Windrush generation and their children wrongly detained and even deported,led to the UK government apologising for the deportation threats many faced. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, accompanied by Baroness Floella Benjamin, Windrush passengers Alford Gardner and John Richards and children at the unveiling of the National Windrush Monument at Waterloo Station Windrush passengers Alford Gardner and John Richards helped the royals to unveil the statue. Jamaican artist and sculptor Mr Watson has said he was""truly honoured"" to have been chosento create the monument. The government said the statue would ""create a permanent place of reflection and inspiration and be a visible statement of our shared history and heritage"". The Duke of Cambridge paid tribute to the ""profound contribution"" of the Windrush generation to the fabric of British life Earlier to mark Windrush Day, Prince William and Catherine met young British-Caribbean creatives at the Brixton House theatre in south London, with the duchess trying her hand at photography and the duke chatting to R&B musician Abdoulaziz Lelo Ndambi. They also met youth workers at Lambeth Council's Elevate programme and attended a workshop led by production agencies Iconic Steps and Oxygen Art. High-profile names, including actor Lenny Henry and poet Benjamin Zephaniah, have called for next year's Windrush Day to be a ""major national moment"" to mark the 75th anniversary. More than 100 leaders across different sectors have signed a joint letter, published in The Times, starting the one-year countdown to the milestone. The letter reads: ""This is not only black history - it is British history. It should be something we all know and commemorate."" Patrick Vernon, convenor of the Windrush 75 network, which is co-ordinating efforts over the next 12 months, said it was a piece of history ""every child should learn about at school"" and called for it to be commemorated as a major event. Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials after HMT Empire Windrush's arrival in 1948 But not everyone has been supportive of the unveiling of the statue with activist Prof Gus John describing it as ""a monument to unforgivable political illiteracy and an entrenched colonial mindset"". In an open letter to Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, dated 9 June, declining an invitation to the unveiling, he said the ""entire Windrush narrative distorts the history of Caribbean engagement with Britain and of Britain's relentless efforts to keep us out"". Vincent McBean, president of the West Indian Association of Service Personnel, supported the creation of the memorial but said it could have been located in a better place. ""In the heart of Brixton is Windrush Square, what would have been more befitting for it to have been put in the square,"" he said, adding that it had been Lambeth Council which had initially embraced those who arrived from the Caribbean. The government says the location was chosen because thousands of members of the Windrush generation passed through Waterloo Station on their way to start new lives across the UK. They are known as the Windrush generation, in reference to the HMT Empire Windrush, one of the ships that carried them to the UK to fill labour shortages, in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration. Under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. But thousands of the Windrush generation arrived in the UK as children and did not have official documentation.  Following immigration law changes in 2014, many were told they were in the UK illegally, despite living and working in the country for decades.

'My kids cried every night asking if we'd die'Kateryna and her two sons are among 60 families in a camp set up for Ukrainian refugees fleeing war.Wales,"This video can not be played Marta Burak is one of more than 220 Ukrainian refugees living at a Welsh government centre It's having her children not crying every night and asking if they will be killed is why Kateryna Halenda knows it was the right call to flee Ukraine. Leaving a country torn apart by war may seem like an easy decision but husband Oleh had to persuade her to leave with their two young children because she didn't want to leave him behind. Kateryna now knows she and her kids are safe but still gets mobile phone alerts when air raids are happening back home. Her worries remain, hoping Oleh is ok. The 32-year-old teacher and her two sons Oleksander, nine, and four-year-old Artem are three of the more thanfive million refugees to have fled Ukrainewhile worried about the family they've left behind. For many like Kateryna and her two boys, they lived in shelters or blacked out windows of their homes back in Ukraine due to the war Ukrainian families who didn't know each other before arriving in Wales are supporting each other through their move to the UK But unlike many of the60,000 Ukrainian refugeesthat have arrived in the UK since Russia invaded Ukraine, Kateryna and her boys have not been taken in by kind families wanting to help. They are one of 60 families who are in a unique Ukrainian community thousands of miles from their homeland in a specialist camp - offering a place to stay, food, education and advice - in the sanctuary of Wales. 'Children drank rainwater from puddles to survive' 'The war has destroyed three generations' Ukraine war could last for years, warns Nato chief ""It's like a big family here. we're all looking out for each other,"" said Kateryna. ""We were amazed when we came here. It's very new but they're now completely happy, they're playing with other children every day and going to school every day. And they feel safe here - and that's important."" Parents who couldn't let their children outside for the fear of Russian bombing can now let their kids play in safety Kateryna is one of 222Ukrainian refugees at the camprun the the Welsh youth organisationUrdd Gobaith Cymru,externaland supported by the Welsh government where more than 100 children displaced from home can now play and learn safely. Yet while their parents and grandparents enjoy this haven from war, home and family is never far from their thoughts - and that explains why they didn't escape Ukraine sooner. Children staying at the centre get opportunities to try out everything from go-karting to rope climbing. ""We waited for 100 days because we didn't want to leave at first but my husband made us go,"" said Kateryna. ""It wasn't safe. We were just so often in our basement because of those air raid sirens all of the time, including at night when I had to wake up my kids. ""But we decided to leave just to find a safe place for my kids."" Four-year-old Artem and Oleksander, 9, miss their dad Oleh who has to remain in Ukraine Kateryna didn't know Olena Andrshchuk before they arrived at the centre in Wales two weeks ago. But now the mums have become friends and support each other with their husbands still back in Ukraine. How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? Fears over lack of homes for Ukrainian refugees Olena's husband Pavlo also made his wife leave their home in the capital Kyiv for the safety of her and their two children. ""It's still not safe,"" said the 36-year-old website content writer. With a heavy heart, Olena left her husband behind in Ukraine to flee to Wales with their two children ""The very day we were leaving, very close to where we live I woke up in the middle of the night because of really big bombing. ""It still wasn't an easy decision to leave because I still had to leave my home town, my husband, everything I have - but I left for my kids."" Ukraine war in maps: Battles raging in the east 'Ukraine war means I'll miss my son's wedding' 'I keep telling them, time will come when we meet' Olena says she ""loves"" it in Wales and likens the centre to a ""holiday resort"" with lots of new friends with shared experiences - but the harsh reminders of what's happening at home aren't too far away. ""I have an app on my phone and I still get the alert for the sirens in Ukraine and they are quite frequent,"" said Kateryna, whose husband Oleh is a volunteer back in their home city of Ternopil in western Ukraine. Activities and learning and now part of these Ukrainian children's day once again ""So I know when to call my husband to ask how he is."" The Urdd centre normally hosts Welsh schools but its Ukrainian children who have been living, learning, and laughing in this small corner of the Welsh countryside for the last two months - enjoying the fact they're free to simply play and have fun safely again. ""My kids didn't attend school for up to three months because it wasn't safe,"" said Kateryna. ""But now they're happy as they go to school every day and feel safe."" Children at the centre can play with kids of their own age safely free from the horrors of war Olena agreed as her youngest Leonard, aged four, struggled with a lack of social interaction with children of his own age because most were kept inside because people were ""too afraid"" to let them play outside with air raid sirens bellowing all around. ""It was a big problem for my little one back in Ukraine,"" she said. ""Now we've come here, the kids can socialise, communicate with each other and they're open to all kinds of activities, which they were missing for so long so they just they're happy. For mums like Olena and Kateryna, who've had to leave their husbands behind in Ukraine, they get support to help find work and access benefits and healthcare. ""Of course they are missing their father and grandparents but this is the better reality than what we had in Ukraine."" While the children enjoy there are daily lessons - in English and Welsh - and a world of activities, their parents can concentrate on finding work, accessing benefits and figuring out where they go next. All of that expert help for refugee families is provided on-site in a one-stop shop that also offered health checks to everyone that arrived - much to the delight of grandmother Marta Burak. ""I was so happy because my grandson was tested for an illness here that we were not able to do back at home,"" said the 64-year-old retired teacher. ""Now he's on three months medication. That was very important for me."" New UK Army chief issues Russia rallying cry How many Ukrainian refugees now have UK visas? Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone? While her daughter Khrystyna gets intensive English lessons provided by the local college, Marta, who is in her fifth week in the centre, is getting help and advice from on-site authorities to remain in the UK. ""While we are doing the necessary legal things to stay in the UK, we would love to stay here forever,"" she said. ""But one day, we'll have to move on."" Yet Marta says ""while half of her heart is in Wales, half is left in Ukraine"". The Welsh Government Welcome Centre at the Urdd camp sees the blue and yellow Ukraine flag flying alongside the Welsh dragon ""My son, my daughter-in-law and my son-in law remain in Ukraine and my grandchildren miss their father every day. ""They cannot properly speak with him because they start crying but we are safe here, that is the most important thing. ""Yesterday I got such sad news because the only son of my friend's family got killed and he was only 30. He was such a handsome, positive young man and it is sad young people are still dying in this war and this must be stopped."" Marta loves her new life in Wales but she is worried about her family back in war-torn Ukraine Home is never far people's thoughts but the support of locals draping Ukrainian flags in their windows gives the refugees hope. And in the camp car park there are a handful of cars with Ukrainian registration plates while one family had to drive through Russia in order to avoid fighting on the frontline before eventually finding their way to Wales. People inWales have so far raised millions of poundsfor theUkraine humanitarian fund,externaland Wales has housedmore than 2,500 refugees,external, Marta met Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford on a his visit to meet the refugees and see their camp The Welsh government has directly sponsored nearly 3,000 people to come to Wales and most are yet to arrive butthe scheme has been pausedto allow people to move on from their 'welcome centres'. Mark Drakeford wants Wales to be a ""nation of sanctuary"" and to help Ukrainian refugees ""re-establish their lives"". But Wales' first minister acknowledged the ""challenge for the coming weeks"" is to help more people leave the centre and into more permanent placements so more refugees can be housed and helped. ""Our focus has been on the arrival of people but now we have 4,000 people wanting to come to Wales when we originally expected 1,000,"" he said on a visit to the camp. ""We've got to focus on people moving on from our centres so there are long-term prospects for people who are here temporarily.""

Rail disruption to continue as strike talks resume,"Stations opened later than usual on Wednesday with only 60% of normal services running A second day of rail strikes is under way after talks between the RMT union and railway employers broke down. The RMT accused Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of ""wrecking"" negotiations by refusing to allow Network Rail to withdraw redundancy threats. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", adding the union was solely to blame for the ""massive disruption"". Thursday's strike is set to have a similar impact as Tuesday's, with just 20% of services running. Millions were affected on Tuesday at the start of the largest strike in decades. Another walkout is due on Saturday. The second day of strikes will see half of the rail network in Britain closed. In London, there are no strikes taking place on the Tube network, though operator TFL has warned of disruption to some services, including the London Overground. It comes as the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms across much of southern England, potentially adding to disruption. What days are the strikes and which trains are running? The breakdown in talks between the RMT and rail companies led to recriminations between the union and the government. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) workers' union, claimed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had ""wrecked"" negotiations by not allowing Network Rail to withdraw its letter threatening redundancy for 2,900 of our members. Mr Shapps called the claim ""a total lie"", saying he had no involvement in the letter. The Department of Transport has said the rail industry is leading the negotiations, but a contract seen by the BBC says that train operating companies' handling of strike action is ""subject to the secretary of state's direction"". A Network Rail source told the BBC little progress was made in Wednesday's talks, with the union's position appearing to have hardened. No new pay offer was made. Disruption for millions on rail strike's first day Fans descend on Glastonbury amid travel disruption 'Why I'm losing my wages to go on strike' Labour MPs defy Starmer's rail strike picket plea Agency staff could cover strikes under law change Both sides in this dispute insist that in recent days they had thought progress was being made. But Wednesday's talks again ended without an agreement. As things stand, a deal to avert the third strike going ahead on Saturday isn't looking particularly likely. The RMT union says that in talks, it asked Network Rail to withdraw Monday's letter about pressing ahead with a formal consultation over changes to working practices in maintenance teams - which would entail redundancies. A source at Network Rail, which maintains and operates the tracks, described this as a ""red herring"". They insisted the letter could be ripped up if the union would properly negotiate on the reforms. There wasn't a new pay offer yesterday. So far, both train companies and Network Rail have offered an unconditional 2%, with a further 1% conditional on accepting changes they say are necessary to modernise ways of working. Meanwhile, passengers face another day of travel misery. More rail commuters can switch to working from home than would have been possible in the past, but not everyone has that option and many plans will be disrupted. The RMT is calling for a pay rise of at least 7% to offset the cost of living crisis, as inflation hits 9.1% and is forecast to reach 11% in the autumn. Employers have offered a maximum of 3%, on condition that the union accepts new working practices. But rail employers said they had suffered a loss of income, with passenger numbers only at 80% of pre-pandemic levels. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies, said it wanted to give ""a fair deal on pay while taking no more than its fair share from taxpayers"", which meant modernising the railway to attract passengers back. On Tuesday, the prime minister urged the country to ""stay the course"" and resist high pay rises he said could further fuel inflation. Services started later than normal on Wednesday as trains were delayed depots On Tuesday about 40,000 RMT members working for Network Rail walked out, leaving many parts of the country with no rail service at all. Disruption continued on Wednesday, with only about 60% of normal services running. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson and the transport secretary of not ""lifting a finger"" to stop the strikes. Mr Johnson responded that the government was doing ""everything we can to prevent these strikes"" and it was up to the railway companies to negotiate. Meanwhile, the government is planning to introduce a new law this week to make itlegal for employers to bring in agency staff to replace striking workers- but it will not impact the planned rail strikes on Thursday and Saturday.
