Tens of thousands flee as Turkey steps up assault,"A picture taken from Akcakale in Turkey shows strikes on the Syrian town of Tal Abyad Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Syria, as Turkish forces step up their cross-border offensive on Kurdish-held areas. Turkish troops have encircled the border towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad and aid agencies fear the exodus could reach hundreds of thousands. International clamour has increased for Turkey to halt the attack. Turkey has defended its bid to create a ""safe zone"" free of Kurdish militias which could also house Syrian refugees. Turkey Syria offensive: Your questions answered Four maps explaining the offensive 'The Kurds have no friends but the mountains' Turkey regards the Kurdish militias of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - which have controlled the cross-border areas - as ""terrorists"" who support an anti-Turkish insurgency. The SDF have been key allies of the United States in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group. However, it was after President Donald Trump's decision to pull US troops out of the area that Turkey launched its assault, sparking SDF accusations they had been ""stabbed in the back"". Many in the US, including some of Mr Trump's Republican allies, say the withdrawal effectively gave Turkey a green light. One major concern for the international community is the fate of thousands of suspected IS prisoners, including many foreign nationals, being guarded by Kurdish-led forces in the region. The International Rescue Committee aid organisation said that 64,000 people had already reportedly fled their homes. The UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, gave a similar figure. The IRC's Misty Buswell said: ""If the offensive continues it's possible a total of 300,000 people could be displaced to already overstretched camps and towns still recovering from the fight against IS."" Residents flee their home town of Ras al-Ain Another group of 14 humanitarian organisations, including the Mercy Corps, warned the figure could be 450,000. Ms Buswell said IRC teams remained on the ground, although other reports suggest some aid groups have pulled back across the Turkish border. Sevinaz, a resident of Ras al-Ain, told the BBC on Thursday morning: ""I am outside the town with my sick mother. My brother is inside. I have been informed that my cousin might have been martyred. There is no safe place for anybody. ""I'm concerned about it being the last time that I see my city."" Could Turkish offensive unleash IS threat? 'The Kurds have no friends but the mountains' What did the Kurds ever do for the US? Rizan Mohammad, who fled the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli after Turkish air strikes, told AFP news agency: ""We're heading to the countryside because we're scared of renewed bombing and intensified clashes."" The BBC's Martin Patience in Turkish border town of Akcakale At the border you can see columns of smoke rising from the Syrian towns being shelled by the Turkish military. They look largely deserted but Kurdish fighters positioned there are firing back. Several shells landed close to where many media organisations have set up, including the BBC on the outskirts of Akcakale. Inside the town, several mortar shells killed three people, including a nine-month-old Syrian baby. But in Turkey there is widespread support for the operation. A tribal chief at the border hailed it as ""a great day for Turkey"". He said it would mean Syrian refugees could go back home and that he supported everything President Recep Tayyip Erdogan does. Now that the offensive has started, Turkey's unlikely to back down. It's an often confused picture, with differing versions. This video can not be played Footage from the start of the Turkish offensive Turkey's Anadolu news agency said late on Thursday that 228 Kurdish militants had been ""neutralised"" since the start of the operation. The SDF had dismissed a figure of 109 given earlier in the day by President Erdogan as an exaggeration but they have not provided exact casualty figures. Who are the Kurds? Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained The Syrian Observatory said at least 29 SDF fighters had died, along with at least 17 Turkish-backed Syrian rebels from the Free Syrian Army. It also said the offensive had captured more than 10 villages in the Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad area, where the SDF appear to be under severe pressure. An SDF Twitter account said an attack by Turkish forces east of the Jalab river had been repelled, with three military vehicles destroyed and 22 enemy combatants killed. The Kurdish Red Crescent said there had been 11 confirmed civilian deaths so far and 28 serious injuries, mostly in Ras al-Ain and the border town of Qamishli. At least five people, including a Syrian baby, were reportedly killed in Kurdish shelling of Turkish border towns. Turkey wants to create a ""safe zone"" running for 480km along the Syrian side of the border but says it will not advance deeper than a planned 32km (20-mile) limit. The UN Security Council discussed the situation on Thursday at the request of its current five EU members - the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland. The five called on Turkey to halt its military offensive, saying ""renewed armed hostilities in the north-east will further undermine the stability of the whole region, exacerbate civilian suffering and provoke further displacements"". Who are the IS prisoners no-one wants? Why the battle for northern Syria matters UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed his ""deep concern"" at the rising violence. US ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft said: ""Failure to play by the rules, to protect vulnerable populations, failure to guarantee that IS cannot exploit these actions to reconstitute, will have consequences."" That followed a tweet from Mr Trump in which he said he was ""talking to both sides"", adding: ""I say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they don't play by the rules! I am watching closely."" This video can not be played Trump: Kurds ""didn't help us in Second World War"" He sent out another tweet later saying there were three choices, ""send in thousands of troops and win militarily, hit Turkey very hard financially and with sanctions, or mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds"". He later told reporters: ""I hope it's going to be the last one."" Turkey for its part said it would take responsibility for the IS prisoners it found during its offensive. Mr Erdogan has strongly defended the incursion, threatening to send some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it hosts to Europe if the Turkish offensive is described as an occupation.

Dyson scraps plans for electric car,"Dyson, the technology company best known for its vacuum cleaners, has scrapped a project to build electric cars. The firm, headed by British inventor Sir James Dyson, said its engineers had developed a ""fantastic electric car"" but that it would not hit the roads because it was not ""commercially viable"". In an email sent to all employees, Sir James said the company had unsuccessfully tried to find a buyer for the project. The division employs 500 UK workers. Dyson had planned to invest more than Â£2bn in developing a ""radical and different"" electric vehicle, a project it launched in 2016. It said the car would not be aimed at the mass market. Half of the funds would go towards building the car, half towards developing electric batteries. In October 2018 Dyson revealed plans to build the car at a new plant in Singapore. It was expected to be completed next year, with the first vehicles due to roll off the production line in 2021. Dyson wanted to make something revolutionary - but also needed to make it pay. And the sums simply didn't add up. Sales of electric cars are climbing rapidly. Yet they still cost more to make than conventional cars, and generate much lower profits - if any. Major manufacturers like VW can afford to plough tens of billions into the EV industry - on the basis that economies of scale will ultimately make the technology cheaper and generate returns. Even the upstart Tesla, widely credited with showing everyone else just how good electric cars could be, has burnt through mountains of cash and had to go cap in hand to investors. Dyson has concluded it simply can't afford to play with the big boys - although its efforts to make a quantum leap in battery technology will continue. The company also planned to invest Â£200m in the UK in research and development and test track facilities. Much of that money has already been spent and Dyson said it would use the site for other projects. The rest of the funds intended for the electric car project would still be spent on developing other products, including its battery technology, Dyson said. The assistant managing director of Singapore's Economic Development Board Tan Kong Hwee said the country would still play a significant role in Dyson's growth plans. ""As Dyson's decision not to pursue the electric vehicle business was taken at an early stage, the disruption to its operations and workforce in Singapore will be minimal,"" he said. Dyson to move head office to Singapore Dyson buys Singapore's 'biggest penthouse flat' The first cars had already been developed and were being tested. But in an email on Thursday, Sir James revealed that Dyson was closing electric car facilities both in the UK and Singapore. The project employed 523 people, 500 of whom were in UK, and Sir James praised their ""immense"" achievements. ""This is not a product failure, or a failure of the team, for whom this news will be hard to hear and digest,"" Sir James wrote. A Dyson patent diagram from 2019 But, he said: ""We have tried very hard throughout the development process, we simply can no longer see a way to make it commercially viable. ""The Dyson automotive team has developed a fantastic car; they have been ingenious in their approach while remaining faithful to our philosophies."" He said the firm was trying to find alternative roles for the workers in its home division, which makes things such as vacuum cleaners, fans and hairdryers. Sir James said Dyson would continue to work on the battery technology, which was used in the car. ""Our battery will benefit Dyson in a profound way and take us in exciting new directions."" ""In summary, our investment appetite is undiminished and we will continue to deepen our roots in both the UK and Singapore,"" he said. ""This is not the first project which has changed direction and it will not be the last.""

'It's like having the battery taken out of me',"This video can not be played Ellie Soutter: Mother of snowboarder on need to listen to young about mental health On Lorraine Denman's left forearm is a tattoo depicting her daughter. Ellie Soutter stands with her arms aloft, the waters of a French lake lapping around her legs - looking out into the distance. ""It was one of her favourite pictures,"" Lorraine says. ""I see happiness, I see freedom."" Ellie, one of Britain's most talented young snowboarders, was tipped for success at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. But on 25 July 2018,she took her own life. It was her 18th birthday. ""Life is completely empty,"" Lorraine says. ""I have a massive void in my life. ""It's like having the battery taken out of me. There's nothing there and I'm just running on empty."" Lorraine Denman's tattoo of her daughter Ellie Ellie won bronze at the 2017 Youth Olympic Winter Festival in Turkey and carried the British flag at the closing ceremony. But,as her father Tony has previously told the BBC, ""funding played massively"" on her mind and that pressure took its toll. In the days leading up to her death, Ellie - due to attend a training camp - had missed a flight, and as a result, felt she had ""let everyone down"". ""Ellie was the other half of me,"" Lorraine tells BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent in an interview broadcast on World Mental Health Day. ""She was very strong, very passionate about her own thoughts. She was very driven and she was very articulate. ""She knew what she wanted, even from an early age. She had her own ambitions and her own drive."" Ellie Soutter during the Youth Olympic Winter Festival in 2017 Lorraine spoke to Ellie the day before her birthday, a conversation in which Ellie had told her about the missed flight. ""We managed to get things into line, we were talking and I said to go home, to enjoy her evening and I would give her a call the next day."" Alarm bells rang when neither Lorraine, nor her father, nor any of Ellie's friends, could get hold of her on her milestone birthday. ""As a mum, I knew something wasn't right,"" Lorraine says. A veterinary nurse in Hove, she left work early. As the day went on, and Ellie's phone remained unanswered, police in Les Gets - the French village where she lived with her father - were called and search parties deployed. Later that night, Lorraine called Ellie's father again. ""He didn't answer and then he called me back,"" she says. ""I just said to him: 'Have you seen Ellie? Have you heard from her?' He said: 'We've found her.' ""For a split second, I thought she was alive. And then he said: 'She's dead'. He said: 'Lorraine, she's dead.' ""I got out of bed and I just fell to the floor. Someone might as well have just taken my heart out."" That night, Lorraine and her husband walked the streets for five hours. Where they went or what they saw, she has no recollection. Fifteen months on, she takes time to hold Ellie's ashes and talk to her daughter every day. The tattoo on her arm, she says, allows her to feel close to her only child. ""Sometimes, I've heard stories, be it on the news or I've read it in the newspaper, of other people who have lost their children, and I think 'those poor people',"" she says. ""Then all of sudden, it hits me. That is me. I am one of those people."" Elsewhere on the BBC 'City life was a lot like a cage' - how surf lifesaving saved me Surge at mental health website after royal ad Ellie, according to her mum, ""was a worrier"". ""She worried about people, she worried about money, she worried about was I OK, was her dad OK. She worried about whether she was going to meet expectations."" Yet from the outside, Ellie looked anything but a worrier. And that, for Lorraine, is what needs to be ""recognised"". ""She looked like she had everything,"" she says. ""As parents, we have to take that as a responsibility as well, because it was easy for us to turn around and say 'Ellie, you've got nothing to worry about, everything is going to be fine, you've got so much to look forward to, you've got this coming up, you've got that', but actually, I think people have to listen and read between the lines."" Lorraine adds: ""You can't wrap your children in cotton wool, they are people and they've got minds of their own, but you can have time to sit and listen to them, or just take on board if they have said something to you, don't just disregard it."" In the days after Ellie's death, her parents established the Ellie Soutter Foundation in order to help young winter athletes ""achieve their potential and dreams"" and to help end the ""vicious cycle"" around young athletes' funding. To date, the Foundation has sponsored two young snowboarders -Maisie Hill and Mia Brookes. On a personal level, Lorraine has now found the inner strength to tell her daughter's story, in the hope it can help others. Ellie's death, she says, ""can't be in vain"". ""I am a voice for Ellie now, and I have to move forward and make other people aware that she couldn't say how she felt for whatever reason, but I can now encourage people to speak up, to share or to talk to their parents or their friends if they are having any problems, and I think that is what is pushing me on. ""Have I wanted to give up? Quite frankly, yes. What is the point in living without her anymore? But equally, she is me and I am her.

YouTuber highlights 'the importance of kindness',"On World Mental Health Day, a disabled presenter shares her simple secrets of happiness. Jessica Kellgren-Fozard gets a real kick out of life's small pleasures - a beautiful dress, a warm bath, or a good night's sleep (on a good day, all three). The YouTuber, who has more than half a million subscribers to her channel, is deaf, partially visually impaired and has a rare autoimmune disorder, MCTD, as well as a nerve disorder, HNPP. Such chronic disabilities may make her life tough at times, but she's determined not to let them define it. ""Because the medical condition that I live with is very unpredictable, I can wake up one morning and not have the use of my legs,"" she tells the BBC. ""Or I wake up in the morning - when I was fine the day before - and now all I can do is vomit and I can't lift my head and it's like, 'oh, right!' Because of that I never know what tomorrow is going to be, so I've kind of I've got to just enjoy now - otherwise, who knows?"" She adds: ""I have to do the fun things now, I can't just be waiting."" World Mental Health Day: What is mindfulness? Kellgren-Fozard lives in Brighton with her wife Claudia (and dogs Walter and Tilly). Their relationship even has its own Instagram page, ""for people who enjoy adorable and quite cheesy lesbians"". On her channel she posts about a wide range of topics from why you don't have to love your body, losing your hearing and whether or not straight people should go to Pride. Now, along with a host of other popular YouTube creators, including the Martinez Twins and Lady Leshurr, the activist has joined forces with modern philosopher Alain de Botton to tackle some of ""the greatest philosophical questions of our age"" for his School of Life channel. She was handpicked for the unenviable task of grappling with a topic that has troubled mankind since the year dot - what is the secret of happiness? Allow YouTube content?

For some it meant money, for others it was dream holidays, and in one instance a Chanel handbag (other handbags are available). But in her seven secrets of happiness, the presenter went for more modest and noble targets - such as acceptance, appreciation and personal growth. In the pursuit of this happiness, she thinks it's time we cut ourselves, and each other, some slack. ""Oh gosh, for sure. Things that we focus on on my channel are things like it's OK not to be OK, and the importance of kindness,"" she explains, via a subtitled video call app. ""We give ourselves a very hard time and we give other people a very hard time. From my experiences of living with an invisible disability, you feel the weight that society puts upon you. ""I don't look like a traditional disabled person, I don't act like I'm supposed to and there's this fear around it. What we need to be doing is really deconstructing that and, when we look at other people, take a moment to think with kindness. 'That looks like an able-bodied person walking into a disabled toilet, but maybe that person needs that help.' ""'Maybe I shouldn't be judging other people', and that in turn I think helps us to learn not to judge ourselves. ""Because,"" she goes on, ""it's very difficult in our modern hustle culture. Where we think you've got to be doing things and being productive all the time, to all become CEOs and making loads of money and it'll be great. ""What we really should be doing is going 'Oh, you know, I am actually a bit tired today, I should be kinder with myself, and give myself a bit of a break'. Or 'I didn't quite reach that goal that I wanted to reach but you know what, I was really struggling this month with a terrible cold so I actually did pretty well considering.'"" The 30-year-old sometimes has to use a mobility aid and, on days when she's housebound, social media is her only her gateway to the outside world. She stresses the importance of regularly connecting with people, both online and on her infrequent but treasured trips out - like this week's new series launch and her recent visit to the University of Worcester, where she was given an honorary degree for her work as a disability rights activist. Completing her own actual degree in five years ""literally almost killed me"", she jokes - but you sense she means it.

Police stunned at car piled high with chairs,"Police tweeted a photo of a car they came across in Glasgow Police were stunned when they spotted this dangerous load travelling along one of Glasgow's busiest roads. Piled high with leather chairs, the car was being driven along Aitkenhead Road. The suite was balanced at precarious angles and secured to the car with just a few straps. One was tied to the front passenger seat. Officers from Police Scotland's road policing unit stopped the car and reported the driver for the load and other offences on Monday. They also tweeted a photograph of their discovery with the hashtags #TheMoreYouLookTheWorseItGets and #WeNeedTheManWithAVan. Police said the driver was given some advice on the transport of couches in the future. The tweet attracted a raft of replies - most of disbelief. James Alexander wrote: ""If it weren't so bad it would be funny."" Another thought the image had to have been photoshopped. And Gordon Struth said: ""It's the football that raises this to the level of contemporary art."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Last of the Summer Wine actress Kaplan dies,"Juliette Kaplan, who played battleaxe Pearl Sibshaw in BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine for 25 years, has died at the age of 80, her agent has said. Kaplan appeared in 226 episodes of the show from 1985 to 2010, with the sharp-tongued Pearl trying to thwart husband Howard's attempts to have an affair. Kaplan also appeared in Coronation Street in 2015 as Agnes Tinker. Barry Langford thanked ""everyone who sent their love and support to this fearless and supremely gifted actress"".

The news comes after the agent said on 31 July that she was ""gravely ill"", describing her as a ""very brave lady"". Last of the Summer Wine ran from 1973 to 2010, taking a comical look at the lives of the elderly residents of a Yorkshire town. Kaplan told Kent Life in 2012 she first got the role as Pearl,externalwhen it toured the UK as a play in 1984. Creator and writer Roy Clarke then wrote Pearl into the TV series as one of the permanent characters. Robert Fyfe played Pearl's husband Howard The Very Last of the Summer Wine The actress was born in Bournemouth but moved around as a child as a result of her South African father's job in the Navy. Shetold the Summer Winos fan site,externalin 2012 that having lived in South Africa and New York, her mother wanted to refine her daughter's accent, ""so she sent me to elocution lessons"" at drama school. She went on to pursue an acting career and worked in theatre. She married and had three children, but her husband died in 1981 when she was 42. Juliette Kaplan worked as an actress throughout her life Kaplan also appeared in TV shows including EastEnders, Brookside and Doctors, but the role of Pearl was the most enduring of her career. She said she helped create her character's distinctive look, complete with wig and glasses. ""They actually gave me a wig from stock, and it used to flap at the back,"" she said. ""So every time the wind blew, my wig came off! So it was my idea to anchor it with either a turban or a beret."" She was in a 2005 Christmas special with (left-right) June Whitfield and Kathy Staff She also appeared in a show written by Clarke called Just Pearl, which toured the UK in 2003, telling the story of Pearl's life before she met Howard.

Nissan Europe 'unsustainable' in no-deal Brexit,"This video can not be played The head of Nissan Europe says a no-deal Brexit threatens the firm's business model Japanese carmaker Nissan has warned that a no-deal Brexit could make its European business model unsustainable. Nissan's European chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said if a 10% export tariff was introduced after the UK left the EU it would put its operations ""in jeopardy"". This would be the case if the UK moved to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules after Brexit, he said. He was speaking at Nissan's plant in Sunderland,where work on a new model of the Juke is due to start. The Japanese firm said it had invested Â£100m in the plant, which also makes the Qashqai and electric Leaf models. Mr de Ficchy said Nissan still intended to build in Sunderland, the UK's biggest car plant, but that it was difficult to plan for the future amid Brexit uncertainty. The new Juke has been designed and manufactured in the UK, aimed specifically at European markets, with two-thirds of its components coming from the EU and 70% of production destined for the continent. Nissan, which employs 7,000 in Sunderland, also has operations in Spain. Mr de Ficchy said the cost of moving to WTO rules would mean the ""entire business model for Nissan Europe will be in jeopardy"". Mr de Ficchy said if duties were applied after a no-deal Brexit it would ""create an enormous problem"" The car industry is the UK's biggest exporter of goods and eight out of every 10 cars built in the UK are exported. Speaking to the BBC, Mr de Ficchy said: ""We do not know still what a no-deal means. ""There are many alternatives, and today there is a lot of uncertainty. ""The only message I can [give] is that if a no-deal will be associated with the application of 10% duties under the WTO rules, that will create an enormous problem for the overall European activities of Nissan Europe. ""If we will have to sustain 10% export duties on the vehicles that we export from UK to EU, knowing that those vehicles represent 70% of total production, the overall business model won't be sustainable. ""It's not a question of Sunderland, it's a question of the overall economic sustainability of our business [in Europe]."" He said the business was asking for tariffs not be imposed if there is a no-deal Brexit. ""We are asking not to have tariffs being applied in a no-deal scenario because otherwise the tariffs won't be sustainable for us,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We continue to work closely with the sector as they get ready for Brexit on 31 October."" Nissan employs 7,000 people at its plant in Sunderland On Wednesday,union leaders revealed night shifts at Sunderland would end- but Mr Ficchy said this was not the result of Brexit. Other carmakers have warned about the impact of Brexit on their business, not just because of the cost of tariffs but the potential slowdown in production caused by new customs checks after the UK leaves the EU. The industry operates a ""just-in-time"" model, shifting parts around the EU to construct cars in plants across the 28-nation bloc. Honda confirms Swindon car plant closure September figures deepen industry gloom Last month,  Carlos Tavares, chief executive of PSA-the car group that owns Vauxhall - compared a no-deal Brexit to a head-on train crash. He has warned previously that Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton were under threat from Brexit. In June, PSA Group announced plans to build a new version of the Vauxhall Astra at its Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire. The industry is also under pressure with fewer diesel cars being bought and emissions standards presenting challenges for carmakers. In February, Honda announced the closure of its Swindon plant but said it was nothing to do with Brexit.

Crash death suspect 'will not return to UK',"This video can not be played Mr Trump called Harry Dunn's death a ""terrible accident"" A woman at the centre of a row over diplomatic immunity will not return to the UK, according to briefing notes held by US President Donald Trump. Anne Sacoolas is suspected of being involved in a car crash that killed British motorcyclist Harry Dunn, who died in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Mrs Sacoolas later left the UK to return home to the US, after telling local police she had no such plans. The note was photographed as Mr Trump addressed reporters at the White House. It reads: ""(If raised) Note, as Secretary Pompeo told Foreign Secretary Raab, that the spouse of the US government employee will not return to the United Kingdom."" Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the US's apparent approach was ""beyond any realm of human thinking"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking to Sky News about the photograph of the notes, Mrs Charles said: ""I'm just disgusted. ""I don't see the point in Boris Johnson talking to President Trump, or President Trump even taking a call from Boris Johnson. ""If he'd already made his decision that if it were to be asked and if it were to be raised, the answer was already going to be no."" Downing Street confirmed Mr Johnson had urged the US president to reconsider the decision to grant immunity to Mrs Sacoolas. At the press briefing, Mr Trump called Mr Dunn's death a ""terrible accident"" and confirmed his administration would seek to speak to Mrs Sacoolas. Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo Police have said CCTV of the crash in which the teenager died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road. Speaking at the press briefing on Wednesday evening - after his conversation with the prime minister - Mr Trump said: ""The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen. ""You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did. ""So a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity, we're going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet."" About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It means that, in theory, they cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. However, where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List. Drivers, cooks and other support staff who have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity. Read more Speaking in Northampton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the use of diplomatic immunity in the case was ""completely unacceptable"". He said: ""We would put every possible bit of pressure we could on the United States and if we could mount legal action on the United States, we would do so."" The crash in which Mr Dunn died happened close to RAF Croughton, a US Air Force communications station, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan worked. Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley said, ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"". Crash death parents 'let down' by governments PM's plea to US to rethink immunity over crash Mr Dunn's parents are planning to travel to Washington DC as soon as possible. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the UK was ""getting the brush-off"" from the US as a result of ""cuddling up"" to Mr Trump. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Thornberry said the UK had been ""holding his hand... and being a Trump tribute act"", which flattered the president who is ""only interested in himself"". She said although it was ""very unusual"" for the prime minister to ask for assistance from the president, Britain needed to ""hold its head a bit higher and look Donald Trump in the eye and be clear about what it is we want"". By James Robbins, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent The speaking note which the president held in his hand seems to be confirmation the United States simply will not agree to the return of Anne Sacoolas to the UK. Whatever the rights and wrongs of their case, that has always been and seems likely to remain the American position. Why? Washington has a whole raft of unstated motives. They simply don't want the spouse of this particular ""US government employee"" exposed to questioning, particularly, but not exclusively, because of the likely nature of his work in super-secret military communications routed through RAF Croughton. More broadly, the Americans are determined not to encourage any country to believe they will succeed in requesting a waiver of diplomatic immunity. After all, if we don't do it for our first among allies, the UK, what chance has any other country got. And, most broadly of all, America's idea of its own ""exceptionalism"" means it hates the idea of offering up any citizen for trial in a foreign court - that is, by anyone other than fellow Americans. This video can not be played Dunn family on Raab meeting: ""We feel let down"" Number 10 said the prime minister had urged Mr Trump to reconsider the decision to allow Mrs Sacoolas immunity in order that ""the individual involved can return to the UK, co-operate with police and allow Harry's family to receive justice"". The teenager's parents have described a meeting with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday as a ""publicity stunt"". Mrs Charles said she felt ""let down"" by both the UK and US governments, while Mr Dunn's father Tim Dunn said: ""I'm deeply, deeply disappointed that they think it's OK to kill a young lad on his bike and they can just walk away.""

Heavy fighting as Turkey pushes into north Syria,"Turkish-backed rebels from the Free Syrian Army, pictured here crossing the border into Syria, are also involved in the offensive Heavy fighting is reported in northern Syria on the second day of a Turkish offensive into Kurdish-held areas. Turkey says it has seized a number of designated targets and killed dozens of Kurdish militants. Tens of thousands of people are reported to be fleeing their homes, and Kurds report several civilian deaths. Turkey says it wants to create a ""safe zone"" cleared of Kurdish militias which will also house some of the millions of Syrian refugees it hosts. The long-planned Turkish offensive began after President Donald Trump withdrew US troops from the area, which has been held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF have been key US allies in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group but Turkey regards their dominant Kurdish militias as terrorists. Turkey Syria offensive: Your questions answered Four maps explaining the offensive Could Turkish offensive unleash IS threat? 'The Kurds have no friends but the mountains' Many in the US, including some of Mr Trump's Republican allies, saw the withdrawal as effectively giving a green light for Turkey, although Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday denied this. The SDF said they had been ""stabbed in the back"". Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday that he was trying to end ""endless wars"" but added: ""I say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they don't play by the rules! I am watching closely."" He also said he was ""talking to both sides"". The offensive has drawn international condemnation. The UN Security Council is due to discuss it on Thursday at the request of its current five EU members - the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland. One major concern for the international community is the fate of thousands of suspected IS prisoners, including many foreign nationals, being guarded by Kurdish-led forces in the region. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has strongly defended the incursion, threatening to send the Syrian refugees it hosts to Europe if the Turkish offensive is described as an occupation. The Turkish-led offensive has struck between the towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad in the central area of Syria's border with Turkey. A number of villages east of Tal Abyad have been captured. Who are the Kurds? Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained Turkish-backed Syrian rebels from the Free Syrian Army have also been involved in the fighting. A spokesman for the rebels said Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad had been surrounded. The SDF said there had been heavy attacks by Turkish planes and artillery on Ras al-Ain, with casualties among civilians. Mr Erdogan said 109 militants had been killed, injured or captured in the initial fighting. The SDF said the figure was an exaggeration. This video can not be played Some residents began to flee as smoke rose over the town of Ras al-Ain The UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said at least 16 SDF fighters had been killed and dozens more injured. An SDF Twitter account said an attack by Turkish forces east of the Jalab river had been repelled, with three military vehicles destroyed and 22 enemy combatants killed. Who are the IS prisoners no-one wants? Why the battle for northern Syria matters The Kurdish Red Crescent said at least seven civilians had so far been killed, two of them children, and at least 19 more critically injured, including four children. The International Rescue Committee aid organisation said that 64,000 people had reportedly fled their homes and if the offensive continued that could surpass 300,000. Kurdish authorities accused Turkey of shelling a prison holding IS inmates in Qamishli in the east of the border region in a ""clear attempt"" to help them escape. The BBC's Orla Guerin also says that at least three rounds of what appeared to be retaliatory Kurdish artillery fire hit the main street of the Turkish town of Akcakale. Two people, including a Syrian baby, were reportedly killed. The SDF currently number about 40,000 fighters, with tens of thousands of others in parallel Kurdish security services, Kurdish sources say. The US joint task force on operations against IS in Iraq and Syria describes them as ""tenacious fighters with a degree of basic military training to function as infantrymen"". But they are deficient in heavy weaponry that could be used against tanks or aircraft, though some units may have anti-tank missiles. In operations against IS, they relied on close coalition air support but in the flat, open country of Syria's northern border they will be vulnerable to air and artillery attack. Turkey considers the Kurdish YPG militia - the dominant force in the SDF - an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. This video can not be played Trump: Kurds ""didn't help us in Second World War"" The SDF say they are holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been revealed, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border. This video can not be played Inside the camp of IS families in Syria Two camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the ""safe zone"". It is unclear whether the Kurds will continue to guard the prisons as fighting breaks out. The US military says it has takencustody of two British detainees notorious for their roles in an IS cell that tortured and killed nearly 30 Western hostages. The two men, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, were part of a British cell nicknamed The Beatles. They have now been removed from a prison run by the Kurdish-led militia in northern Syria. A senior Kurdish official also told the BBC that some foreign IS prisoners would be relocated within north-eastern Syria. Are you in the affected area?

Johnson and Varadkar 'can see pathway to a deal',"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar agree they can ""see a pathway to a possible deal"" after talks, Downing Street says. The leaders spoke for over two hours, including a one-to-one discussion during a walk in the grounds of Thornton Manor in north-west England. Mr Varadkar said Thursday's ""positive"" meeting was ""sufficient to allow negotiations to resume in Brussels"". Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet the EU's Michel Barnier on Friday. On Wednesday,EU leaders accused the UK of proposing untested ideas, adding that progress had been limited. A crunch EU summit next week on 17 and 18 October is seen as the last chance for the UK and EU to agree a deal ahead of 31 October deadline. Kuenssberg: Something has changed - but there are miles to go Corbyn: No Brexit referendum before election EU leaders criticise UK Brexit proposals How are the UK's talks with the EU going? After the meeting, Mr Varadkar told reporters the talks were at a ""very sensitive stage"" but were ""very positive and very promising"". He said he was now ""convinced"" the UK wants an agreement, saying: ""I do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks."" However, issues remain over ""consent and democracy"" and ensuring there is no customs border, Mr Varadkar said. The Brexit proposals from Mr Johnson include a provision for the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians to be sought every four years - meaning the arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: Brexit talks 'very promising' ""It remains our position that there can't be a hard border between north and south,"" Mr Varadkar added. ""No one's cracking open the champagneâ¦ don't even pour a pint of warm Guinness,"" joked one of the few people familiar with what actually happened on Thursday after talks between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar. Nothing that happened in the privacy of a country house wedding venue on the Wirral means there will be a deal with the EU in the next seven days. Nothing has made the obstacles in the way of reaching an agreement magically disappear. But something has changed today. After days of various EU players publicly scorning the UK's proposals, explaining the objections and lamenting the weaknesses, there is a tangible willingness, on the bloc's side at least, to see seriously if they can work. We've discussed here so many times why Ireland's attitude matters so much, so the very public positivity from Mr Varadkar - his ""maybe"", instead of ""no"" to Mr Johnson's proposals - is extremely important. There is hardly any detail out there of the compromises or concessions that might be actually in play to make a deal work. Don't give too much credence to even the best informed speculation that's already whirring online as to how it could happen. Read more from Laura A joint statement said the prime minister and Taoiseach (Irish leader) had a ""detailed and constructive discussion"". ""Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody's interest,"" the statement said. ""They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.""

Dyson scraps Â£2.5bn plans for electric car,"Dyson, the technology company best known for its vacuum cleaners, has scrapped a project to build electric cars. The firm, headed by British inventor Sir James Dyson, said its engineers had developed a ""fantastic electric car"" but that it would not hit the roads because it was not ""commercially viable"". In an email sent to all employees, Sir James said the company had unsuccessfully tried to find a buyer for the project. The division employs 500 UK workers. Dyson had planned to invest more than Â£2bn in developing a ""radical and different"" electric vehicle, a project it launched in 2016. It said the car would not be aimed at the mass market. Half of the funds would go towards building the car, half towards developing electric batteries. In October 2018 Dyson revealed plans to build the car at a new plant in Singapore. It was expected to be completed next year, with the first vehicles due to roll off the production line in 2021. Dyson wanted to make something revolutionary - but also needed to make it pay. And the sums simply didn't add up. Sales of electric cars are climbing rapidly. Yet they still cost more to make than conventional cars, and generate much lower profits - if any. Major manufacturers like VW can afford to plough tens of billions into the EV industry - on the basis that economies of scale will ultimately make the technology cheaper and generate returns. Even the upstart Tesla, widely credited with showing everyone else just how good electric cars could be, has burnt through mountains of cash and had to go cap in hand to investors. Dyson has concluded it simply can't afford to play with the big boys - although its efforts to make a quantum leap in battery technology will continue. The company also planned to invest Â£200m in the UK in research and development and test track facilities. Much of that money has already been spent and Dyson said it would use the site for other projects. The rest of the funds intended for the electric car project would still be spent on developing other products, including its battery technology, Dyson said. The assistant managing director of Singapore's Economic Development Board Tan Kong Hwee said the country would still play a significant role in Dyson's growth plans. ""As Dyson's decision not to pursue the electric vehicle business was taken at an early stage, the disruption to its operations and workforce in Singapore will be minimal,"" he said. Dyson to move head office to Singapore Dyson buys Singapore's 'biggest penthouse flat' The first cars had already been developed and were being tested. But in an email on Thursday, Sir James revealed that Dyson was closing electric car facilities both in the UK and Singapore. The project employed 523 people, 500 of whom were in UK, and Sir James praised their ""immense"" achievements. ""This is not a product failure, or a failure of the team, for whom this news will be hard to hear and digest,"" Sir James wrote. A Dyson patent diagram from 2019 But, he said: ""We have tried very hard throughout the development process, we simply can no longer see a way to make it commercially viable. ""The Dyson automotive team has developed a fantastic car; they have been ingenious in their approach while remaining faithful to our philosophies."" He said the firm was trying to find alternative roles for the workers in its home division, which makes things such as vacuum cleaners, fans and hairdryers. Sir James said Dyson would continue to work on the battery technology, which was used in the car. ""Our battery will benefit Dyson in a profound way and take us in exciting new directions."" ""In summary, our investment appetite is undiminished and we will continue to deepen our roots in both the UK and Singapore,"" he said. ""This is not the first project which has changed direction and it will not be the last.""

No-deal Brexit 'to jeopardise' Nissan Europe arm,"This video can not be played The head of Nissan Europe says a no-deal Brexit threatens the firm's business model Japanese carmaker Nissan has warned that a no-deal Brexit could make its European business model unsustainable. Nissan's European chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said if a 10% export tariff was introduced after the UK left the EU it would put its operations ""in jeopardy"". This would be the case if the UK moved to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules after Brexit, he said. He was speaking at Nissan's plant in Sunderland,where work on a new model of the Juke is due to start. The Japanese firm said it had invested Â£100m in the plant, which also makes the Qashqai and electric Leaf models. Mr de Ficchy said Nissan still intended to build in Sunderland, the UK's biggest car plant, but that it was difficult to plan for the future amid Brexit uncertainty. The new Juke has been designed and manufactured in the UK, aimed specifically at European markets, with two-thirds of its components coming from the EU and 70% of production destined for the continent. Nissan, which employs 7,000 in Sunderland, also has operations in Spain. Mr de Ficchy said the cost of moving to WTO rules would mean the ""entire business model for Nissan Europe will be in jeopardy"". Mr de Ficchy said if duties were applied after a no-deal Brexit it would ""create an enormous problem"" The car industry is the UK's biggest exporter of goods and eight out of every 10 cars built in the UK are exported. Speaking to the BBC, Mr de Ficchy said: ""We do not know still what a no-deal means. ""There are many alternatives, and today there is a lot of uncertainty. ""The only message I can [give] is that if a no-deal will be associated with the application of 10% duties under the WTO rules, that will create an enormous problem for the overall European activities of Nissan Europe. ""If we will have to sustain 10% export duties on the vehicles that we export from UK to EU, knowing that those vehicles represent 70% of total production, the overall business model won't be sustainable. ""It's not a question of Sunderland, it's a question of the overall economic sustainability of our business [in Europe]."" He said the business was asking for tariffs not be imposed if there is a no-deal Brexit. ""We are asking not to have tariffs being applied in a no-deal scenario because otherwise the tariffs won't be sustainable for us,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We continue to work closely with the sector as they get ready for Brexit on 31 October."" Nissan employs 7,000 people at its plant in Sunderland On Wednesday,union leaders revealed night shifts at Sunderland would end- but Mr Ficchy said this was not the result of Brexit. Other carmakers have warned about the impact of Brexit on their business, not just because of the cost of tariffs but the potential slowdown in production caused by new customs checks after the UK leaves the EU. The industry operates a ""just-in-time"" model, shifting parts around the EU to construct cars in plants across the 28-nation bloc. Honda confirms Swindon car plant closure September figures deepen industry gloom Last month,  Carlos Tavares, chief executive of PSA-the car group that owns Vauxhall - compared a no-deal Brexit to a head-on train crash. He has warned previously that Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton were under threat from Brexit. In June, PSA Group announced plans to build a new version of the Vauxhall Astra at its Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire. The industry is also under pressure with fewer diesel cars being bought and emissions standards presenting challenges for carmakers. In February, Honda announced the closure of its Swindon plant but said it was nothing to do with Brexit.

Johnson and Varadkar hold further Brexit talksThe talks come as EU leaders express pessimism over whether a deal can be reached by 31 October.,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar agree they can ""see a pathway to a possible deal"" after talks, Downing Street says. The leaders spoke for over two hours, including a one-to-one discussion during a walk in the grounds of Thornton Manor in north-west England. Mr Varadkar said Thursday's ""positive"" meeting was ""sufficient to allow negotiations to resume in Brussels"". Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet the EU's Michel Barnier on Friday. On Wednesday,EU leaders accused the UK of proposing untested ideas, adding that progress had been limited. A crunch EU summit next week on 17 and 18 October is seen as the last chance for the UK and EU to agree a deal ahead of 31 October deadline. Kuenssberg: Something has changed - but there are miles to go Corbyn: No Brexit referendum before election EU leaders criticise UK Brexit proposals How are the UK's talks with the EU going? After the meeting, Mr Varadkar told reporters the talks were at a ""very sensitive stage"" but were ""very positive and very promising"". He said he was now ""convinced"" the UK wants an agreement, saying: ""I do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks."" However, issues remain over ""consent and democracy"" and ensuring there is no customs border, Mr Varadkar said. The Brexit proposals from Mr Johnson include a provision for the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians to be sought every four years - meaning the arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: Brexit talks 'very promising' ""It remains our position that there can't be a hard border between north and south,"" Mr Varadkar added. ""No one's cracking open the champagneâ¦ don't even pour a pint of warm Guinness,"" joked one of the few people familiar with what actually happened on Thursday after talks between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar. Nothing that happened in the privacy of a country house wedding venue on the Wirral means there will be a deal with the EU in the next seven days. Nothing has made the obstacles in the way of reaching an agreement magically disappear. But something has changed today. After days of various EU players publicly scorning the UK's proposals, explaining the objections and lamenting the weaknesses, there is a tangible willingness, on the bloc's side at least, to see seriously if they can work. We've discussed here so many times why Ireland's attitude matters so much, so the very public positivity from Mr Varadkar - his ""maybe"", instead of ""no"" to Mr Johnson's proposals - is extremely important. There is hardly any detail out there of the compromises or concessions that might be actually in play to make a deal work. Don't give too much credence to even the best informed speculation that's already whirring online as to how it could happen.

UK set to avoid recession despite poor August,"TV and film production has helped to boost the economy The UK's economy is expected to avoid a recession after showing better-than-expected growth in the three months to the end of August. The Office for National Statistics said the economy would now have to shrink sharply in September for the third quarter to show an overall contraction. In three months, the economy grew by 0.3% as weak manufacturing was offset by buoyant TV and film production. Even so, the economy unexpectedly shrank in the month of August by 0.1%. The growth figures are being watched closely for signs of recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction - afterthe economy shrank in the second quarter for the first time since 2012. The next quarter runs until the end of September so the August data is the second month in the third quarter. What is the UK's GDP? Although the economy contracted in August, the ONS revised up its forecast for growth in July from 0.3% to 0.4%. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that this revision meant ""fears that the economy is already in recession have been banished"". The ONS said the economy would now have to contract by 1.5% in September alone for the UK to slide in to recession. The ONS uses the monthly data to compile a rolling three-month picture of GDP. It said that in the first half of 2019 the data had been volatile because of preparations for the original Brexit date in March, which had sparked some stockpiling. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said: ""Growth increased in the latest three months, despite a weak performance across manufacturing, with TV and film production helping to boost the services sector. ""Services provided [the] majority of the growth over the three months, with production and manufacturing falling back,"" he said. Over the three months the services sector - which makes up roughly 80% of GDP - grew by 0.4%, following a period of largely flat growth in the previous three months. The ONS said the production sector fell by 0.4% in the same period, while construction output grew by 0.1%. For August, economists had been expecting zero growth. But the ONS data showed it contracted, dragged lower by a drop in manufacturing when car production was subdued. Only the construction sector expanded during the month, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. Manufacturing contracted by 0.7% while the all-important services sector failed to grow. He described the August data as ""disappointing"". TV and film production - such as filming of The Crown -  enabled GDP to grow by 0.3% in the three months to August, more than compensating for activity languishing across the board in that month alone. But that is not sufficient reason to cheer. As the Bank of England has highlighted, growth has lost momentum over the past year and the economy is limping rather than flying. Part of this is undoubtedly Brexit related - with business investment suffering amidst the prolonged uncertainty. A failure of firms to spend on factories and machines will have long-reaching implications. This is one reason why economists are pulling down their forecasts for next year too. But it is also unhelpful that growth in some of our biggest trading partners, such as Germany, has run into problems. The bright spot remains job creation - but that too could falter. This sluggishness ignited a mood shift among policymakers. Even those members of the Bank's interest rate panel who previously favoured a rise in the cost of borrowing now think their next move could be a cut - deal or no deal. The question for them, grappling with as much uncertainty as the rest of us, is when. The data sparked some economists to revise up their expectations for the third quarter. Mr Wishart said the the economy could grow by 0.4% in the third quarter, more than he had originally expected. However, John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said that while the data ""has put to bed fears of the UK economy falling into recession in the third quarter of 2019"", he was cautious about the future. He said there could be ""problems ahead in the fourth quarter as heightened Brexit-related uncertainty takes a toll on both business investment and consumer confidence."" Uncertainty about Brexit was also mentioned by Mr Williamson. who expects the UK to expand by 1% in 2019 but by just 0.5% in 2020. ""These growth projections assume a Brexit delay beyond 31st October and that the UK and EU will eventually achieve a comprehensive agreement on future relations. However, a no-deal Brexit would likely throw the UK into a prolonged recession,"" he said. UK facing 'heightened risk of recession' How fast is the UK's economy growing?

That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October. EU heading for no-deal by mistake, Jeremy Hunt warns How could a no-deal Brexit happen? On Wednesday, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom suggested the PM was gearing up to bypass legal obstacles to a no-deal Brexit by sending one letter requesting an extension and, in the same instance, submitting a second memo telling European leaders he does not want one. Asked on ITV's Peston programme whether the idea of sending two letters to the EU was a possible loophole, Ms Leadsom replied: ""Absolutely."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button In a speech in Northampton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated that his party would agree to a general election as soon as no-deal has been taken ""off the table"", as the PM ""can't be trusted not to break the law"". He alsoaccused Mr Johnsonof ""using the Queen"" to deliver a ""pre-election Tory party political broadcast"" at next week's state opening of Parliament. He told party supporters that the government had ""no obvious means"" of getting new laws passed, and holding a Queen's Speech before an election was a ""cynical stunt."" Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Special sitting of Parliament and the date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

"Duggan family settle with Met over shootingThe 29-year-old shot was shot dead by police in London in 2011, sparking riots across England.","Mark Duggan was shot by police in Tottenham who believed he was carrying a weapon The family of Mark Duggan, whose death sparked riots across England in August 2011, has settled a damages claim against the Met over his shooting. Mr Duggan, 29, was killed by police who believed he was carrying a gun and posed a threat. The High Court heard mediation had taken place between the two parties last month and terms had been agreed. Mr Duggan's family said the two sides agreed to ""bring all proceedings... to a conclusion and move forward"". In a statement, they added the two parties had ""reached an agreed position without acceptance of liability on the part of the Metropolitan Police Service or its officers"". Rioting erupted in August 2011 following a peaceful protest The terms of the settlement will remain confidential at the request of the family. The Met said neither party would make ""any further comment about the terms of the settlement or the mediation"". In 2014, an inquest jury found Mr Duggan was not holding a weapon when he was shot, but concluded he had been lawfully killed. Rioting spread to other parts of England The jury heard Mr Duggan was shot after armed police intercepted a minicab he had been travelling in. Officers had been following intelligence that indicated he was part of a gang and had arranged to collect a gun. Duggan family to sue Met over death Duggan family loses new inquest appeal Duggan killing lawful, says jury After the 29-year-old got out of the cab, one of the firearms officers - referred to as V53 - shot him twice, including once in the chest. A pistol, wrapped in a sock, was later found on grassland behind railings 10-20ft (3-6m) from Mr Duggan's body. Jurors concluded Mr Duggan had dropped the gun when the minicab came to a stop, but decided that V53 had ""honestly believed"" he still had the weapon and acted lawfully in self-defence.

'Ban snacking on public transport',"This video can not be played People in Manchester give a mixed response to banning snacks on public transport Snacking should be banned on public transport and extra taxes placed on unhealthy foods to tackle child obesity, England's outgoing chief medical officer says. In her final report as CMO, Dame Sally Davies also called for tighter rules on advertising and takeaways. She said children needed more help as they were ""drowning in a flood"" of unhealthy options. If ministers were not bold, she added, they would fail to cut obesity rates. A target to halve rates by 2030 has been set. Will we see radical action to tackle child obesity? Dame Sally said: ""The unavoidable fact is that over time our environment has become very unhealthy without us realising. ""Our children are now suffering from painful, potentially life-limiting disease. ""Our politicians need to be bold and help everyone embrace healthier life choices."" The proportion of obese and overweight children has doubled in the past 30 years. Today around a third are obese or overweight by the age of 11 in England - with a minority, but growing number, classed as severely obese. The problem is most acute among girls - where the UK has one of the highest rates in the world. There are signs the increase has begun to level off, but among the most deprived communities rates are still increasing Children living in the poorest tenth of areas are more than twice as likely to be obese than those in the richest. Obesity increases the risk of a range of diseases from cancer and heart disease to diabetes. In fact, until recently type two diabetes was considered an adult problem, but now there are more than 100 new cases each year among children. How to help a child eat healthily What to do if your child is overweight Record number of severely obese children Dame Sally has put forward a wide range of measures. Some are about extending existing policies, while others are completely new. They include: Phasing out all marketing, advertising and sponsorship of unhealthy food and drink Banning food and drink on local transport with exceptions for water, breast-feeding and medical conditions Free water refills to be available at all food outlets, transport stations and public sector buildings Regular car-free weekends across the country to encourage physical activity Changing planning rules to make it harder to open fast-food takeaways Extending the sugar tax to include milk-based drinks Adding VAT to unhealthy food products that are currently zero-rated, such as cakes Capping calories in food served out-of-the home to combat rising portion sizes Consider plain packaging - as for tobacco - for junk food, if firms fail to reduce sugar, fat and salt in their products quickly enough All nurseries, registered childminders and schools to adopt water and milk-only policies The most eye-catching announcement is the proposed ban on eating and drinking on public transport. This is squarely aimed at children on the way to and from school and so will only apply on local transport - trains, buses, trams and metro networks. Inter-city trains with buffet cars will not be covered, the CMO said. The idea is to discourage snacking. The ban will also apply to adults - she wants them to model good behaviour to children. And she is suggesting there are exemptions for people who need to eat or drink because they have medical conditions that require them to. Breast-feeding would also be allowed, while everyone will be able to drink water. Dame Sally said tax was an important lever for ministers. She highlighted the success of the sugar tax - a levy which has been applied on sugary drinks since last year. Figures released last month showed that it had reduced sugar consumption by more than a fifth through a combination of people choosing lower sugar drinks and industry changing the sugar content of products. The fall came despite an increase in sales, and means the equivalent of 30,000 tonnes of sugar a year have been taken out of the nation's diet. But Dame Sally wants the government to go further by extending the tax to cover milk-based drinks. She also wants some anomalies in the VAT system to be tackled. Food is generally not taxed, but some unhealthy ones are, adding 20% to the price. It means that a gingerbread man with chocolate-covered trousers is subject to VAT, but not if it only has chocolate eyes. Cakes, flapjacks and corn chips are zero-rated, but chocolate biscuits, cereal bars and crisps are not. Unhealthy foods are big business for advertisers. Around Â£300m a year is spent on promoting soft drinks, confectionery and sweet and savoury snacks - that's nearly half of the total spend on food and drink advertising. By comparison just Â£16m goes on fruit and vegetables. There are already restrictions on junk food advertising on TV and online. But Dame Sally wants to go further, calling for a complete ban on unhealthy food and drink advertising. The government in England published its lastobesity strategy,externalin 2018. The goal is to halve rates by 2030. None of the headline measures recommended by Dame Sally are part of the current measures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock praised the work of the outgoing CMO, saying she had ""done more than anyone to promote the health of the nation"" over the past decade. He said ministers would study the recommendations ""closely"". But there are doubts about how reforming a government led by Boris Johnson will be in this area. He has already expressed scepticism about so-called sin taxes such as the sugar levy, although a policy paper published just before he became prime minister did suggest the sugar levy could be extended to milk-based drinks. Both Wales and Scotland have published obesity plans in recent years, but neither of these were as radical as Dame Sally's proposals. But she has still received the backing of health experts. Sally Warren, of the King's Fund think tank, said: 'The government should make full use of all the levers at its disposal to tackle obesity. ""Some politicians may baulk at the idea of the 'nanny state', but research suggests these types of intervention may enjoy stronger public support than they often assume."" Professor Dame Parveen Kumar, of the British Medical Association, said the government would ""let down"" children if it did not act. Child obesity: Will we see radical action?

It means that a gingerbread man with chocolate-covered trousers is subject to VAT, but not if it only has chocolate eyes. Cakes, flapjacks and corn chips are zero-rated, but chocolate biscuits, cereal bars and crisps are not. Unhealthy foods are big business for advertisers. Around Â£300m a year is spent on promoting soft drinks, confectionery and sweet and savoury snacks - that's nearly half of the total spend on food and drink advertising. By comparison just Â£16m goes on fruit and vegetables. There are already restrictions on junk food advertising on TV and online. But Dame Sally wants to go further, calling for a complete ban on unhealthy food and drink advertising. The government in England published its lastobesity strategy,externalin 2018. The goal is to halve rates by 2030. None of the headline measures recommended by Dame Sally are part of the current measures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock praised the work of the outgoing CMO, saying she had ""done more than anyone to promote the health of the nation"" over the past decade. He said ministers would study the recommendations ""closely"". But there are doubts about how reforming a government led by Boris Johnson will be in this area. He has already expressed scepticism about so-called sin taxes such as the sugar levy, although a policy paper published just before he became prime minister did suggest the sugar levy could be extended to milk-based drinks. Both Wales and Scotland have published obesity plans in recent years, but neither of these were as radical as Dame Sally's proposals. But she has still received the backing of health experts. Sally Warren, of the King's Fund think tank, said: 'The government should make full use of all the levers at its disposal to tackle obesity. ""Some politicians may baulk at the idea of the 'nanny state', but research suggests these types of intervention may enjoy stronger public support than they often assume."" Professor Dame Parveen Kumar, of the British Medical Association, said the government would ""let down"" children if it did not act. Child obesity: Will we see radical action?

Mr Carlaw, in tears, asked Nicola Sturgeon to give the controversy her personal attention. Nicola Sturgeon said she hadn't seen any evidence of obstruction, but that she was willing to speak personally to Dr Dionysios Veronikis as the government still wants him to come to Scotland.

Independent schools like Albyn in Aberdeen could be affected Ministers plan to""enhance"" the business rates systemthrough the Non-Domestic Rates (Scotland) Bill. The reforms include ending the relief which many independent schools have been able to claim as charities. Some within the sector fear this will directly lead to schools raising fees, offering fewer bursaries or closing. Non-domestic rates are levied on business properties, determined by the assessed value of the building, and are the second-highest source of tax income for the Scottish government. Read more. Plans by the Scottish government to introduce more frequent business rate revaluations will fail unless a ""more modern"" tax system is delivered, a business lobby group warned in September 2018. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said modernisation should include a new ""digital rates interface"". It argued the move would help firms pay bills, apply for reliefs, lodge appeals and submit data. FSB was responding to a consultation on proposed business rates legislation. Read more. Leisure centres, some golf clubs, private schools and universities should be brought fully under the business rates system, according to a review. TheBarclay Report into non-domestic rates,externalalso recommended that childcare centres should be exempt. The system had faced strong criticism, particularly from hospitality firms. The review was commissioned by the Scottish government in March 2016 and headed up by Ken Barclay, former head of Scottish operations for RBS. Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur agrees with many of the concerns and analysis that Andy Wightman has just outlined. The Barclay review was ""hobbled in its scope"", adds Mr McArthur, who goes on to say the risk in trying to fake localism is you create more of a mess. He calls for power over rates to be ceded to local authorities, giving them the clout to shape their own communities. The Lib Dem MSP says his party backs a  land value system could generate economic benefits and insists this is not a major bill, rather it is a small bill. Green MSP Andy Wightman says there has been no reform to local tax since 1992 and he therefore welcomes the introduction of a bill. However, he says it only focuses on technical measures and he criticses the fact the Barclay review only asked one question and had to be revenue neutral. He confirms the Greens will be bringing forward amendments on: But Mr Wightman says the Greens major concern is that the bill removes this tax base from its history owners - local government - and therefore violates international law. He confirms his party will abstain this evening. More than 400 bank branches, shops and local businesses have closed or have been winding down in Scotland since the start of 2016, new figures show. The Federation of Small Businesses is calling for measures to reverse the closures, averaging nine a month. In a report, it says the Scottish and UK governments must invest in projects to make towns better places to work, live and run a business. The group also wants a commission to tackle the rise in vacant properties. Read more. Ms Boyack criticises the tight remit of the Barclay review. She highlights an urgent need for incentives for low carbon
investment. The Labour MSP warns that tax avoidance corrodes public
trust and she calls for an approach to prevent repeat offenders. Leading for Labour, Sarah Boyack says non-domestic rates are a vital part of funding local services. Ms Boyack says her party welcomes the broad thrust of the bill but believe it is a missed opportunity. She welcomes: Regarding independent schools, Mr Fraser says there is an inconsistency in providing a relief to private-run nurseries but removing it for schools. It is disappointing that the large business supplement will not be reduced by this bill he adds, suggesting it is losing Scotland business. Tory MSP Murdo Fraser says he generally welcomes the bill, though suggests in some areas it does not go far enough. It does not implement all Barclay review recommendations, he notes, such as removing the tax concession for ALEOs which could have introduced the ""swim tax"". He welcomes to move towards a three-year revaluation schedule, as well as some of the reliefs proposed. The Tory MSP wonders if the next revaluation could be brought forward a year to 2021, but the minister intervenes to say there needs to be time to implement the reforms. The committee's report on the Non-Domestic Rates Bill also: James Dornan says the Local Government and Communities Committee endorsed the Non-Domestic Rates Bill. The committee convener welcomes the switch to a three year cycle for revaluations. He welcomes the minister pledging to look at fees for appeals. The SNP MSP pivots to ending the tax relief independent schools have been able to claim as charities. Mr Dornan argues this is a change the sector will be able to adapt to. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Forbes says reforms to the appeal system is perhaps the most important and ambitious part of this package. Without doing so, we risk negating any benefit from the other changes she suggests. Regarding the plan to scrap independent schools being exempt from rates, the minister says the different rates treatment between independent and state schools is unfair. She urges MSPs to back the general principles of the bill. MSPs have backed a major reform of the business rates system, including a plan to strip independent schools of charitable status. The local government committee concludes the Non-Domestic Rates Bill would facilitate a ""more modern and fair ratings system"". And while it backed the view that independent schools should no longer be able to claim charitable status, the Conservative members dissented from this conclusion. Convener James Dornan said: ""We recognise the strength of feeling from the independent school sector about the Billâs proposal to remove charitable rates relief from them. ""However, we believe this will level the playing field with state schools and generate vital funds for local authorities at a time of increasing demand on their services.""

"UK set to avoid recession despite poor AugustThe economy contracted in August, but is still expected to have grown in the third quarter.BusinessComments","TV and film production has helped to boost the economy The UK's economy is expected to avoid a recession after showing better-than-expected growth in the three months to the end of August. The Office for National Statistics said the economy would now have to shrink sharply in September for the third quarter to show an overall contraction. In three months, the economy grew by 0.3% as weak manufacturing was offset by buoyant TV and film production. Even so, the economy unexpectedly shrank in the month of August by 0.1%. The growth figures are being watched closely for signs of recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction - afterthe economy shrank in the second quarter for the first time since 2012. The next quarter runs until the end of September so the August data is the second month in the third quarter. What is the UK's GDP? Although the economy contracted in August, the ONS revised up its forecast for growth in July from 0.3% to 0.4%. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that this revision meant ""fears that the economy is already in recession have been banished"". The ONS said the economy would now have to contract by 1.5% in September alone for the UK to slide in to recession. The ONS uses the monthly data to compile a rolling three-month picture of GDP. It said that in the first half of 2019 the data had been volatile because of preparations for the original Brexit date in March, which had sparked some stockpiling. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said: ""Growth increased in the latest three months, despite a weak performance across manufacturing, with TV and film production helping to boost the services sector. ""Services provided [the] majority of the growth over the three months, with production and manufacturing falling back,"" he said. Over the three months the services sector - which makes up roughly 80% of GDP - grew by 0.4%, following a period of largely flat growth in the previous three months. The ONS said the production sector fell by 0.4% in the same period, while construction output grew by 0.1%. For August, economists had been expecting zero growth. But the ONS data showed it contracted, dragged lower by a drop in manufacturing when car production was subdued. Only the construction sector expanded during the month, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. Manufacturing contracted by 0.7% while the all-important services sector failed to grow. He described the August data as ""disappointing"". TV and film production - such as filming of The Crown -  enabled GDP to grow by 0.3% in the three months to August, more than compensating for activity languishing across the board in that month alone. But that is not sufficient reason to cheer. As the Bank of England has highlighted, growth has lost momentum over the past year and the economy is limping rather than flying. Part of this is undoubtedly Brexit related - with business investment suffering amidst the prolonged uncertainty. A failure of firms to spend on factories and machines will have long-reaching implications. This is one reason why economists are pulling down their forecasts for next year too. But it is also unhelpful that growth in some of our biggest trading partners, such as Germany, has run into problems. The bright spot remains job creation - but that too could falter. This sluggishness ignited a mood shift among policymakers. Even those members of the Bank's interest rate panel who previously favoured a rise in the cost of borrowing now think their next move could be a cut - deal or no deal. The question for them, grappling with as much uncertainty as the rest of us, is when. The data sparked some economists to revise up their expectations for the third quarter. Mr Wishart said the the economy could grow by 0.4% in the third quarter, more than he had originally expected. However, John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said that while the data ""has put to bed fears of the UK economy falling into recession in the third quarter of 2019"", he was cautious about the future. He said there could be ""problems ahead in the fourth quarter as heightened Brexit-related uncertainty takes a toll on both business investment and consumer confidence."" Uncertainty about Brexit was also mentioned by Mr Williamson. who expects the UK to expand by 1% in 2019 but by just 0.5% in 2020. ""These growth projections assume a Brexit delay beyond 31st October and that the UK and EU will eventually achieve a comprehensive agreement on future relations. However, a no-deal Brexit would likely throw the UK into a prolonged recession,"" he said. UK facing 'heightened risk of recession' How fast is the UK's economy growing?

Johnson and Varadkar set for further Brexit talks,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar agree they can ""see a pathway to a possible deal"" after talks, Downing Street says. The leaders spoke for over two hours, including a one-to-one discussion during a walk in the grounds of Thornton Manor in north-west England. Mr Varadkar said Thursday's ""positive"" meeting was ""sufficient to allow negotiations to resume in Brussels"". Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet the EU's Michel Barnier on Friday. On Wednesday,EU leaders accused the UK of proposing untested ideas, adding that progress had been limited. A crunch EU summit next week on 17 and 18 October is seen as the last chance for the UK and EU to agree a deal ahead of 31 October deadline. Kuenssberg: Something has changed - but there are miles to go Corbyn: No Brexit referendum before election EU leaders criticise UK Brexit proposals How are the UK's talks with the EU going? After the meeting, Mr Varadkar told reporters the talks were at a ""very sensitive stage"" but were ""very positive and very promising"". He said he was now ""convinced"" the UK wants an agreement, saying: ""I do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks."" However, issues remain over ""consent and democracy"" and ensuring there is no customs border, Mr Varadkar said. The Brexit proposals from Mr Johnson include a provision for the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians to be sought every four years - meaning the arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: Brexit talks 'very promising' ""It remains our position that there can't be a hard border between north and south,"" Mr Varadkar added. ""No one's cracking open the champagneâ¦ don't even pour a pint of warm Guinness,"" joked one of the few people familiar with what actually happened on Thursday after talks between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar. Nothing that happened in the privacy of a country house wedding venue on the Wirral means there will be a deal with the EU in the next seven days. Nothing has made the obstacles in the way of reaching an agreement magically disappear. But something has changed today. After days of various EU players publicly scorning the UK's proposals, explaining the objections and lamenting the weaknesses, there is a tangible willingness, on the bloc's side at least, to see seriously if they can work. We've discussed here so many times why Ireland's attitude matters so much, so the very public positivity from Mr Varadkar - his ""maybe"", instead of ""no"" to Mr Johnson's proposals - is extremely important. There is hardly any detail out there of the compromises or concessions that might be actually in play to make a deal work. Don't give too much credence to even the best informed speculation that's already whirring online as to how it could happen. Read more from Laura A joint statement said the prime minister and Taoiseach (Irish leader) had a ""detailed and constructive discussion"". ""Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody's interest,"" the statement said. ""They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal."" The talks concentrated on ""the challenges of customs and consent"", Downing Street said. ""They agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them."" Mr Johnson put forward fresh proposals for a Brexit deal last week, but Mr Varadkar had previously said ""big gaps"" remained between the UK and the EU. Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who has responsibility for the UK's no-deal preparations, said: ""I have to prepare for every eventuality but I'm hopeful following the good conversation that they had that we can make good progress in the days ahead."" Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told BBC Northern Ireland's The View he was ""delighted to see the positivity that came out of the meeting"". He said the ""mood music and developments are really, really positive"". Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? The prime minister has insisted the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month. That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October. EU heading for no-deal by mistake, Jeremy Hunt warns How could a no-deal Brexit happen? On Wednesday, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom suggested the PM was gearing up to bypass legal obstacles to a no-deal Brexit by sending one letter requesting an extension and, in the same instance, submitting a second memo telling European leaders he does not want one. Asked on ITV's Peston programme whether the idea of sending two letters to the EU was a possible loophole, Ms Leadsom replied: ""Absolutely."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button In a speech in Northampton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated that his party would agree to a general election as soon as no-deal has been taken ""off the table"", as the PM ""can't be trusted not to break the law"". He alsoaccused Mr Johnsonof ""using the Queen"" to deliver a ""pre-election Tory party political broadcast"" at next week's state opening of Parliament. He told party supporters that the government had ""no obvious means"" of getting new laws passed, and holding a Queen's Speech before an election was a ""cynical stunt."" Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Special sitting of Parliament and the date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal.

Oxfam alleges UK supermarket supply chain abuse,"Workers on fruit farms in Brazil told Oxfam they had developed skin conditions from using pesticides without adequate protection Workers on farms and plantations that supply big UK supermarkets are being subjected to poverty and human rights abuses, according to Oxfam. A ""relentless"" drive for retailer profits is fuelling poverty, abuse, and discrimination, the charity said. Poor conditions were rife on farms that supply supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, it added. But the British Retail Consortium said retailers were ""spearheading actions"" intended to improve millions of lives. Oxfam conducted research in India and Brazil, and surveyed workers in five other countries. Workers on 50 tea plantations in Assam told Oxfam that cholera and typhoid are ""prevalent because workers lack access to toilets and safe drinking water"". Half the workers questioned got ration cards from the government due to low wages, while female employees regularly worked for up to 13 ""back-breaking"" hours a day, it said. Workers in Assam told Oxfam that cholera and typhoid are ""prevalent"" due to unsanitary conditions. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi all source tea from those suppliers, while Asda-owner Walmart would neither confirm nor deny whether it did, the charity said. Oxfam found that, of the 79p paid by shoppers for a 100g pack of black Assam tea in the UK, supermarkets and tea brands receive 49p while workers collectively received 3p. The charity said workers on the Assam estates could earn a living wage if they were paid 5p more of the retail price. Workers on fruit farms in Brazil told Oxfam they had developed skin conditions from using pesticides without adequate protection. Women on those grape, melon and mango farms also said they had to rely on government handouts outside of harvest season. Those farms supply supermarkets including Lidl and Sainsbury's, and previously Tesco and Morrisons, the charity said. Walmart again neither confirmed nor denied links. Female employees in Assam regularly worked 13-hour ""back-breaking"" days, Oxfam said. Rachel Wilshaw, Oxfam ethical trade manager, said: ""Despite some pockets of good practice, supermarkets' relentless pursuit of profits continues to fuel poverty and human rights abuses in their supply chains. ""Supermarkets must do more to end exploitation, pay all their workers a living wage, ensure women get a fair deal and be more transparent about where they source their products."" A separate Oxfam survey of more than 500 workers in the Philippines, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Peru and the US found three quarters of workers saying they were not paid enough to cover basic needs such as food and housing. More than a third said they were not protected from injury or harm at work and were not able to take a toilet break or have a drink of water when they needed it. An Oxfam spokesperson said abuses in supermarket supply chains were ""endemic"". However, Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said: ""Supermarkets in the UK are spearheading actions aimed at improving the lives of the millions of people across the globe who contribute to the retail supply chain. ""Our members are working hard to address existing injustices and continue to collaborate internationally with NGOs [non-governmental organisations], business groups and government on this vital issue."" Meanwhile, Oxfam ranked supermarket giants on their sourcing policies, with all showing an improvement compared with last year. Tesco, which was at the top of the pile, was given a score of 38%. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""This is the second year in a row that Tesco has been assessed by Oxfam as doing most, of all major supermarkets globally, to ensure human rights are respected in food supply chains."" It said its tea was Rainforest Alliance certified and that it was ""committed to improving the lives of tea workers and ensuring minimum working conditions."" It added: ""We know there is always more to do and we are working collaboratively with NGOs, trade unions and others to improve wages in the key produce, tea and clothing sectors and ensure working conditions are fair."" An Aldi spokesperson said: ""We continue to work hard to ensure every person working in our supply chain is treated fairly and has their human rights respected. ""We share the values behind Oxfam's campaign and are in regular dialogue with them."" Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing?

During FMQs Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said there was a suspicion there had been a co-ordinated attempt to block the trip. Mr Carlaw, in tears, asked Nicola Sturgeon to give the controversy her personal attention. Nicola Sturgeon said she hadn't seen any evidence of obstruction, but that she was willing to speak personally to Dr Dionysios Veronikis as the government still wants him to come to Scotland. The first minster also pointed out no vaginal mesh implants have been carried out in Scotland since the chief medical officer ordered a halt last October. That's all from Holyrood Live on Thursday 10 October 2019, we're back after the recess. MSPs back the general principles of theNon-Domestic Rates (Scotland) Bill,external. 97 voted for it and 6 abstained. MSPs pass the Transport (Scotland) Bill,  meaning plans for a levy on workplace parking will become law. 56 MSPs backed it, 29 voted against and 18 abstained. An attempt by Labour to remove the parking levy aspect was defeated during a debate on Wednesday. The same fate befell a series of amendments proposing exemptions from the car park tax. The bill will also shake up bus services, introduce low emission zones in cities and ban parking on pavements. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Independent schools like Albyn in Aberdeen could be affected Ministers plan to""enhance"" the business rates systemthrough the Non-Domestic Rates (Scotland) Bill. The reforms include ending the relief which many independent schools have been able to claim as charities. Some within the sector fear this will directly lead to schools raising fees, offering fewer bursaries or closing. Non-domestic rates are levied on business properties, determined by the assessed value of the building, and are the second-highest source of tax income for the Scottish government. Read more. Plans by the Scottish government to introduce more frequent business rate revaluations will fail unless a ""more modern"" tax system is delivered, a business lobby group warned in September 2018. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said modernisation should include a new ""digital rates interface"". It argued the move would help firms pay bills, apply for reliefs, lodge appeals and submit data. FSB was responding to a consultation on proposed business rates legislation. Read more. Leisure centres, some golf clubs, private schools and universities should be brought fully under the business rates system, according to a review. TheBarclay Report into non-domestic rates,externalalso recommended that childcare centres should be exempt. The system had faced strong criticism, particularly from hospitality firms. The review was commissioned by the Scottish government in March 2016 and headed up by Ken Barclay, former head of Scottish operations for RBS. Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur agrees with many of the concerns and analysis that Andy Wightman has just outlined. The Barclay review was ""hobbled in its scope"", adds Mr McArthur, who goes on to say the risk in trying to fake localism is you create more of a mess. He calls for power over rates to be ceded to local authorities, giving them the clout to shape their own communities. The Lib Dem MSP says his party backs a  land value system could generate economic benefits and insists this is not a major bill, rather it is a small bill. Green MSP Andy Wightman says there has been no reform to local tax since 1992 and he therefore welcomes the introduction of a bill. However, he says it only focuses on technical measures and he criticses the fact the Barclay review only asked one question and had to be revenue neutral. He confirms the Greens will be bringing forward amendments on: But Mr Wightman says the Greens major concern is that the bill removes this tax base from its history owners - local government - and therefore violates international law. He confirms his party will abstain this evening. More than 400 bank branches, shops and local businesses have closed or have been winding down in Scotland since the start of 2016, new figures show. The Federation of Small Businesses is calling for measures to reverse the closures, averaging nine a month. In a report, it says the Scottish and UK governments must invest in projects to make towns better places to work, live and run a business. The group also wants a commission to tackle the rise in vacant properties. Read more. Ms Boyack criticises the tight remit of the Barclay review. She highlights an urgent need for incentives for low carbon
investment. The Labour MSP warns that tax avoidance corrodes public
trust and she calls for an approach to prevent repeat offenders. Leading for Labour, Sarah Boyack says non-domestic rates are a vital part of funding local services. Ms Boyack says her party welcomes the broad thrust of the bill but believe it is a missed opportunity. She welcomes: Regarding independent schools, Mr Fraser says there is an inconsistency in providing a relief to private-run nurseries but removing it for schools. It is disappointing that the large business supplement will not be reduced by this bill he adds, suggesting it is losing Scotland business. Tory MSP Murdo Fraser says he generally welcomes the bill, though suggests in some areas it does not go far enough. It does not implement all Barclay review recommendations, he notes, such as removing the tax concession for ALEOs which could have introduced the ""swim tax"". He welcomes to move towards a three-year revaluation schedule, as well as some of the reliefs proposed. The Tory MSP wonders if the next revaluation could be brought forward a year to 2021, but the minister intervenes to say there needs to be time to implement the reforms. The committee's report on the Non-Domestic Rates Bill also: James Dornan says the Local Government and Communities Committee endorsed the Non-Domestic Rates Bill. The committee convener welcomes the switch to a three year cycle for revaluations. He welcomes the minister pledging to look at fees for appeals. The SNP MSP pivots to ending the tax relief independent schools have been able to claim as charities. Mr Dornan argues this is a change the sector will be able to adapt to. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Forbes says reforms to the appeal system is perhaps the most important and ambitious part of this package. Without doing so, we risk negating any benefit from the other changes she suggests. Regarding the plan to scrap independent schools being exempt from rates, the minister says the different rates treatment between independent and state schools is unfair. She urges MSPs to back the general principles of the bill. MSPs have backed a major reform of the business rates system, including a plan to strip independent schools of charitable status. The local government committee concludes the Non-Domestic Rates Bill would facilitate a ""more modern and fair ratings system"". And while it backed the view that independent schools should no longer be able to claim charitable status, the Conservative members dissented from this conclusion. Convener James Dornan said: ""We recognise the strength of feeling from the independent school sector about the Billâs proposal to remove charitable rates relief from them. ""However, we believe this will level the playing field with state schools and generate vital funds for local authorities at a time of increasing demand on their services.""

"UK set to avoid recession despite poor AugustAlthough the economy unexpectedly contracted in August, it is still expected to avoid a recession.","TV and film production has helped to boost the economy The UK's economy is expected to avoid a recession after showing better-than-expected growth in the three months to the end of August. The Office for National Statistics said the economy would now have to shrink sharply in September for the third quarter to show an overall contraction. In three months, the economy grew by 0.3% as weak manufacturing was offset by buoyant TV and film production. Even so, the economy unexpectedly shrank in the month of August by 0.1%. The growth figures are being watched closely for signs of recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction - afterthe economy shrank in the second quarter for the first time since 2012. The next quarter runs until the end of September so the August data is the second month in the third quarter. What is the UK's GDP? Although the economy contracted in August, the ONS revised up its forecast for growth in July from 0.3% to 0.4%. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that this revision meant ""fears that the economy is already in recession have been banished"". The ONS said the economy would now have to contract by 1.5% in September alone for the UK to slide in to recession. The ONS uses the monthly data to compile a rolling three-month picture of GDP. It said that in the first half of 2019 the data had been volatile because of preparations for the original Brexit date in March, which had sparked some stockpiling. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said: ""Growth increased in the latest three months, despite a weak performance across manufacturing, with TV and film production helping to boost the services sector. ""Services provided [the] majority of the growth over the three months, with production and manufacturing falling back,"" he said. Over the three months the services sector - which makes up roughly 80% of GDP - grew by 0.4%, following a period of largely flat growth in the previous three months. The ONS said the production sector fell by 0.4% in the same period, while construction output grew by 0.1%. For August, economists had been expecting zero growth. But the ONS data showed it contracted, dragged lower by a drop in manufacturing when car production was subdued. Only the construction sector expanded during the month, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. Manufacturing contracted by 0.7% while the all-important services sector failed to grow. He described the August data as ""disappointing"". TV and film production - such as filming of The Crown -  enabled GDP to grow by 0.3% in the three months to August, more than compensating for activity languishing across the board in that month alone. But that is not sufficient reason to cheer. As the Bank of England has highlighted, growth has lost momentum over the past year and the economy is limping rather than flying. Part of this is undoubtedly Brexit related - with business investment suffering amidst the prolonged uncertainty. A failure of firms to spend on factories and machines will have long-reaching implications. This is one reason why economists are pulling down their forecasts for next year too. But it is also unhelpful that growth in some of our biggest trading partners, such as Germany, has run into problems. The bright spot remains job creation - but that too could falter. This sluggishness ignited a mood shift among policymakers. Even those members of the Bank's interest rate panel who previously favoured a rise in the cost of borrowing now think their next move could be a cut - deal or no deal. The question for them, grappling with as much uncertainty as the rest of us, is when. The data sparked some economists to revise up their expectations for the third quarter. Mr Wishart said the the economy could grow by 0.4% in the third quarter, more than he had originally expected. However, John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said that while the data ""has put to bed fears of the UK economy falling into recession in the third quarter of 2019"", he was cautious about the future. He said there could be ""problems ahead in the fourth quarter as heightened Brexit-related uncertainty takes a toll on both business investment and consumer confidence."" Uncertainty about Brexit was also mentioned by Mr Williamson. who expects the UK to expand by 1% in 2019 but by just 0.5% in 2020. ""These growth projections assume a Brexit delay beyond 31st October and that the UK and EU will eventually achieve a comprehensive agreement on future relations. However, a no-deal Brexit would likely throw the UK into a prolonged recession,"" he said. UK facing 'heightened risk of recession' How fast is the UK's economy growing?

Trump to speak to immunity row crash death suspect,"This video can not be played Mr Trump called Harry Dunn's death a ""terrible accident"" A woman at the centre of a row over diplomatic immunity will not return to the UK, according to briefing notes held by US President Donald Trump. Anne Sacoolas is suspected of being involved in a car crash that killed British motorcyclist Harry Dunn, who died in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Mrs Sacoolas later left the UK to return home to the US, after telling local police she had no such plans. The note was photographed as Mr Trump addressed reporters at the White House. It reads: ""(If raised) Note, as Secretary Pompeo told Foreign Secretary Raab, that the spouse of the US government employee will not return to the United Kingdom."" Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the US's apparent approach was ""beyond any realm of human thinking"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking to Sky News about the photograph of the notes, Mrs Charles said: ""I'm just disgusted. ""I don't see the point in Boris Johnson talking to President Trump, or President Trump even taking a call from Boris Johnson. ""If he'd already made his decision that if it were to be asked and if it were to be raised, the answer was already going to be no."" Downing Street confirmed Mr Johnson had urged the US president to reconsider the decision to grant immunity to Mrs Sacoolas. At the press briefing, Mr Trump called Mr Dunn's death a ""terrible accident"" and confirmed his administration would seek to speak to Mrs Sacoolas. Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo Police have said CCTV of the crash in which the teenager died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road. Speaking at the press briefing on Wednesday evening - after his conversation with the prime minister - Mr Trump said: ""The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen. ""You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did. ""So a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity, we're going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet."" About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It means that, in theory, they cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. However, where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List. Drivers, cooks and other support staff who have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity. Read more Speaking in Northampton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the use of diplomatic immunity in the case was ""completely unacceptable"". He said: ""We would put every possible bit of pressure we could on the United States and if we could mount legal action on the United States, we would do so."" The crash in which Mr Dunn died happened close to RAF Croughton, a US Air Force communications station, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan worked. Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley said, ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"". Crash death parents 'let down' by governments PM's plea to US to rethink immunity over crash Mr Dunn's parents are planning to travel to Washington DC as soon as possible. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the UK was ""getting the brush-off"" from the US as a result of ""cuddling up"" to Mr Trump. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Thornberry said the UK had been ""holding his hand... and being a Trump tribute act"", which flattered the president who is ""only interested in himself"". She said although it was ""very unusual"" for the prime minister to ask for assistance from the president, Britain needed to ""hold its head a bit higher and look Donald Trump in the eye and be clear about what it is we want"". By James Robbins, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent The speaking note which the president held in his hand seems to be confirmation the United States simply will not agree to the return of Anne Sacoolas to the UK. Whatever the rights and wrongs of their case, that has always been and seems likely to remain the American position. Why? Washington has a whole raft of unstated motives. They simply don't want the spouse of this particular ""US government employee"" exposed to questioning, particularly, but not exclusively, because of the likely nature of his work in super-secret military communications routed through RAF Croughton. More broadly, the Americans are determined not to encourage any country to believe they will succeed in requesting a waiver of diplomatic immunity. After all, if we don't do it for our first among allies, the UK, what chance has any other country got. And, most broadly of all, America's idea of its own ""exceptionalism"" means it hates the idea of offering up any citizen for trial in a foreign court - that is, by anyone other than fellow Americans. This video can not be played Dunn family on Raab meeting: ""We feel let down"" Number 10 said the prime minister had urged Mr Trump to reconsider the decision to allow Mrs Sacoolas immunity in order that ""the individual involved can return to the UK, co-operate with police and allow Harry's family to receive justice"". The teenager's parents have described a meeting with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday as a ""publicity stunt"". Mrs Charles said she felt ""let down"" by both the UK and US governments, while Mr Dunn's father Tim Dunn said: ""I'm deeply, deeply disappointed that they think it's OK to kill a young lad on his bike and they can just walk away.""

Johnson and Varadkar set for further Brexit talksThe talks come as EU leaders express pessimism over whether a deal can be reached by 31 October.UK Politics,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar agree they can ""see a pathway to a possible deal"" after talks, Downing Street says. The leaders spoke for over two hours, including a one-to-one discussion during a walk in the grounds of Thornton Manor in north-west England. Mr Varadkar said Thursday's ""positive"" meeting was ""sufficient to allow negotiations to resume in Brussels"". Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet the EU's Michel Barnier on Friday. On Wednesday,EU leaders accused the UK of proposing untested ideas, adding that progress had been limited. A crunch EU summit next week on 17 and 18 October is seen as the last chance for the UK and EU to agree a deal ahead of 31 October deadline. Kuenssberg: Something has changed - but there are miles to go Corbyn: No Brexit referendum before election EU leaders criticise UK Brexit proposals How are the UK's talks with the EU going? After the meeting, Mr Varadkar told reporters the talks were at a ""very sensitive stage"" but were ""very positive and very promising"". He said he was now ""convinced"" the UK wants an agreement, saying: ""I do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks."" However, issues remain over ""consent and democracy"" and ensuring there is no customs border, Mr Varadkar said. The Brexit proposals from Mr Johnson include a provision for the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians to be sought every four years - meaning the arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely. This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: Brexit talks 'very promising' ""It remains our position that there can't be a hard border between north and south,"" Mr Varadkar added. ""No one's cracking open the champagneâ¦ don't even pour a pint of warm Guinness,"" joked one of the few people familiar with what actually happened on Thursday after talks between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar. Nothing that happened in the privacy of a country house wedding venue on the Wirral means there will be a deal with the EU in the next seven days. Nothing has made the obstacles in the way of reaching an agreement magically disappear. But something has changed today. After days of various EU players publicly scorning the UK's proposals, explaining the objections and lamenting the weaknesses, there is a tangible willingness, on the bloc's side at least, to see seriously if they can work. We've discussed here so many times why Ireland's attitude matters so much, so the very public positivity from Mr Varadkar - his ""maybe"", instead of ""no"" to Mr Johnson's proposals - is extremely important. There is hardly any detail out there of the compromises or concessions that might be actually in play to make a deal work. Don't give too much credence to even the best informed speculation that's already whirring online as to how it could happen. Read more from Laura A joint statement said the prime minister and Taoiseach (Irish leader) had a ""detailed and constructive discussion"". ""Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody's interest,"" the statement said. ""They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal."" The talks concentrated on ""the challenges of customs and consent"", Downing Street said. ""They agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them."" Mr Johnson put forward fresh proposals for a Brexit deal last week, but Mr Varadkar had previously said ""big gaps"" remained between the UK and the EU. Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who has responsibility for the UK's no-deal preparations, said: ""I have to prepare for every eventuality but I'm hopeful following the good conversation that they had that we can make good progress in the days ahead."" Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith told BBC Northern Ireland's The View he was ""delighted to see the positivity that came out of the meeting"". He said the ""mood music and developments are really, really positive"". Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? The prime minister has insisted the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month. That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October. EU heading for no-deal by mistake, Jeremy Hunt warns How could a no-deal Brexit happen? On Wednesday, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom suggested the PM was gearing up to bypass legal obstacles to a no-deal Brexit by sending one letter requesting an extension and, in the same instance, submitting a second memo telling European leaders he does not want one. Asked on ITV's Peston programme whether the idea of sending two letters to the EU was a possible loophole, Ms Leadsom replied: ""Absolutely."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button In a speech in Northampton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated that his party would agree to a general election as soon as no-deal has been taken ""off the table"", as the PM ""can't be trusted not to break the law"". He alsoaccused Mr Johnsonof ""using the Queen"" to deliver a ""pre-election Tory party political broadcast"" at next week's state opening of Parliament. He told party supporters that the government had ""no obvious means"" of getting new laws passed, and holding a Queen's Speech before an election was a ""cynical stunt."" Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Special sitting of Parliament and the date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

Wrightbus fate 'to be known in hours'English industrialist Jo Bamford is understood to have made a bid for the Ballymena-based company.,"Wrightbus went into administration last month after a period of financial difficulties The fate of Wrightbus will be known in hours, Ian Paisley MP has said. The Ballymena business was placed into administration last month and is up for sale. The English industrialist Jo Bamford, son of JCB chairman Lord Bamford, is understood to have made a bid for the company. However, the ownership of the Wrightbus factory, at Galgorm just outside Ballymena, remains a barrier to an overall resolution. The union, Unite, said the deadline to resolve the current impasse over site ownership was now 10:00 BST on Thursday. Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure The premises are owned separately from the manufacturing business and held in a company called Whirlwind Property Two, which is not part of the Wrights group and is therefore not under the control of the administrator. The property company is controlled by Jeff Wright, the former owner of Wrightbus. Mr Paisley said the land remained the final hurdle to the deal, and Mr Bamford was not going to invest tens of millions of pounds if he did not control the asset. The Unite union has said the livelihoods of 1,200 workers hang in the balance ""This is the last chance and I really hope that a deal can be done,"" the Democratic Unionist Party MP said. ""The banks have accepted it, the administrators have accepted it and now the bell tolls for the landlord. ""At teatime tonight this deal effectively ceases to exist and sometime tomorrow I believe the administrator will be forced to liquidate this company."" About 1,200 jobs were lost after the company failed to find a new owner before it went into administration. ""This is theÂ eleventh hour in theÂ effort to save these jobs,"" said Unite's George Brash. ""Unite is calling on Jeff Wright to do the right thing - by thisÂ workforce, by their families, and by this town."" Wrightbus workers gather near the factory, hoping for some good news Wrightbus went into administration last month after a period of financial difficulties. Pre-administration attempts to sell the business were also complicated by the factory ownership issue. The Wright family said it had not acted unreasonably during that sales process. It said that one bidder had agreed to rent the factory, but then later withdrew the offer.

Ban and tax our way out of obesity - top doctor,"This video can not be played People in Manchester give a mixed response to banning snacks on public transport Snacking should be banned on public transport and extra taxes placed on unhealthy foods to tackle child obesity, England's outgoing chief medical officer says. In her final report as CMO, Dame Sally Davies also called for tighter rules on advertising and takeaways. She said children needed more help as they were ""drowning in a flood"" of unhealthy options. If ministers were not bold, she added, they would fail to cut obesity rates. A target to halve rates by 2030 has been set. Will we see radical action to tackle child obesity? Dame Sally said: ""The unavoidable fact is that over time our environment has become very unhealthy without us realising. ""Our children are now suffering from painful, potentially life-limiting disease. ""Our politicians need to be bold and help everyone embrace healthier life choices."" The proportion of obese and overweight children has doubled in the past 30 years. Today around a third are obese or overweight by the age of 11 in England - with a minority, but growing number, classed as severely obese. The problem is most acute among girls - where the UK has one of the highest rates in the world. There are signs the increase has begun to level off, but among the most deprived communities rates are still increasing Children living in the poorest tenth of areas are more than twice as likely to be obese than those in the richest. Obesity increases the risk of a range of diseases from cancer and heart disease to diabetes. In fact, until recently type two diabetes was considered an adult problem, but now there are more than 100 new cases each year among children. How to help a child eat healthily What to do if your child is overweight Record number of severely obese children Dame Sally has put forward a wide range of measures. Some are about extending existing policies, while others are completely new. They include: Phasing out all marketing, advertising and sponsorship of unhealthy food and drink Banning food and drink on local transport with exceptions for water, breast-feeding and medical conditions Free water refills to be available at all food outlets, transport stations and public sector buildings Regular car-free weekends across the country to encourage physical activity Changing planning rules to make it harder to open fast-food takeaways Extending the sugar tax to include milk-based drinks Adding VAT to unhealthy food products that are currently zero-rated, such as cakes Capping calories in food served out-of-the home to combat rising portion sizes Consider plain packaging - as for tobacco - for junk food, if firms fail to reduce sugar, fat and salt in their products quickly enough All nurseries, registered childminders and schools to adopt water and milk-only policies The most eye-catching announcement is the proposed ban on eating and drinking on public transport. This is squarely aimed at children on the way to and from school and so will only apply on local transport - trains, buses, trams and metro networks. Inter-city trains with buffet cars will not be covered, the CMO said. The idea is to discourage snacking. The ban will also apply to adults - she wants them to model good behaviour to children. And she is suggesting there are exemptions for people who need to eat or drink because they have medical conditions that require them to. Breast-feeding would also be allowed, while everyone will be able to drink water. Dame Sally said tax was an important lever for ministers. She highlighted the success of the sugar tax - a levy which has been applied on sugary drinks since last year. Figures released last month showed that it had reduced sugar consumption by more than a fifth through a combination of people choosing lower sugar drinks and industry changing the sugar content of products. The fall came despite an increase in sales, and means the equivalent of 30,000 tonnes of sugar a year have been taken out of the nation's diet. But Dame Sally wants the government to go further by extending the tax to cover milk-based drinks. She also wants some anomalies in the VAT system to be tackled. Food is generally not taxed, but some unhealthy ones are, adding 20% to the price. It means that a gingerbread man with chocolate-covered trousers is subject to VAT, but not if it only has chocolate eyes. Cakes, flapjacks and corn chips are zero-rated, but chocolate biscuits, cereal bars and crisps are not. Unhealthy foods are big business for advertisers. Around Â£300m a year is spent on promoting soft drinks, confectionery and sweet and savoury snacks - that's nearly half of the total spend on food and drink advertising. By comparison just Â£16m goes on fruit and vegetables. There are already restrictions on junk food advertising on TV and online. But Dame Sally wants to go further, calling for a complete ban on unhealthy food and drink advertising. The government in England published its lastobesity strategy,externalin 2018. The goal is to halve rates by 2030. None of the headline measures recommended by Dame Sally are part of the current measures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock praised the work of the outgoing CMO, saying she had ""done more than anyone to promote the health of the nation"" over the past decade. He said ministers would study the recommendations ""closely"". But there are doubts about how reforming a government led by Boris Johnson will be in this area. He has already expressed scepticism about so-called sin taxes such as the sugar levy, although a policy paper published just before he became prime minister did suggest the sugar levy could be extended to milk-based drinks. Both Wales and Scotland have published obesity plans in recent years, but neither of these were as radical as Dame Sally's proposals. But she has still received the backing of health experts. Sally Warren, of the King's Fund think tank, said: 'The government should make full use of all the levers at its disposal to tackle obesity. ""Some politicians may baulk at the idea of the 'nanny state', but research suggests these types of intervention may enjoy stronger public support than they often assume."" Professor Dame Parveen Kumar, of the British Medical Association, said the government would ""let down"" children if it did not act. Child obesity: Will we see radical action?

"Two die in working men's club blazeThe men were rescued from the fire at the club in Morecambe but died soon after, police say.Lancashire","Ten fire engines initially attended the fire Two men have died in a fire at a working men's club in Lancashire. The men were rescued from Gordon Working Men's Club on Springfield Street, Morecambe but died a short time later, police said. Ten fire engines, including appliances from Cumbria, two helicopters and three road ambulances, were called after the blaze broke out at 14:45 BST.

Johnson 'fails to answer Arcuri questions'The London Assembly criticises the PM's response to its inquiry into his contacts with the US businesswoman.,"Boris Johnson spoke at four of Jennifer Arcuri's events in London when he was mayor Boris Johnson is under fire for failing to provide details of his contacts with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri to a London Assembly inquiry. The PM responded to the assembly's request for information on Tuesday. But the assembly said the letter it received - marked ""confidential and not for publication"" - did not answer any of its questions. Mr Johnson denies claims of a conflict of interest over his friendship with Ms Arcuri when he was London mayor. The assembly had asked for details and a timeline of all contact between the pair, including private text messages and emails. A London Assembly spokeswoman told the BBC the letter ""doesn't answer any of the questions we asked"", adding: ""I can't understand why it is labelled confidential."" No 10 responds to Arcuri details request No 'favouritism' over Johnson links, Arcuri says Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? The assembly is now seeking legal advice over whether members of its oversight committee can discuss the contents of the letter at their meeting next week. In a statement, Len Duvall, Labour chairman of the committee, said: ""We did finally receive a response from Boris Johnson, through his solicitors, which they have indicated may not be published. At this stage we are respecting that, but we are seeking further clarification. ""Nothing in the response, in our opinion, reflects the need for confidentiality. In fact, the response is insufficient as far as our request for information is concerned. ""We are focused on our investigation and considering next steps. A number of options are open to us; they include speaking to various people and using our power of summons."" Len Duvall says his committee is considering its next move He said the committee was liaising with the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which has been asked to consider whether Mr Johnson, who as mayor was responsible for policing in London, should be investigated for misconduct in public office. Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: ""With an issue as serious as potential abuse of public office, it is absolutely in the public interest that this letter be published. ""Boris Johnson might think he is above the law but he cannot hide from scrutiny."" If the PM fails to answer the assembly's questions, added Mr Trickett, ""he is showing contempt for the inquiry and the people of this country."" Mr Johnson held the office of London mayor between 2008 and 2016. According to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story, technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor and received thousands of pounds in public money. It is also understood she attended events on two of the trade missions - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri: ""I'm not going to put myself in a position where you can weaponise my answer"" Ms Arcuri told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mr Johnson was ""a really good friend"" who had spoken at event she organised - but denied the then mayor had shown any ""favouritism"" towards her. The code governing conduct at London City Hall states that public office holders should not act in any way to gain benefits for families or friends, and should declare private interests to resolve any conflicts. The prime minister has denied breaking any rules of conduct and insisted everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". Separately, the current Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked a senior lawyer to review a 2013 decision by London and Partners, the mayor's promotional agency, to sponsor a conference organised one of Ms Arcuri's companies, for Â£10,000. London and Partners say they have found no evidence of Mr Johnson's involvement in the decision. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is, meanwhile, ""reviewing"" a Â£100,000 grant made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's cyber-security business Hacker House.
