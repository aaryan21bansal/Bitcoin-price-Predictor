The pair, aged 25 and 32, went into cardiac arrest after crossing the finishing line. About 20,000 people took part this year - which was the race's 15th anniversary. Run 4 Wales chief executive Matt Newman said: ""This is a terrible tragedy for the families. Our deepest sympathies go out to their family and friends."" He added: ""Everyone connected with the race is devastated. ""They unfortunately become the first fatalities in the 15 year history of the race."" The men were treated on the finishing line before being taken to Cardiff's University Hospital Wales. South Wales Police said the men's next-of-kin had been notified.

Young with deposits cannot afford homes,"About 40% of young adults cannot afford to buy one of the cheapest homes in their area even with a 10% deposit,according to a new research.,external The Institute for Fiscal Studies said house prices in England have risen by 173% over two decades. But average pay for 25-34 year-olds has grown by just 19% over the same period. In 1996, 93% of those with a deposit who borrowed four and a half times their salary could purchase a home but that fell to 61% in 2016. Young people face renting 'all their lives' How housing has divided the young 'They cram as many people in as they can' The IFS also said that higher rental costs - up from an average Â£140 a week to Â£200 a week in England - have ""reduced the purchasing power of young adults' incomes"" and made it harder to save for a deposit. Bradley Tucker, a 27-year-old recruitment worker from King's Langley in Hertfordshire, is struggling to save for a deposit. He and his partner have moved from a rented flat to a shared house, so they can start to save something. But while his dad - a bricklayer - managed to buy a house after just one year, Bradley estimates it will take them at least a decade. ""On a current trajectory, the cheapest deposit is Â£15,000 to Â£20,000, so you're looking at 10 years plus,"" he told the BBC. ""For young people, it seems an almost impossible challenge. It's a depressing outlook."" Onward, a think tank, has suggested that the government should give UK private renters a chance to buy their home by rewarding landlords who sell to long-term tenants. It says buy-to-let properties should be eligible for 100% capital gains tax relief if sold to a sitting tenant who has lived there for three years. Onward says the average gain per property would be Â£15,000, or Â£7,500 for both the landlord and tenant, helping those tenants to apply for a mortgage. Housing organisations recommend spending no more than 30% of your salary on rent. The average rent of a 1-bedroom home exceeds this for twenty-somethings in two-thirds of Britain.    Contains OS data Â© Crown copyright and database rights 2018. Scroll down for methodology. Insufficient data is available for Northern Ireland. The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) said it welcomed the idea of lower taxation, but said landlords would prefer to get tax relief on rent from long-term tenancies, or a refund of Stamp Duty. The centre right think tank estimates 88,000 households would be eligible to take up the relief each year, costing the Treasury around Â£1.32bn a year. A spokeswoman for the Treasury declined to comment. The IFS said that the proportion of 25-34 year olds who own a house has dropped from 55% two decades ago to 35%. Meanwhile, the rate of homeownership for those aged between 65-74 years old has risen gradually to around 80%. Polly Simpson, a research economist at IFS and a co-author of the study, said: ""Many young adults cannot borrow enough to buy a cheap home in their area, let alone an average-priced one. These trends have increased inequality between older and younger generations."" The IFS said that it is key for the government to increase the supply of homes. It said that planning restrictions, such as within the Green Belt, prevents the construction of new homes in response to demand. ""Without increasing supply, policies to help young adults get onto the housing ladder will continue to push up house prices - and potentially rents too, which would hurt those young adults who will never be able to buy their own home,"" it said. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that 1.1 million properties had been built since 2010. They said: ""This government is committed to helping more people get on the housing ladder and last year saw the highest number of first time buyers for over a decade.""

SNP would back 'People's Vote' on Brexit,"This video can not be played Sturgeon: SNP MPs would back new Brexit vote SNP MPs would back a new Brexit referendum if it were put to them, party leader Nicola Sturgeon has said. Campaigners have been pressing for a fresh vote on whatever exit plans result from talks with EU leaders. PM Theresa May has rejected calls for a so-called People's Vote and while Labour has not ruled it out, it wants a general election to decide the issue. Ms Sturgeon said SNP MPs would oppose anything short of staying in the single market and customs union. Neither choice features in the plan backed by the cabinet at Chequers in July, which the prime minister insists is the only credible option to avoid a ""no-deal"" scenario. EU leaders said last month that Mrs May's proposed new economic partnership ""will not work"". However, they have struck a more optimistic note in recent days. Juncker says chance of Brexit deal has increased Brexit: what happens next? Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said on Sunday that the ""chances [of a deal] are good"" before the UK is due to withdraw from the bloc on 29 March. ""The withdrawal treaty is already about 90% agreed in terms of text... what is needed now is the two negotiating teams need to lock themselves in a room for the next 10 days or so,"" he told Sky News. The People's Vote campaign wants the public to have the final say on any deal. On Sunday hundreds of dog-owners marched their pets through central London to support the calls. Dog-owners in London took part in a ""Wooferendum"" march to call for a People's Vote Actor Peter Egan and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy were among those addressing a rally in Parliament Square. Ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who marched with his five-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, claimed politicians were ""scared"" of another referendum. Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that her MPs would back calls for another public vote. Speaking ahead of the SNP conference in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said the UK was heading for a ""cobbled together"" exit agreement that would be ""almost as unacceptable as no deal at all"". Any deal would be put to MPs in a vote at Westminster, as well as having to be ratified by the remaining EU member states. ""In those circumstances, sensible MPs of all parties should come together to look at the alternative,"" she said. ""No doubt calls for a second referendum would grow in those circumstances, and I've said before we wouldn't stand in the way of a second referendum. I think SNP MPs would undoubtedly vote for that proposition."" Campaigners, such as these marching in Liverpool last month, are calling for another vote on the EU to be held In an age of political shocks, Nicola Sturgeon backing a new EU referendum won't count as one of the biggest. The party had always said it was open to the idea, even if it still has concerns you could end up with another situation where Scotland votes Remain, but ends up bound by a UK-wide result. It makes the SNP - with its 35 MPs - the biggest party in Parliament to back a so-called ""people's vote"". But the Commons numbers who have committed to supporting one still remain a small minority. The government has ruled one out. Labour says it's still an option - but it isn't their preference. So campaigners who want the public to have its say on the final deal still have a lot of work to do if they are to get their wish.

Can violent men ever change?,"Notes from what perpetrators have said on the course Every year more than a million people are victims of domestic abuse in the UK. Often the focus is on helping the victim find safety - but what of the abusers? Should they be given help? And can they change? Andrew found himself wanting to change when he faced the prospect of losing his family. He had been abusive to his partner, Emma, injuring her a number of times. After his violence escalated, he moved out and Emma struggled to cope with their children. They were later removed from their care. Emma was offered courses to support her as she tried to move on from the abusive relationship and rebuild her self-esteem. However, Andrew was looking for something for himself. He wanted to stop abusing his partner and sought help. He found Phoenix Domestic Abuse Service, which offered a weekly programme to help men confront their actions and change their behaviour. Andrew took part in the course Andrew remembers his first time at Phoenix, walking into a room full of ""big blokes, mean looking blokes"" and thinking ""Oh, what have I done?"" But after seven months on the course he has formed a bond with the group and says he is beginning to understand the effects of his behaviour. Every week he was challenged on his behaviour and had to confront his actions. The course uses role-play, problem-solving tasks, and challenging discussions to teach the men about the impact of their actions. ""I'm not proud of who I was then, but I am proud of who I am now,"" he says. Emma says she recognises the transformation in Andrew. ""He's different. We talk more, he listens,"" she says. They were separated for two years but are now together again and are working to get their children back. Emma took part in a victim's support group Lidia, who helped Andrew through the course, said it is important to intervene because ""if no one does any work with that person then they are likely to go on and find another victim. ""Their next relationship is likely to become abusive."" Phoenix sees both sides of abusive relationships on a weekly basis, believing the abuser and the abused partner both need support - either together or apart - if they hope to break out of the violent cycle. But not everyone has such positive experiences of domestic abuse courses. Sarah - not her real name - did not see any change in her partner when he was referred to a programme by her local authority. ""If anything it made him angrier,"" she says. The abuse continued, both throughout and after the course. ""[It was] seriously bad violence,"" she says. ""Strangling you, picking you up by your hair, throwing you across rooms, smashing your head into walls."" She thinks the courses are not enough to make meaningful change and abusers will only reform with years of therapy. Rachel Williams is an advocate for survivors ""Their whole brain needs unpicking. It's got to be long-term mental health intervention, not a six-week course, because they are so manipulative they will pull the wool over people's eyes."" She says she feels let down by the system. She has not been offered any significant support to protect her from her abusive partner, she says, adding that he knows where she lives and continues to harass her and her children. She doesn't feel the perpetrator programme held her abuser to account. It is estimated that every year more than 3,000 people in the UK attend such courses - and that number is growing each year. Cafcass, the Family Courts Support Service, made 800 referrals last year, four times as many as five years ago. The vast majority of those who attend are men. Costs start at around Â£500, with that figure being picked up by either local authorities or individuals. Some courses target the perpetrator alone, while others run parallel courses for their partners. However, the debate rages as to which approach works best. Dr Gene Feder is conducting the first clinical trial of a perpetrator course. ""If you ignore perpetrators you're really ignoring the upstream origin of the problem,"" he says. ""If you just respond to survivors you're in some ways colluding in the repeated cycle of violence which goes on."" Rachel Williams is a survivor of domestic abuse, she was with her husband for 18 years and the abuse she suffered escalated over time. When they separated he came to the salon where she worked with a sawn off shotgun and shot her in the leg at point blank range. Denise has been working with perpetrators of abuse for more than twenty years Rachel is now an advocate for survivors and hears from lots of women seeking support. She has heard of abusers using the courses in court to claim they have changed, despite continuing to abuse and manipulate their partners and even blaming their partners for having to go on a course. She thinks people do not understand the true effect of domestic violence and how clever and manipulative abusers can be. ""We need to keep monitoring them. The only people who can tell if they have changed is their new partner."" Denise has been running a perpetrator course for more than 20 years. She says those who want to change should be given the opportunity to do so. ""There are going to be some people out there who cannot change and will not change, for a variety of reasons. ""But those that want to, those that are willing to give it a go, they need to be given the opportunity and I think for those people, yes they can change.""

Tina Turner reveals wedding night ordeal,"Tina and Ike Turner, pictured in 1972 Legendary American singer Tina Turner has described how she was forced to watch a live sex show on the night she married blues musician Ike Turner.

There would be no fancy wedding though. Instead, he drove them from California across the Mexican border into Tijuana to find ""the Mexican version of a justice of the peace"", she told the Mail. But the day got worse and she described being miserable and close to tears throughout the sex show. ""People can't imagine the kind of man he was - a man who takes his brand new wife to a live, pornographic sex show right after their marriage ceremony,"" she said. Tina Turner, pictured here in 2017, has lived in Zurich for many years But she said she then presented an image of the happy young bride when they returned to Los Angeles.

In her autobiography, I, Tina, in 1986, she revealed how he physically abused her throughout their marriage. He acknowledged some of it, saying in his own autobiography: ""Sure I've slapped Tina. There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I never beat her."" Tina Turner's life has been immortalised in the hit West End show Tina: The Musical.

Brazil exit polls give Bolsonaro wide lead,"Jair Bolsonaro (left) and Fernando Haddad will face each other in a run-off A far-right candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, has won the first round of Brazil's presidential election. He will face the left-wing Workers' Party candidate, Fernando Haddad, in the second round on 28 October after he failed to win the 50% of valid votes needed to win outright. With almost all the votes counted, Mr Bolsonaro had 46% and Mr Haddad 29%. Opinion polls conducted before the election predicted that in a second round the two candidates would be tied. A Trump for the Tropics? The man who would be Lula Basics on Brazil Mr Bolsonaro's once insignificant Social Liberal Party (PSL) is poised to become the largest force in Congress following legislative elections held alongside the presidential vote, in what analysts have described as a seismic shift in Brazilian politics. The politician and the PSL have ridden a wave of rising anger at the Workers' Party, which their supporters blame for a prolonged recession, rising violent crime and widespread corruption in South America's largest economy. In his victory speech, broadcast live on Facebook and uploaded on to Twitter,external, he said Brazilians could take the path of ""prosperity, liberty, family, on God's side"" or the path of Venezuela. Brazil's socialist-led neighbour is mired in a deep economic and political crisis which has driven more than two million people to leave. Across Latin America this has become a popular campaign strategy: don't vote for the left or you will end up like Venezuela. This video can not be played Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro has won Brazil's presidential election. But who is he? The former army captain has made provocative statements on a huge range of issues. He has pledged tough punishments for offenders and the relaxing of gun ownership. He has also spoken of torture as a legitimate practice and wants to restore the death penalty. His hard-line approach to law and order has brought back memories of the two-decade military dictatorship, and earned him backing from the military and those demanding greater safety ina country with rising levels of violent crime. Jair Bolsonaro has strong support within the armed forces Misogynistic and homophobic rhetoric has prompted outrage and protests, and he has taken a strong anti-abortion stance. Like Mr Trump, Mr Bolsonaro has criticisedthe Paris climate agreement, and he has vowed to make Brazil great again. Economically, he favours a smaller state. He has announced plans to lower taxes, privatise state companies and limit foreign ownership of natural resources. The candidate believes selling off companies will help fight government corruption - one of the focuses ofOperation Car Wash, a massive corruption investigation. Mr Bolsonaro was stabbed on the campaign trail, drawing intense media attention to him and his policies. Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent Jair Bolsonaro expected to win the presidency in this first round, even if the polls said otherwise. ""On the 28th October, we can all go to the beach,"" he said, as he turned up to vote on Sunday. His supporters had been saying for weeks that their candidate would win this straight out. Mr Bolsonaro may have soared in the polls recently but Brazilians are going to have to wait another three weeks to find out whether it'll be him or Fernando Haddad as Brazil's new leader. Brazil feels very divided - and fragile. You could feel it when you talked to voters. So many people have told me they would be voting for the ""least worst"" candidate. On one side, there are those determined never to allow the Workers' Party to rule again; on the other, those desperately trying not to allow a far-right candidate to rule this young democracy. A feeling of nervousness hangs over Brazil - and will do for the next few weeks as both candidates ramp up their campaigning once again. The future of Brazil will vary greatly, depending on who eventually wins. He has won over many Brazilians who think his law-and-order stance will make Brazil safer. A Roman Catholic, he has also attracted the support of millions of evangelical Christians by saying he will defend traditional family values. Supporters of Jair Bolsonaro celebrated outside his home in Rio de Janeiro Several prominent Brazilian footballers have endorsed his candidacy including World Cup winner Ronaldinho,  Palmeiras midfielder Felipe Melo and Tottenham Hotspur winger Lucas Moura. Results showed Mr Bolsonaro dominating Brazil's two biggest states, SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. However, the country's north-east showed more loyalty to the Workers' Party, having benefited from its social policies. Centre-left presidential candidate Ciro Gomes got the most support in the state of CearÃ¡, where he has lived for most of his life. In Sao Paulo, Mr Bolsonaro's son Eduardo was re-elected as a state deputy, receiving more votes than any other lower-house candidate in Brazil's history. Eduardo Bolsanaro has previously tweeteda photo of himself and former chief strategist to US President Donald Trump, Steve Bannon,external- who, he says, is ""in touch"" with his father's campaign to help fight ""cultural Marxism"". Mr Bolsonaro said that he was certain that if there had not been ""problems"" with the electronic voting system used in Brazil, he would have won outright. Brazil's electoral authorities have said the vote went ahead peacefully and without any major problems. Fernando Haddad was visibly relieved that there would be a second round He has portrayed himself as a trusted candidate for those who baulk at Mr Bolsonaro's style and rhetoric. After reaching the second round, he said he and the Workers' Party would ""only use arguments, we don't use any guns"". Referring to Mr Bolsonaro's lead, he said he felt ""challenged by the results, which alert us to the risks Brazilian democracy is facing"". ""We need to approach this with a sense of responsibility,"" he told his cheering supporters. ""We want to unite the democrats of this country, to reduce inequality and to achieve social justice."" He said he and his party had been presented with ""a golden opportunity"" by making it into the second round.

Whittaker a hit with Doctor Who fans,"Jodie Whittaker with (left-right) Mandip Gill, Tosin Cole, Bradley Walsh and Sharon D Clarke The 13th Doctor has landed. Or, rather, crash-landed through a train roof, fully introducing Jodie Whittaker as the first female Time Lord. Whittaker's first episode as the Doctor drew the programme's biggest series launch viewing figures in 10 years. The show saw an average of 8.2 million viewers in its new Sunday teatime slot. After her first episode, many fans took to social media to give Whittaker's portrayal of the Doctor their approval. Whittaker's first outing as Doctor Who, which has moved from a Saturday night slot, saw more people tuning in than for the debuts of her predecessors Peter Capaldi and Matt Smith. This makes the broadcast the most-watched, according to overnight ratings, since David Tennant's 2008 series opener - which garnered an audience of 8.4 million. The first episode featuring a female Doctor was always going to draw a big audience. But last night's figure of 8.2 million has exceeded many people's expectations - the biggest Doctor Who overnight figure in almost five years, and the biggest overnight audience for a Doctor Who series launch in 10 years (the first episode of David Tennant's final series got slightly more with 8.4 million). It's significant not just because, obviously, large numbers of people chose to tune in, but because it underlines with hard stats the overwhelmingly positive social media reaction in declaring the new Doctor Who with Jodie Whittaker as being a huge success. And in an era where catch-up viewing for a show like Doctor Who typically adds millions to an overnight figure, BBC One will be thrilled with how the first episode has performed. Still, the true test will be what happens over the remainder of the series. A (not too big) fall in the figures will still count as big success, as inevitably some will have only viewed out of curiosity over the show's new era. And it's possible, if perhaps unlikely, that it could even perform like BBC drama Bodyguard which started off well and massively increased its overnight viewers as the series progressed. Viewers were quick to take to social media to give their feedback on the show's first female Doctor. Comments ranged from""A breath of fresh air"",externalto""This is everything the show was ever meant to be"",externaland ""Jodie has nailed it at the first attempt,external"". Allow Twitter content?

Whittaker's Doctor was first seen hurtling out of the burning Tardis in the Christmas special, and she finally landed at the start of Sunday's series opener.

The West Yorkshire-born former Broadchurch actress was wearing Capaldi's outfit for most of the episode, and addressed her status as the first female Doctor early on. When someone told her she was a woman, she replied: ""Am I? Does it suit me? Oh yeah, I remember. Half an hour ago I was a white-haired Scotsman."" There was also a thinly-veiled message to any sceptical fans when her character said at one point: ""Don't be scared. All this is new to you and new can be scary."" Allow Twitter content?

Graham Linehan was told by West Yorkshire Police not to contact Stephanie Hayden. She reported him for referring to her as a ""he"", and for tweeting the names she used before transitioning. Miss Hayden, 45, is now suing the writer. Mr Linehan, 50, told the BBC he is also considering taking action against her. Stephanie Hayden is pursuing civil proceedings against the writer The row comes amid a continuing debate about gender recognition in the UK. Currently, if someone wishes to have their gender identity legally recognised, they have to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate - which requires a medical diagnosis. Some argue the medical element should be removed and say there should be a system of gender recognition based on self-identification. But not all agree, with some ""gender critical"" people believing the system could be abused by predatory men. Do trans rights affect women's rights? Beyond 'he' and 'she' Consultation on changing legal gender Mr Linehan - also known for writing Black Books and The IT Crowd - had given his backing to a support group of trans women who are opposed to self-identification and said he would back their campaign on social media. Miss Hayden was also a member of the group, saying she is also gender critical, but said she had never met Mr Linehan. An internal row saw the group disband, but led to a number of acrimonious tweets between Mr Linehan and Miss Hayden. This included the Irish writer retweeting a post giving her previous names with pictures, and Miss Hayden tweeting Companies House information which revealed Mr Linehan's home address. Miss Hayden, who is pursuing civil proceedings accusing him of harassment, defamation and misuse of private information, told the BBC: ""I spoke to the police for 45 minutes about how I wanted to go forward. ""I didn't think he was a physical threat, but thought if the police spoke to him and advised him with a warning, he would possibly realise the hurt he had caused. ""The point I want to get across is this isn't about free speech, this is about harassment. ""He is perfectly entitled to say his subjective opinions, but he is not allowed to publish details about me."" Mr Linehan, who said he was speaking to his lawyer on Monday about possibly taking action against Miss Hayden, told the BBC: ""The police phoned me and told me to stay away. ""I would love to keep Stephanie away from me and my family and I have no intention of speaking to Stephanie. But he defended his stance of referring to Miss Hayden as ""he"", adding: ""I will call all of my trans friends 'she'. ""I think of them as women, they are respectful and are not misogynists. ""But I refuse to respect the pronouns of misogynists."" Do trans rights affect women's rights?

"Whittaker a hit with Doctor Who fansAfter her first full episode, most viewers on social media give the new Doctor a big thumbs up.Entertainment & Arts","Jodie Whittaker with (left-right) Mandip Gill, Tosin Cole, Bradley Walsh and Sharon D Clarke The 13th Doctor has landed. Or, rather, crash-landed through a train roof, fully introducing Jodie Whittaker as the first female Time Lord. Whittaker's first episode as the Doctor drew the programme's biggest series launch viewing figures in 10 years. The show saw an average of 8.2 million viewers in its new Sunday teatime slot. After her first episode, many fans took to social media to give Whittaker's portrayal of the Doctor their approval. Whittaker's first outing as Doctor Who, which has moved from a Saturday night slot, saw more people tuning in than for the debuts of her predecessors Peter Capaldi and Matt Smith. This makes the broadcast the most-watched, according to overnight ratings, since David Tennant's 2008 series opener - which garnered an audience of 8.4 million. The first episode featuring a female Doctor was always going to draw a big audience. But last night's figure of 8.2 million has exceeded many people's expectations - the biggest Doctor Who overnight figure in almost five years, and the biggest overnight audience for a Doctor Who series launch in 10 years (the first episode of David Tennant's final series got slightly more with 8.4 million). It's significant not just because, obviously, large numbers of people chose to tune in, but because it underlines with hard stats the overwhelmingly positive social media reaction in declaring the new Doctor Who with Jodie Whittaker as being a huge success. And in an era where catch-up viewing for a show like Doctor Who typically adds millions to an overnight figure, BBC One will be thrilled with how the first episode has performed. Still, the true test will be what happens over the remainder of the series. A (not too big) fall in the figures will still count as big success, as inevitably some will have only viewed out of curiosity over the show's new era. And it's possible, if perhaps unlikely, that it could even perform like BBC drama Bodyguard which started off well and massively increased its overnight viewers as the series progressed. Viewers were quick to take to social media to give their feedback on the show's first female Doctor. Comments ranged from""A breath of fresh air"",externalto""This is everything the show was ever meant to be"",externaland ""Jodie has nailed it at the first attempt,external"". Allow Twitter content?

Whittaker's Doctor was first seen hurtling out of the burning Tardis in the Christmas special, and she finally landed at the start of Sunday's series opener. She fell to Earth in the middle of an alien invasion in Sheffield, and picked up three new companions - played by Tosin Cole, Mandip Gill and Bradley Walsh - along the way. Allow Twitter content?

The West Yorkshire-born former Broadchurch actress was wearing Capaldi's outfit for most of the episode, and addressed her status as the first female Doctor early on. When someone told her she was a woman, she replied: ""Am I? Does it suit me? Oh yeah, I remember. Half an hour ago I was a white-haired Scotsman."" There was also a thinly-veiled message to any sceptical fans when her character said at one point: ""Don't be scared. All this is new to you and new can be scary."" Allow Twitter content?

McDonnell: Universal credit has to go,"The government's flagship welfare policy faces being scrapped by Labour because it is ""just not sustainable"", the shadow chancellor has said. John McDonnell said universal credit, which merges six working-age benefits into one payment, ""will have to go"". Labour announced at its party conference last month that it would review the system, which is being rolled out across the UK. The Tories said Labour had not offered a credible alternative. What is universal credit? Universal credit is aimed at making the system simpler so people who are able to work are rewarded for doing so. But it has been criticised for running over budget and causing delays to people's payments. Labour has previously pledged to pause the rollout of the scheme to fix what it says are flaws in the system. At the Labour conference, Mr McDonnell told a fringe event that the ""message we're getting back"" from the consultation was that it should be scrapped. He went further on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, saying he had been listening to people's views and the government's arguments, but ""the reforms haven't worked"". ""I think we're at that stage now that it's not sustainable any more. It's not a system that can work. ""It's not a system that's providing the safety net that people expect when they need support. ""I think we are moving to a position now where it is just not sustainable. ""It will have to go. ""I think we are moving towards a conclusion now that you can't save the thing, it's got to go."" Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis defended the scheme, describing it as ""the right way to go"". He did not deny a report in the Times that Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey privately warned cabinet colleagues that half of lone parents and about two-thirds of working-age couples with children would lose the equivalent of Â£2,400 a year under the new benefit. Responding to Mr McDonnell's comments, a Conservative spokesman said it was an unfunded spending pledge to scrap the payment, adding: ""By scrapping universal credit, a programme which has helped deliver record employment, Labour would return to the record of previous Labour governments, every one of which left more people out of work. ""Conservatives on the other hand believe in social mobility and supporting aspiration and people into employment."" In a separate interview with the BBC's Sunday Politics London, Mr McDonnell said Labour would consider reducing the working week to four days. Asked whether Labour agreed withunion leaders' proposalsfor a four-day week, Mr McDonnell said the party would be exploring ""a whole range of issues about automation"", and as part of that ""we'll look at the working week because I think people are working too long"". The shadow chancellor said the TUC report stressed the need for workers to benefit from automation in the future and ""that might be reducing hours of work - we are a long-hour economy."" Asked if it would be in a future Labour manifesto, he replied: ""We'll see how it goes."" How are universal credit rules changing? Could a basic income replace Universal Credit?

Second death linked to Pret sandwich,"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, also died after suffering an allergic reaction to a Pret sandwich, in 2016 A second customer is believed to have died from an allergic reaction to a product bought from Pret a Manger, the chain has said. The person died in 2017 after eating a ""super-veg rainbow flatbread"" which was supposed to be dairy-free. Sandwich chain Pret said it was mis-sold a guaranteed dairy-free yoghurt, as it contained dairy protein. But the company who sold Pret the yoghurt denied that it is to blame and said the ""true cause"" is unknown. It comes after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15,died after eating a Pret a Manger baguette in 2016. Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death? 'People can die' - allergy sufferers speak out The second customer died on 27 December last year after buying the sandwich from a store in Stall Street, Bath. Pret said the yoghurt in the product was supplied by Coyo - a coconut milk brand which is stocked in shops and supermarkets across the UK. The chain said it withdrew all affected products as soon as it was made aware of the incident by Bath and North East Somerset Council. A Pret spokesman said subsequent testing by Pret and two independent authorities found the Coyo dairy-free yoghurt contained traces of dairy protein. ""This is believed to have resulted in the tragic death of a customer from an allergic reaction in December 2017,"" he said. Pret then ended its relationship with Coyo and is in the process of taking legal action, he added. In February this year,Coyo recalled all of its dairy-free coconut yoghurtsafter they were found to contain dairy. The vegan brand was investigated by the Food Standards Agency and the London Borough of Bexley - where Coyo is based - before it issued an allergy alert. But in a statement on Sunday, Coyo denied it was to blame for the death. It said the contamination of its yoghurts in February was not related to the Pret case, and urged against speculation. ""The claims made by Pret are unfounded,"" it said. ""The dairy-free product we provided to Pret in December 2017, at the time of this tragedy, is not linked to the product we recalled in February 2018. ""The product recalled in 2018 was made with a contaminated raw material that was only supplied to us in January 2018. ""Pret's inability to provide us with a batch code, despite several requests, has severely limited our ability to investigate this further."" Allow Twitter content?

Coyo added that it will continue to assist in the case to find the ""true cause"". ""We urge all parties to work together, and not to speculate on the cause of this tragic death which is unknown as far as we are aware and is still being investigated by the coroner's court,"" the company added. Following the incident in February, Coyo previously said it was ""devastated"" to discover dairy in its yoghurts, ""especially as being dairy-free sits at the heart of everything we do"". It said it had carried out a ""thorough review"" of its ingredients and identified that the contaminated material was provided by an external third-party supplier, whose relationship had now been terminated. By Joe Miller, business reporter, BBC News Pret made its name on the High Street with slogans such as ""freshly prepared, lovingly handmade"" - a concerted effort to differentiate itself from the average fast food joint. A page on its website is even entitled ""Doing the right thing: It's what makes Pret, Pret"". So the twin blows to its reputation - two deaths apparently due to allergic reactions to its food - strike at the very heart of the 32-year-old brand and it may explain why in this instance the chain has been so quick to point the finger at one of its former suppliers, Coyo. Unsurprisingly, Coyo, whose carefully curated social media feeds talk about ""trust"" and whose products are marketed as being integral to leading ""nourished lives"", has been quick to punch back. Coyo, as a younger, smaller, company, is perhaps more susceptible to reputational damage. But even Pret, which has grown exponentially over the last decade and has seen global sales rise year after year, will know that such headlines could eventually threaten its bottom line. The spokesman for Pret said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of our customer in this terrible case and we will seek to assist them in any way we can."" On Sunday, the family of Miss Ednan-Laperouse, who died from an allergic reaction to a Pret sandwich, said they were ""incredibly saddened"" to hear of a second death. ""Our hearts go out to the bereaved family."" The teenager, from Fulham, south-west London, suffered a fatal allergic reaction on a flight after eating a sandwich from a Pret store at Heathrow Airport in 2016. Pret announced it would list all ingredients on its freshly-made productsfollowing her death. Milk allergy is one of the most common allergies for children, but most grow out of it by the time they start school,the NHS says.,external For adults, it is rare - with one in every 200 adults estimated to have a cow's milk allergy, according to theAnaphylaxis Campaign charity.,external It is caused when the body's immune system wrongly perceives some of the proteins in cow's milk to be a threat. Symptoms can develop within minutes and can include redness, hives and puffiness around the mouth and eyes as well as vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea in some cases. In more serious cases, there may be an anaphylactic reaction which includes swelling in the mouth or throat, wheezing, coughing or a fall in blood pressure leading to collapse. According to the charity, a splash of milk on the skin can cause immediate symptoms in some cases. Inhaling cow's milk protein - for example when milk is being heated or prepared - can also cause reactions among some people. A milk allergy is not the same as lactose intolerance, which is a digestive problem.

SNP would back new Brexit referendum,"This video can not be played Sturgeon: SNP MPs would back new Brexit vote SNP MPs would back a new Brexit referendum if it were put to them, party leader Nicola Sturgeon has said. Campaigners have been pressing for a fresh vote on whatever exit plans result from talks with EU leaders. PM Theresa May has rejected calls for a so-called People's Vote and while Labour has not ruled it out, it wants a general election to decide the issue. Ms Sturgeon said SNP MPs would oppose anything short of staying in the single market and customs union. Neither choice features in the plan backed by the cabinet at Chequers in July, which the prime minister insists is the only credible option to avoid a ""no-deal"" scenario. EU leaders said last month that Mrs May's proposed new economic partnership ""will not work"". However, they have struck a more optimistic note in recent days. Juncker says chance of Brexit deal has increased Brexit: what happens next? Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said on Sunday that the ""chances [of a deal] are good"" before the UK is due to withdraw from the bloc on 29 March. ""The withdrawal treaty is already about 90% agreed in terms of text... what is needed now is the two negotiating teams need to lock themselves in a room for the next 10 days or so,"" he told Sky News. The People's Vote campaign wants the public to have the final say on any deal. On Sunday hundreds of dog-owners marched their pets through central London to support the calls. Dog-owners in London took part in a ""Wooferendum"" march to call for a People's Vote Actor Peter Egan and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy were among those addressing a rally in Parliament Square. Ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who marched with his five-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, claimed politicians were ""scared"" of another referendum. Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that her MPs would back calls for another public vote. Speaking ahead of the SNP conference in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said the UK was heading for a ""cobbled together"" exit agreement that would be ""almost as unacceptable as no deal at all"". Any deal would be put to MPs in a vote at Westminster, as well as having to be ratified by the remaining EU member states. ""In those circumstances, sensible MPs of all parties should come together to look at the alternative,"" she said. ""No doubt calls for a second referendum would grow in those circumstances, and I've said before we wouldn't stand in the way of a second referendum. I think SNP MPs would undoubtedly vote for that proposition."" Campaigners, such as these marching in Liverpool last month, are calling for another vote on the EU to be held In an age of political shocks, Nicola Sturgeon backing a new EU referendum won't count as one of the biggest. The party had always said it was open to the idea, even if it still has concerns you could end up with another situation where Scotland votes Remain, but ends up bound by a UK-wide result. It makes the SNP - with its 35 MPs - the biggest party in Parliament to back a so-called ""people's vote"". But the Commons numbers who have committed to supporting one still remain a small minority. The government has ruled one out. Labour says it's still an option - but it isn't their preference. So campaigners who want the public to have its say on the final deal still have a lot of work to do if they are to get their wish.

Speaking on Sunday, Joanna Cherry MP said Scotland would not necessarily have to have a second independence referendum to leave the United Kingdom. The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman at Westminster suggested independence could be achieved through a ""democratic event"", like a general election.

China confirms Interpol chief detained,"This video can not be played Meng Hongwei's wife shares husband's final ""knife emoji"" text The detained Chinese head of Interpol, Meng Hongwei, is being investigated for alleged bribe-taking, Chinese authorities have announced. Mr Meng was first reported missing in late September after travelling from Interpol HQ in France to China. His wife has revealed that he sent her a text message with a knife emoji on the day he went missing. Mr Meng is the latest high-profile target to be ensnared in China's sweeping anti-corruption campaign. He is also a vice-minister for public security in the country. In its announcement of the investigation, China's Public Security Ministry said the probe was ""correct, wise and shows the determination of [President Xi]'s administration to continue its anti-corruption drive"". Interpol is the global policing agency that co-ordinates between police forces around the world, including searches for missing and wanted persons. Interpol's general secretariat oversees the day-to-day work of the 192-member organisation, with the role of the president largely ceremonial. Charting China's 'great purge' under Xi China punished 'million' for corruption China's new anti-corruption super agency After Mr Meng's disappearance was made public on Friday, speculation had mounted that he had been taken into custody. A number of top Chinese government officials, billionaires and even an A-list celebrity have vanished in recent months. Last week, actress Fan Bingbing,who disappeared in July, emerged with a public apology and a fine of 883 million yuan ($129m; Â£98.9m) for tax evasion and other offences. But correspondents say that Mr Meng's high-profile position at Interpol was once seen as a prize for Beijing, raising questions about whom he might have angered or what he might have done to be targeted as part of President Xi's anti-corruption blitz. In a statement on Twitter on Sunday,,externalit said it had received Mr Meng's resignation with immediate effect. Under its terms it has appointed senior vice-president Kim Jong-yang of South Korea as acting president. A new president will be elected for the remaining two years of Mr Meng's mandate at the general assembly in Dubai next month. On Saturday, the international police agency urged China to clarify Mr Meng's status, saying it was concerned about the well-being of its president. There has been no word from him on the charges he faces. French authorities have opened an investigation and have placed Mr Meng's wife under police protection after she received threats. Grace Meng did not want to be identified out of fear for her safety Grace Meng, speaking shortly before China's confirmation of the detention, had told journalists she thought he was in danger. She issued an emotional plea for international help to find her husband. On the day he went missing, she said he had sent her a social media message telling her to ""wait for my call"", before sending a knife emoji, signifying danger. With her back to the cameras to avoid being identified out of fear for her safety, she held back sobs to read out a statement in Chinese and English. ""We are always connected by [our] hearts. He would support me in doing this. The matter belongs to fairness and justice. The matter belongs to the international community. The matter belongs to the people of my motherland."" Analysisby Robin Brant, in Beijing Meng Hongwei became a vice-minister of public security in 2004 When Meng Hongwei was appointed two years ago, one newspaper here wrote that it would ""promote understanding abroad of China's justice system"". This is probably not what was envisaged back then. His ""resignation"" and apparent detention makes it clear that it's the laws of China - and the rules of its governing Communist Party - that trump all else for any government official. Even if they're appointed to a job in France. China's new National Supervision Commission - an anti-corruption agency - said Mr Meng was being investigated for ""violation of laws"". Importantly it didn't mention - as is often the case with high-profile detentions like this - the charge of ""violating party rules"". The anti-corruption body has targeted thousands of people in a relentless drive led by President Xi Jinping. There are also rumours that Mr Meng may have been purged because of his links to another senior party figure out of favour with the leadership. The investigation into Mr Meng has raised some concern that international institutions will be reluctant to appoint Chinese officials to high positions - something Beijing has pushed for in recent years. Chinese nationals hold top positions at several global institutions including the UN, IMF, World Bank and Unesco. But Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing said while he believes the current case is not likely to affect future appointments, it does have an impact on China's image on the international stage. ""There's obviously going to be some bad publicity around this and it's not like China doesn't care about this,"" he said. ""But whatever they want Mr Meng for has in this case trumped their concern for international public opinion."" Long read: The thoughts of Chairman Xi He was elected Interpol president in November 2016, the first Chinese person to take up the post, and was scheduled to serve until 2020. He headed the organisation's Executive Committee, which provides overall guidance and direction. Mr Meng has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing in China, notably in the fields of drugs, counter-terrorism and border control. After his election, human rights groups expressed concern that the move could help China pursue political dissidents who have fled the country.

Saudi writer 'murdered' in consulate,"Jamal Khashoggi has not been seen since lunchtime on Tuesday Fears are growing over the missing Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi, after Turkish officials said they believed he had been murdered. Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi national, was last seen visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Tuesday. A Turkish official told the BBC that initial investigations indicated he was murdered there. Saudi Arabia has denied the accusations, saying it is ""working to search for him"". Mr Khashoggi has contributed articles to the Washington Post's opinion section.The Post said it would be a ""monstrous and unfathomable act"",externalif he had been killed. An official of Turkey's ruling AK Party told broadcaster CNN Turk there was concrete evidence in the case, although none has yet been presented. Jamal Khashoggi went to the consulate on Tuesday to obtain a document certifying he had divorced his ex-wife, so that he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz. Saudi woman activist 'faces death penalty' Saudi Arabia to punish online satire Saudi Arabia's missing princes Ms Cengiz said she waited outside for 11 hours, but he did not come out. Jamal Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e Hatice waited outside the Saudi consulate on Wednesday She said Mr Khashoggi was required to surrender his mobile phone, which is standard practice in some diplomatic missions. He told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not return. ""Jamal is not dead. I cannot believe that he has been killed...!"" Ms Cengiz wrote in a Twitter post that included a photo of Mr Khashoggi. She added that she was waiting for official confirmation as the allegations circulated. Allow Twitter content?

Turkish officials said Mr Khashoggi was killed on the premises and his body was then removed. Investigators said a 15-person team arrived at the consulate on Tuesday, returning to Riyadh the same day. The head of the Turkish-Arab Media Association, Turan Kislakci, told the New York Times thatTurkish police officers providing security for the consulate had checked their security cameras and did not see the journalist leave on foot,external. But he added that diplomatic cars had been seen moving in and out. Mr Erdogan was more circumspect, saying on Sunday he remained ""positive"" and would await the results of an investigation as Turkish authorities continue to look at camera footage and airport arrivals and departures. Saudi Arabia said the allegations were baseless. It has allowed reporters into the consulate to show Mr Khashoggi is not there. On Wednesday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News thatTurkish authorities were welcome to search the building,externalbecause ""we have nothing to hide"". The prince said the Saudis were ""very keen to know what happened to him"", saying his understanding was that Mr Khashoggi left ""after a few minutes or one hour"". The Saudi consulate said Khashoggi left after completing paperwork Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed? When asked if Mr Khashoggi faced charges in Saudi Arabia, the crown prince said his country would need to know where he was first. Analysis by the BBC's Mark Lowen, Istanbul This is a bombshell allegation by Turkey. And while the authorities here are so far not providing evidence to back it up, it's inconceivable that such a claim would have been made without firm grounds. Ankara's relationship with Riyadh is too important to jeopardise on the basis of unsubstantiated rumour. That relationship is already strained over several issues, including Turkey's support for Qatarin the blockade by Saudi Arabia; its closeness to the Muslim Brotherhood - blacklisted by Riyadh as a terrorist organisation; and its rapprochement withSaudi Arabia's arch-rival Iran. But if proven, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi would be the most serious diplomatic crisis between the two in living memory. Turkey would hope for backing from its Nato ally, the US. But Saudi Arabia has arguably become Donald Trump's closest ally in the Middle East - and Washington may be reluctant to weigh in against Riyadh at this stage. He is a high-profile critic of the crown prince. Mr Khashoggi, 59, has more than 1.6 million Twitter followers and has written for the Washington Post opinion section. The crown prince has unveiled reforms praised by the West while carrying out an apparent crackdown on dissent. Human and women's rights activists, intellectuals and clerics have been arrested - meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is waging a war in Yemen that has triggered a humanitarian crisis. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: Saudi Arabia needs reform, but one-man rule is ""bad"" for the kingdom A former editor of the al-Watan newspaper and a short-lived Saudi TV news channel, Mr Khashoggi was for years seen as close to the Saudi royal family. He served as an adviser to senior Saudi officials. After several of his friends were arrested, his column was cancelled by the al-Hayat newspaper and he was allegedly warned to stop tweeting, Mr Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia for the US, from where he wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and continued to appear on Arab and Western TV channels. ""I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,""he wrote in September 2017,external. ""To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison.

Father Ted writer given harassment warning,"Graham Linehan is also behind TV shows Black Books and IT Crowd. The co-creator of Father Ted has been given a verbal warning by police for alleged harassment following a row on Twitter with a transgender woman. Graham Linehan was told by West Yorkshire Police not to contact Stephanie Hayden. She reported him for referring to her as a ""he"", and for tweeting the names she used before transitioning. Miss Hayden, 45, is now suing the writer. Mr Linehan, 50, told the BBC he is also considering taking action against her. Stephanie Hayden is pursuing civil proceedings against the writer The row comes amid a continuing debate about gender recognition in the UK. Currently, if someone wishes to have their gender identity legally recognised, they have to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate - which requires a medical diagnosis. Some argue the medical element should be removed and say there should be a system of gender recognition based on self-identification. But not all agree, with some ""gender critical"" people believing the system could be abused by predatory men. Do trans rights affect women's rights? Beyond 'he' and 'she' Consultation on changing legal gender Mr Linehan - also known for writing Black Books and The IT Crowd - had given his backing to a support group of trans women who are opposed to self-identification and said he would back their campaign on social media. Miss Hayden was also a member of the group, saying she is also gender critical, but said she had never met Mr Linehan. An internal row saw the group disband, but led to a number of acrimonious tweets between Mr Linehan and Miss Hayden. This included the Irish writer retweeting a post giving her previous names with pictures, and Miss Hayden tweeting Companies House information which revealed Mr Linehan's home address. Miss Hayden, who is pursuing civil proceedings accusing him of harassment, defamation and misuse of private information, told the BBC: ""I spoke to the police for 45 minutes about how I wanted to go forward. ""I didn't think he was a physical threat, but thought if the police spoke to him and advised him with a warning, he would possibly realise the hurt he had caused. ""The point I want to get across is this isn't about free speech, this is about harassment. ""He is perfectly entitled to say his subjective opinions, but he is not allowed to publish details about me."" Mr Linehan, who said he was speaking to his lawyer on Monday about possibly taking action against Miss Hayden, told the BBC: ""The police phoned me and told me to stay away. ""I would love to keep Stephanie away from me and my family and I have no intention of speaking to Stephanie. But he defended his stance of referring to Miss Hayden as ""he"", adding: ""I will call all of my trans friends 'she'. ""I think of them as women, they are respectful and are not misogynists. ""But I refuse to respect the pronouns of misogynists."" Do trans rights affect women's rights?

Kanye West deletes social media profiles,"Kanye West at New York Fashion week in September 2018 Just when we were getting used to the regular stream of controversial statements spouted by Kanye West, he's disappeared from social media. It looks like he deleted his Twitter and Instagram accounts on Saturday night. The rapper,who wants to be referred to as Ye, recently came under fire for saying that the 13th amendment of the US Constitution, which brought an end to slavery, should be abolished - a statement that he later clarified. Apparently he meant to write ""amend"". And his performance on the American comedy show Saturday Night Live a few weeks agosparked outrage and amusement in equal measure. The singer, who is married to Kim Kardashian, wore a hat with Donald Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again"" and apparently gave an unscripted, off-air rant in support of the president to the audience. Excerpts filmed by the audience and shared on social media show the rapper discuss his support for President Trump, his pledge to run for president in 2020 and the need for a ""dialogue not a diatribe"" . ""So many times I talk to a white person and [they] say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'"" he said. ""Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago."" Kanye West wore one of Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" hats on Saturday Night Live This isn't the first time that Kanye has removed his social media accounts. He reappeared on Twitter in April after a year-long absence. On the same platform, he recently changed his profile name to Ye and asked that people refer to him by his new name. He was also using Twitter to try and be a peacemaker, byurging Colin Kaepernick to ""tell your experience directly"" to Donald Trump. The NFL quarterback was the first player to kneel during during the pre-game national anthem in 2016, kickstarting a campaign to highlight racial injustice in the United States. Kaepernick's been criticised by the US president, but awarded by Amnesty International and become the face of Nike's new advertising campaign.

Brawl after Nurmagomedov beats McGregor,"Khabib Nurmagomedov was escorted from the arena by police Ugly scenes marred UFC 229 as lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov began a brawl by the octagon after beating Conor McGregor. Seconds after landing a fourth-round submission, the Russian vaulted the cage and headed towards Irishman McGregor's team, prompting a melee. Meanwhile, McGregor was involved in a bust-up in the octagon with members of his opponent's team. Three of Nurmagomedov's party were arrested but later released. 'This is not my best side' - champion Nurmagomedov apologises for ugly scenes 'Bad for the brand and bad for the sport - White on UFC 229 chaos The BBC MMA Show podcast: A night to remember/forget UFC president Dana White said McGregor had refused to press charges. Earlier White could be heard telling the 30-year-old winner he could not receive his belt in the octagon as he feared it may incite trouble among those present at Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena. He later said the Nevada State Commission, which sanctioned the bout, has withheld Nurmagomedov's fight payment pending an investigation. ""I know if we put the belt on him [Nurmagomedov] in the octagon there'll be things thrown,"" said White. ""I just said let's just try and get him out of here. ""Police officers were getting punched, security guys were getting punched. I actually think police and security did an incredible job. Khabib jumped over the cage like one of those Parkour guys. What are you expected to do? "" McGregor appeared stunned and was quickly escorted away by his team, while heavyweight and light-heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier entered the octagon to seemingly try to calm Nurmagomedov, who left the arena flanked by police. What was billed as the biggest bout in UFC history, one set to break the organisation's pay-per-view record and where McGregor returned after a 693-day absence, will now prompt difficult questions for White and the company. How extraordinary UFC 229 unfolded in Las Vegas Listen to a replay of the fight every hour on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra UFC president Dana White tried to speak to a stunned McGregor in the aftermath of the contest Nurmagomedov largely dominated proceedings before administering a rear-naked choke, prompting McGregor to tap out with one minute and 57 seconds of round four remaining. The champion instantly shouted at the beaten man and then pointed at McGregor's team before exiting the ring and attacking Dillon Danis, a fighter who trains with McGregor. While the brawl took place, McGregor was involved in a bust-up in the octagon with one of Nurmagomedov's training partners. Nurmagomedov left the arena with fans throwing objects towards him, while White said he felt ""sick"" over the scenes. The rivalry between the fighters was evident between rounds as they often traded words BBC MMA Show presenter Nick Peet: After seeing that I'll be so surprised if Khabib isn't suspended and stripped of the belt, he caused a riot. He blew it, he completely lost control. To do it in front of 20,000 fans in Vegas in an environment that is being broadcast to the world. It's incredible. Khabib has let his team down, he's let his fans down. This is an absolute disgrace what he has done here. Former UFC fighter Dan Hardy on BBC Radio 5 live: I feel that because it was a one-sided fight, Khabib didn't have chance to get the respect of McGregor. Because Khabib has mauled McGregor for four rounds, he didn't get the closure he needed from the fight. As soon as he got back up, there was fight left in him and that's why he went for one of McGregor's men. Nurmagomedov used his renowned wrestling skills to dominate McGregor on the floor and won the contest with a choke The aftermath to the bout managed to overshadow one of the most acrimonious build-ups to a contest the UFC has seen. In McGregor's two years out of the Octagon his one-fight Â£76m foray into boxing -a defeat to Floyd Mayweather- further built his profile. Nurmagomedov - now unbeaten in 27 MMA bouts - added to his own reputation by landing the lightweight belt which once belonged to 'The Notorious'. When McGregor attacked a bus carrying his rival and UFC staff - prompting afive-day community service charge- the flames were fanned further. Unsurprisingly, the pair refused to touch gloves seconds before the contest. Actors including Mel Gibson and Matt Damon sat ringside, as did Northern Irish golfer Rory McIlroy and they saw Nurmagomedov - who began honing his renowned wrestling skills at the age of eight - take his rival down inside a minute. McGregor - pinned to the cage - survived for four minutes and though his coach told him Nurmagomedov could not improve on his opening five-minute segment, the champion and heavy pre-fight favourite flew out in round two, landing a superb overhand right. It staggered McGregor, who somehow withstood a ground and pound lasting close to two minutes to again make it to the end of the round. McGregor had never stopped an opponent after the second round in his UFC career and as he struggled to gain any sort of foothold, it appeared a flash knockout would be his best hope. He looked more threatening in the third and managed to repel takedown attempts but after again being pinned to the cage in the fourth, he eventually succumbed to a choke. Nurmagomedov, the first Russian and Muslim to win a UFC title, had delivered a dominant display but his immediate actions changed the mood and narrative instantly. McGregor was escorted back to his changing room while Nurmagomedov was still being calmed in the octagon Former world heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury:""What the average fan don't understand is it's showbusiness as well as a fight. Think how big a rematch could be."" Former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson:""Watching the @TheNotoriousMMA vs @TeamKhabib fight. Unimaginable never thought it would go down like this."" British cruiserweight Tony Bellew:""Conor lost the fight fair and square. Not a chance in the world he deserves to be attacked by two men! One in front and one from behind! Both bare knuckle after he's just been fighting for 20 minutes anyway. It's a disgrace. The coward jumping the cage is a disgrace. UFC have to deal with this."" UFC heavyweight and light-heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier:""Hey guys, two wrongs don't make it right. Conor didn't deserve that. No one did. But some things aren't for fight promotion. Religion, family, country. Throwing stuff in Brooklyn. For Khabib it wasn't fight promotion, it was really personal. Different culture man. Sucks.""

Father Ted writer given harassment warningPolice contacted Graham Linehan following a row with a trans women on social media.UK,"Graham Linehan is also behind TV shows Black Books and IT Crowd. The co-creator of Father Ted has been given a verbal warning by police for alleged harassment following a row on Twitter with a transgender woman. Graham Linehan was told by West Yorkshire Police not to contact Stephanie Hayden. She reported him for referring to her as a ""he"", and for tweeting the names she used before transitioning. Miss Hayden, 45, is now suing the writer. Mr Linehan, 50, told the BBC he is also considering taking action against her. Stephanie Hayden is pursuing civil proceedings against the writer The row comes amid a continuing debate about gender recognition in the UK. Currently, if someone wishes to have their gender identity legally recognised, they have to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate - which requires a medical diagnosis. Some argue the medical element should be removed and say there should be a system of gender recognition based on self-identification. But not all agree, with some ""gender critical"" people believing the system could be abused by predatory men. Do trans rights affect women's rights? Beyond 'he' and 'she' Consultation on changing legal gender Mr Linehan - also known for writing Black Books and The IT Crowd - had given his backing to a support group of trans women who are opposed to self-identification and said he would back their campaign on social media. Miss Hayden was also a member of the group, saying she is also gender critical, but said she had never met Mr Linehan. An internal row saw the group disband, but led to a number of acrimonious tweets between Mr Linehan and Miss Hayden. This included the Irish writer retweeting a post giving her previous names with pictures, and Miss Hayden tweeting Companies House information which revealed Mr Linehan's home address. Miss Hayden, who is pursuing civil proceedings accusing him of harassment, defamation and misuse of private information, told the BBC: ""I spoke to the police for 45 minutes about how I wanted to go forward. ""I didn't think he was a physical threat, but thought if the police spoke to him and advised him with a warning, he would possibly realise the hurt he had caused. ""The point I want to get across is this isn't about free speech, this is about harassment. ""He is perfectly entitled to say his subjective opinions, but he is not allowed to publish details about me."" Mr Linehan, who said he was speaking to his lawyer on Monday about possibly taking action against Miss Hayden, told the BBC: ""The police phoned me and told me to stay away. ""I would love to keep Stephanie away from me and my family and I have no intention of speaking to Stephanie. But he defended his stance of referring to Miss Hayden as ""he"", adding: ""I will call all of my trans friends 'she'. ""I think of them as women, they are respectful and are not misogynists. ""But I refuse to respect the pronouns of misogynists."" Do trans rights affect women's rights?

Clare Smyth, 40, grew up on a farm in County Antrim to become theworld's best female chefand cater for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding reception. She's the first and only woman to run the kitchen of a British restaurant with three Michelin stars and, this week, her first solo venture earned her two Michelin stars in its first year. We got the two together at Clare's restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, and asked Rosie to serve up the questions to her cooking idol. Rosie: When did you first know you wanted to be a chef? Clare: From the age of 14. I knew I wanted to be a chef at the top level. How did you cope with the long hours? I come from a farming family. Working long hours was part of my life so I was used to it. For young people starting out, you have to build up your tolerance. Young people are not used to standing on their feet all day. If you expect too much of them, you can put them off. What was your strategy to get to the top? I was quite calculating. I knew if I trained with the best chefs in the world [she's worked with Alain Ducasse, Thomas Keller and Gordon Ramsay] that would give me my best chance. How large is your kitchen team? There are 15 chefs at Core [Clare's London restaurant]. We do three lunches and five dinners over five days so staff are always guaranteed time off. It gives people time to do training which is really important for the restaurant to evolve. And it's my life so you can't just work yourself into the ground. What are your influences when creating a dish? Seasonality. We talk to our suppliers a lot. We're always trying to create something new - at the moment we're trying to create something that's as light as a feather - literally. Inspiration can come from anywhere. I collaborate with the head chef and the head of development. I get asked: ""Do you chop the onions?"" Does a conductor of the orchestra play the violin? Clare keeps every handwritten thank you note from guests, including the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, George Osborne and her mentor Alain Ducasse What does your target customer look like? We don't have one. Everybody should want to come to a fine dining restaurant. Some people can find that intimidating but I want to blow that apart. We do that by being incredibly welcoming and stripping away things people find pretentious - that comes down to the music we play, the language of the menu and no kitchen walls. What are you doing to be sustainable? Our choice is to buy British - from our plates (made by a 300-year-old company in Stoke-on-Trent) to our scallops. Our scallop diver is also a conservationist so we support him by always having scallops on our menu. The potato is a humble ingredient but by using our skill it can become much more than that. We have one dish that is carrot with lamb on the side. It's about getting people thinking differently. As a young woman being a chef can feel intimidating. How did you find this at the start of your career? I'm quite single-minded. If you want to achieve something, achieve it. Don't worry about what anyone else is doing. Do you struggle to find good female chefs to hire? I really try to encourage as many as possible to come in. We do have a few but not enough at all. Ultimately the job is based on merit, not gender at all. How has the industry changed? It's so much better than when I started - the working conditions, the hours and the way we treat the team. We value people more, getting time off, the way we speak to each other - it's all changed dramatically. Can you recommend any exciting new restaurants or chefs? New chefs? I always like to wait until they've proved themselves What are your tips for cooking at home? Buy quality in-season ingredients and you're on to a winner. If things are expensive, use more vegetables than fish or meat. There are lots of simple dishes and recipes. I know it's easy for me to say but cooking is really easy.

Clashes at German far-right rock concert,"About 700 neo-Nazis showed up for the concert Eight police officers in an east German town were slightly injured on Saturday night after they were pelted with bottles at a far-right rock concert. The concert, in the market place of Apolda, Thuringia, was halted after an hour because of the violence. Around 700 neo-Nazis attended the concert, which had been dubbed ""Rock Against the Overflow of Foreigners"". A counter-demonstration earlier in the day attracted a similar number of people. An ecumenical church service in protest at the concert was also held on Saturday, attended by Thuringia's first minister, minister of the interior and minister of the environment. The concert was legal, but the violence began as people began arriving for the concert. As well as bottles being thrown, police used pepper spray on at least one demonstrator who tried to jump the barrier checks. State police later tweeted that eight officers were slightly injured,externalbut had not needed hospital treatment. The concert had been moved to Apolda at the last minute after it was banned from being held as planned in a nearby city. Support for the far right is on the rise in eastern Germany. The arrival of more than one million refugees and asylum seekers since 2015 has divided the country. About 23% of voters in Thuringia support the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party,external, according to a recent opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster MDR. The co-leader of the AfD in Thuringia, BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke, has condemned the Holocaust memorial in Berlinand is well-known for inflammatory marks on refugees and race. Germany society has been deeply divided over the influx of more than one million migrants, mostly Muslims fleeing Middle East conflicts, after Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to let them in. Since then, policy changes have led to a sharp fall in the number of people seeking asylum.

May: Tories must woo Labour voters,"Theresa May also used her Conservative Party Conference speech to appeal to Labour voters Theresa May has made a pitch to Labour voters unhappy at Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, urging people to look beyond ""party labels"". Writing in the Observer,external, the prime minister said voters were not ""bound by ideology"" and urged lifelong Labour voters to look ""afresh"" at her party. She said the Tories had to offer a ""positive and optimistic vision"" and do more than just criticise Mr Corbyn. But Labour said people were facing ""brutal cuts"" and ""won't be fooled"". Mrs May's pitch to Labour supporters follows her speech to the Conservative Party conference in which she set out domestic policies including a boost to council house-building and a promised end to austerity. But the conference was dominated by Brexit, with her strategy facing heavy criticism as discussions with the EU enter the final straight. May the moderate looks beyond Brexit Reality Check: What are the plans to boost council homes? In her article Mrs May said the Conservatives had a responsibility to offer a home to former Labour supporters who were ""appalled"" by the direction of the party under Mr Corbyn. But the prime minister recognised her party must ""do more than demonstrate the flaws of Corbynism"". ""We need to offer a positive and optimistic vision of the better future that our policies will deliver,"" she said. She said her government would ""restore the dream of homeownership to a new generation"" by building more homes and lifting the cap on the amount councils can borrow to fund new developments - policies also mentioned in her conference speech. She also pledged to tackle the cost of living and restated her promise that the end of austerity was ""in sight"". By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent It's not often that politicians admit that they're wrong. And Theresa May hasn't gone quite that far, but she has acknowledged that her tactics aren't working. The Conservatives, as she puts it, ""must do more than demonstrate the flaws of Corbynism"" - which is another way of saying that attacks on the Labour leader's political past alone won't win them an election. The prime minister is concerned enough about people voting for a Labour government that she says ""we are not just a party to clean up a mess"" - and outlines several policies she hopes will appeal to Labour supporters. She will have to hope that people believe her claim that the end to austerity ""is in sight"" and that they think eight years of financial belt-tightening has been worth it. And it's not just Labour voters Theresa May is appealing to. She may well need the support of their MPs to get any Brexit deal she reaches with the EU through Parliament. Responding to Mrs May's article, Labour Party chair Ian Lavery said the claim that austerity policies were over was ""a con"". ""The Tories have spent their entire time in power running down our schools, local services and NHS, while gifting huge tax breaks to big business,"" he said. ""The prime minister is clearly spooked, so is resorting to desperate pleas in an attempt to revive her failing administration. The British public won't be fooled.""

EU expects deal by 'end of year',"Top EU officials have expressed optimism that a Brexit deal can be struck by the end of the year. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said the chance of the UK and the EU reaching a deal has increased in the last few days and could be agreed by November. Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk said an agreement was possible by the end of 2018. But Irish PM Leo Varadkar said there is still ""a fair bit of work to be done"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. However, there is still no agreement on some issues, including how to avoid new checks on the Irish border. Both sides had hoped to finalise the so-called divorce agreement and agree a statement on their future economic co-operation by an EU summit in 11 days' time. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles Speaking to the Austrian press on Friday and asked whether an agreement could be reached at the next meeting of European leaders on 17 October, Mr Juncker said: ""We are not that far yet. But our will is unbroken to reach agreement with the British government."" He said a deal could be agreed by November. ""I have reason to think that the rapprochement potential between both sides has increased in recent days,"" Mr Juncker added. He also reiterated his position that a no-deal scenario ""would not be good"" for either the UK or the EU. Speaking on Saturday, European Council President Mr Tusk said: ""We will try for it [agreeing a deal] in October... and I think there is a chance to have an accord by the end of the year."" Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan also expressed optimism that a deal could be reached before December. There were also reports from EU officials of a better atmosphere in talks over the Irish border. The upbeat assessment of progress in negotiations prompted sterling to rise against the Euro and the US dollar. But Mr Varadkar warned that the two sides had not crossed the finish line yet and the October summit was ""a time to take stock"". He told reporters: ""I would be hopeful at that point that there would be decisive progress allowing us to conclude an agreement by November. ""That remains to be seen yet. I think there is a fair bit of work to be done."" He added: ""It's increasingly important that we conclude a deal sooner rather than later."" Theresa May meets Jean-Claude Juncker at the summit of the European Council in December last year The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said officials still ""seem to be pushing for the whole withdrawal agreement to basically be done"" by the EU summit. ""Although, if we have learned anything from Brexit it's that the timetable is incredibly flexible, to use diplomatic language,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Downing Street distanced itself from suggestions - reported in the Daily Mail newspaper - that they were concerned Mr Juncker was trying to ""bounce"" the UK into agreeing a Brexit deal by mid-October. Meanwhile,the Guardian reported,externalsenior Conservatives had been in private contact with a number of Labour MPs to persuade them to back Theresa May's Brexit deal. Some Labour MPs who were mentioned in the article took to Twitter to refute the claims. Rachel Reeves tweeted: ""All the Labour MPs listed work hard and fight Tories locally and nationally every day."" It comes weeks after the head of the European Council Donald Tusksaid Theresa May's Brexit plans were unworkable. Both sides had hoped to finalise the so-called divorce agreement and agree a statement on their future economic co-operation by the October summit. But last month, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that if both sides were ""realistic"" there could be an agreement by November, when a special one-off summit has been arranged. Please upgrade your browser The European Commission is also considering whether to publish an analysis of where the two sides agree on elements of their future relationship. It could appear alongside the EU's latest contingency plans for a no-deal scenario, which will be released next week. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions, Sir Alan Duncan was also optimistic about the prospects of a deal. ""We are in the art of the possible here, and from what I see in government, I think that we will get a deal, be it in October or November at the two consecutive summits,"" he said. Currently, thousands of people cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland every day. Goods and services pass between the two areas easily without any restrictions. As the UK and Ireland are currently part of the EU single market and customs union, products do not need to be inspected for customs and standards, but after Brexit, all that could change. The UK wants to leave both the single market and customs union. Both the UK and EU have agreed they do not, in all circumstances, want a ""hard border"" - which means physical checks or installing infrastructure such as cameras or customs posts. Both sidessigned up to that promise in December 2017. They hope they can achieve that anyway in a future agreement on a new trading relationship after Brexit. But if there were to be a delay or a failure in reaching such an agreement, they have agreed there needs to be a ""backstop"" solution - which means a last resort plan - that would keep the Irish border open. The trouble is the two sides can't agree on what the backstop text should say. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue The EU's proposed backstop solution would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue. But the UK government is against this idea, saying it would effectively separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and create a border in the Irish Sea. Instead, it would like to see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time. But the UK has now signalled that it is ""open to looking at some of the options on regulatory checks"". Negotiators are yet to find a solution that is acceptable to both sides.

Snake surprise for woman cooking chips,"The African brown snake may have been attracted by the warmth of the oven, the RSPCA said An elderly woman had the ""shock of her life"" when she found a 3ft (90cm) snake in her oven. The 82-year-old said she wondered if her ""eyes were deceiving her"" when she first saw the African brown snake, which is thought to be an escaped pet. The reptile then disappeared, before turning up in the oven again two days later at the home in Stockport, Greater Manchester. The RSPCA was called and rescued the snake on 26 September. Seven foot snake falls from attic hatch Runaway 15ft python found in garden The woman, who was preparing to cook some chips, said: ""When I opened the oven door and saw it, I got the shock of my life. ""I have recently had a cataract operation and was wondering if my eyes were deceiving me - but my husband saw it too."" The woman, who preferred not to be named, added: ""I gave the RSPCA inspector a big hug and a cup of tea afterwards, but I went off the idea of oven chips so sent my husband to the fish and chip shop instead."" It was a good thing the woman didn't preheat her oven, the RSPCA said Inspector Andy Harris said the species was not venomous and the serpent was likely to have escaped or been abandoned. He said: ""I managed to coax the snake from the oven. It must have squeezed through a wall cavity and there is a hole at the back of the oven so it was probably attracted by the warmth. ""It was lucky the couple didn't preheat the oven first."" African brown snakes are frequently found in homes in Africa and eat rodents, small lizards and birds.

Entire lead roof stolen from church,"Plastic sheeting has now been placed on the roof by builders to protect it from the elements ""Audacious"" thieves have stolen an entire lead roof from a Grade I-listed church. About 20 tonnes of lead was taken from All Saint's Church, Houghton Conquest, Bedfordshire, over ""a prolonged period of time"", police said. The theft was discovered on Tuesday and police believe the thieves posed as tradesmen to gain access to the roof. The church said the insurance would not cover all the repair costs - expected to reach tens of thousands of pounds. Treasurer Joyce Bullock said: ""I don't know how we are going to pay for it,"" adding: ""I just pray every day that nothing else happens."" All Saint's Church in the village of Houghton Conquest dates from the 14th Century The theft was uncovered on Tuesday when daylight could be seen through the ceiling and rubble was found on the ground. Sarah Hannant, a member of the congregation, said: ""This is devastating; it has caused a lot of stress. We don't have enough volunteers as it is, it just takes the wind out of your sails.""

Thieves also damaged pillars and stonework on the Grade I-listed church The church also needs a new boiler and vestry roof Insp Nick Masters said: ""We suspect the people responsible may have been going backwards and forwards to the church for a prolonged period of time."" He believes the thieves posed as tradesmen and drove trucks or vans, so they could transport scaffolding or ladders to the site to gain access to the roof.

Haiti struck by deadly earthquake,"At least 10 people have been killed by an earthquake that struck off the north of Haiti, officials say. The magnitude 5.9 quake was one of the strongest to hit the Caribbean nation since a major tremor in 2010 killed more than 200,000 people. Several buildings are reported to have been destroyed. President Jovenel Moise has urged people to remain calm. Government spokesman Eddy Jackson Alexis said a disaster response task force had been set up. The US Geological Survey said the epicentre of the quake that struck late on Saturday was about 19km (12 miles) north-west of the city of Port-de-Paix.

Brawl after Nurmagomedov beats McGregorUgly scenes mar UFC 229 mixed martial arts as champion Nurmagomedov brawls after victory.BBC Sport,"Khabib Nurmagomedov was escorted from the arena by police Ugly scenes marred UFC 229 as lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov began a brawl by the octagon after beating Conor McGregor. Seconds after landing a fourth-round submission, the Russian vaulted the cage and headed towards Irishman McGregor's team, prompting a melee. Meanwhile, McGregor was involved in a bust-up in the octagon with members of his opponent's team. Three of Nurmagomedov's party were arrested but later released. 'This is not my best side' - champion Nurmagomedov apologises for ugly scenes 'Bad for the brand and bad for the sport - White on UFC 229 chaos The BBC MMA Show podcast: A night to remember/forget UFC president Dana White said McGregor had refused to press charges. Earlier White could be heard telling the 30-year-old winner he could not receive his belt in the octagon as he feared it may incite trouble among those present at Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena. He later said the Nevada State Commission, which sanctioned the bout, has withheld Nurmagomedov's fight payment pending an investigation. ""I know if we put the belt on him [Nurmagomedov] in the octagon there'll be things thrown,"" said White. ""I just said let's just try and get him out of here. ""Police officers were getting punched, security guys were getting punched. I actually think police and security did an incredible job. Khabib jumped over the cage like one of those Parkour guys. What are you expected to do? "" McGregor appeared stunned and was quickly escorted away by his team, while heavyweight and light-heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier entered the octagon to seemingly try to calm Nurmagomedov, who left the arena flanked by police. What was billed as the biggest bout in UFC history, one set to break the organisation's pay-per-view record and where McGregor returned after a 693-day absence, will now prompt difficult questions for White and the company. How extraordinary UFC 229 unfolded in Las Vegas Listen to a replay of the fight every hour on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra UFC president Dana White tried to speak to a stunned McGregor in the aftermath of the contest Nurmagomedov largely dominated proceedings before administering a rear-naked choke, prompting McGregor to tap out with one minute and 57 seconds of round four remaining. The champion instantly shouted at the beaten man and then pointed at McGregor's team before exiting the ring and attacking Dillon Danis, a fighter who trains with McGregor. While the brawl took place, McGregor was involved in a bust-up in the octagon with one of Nurmagomedov's training partners. Nurmagomedov left the arena with fans throwing objects towards him, while White said he felt ""sick"" over the scenes. The rivalry between the fighters was evident between rounds as they often traded words BBC MMA Show presenter Nick Peet: After seeing that I'll be so surprised if Khabib isn't suspended and stripped of the belt, he caused a riot. He blew it, he completely lost control. To do it in front of 20,000 fans in Vegas in an environment that is being broadcast to the world. It's incredible. Khabib has let his team down, he's let his fans down. This is an absolute disgrace what he has done here. Former UFC fighter Dan Hardy on BBC Radio 5 live: I feel that because it was a one-sided fight, Khabib didn't have chance to get the respect of McGregor. Because Khabib has mauled McGregor for four rounds, he didn't get the closure he needed from the fight. As soon as he got back up, there was fight left in him and that's why he went for one of McGregor's men. Nurmagomedov used his renowned wrestling skills to dominate McGregor on the floor and won the contest with a choke The aftermath to the bout managed to overshadow one of the most acrimonious build-ups to a contest the UFC has seen. In McGregor's two years out of the Octagon his one-fight Â£76m foray into boxing -a defeat to Floyd Mayweather- further built his profile. Nurmagomedov - now unbeaten in 27 MMA bouts - added to his own reputation by landing the lightweight belt which once belonged to 'The Notorious'. When McGregor attacked a bus carrying his rival and UFC staff - prompting afive-day community service charge- the flames were fanned further. Unsurprisingly, the pair refused to touch gloves seconds before the contest. Actors including Mel Gibson and Matt Damon sat ringside, as did Northern Irish golfer Rory McIlroy and they saw Nurmagomedov - who began honing his renowned wrestling skills at the age of eight - take his rival down inside a minute. McGregor - pinned to the cage - survived for four minutes and though his coach told him Nurmagomedov could not improve on his opening five-minute segment, the champion and heavy pre-fight favourite flew out in round two, landing a superb overhand right. It staggered McGregor, who somehow withstood a ground and pound lasting close to two minutes to again make it to the end of the round. McGregor had never stopped an opponent after the second round in his UFC career and as he struggled to gain any sort of foothold, it appeared a flash knockout would be his best hope. He looked more threatening in the third and managed to repel takedown attempts but after again being pinned to the cage in the fourth, he eventually succumbed to a choke. Nurmagomedov, the first Russian and Muslim to win a UFC title, had delivered a dominant display but his immediate actions changed the mood and narrative instantly. McGregor was escorted back to his changing room while Nurmagomedov was still being calmed in the octagon Former world heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury:""What the average fan don't understand is it's showbusiness as well as a fight. Think how big a rematch could be."" Former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson:""Watching the @TheNotoriousMMA vs @TeamKhabib fight. Unimaginable never thought it would go down like this."" British cruiserweight Tony Bellew:""Conor lost the fight fair and square. Not a chance in the world he deserves to be attacked by two men! One in front and one from behind! Both bare knuckle after he's just been fighting for 20 minutes anyway. It's a disgrace. The coward jumping the cage is a disgrace. UFC have to deal with this."" UFC heavyweight and light-heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier:""Hey guys, two wrongs don't make it right. Conor didn't deserve that. No one did. But some things aren't for fight promotion. Religion, family, country. Throwing stuff in Brooklyn. For Khabib it wasn't fight promotion, it was really personal. Different culture man. Sucks.""

Victory for Trump in Supreme Court battle,"Brett Kavanaugh, surrounded by his family, was administered the judicial oath by outgoing justice Anthony Kennedy President Donald Trump's controversial nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, has been sworn in following weeks of rancorous debate. The Senate earlier backed his nomination by 50 votes to 48. Mr Kavanaugh had been embroiled in a bitter battle to stave off claims of sexual assault, which he denies. But after an 11th-hour investigation by the FBI into the allegations, enough wavering senators decided to support the nomination. His confirmation hands Mr Trump a political victory ahead of key mid-term elections in November. Before the vote, hundreds of people protested against Mr Kavanaugh's nomination at the US Capitol in Washington. This video can not be played The moment Vice President Mike Pence announces Brett Kavanaugh's win During the vote, other protesters shouted ""shame"" from the public gallery and Vice-President Mike Pence had to call for order to be restored. Why US top court is so much more political than UK's What did the FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh result in? Mr Kavanaugh's appointment is for life and he will strengthen conservative control of the nine-judge court, which has the final say on US law. The 53-year-old was sworn in on Saturday evening in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the constitutional oath, and retired justice Anthony Kennedy - whom Mr Kavanaugh is replacing - administered the judicial oath. Protesters had gathered outside the court and at one point some ran up the steps and banged on its ornate doors. Other demonstrators climbed on the nearby statue of justice. Protesters sat on the statue of justice outside the Supreme Court He sent out a tweet of congratulations: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Later he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One, saying Mr Kavanaugh had withstood a ""horrible attack by the Democrats"" and that women were ""outraged"" at what had happened to the nominee. Mr Trump also said he was ""100% certain"" that the woman who had accused Mr Kavanaugh of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, had named the wrong person. The upper house is split 51-49 in favour of the Republicans and the vote was largely along party lines. In the end, there was indeed a two-vote margin, the closest nomination vote since 1881. The only party dissenters were Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who had intended to vote no, and Democrat Joe Manchin, who voted yes. That should have meant a 51-49 tally, but the absence of Republican Steve Daines, a yes voter who was at his daughter's wedding, altered the final figures. This video can not be played Donald Trump's nominee has been embroiled in a bitter battle over sexual assault allegations. Ms Murkowski opted instead to simply mark herself as ""present"", leaving the final vote 50-48. In their final summations, the two Senate party leaders reflected how bitter the divide had become. Minority Democrat leader Chuck Schumer said Mr Kavanaugh did not belong on the bench as he had ""obscured his views to the American people"", ""repeatedly misled the Senate"" and delivered one of the ""bitterest and most partisan testimonies ever presented by a nominee"". He also said Mr Trump had ""stooped to new depths"" in mocking the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford. The decision of Susan Collins to vote yes helped sway the final tally Mr Schumer said that for all those who opposed the nomination, ""there is one answer - vote"" in the November mid-term elections. Majority Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Mr Kavanaugh was a ""serious scholar, a brilliant student of the law and a meticulous and dedicated public servant"". He said events had ""strained our basic principles of fairness and justice"" and that the vote showed the Senate was ""an institution where evidence and facts matter"". He spoke of ""intimidation by the mob"" and said the Senate vote should be one ""to turn away from darkness"". Ms Murkowski had earlier said that although Mr Kavanaugh was a ""good man"", he was ""not the right person for the court at this time"" and his ""appearance of impropriety has become unavoidable"". Joe Manchin is facing a difficult re-election campaign in West Virginia, a traditionally Republican state that Mr Trump won by a landslide. He said he ""found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist"". There were shouts of ""shame"" from the public gallery as he voted yes. Two Republican waverers, Susan Collins and Jeff Flake, finally decided to back the judge. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has been decided. The political war, however, is just beginning. Donald Trump's court pick generated a controversy that captured the nation's attention in a way that few political issues do. It generated daily headlines rivalled only by the US quadrennial presidential elections. Now that the bombs have been thrown, it's time to assess the fallout. Read more from Anthony Basically, it's the final arbiter of US law. It has the ultimate say on such contentious issues as abortion and gun control. The Democrats are still smarting from the previous Supreme Court appointment. Republicans last year successfully stalled the process, meaning it fell to Mr Trump, not Barack Obama, to nominate the new justice. Mr Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch strengthened the conservative leaning. All eyes will now be on November's mid-term elections. Mr Trump will be able to campaign on the back of an important victory, but commentators will be watching closely how the Kavanaugh affair affects women voters.

SNP MPs would back new Brexit referendum,"This video can not be played Sturgeon: SNP MPs would back new Brexit vote SNP MPs would back a new Brexit referendum if it were put to them, party leader Nicola Sturgeon has said. Campaigners have been pressing for a fresh vote on whatever exit plans result from talks with EU leaders. PM Theresa May has rejected calls for a so-called People's Vote and while Labour has not ruled it out, it wants a general election to decide the issue. Ms Sturgeon said SNP MPs would oppose anything short of staying in the single market and customs union. Neither choice features in the plan backed by the cabinet at Chequers in July, which the prime minister insists is the only credible option to avoid a ""no-deal"" scenario. EU leaders said last month that Mrs May's proposed new economic partnership ""will not work"". However, they have struck a more optimistic note in recent days. Juncker says chance of Brexit deal has increased Brexit: what happens next? Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said on Sunday that the ""chances [of a deal] are good"" before the UK is due to withdraw from the bloc on 29 March. ""The withdrawal treaty is already about 90% agreed in terms of text... what is needed now is the two negotiating teams need to lock themselves in a room for the next 10 days or so,"" he told Sky News. The People's Vote campaign wants the public to have the final say on any deal. On Sunday hundreds of dog-owners marched their pets through central London to support the calls. Dog-owners in London took part in a ""Wooferendum"" march to call for a People's Vote Actor Peter Egan and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy were among those addressing a rally in Parliament Square. Ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who marched with his five-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, claimed politicians were ""scared"" of another referendum. Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that her MPs would back calls for another public vote. Speaking ahead of the SNP conference in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said the UK was heading for a ""cobbled together"" exit agreement that would be ""almost as unacceptable as no deal at all"". Any deal would be put to MPs in a vote at Westminster, as well as having to be ratified by the remaining EU member states. ""In those circumstances, sensible MPs of all parties should come together to look at the alternative,"" she said. ""No doubt calls for a second referendum would grow in those circumstances, and I've said before we wouldn't stand in the way of a second referendum. I think SNP MPs would undoubtedly vote for that proposition."" Campaigners, such as these marching in Liverpool last month, are calling for another vote on the EU to be held In an age of political shocks, Nicola Sturgeon backing a new EU referendum won't count as one of the biggest. The party had always said it was open to the idea, even if it still has concerns you could end up with another situation where Scotland votes Remain, but ends up bound by a UK-wide result. It makes the SNP - with its 35 MPs - the biggest party in Parliament to back a so-called ""people's vote"". But the Commons numbers who have committed to supporting one still remain a small minority. The government has ruled one out. Labour says it's still an option - but it isn't their preference. So campaigners who want the public to have its say on the final deal still have a lot of work to do if they are to get their wish.

Speaking on Sunday, Joanna Cherry MP said Scotland would not necessarily have to have a second independence referendum to leave the United Kingdom. The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman at Westminster suggested independence could be achieved through a ""democratic event"", like a general election.

US court is more political than UK's,"Protesters gather outside the US Supreme Court following an immigration ruling in June The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg could change the political composition of the US Supreme Court and has revived discussions about how nasty the selection process can be in the US. The debate is unlike any the UK has when justices at the Supreme Court are replaced, as a different appointment system means their political views are rarely publicly known and, according to experts, do not have any influence in the process. In the US, the nine-member Supreme Court is the third branch of the federal government and its decisions have a profound impact on American society. It is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between state and federal governments, and final appeals to stay executions. Under Article 2 of the constitution, the president has the power to make a nomination. ""There's no clear view as to why the president was granted this power,"" said Bruce Ackerman, Sterling Professor of Law at Yale University. The Senate has the task to approve a candidate, in usually tense hearings, a method that enforces the concept of checks and balances between the powers envisioned by the Founding Fathers. Candidates do not have to meet any qualifications and serve lifetime terms - a contentious topic for many. That is why replacing a justice is one of the most consequential decisions of a president. So, unsurprisingly, every nomination is a highly politicised affair. Why is the US top court so important? Observers say recent nominees have been more ideological than in the past Divisions at the top court are not new, as presidents tend to nominate people with the same ideological positions, but scholars say there was little evidence of partisan division until recently. Dissent in the past was infrequent and, when it happened, did not tend to break along party lines, Prof Neal Devins and Prof Lawrence Baum wrote inHow Party Polarization Turned the Supreme Court into a Partisan Court,external. Take theDred Scott v Sandford case,external, in which the court declared in 1857 that slaves were not US citizens and could not sue in federal courts. The two diverging votes in one of the most important decisions of that time came from judges who had been appointed by both the Whig and Democratic parties. The lack of partisan divide remained over the following decades but signs of divisions started to emerge. Byron White was the last conservative-leaning nomination by a Democrat - President John F Kennedy in 1962 - whileDavid Souter,externalwas the last liberal-leaning justice appointed by a Republican president - George H W Bush in 1990. Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's choice for Supreme Court US Supreme Court: Who are the justices? Things changed in 2010, with the retirement ofJohn Paul Stevens,external, a liberal justice appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford in 1975. Since then, all of the nominations by Democrats have been liberal while all those appointed by Republicans are conservative, the first time in the court's history that ideological positions coincide with party lines, Prof Devins and Prof Baum wrote. ""Today's partisan split, while unprecedented, is likely enduring."" The partial exception, they said, was Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Republican appointee who sided with liberal justices on key issues like abortion, death penalty and gay rights, and has now retired. Now that Brett Kavanaugh, who by all accounts is a reliable conservative, has been confirmed as Mr Kennedy's replacement, he is expected to push the court to the right, restoring a conservative majority of 5-4. And being relatively young, 53 years old, he is likely to be there for many years. That is one of the reasons why his nomination has an even bigger significance. The confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees are usually tense and closely followed Analysts say Mr Kavanaugh's nomination hearings, which included a row over documents related to his years in the George W Bush administration that were shielded from Senate Democrats and the public as well as allegations of sexual misconduct that he denied, have been the most contentious in recent history, and highlighted how partisan divisions can dominate the process. Writing in theStanford Law Review Online in 2012,external, Eric Hamilton said: ""Politicisation of the Supreme Court causes the American public to lose faith in the Court"". In the UK, the12-member Supreme Court,externalwas created in 2009, replacing the Law Lords in Parliament, bringing the UK into line with many comparable modern states. It acts as a final court of appeal in cases of major public importance. The justices are nominated by an independent commission,external, chaired by the president of the court, a senior judge from anywhere in the UK to be named by the president and members of the appointment commissions from England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The UK Supreme Court was created in 2009 (File picture) A number of senior judges must be consulted by the commission before any decision is taken. Candidates must have been a senior judge for at least two years or a qualified lawyer for at least 15. When someone is chosen, the name is sent to the justice secretary, who can accept or reject it. If accepted, the nomination is then sent to the prime minister, who recommends it to the Queen, who makes the appointment. These rules, experts say, mean that political positions of nominees are often unknown or irrelevant in the process. Q&A: UK Supreme Court,external ""[Changes were not] very controversial at all. There was no discussion of it in the press when the names were announced and when we looked at the people who were there it was all understandable,"" said Alison Young, Prof of Public Law at the University of Cambridge. ""We have a completely independent process... It's almost seen like an internal promotion system rather than a politicised process,"" she added, saying that citizens can officially complain over alleged political bias. Another difference is that the UK has no codified, written constitution, so the court does not have the ability to strike down a law as unconstitutional, unlike in the US, where the court has also been involved in key political decisions. In 1997, in a case involving then President Bill Clinton, the US Supreme Court ruled thatsitting US presidents could be prosecuted,external. In 1974, itordered President Richard Nixon to deliver tape recordings,externalrelated to the Watergate scandal. There is no limit to UK justices' terms but they must retire when they are 75 years old. Similar age restrictions are in place in other Western European countries too. In Germany, for example, the top judges serve 12-year terms with no re-election allowed and must retire at the age of 68. In Switzerland, they serve six-year terms and can be re-elected an unlimited number of times - but theymust resign at the age of 68,external. (Both countries have different selection processes.) The partisan split at the Supreme Court is unprecedented, some experts say Lifetime appointments in the US were originally designed to isolate them from political pressure. But given the current climate, critics argue that, in fact, the opposite is happening and some have defended the introduction of fixed terms. ""It doesn't make sense at all,"" said Prof Ackerman, from Yale, about lifetime terms. And so, members nominated at a relatively young age - Justice Clarence Thomas, another controversial nomination, was 43 when he was appointed in 1991 - can serve for several decades. Opponents to terms, meanwhile, say theycould actually make the politicisation even worse,external, as presidents would be more inclined to make partisan nominations as justices would have temporary terms.

"Victory for Trump in Supreme Court battleThe US president's controversial nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, is sworn in after weeks of rancour.US & Canada","Brett Kavanaugh, surrounded by his family, was administered the judicial oath by outgoing justice Anthony Kennedy President Donald Trump's controversial nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, has been sworn in following weeks of rancorous debate. The Senate earlier backed his nomination by 50 votes to 48. Mr Kavanaugh had been embroiled in a bitter battle to stave off claims of sexual assault, which he denies. But after an 11th-hour investigation by the FBI into the allegations, enough wavering senators decided to support the nomination. His confirmation hands Mr Trump a political victory ahead of key mid-term elections in November. Before the vote, hundreds of people protested against Mr Kavanaugh's nomination at the US Capitol in Washington. This video can not be played The moment Vice President Mike Pence announces Brett Kavanaugh's win During the vote, other protesters shouted ""shame"" from the public gallery and Vice-President Mike Pence had to call for order to be restored. Why US top court is so much more political than UK's What did the FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh result in? Mr Kavanaugh's appointment is for life and he will strengthen conservative control of the nine-judge court, which has the final say on US law. The 53-year-old was sworn in on Saturday evening in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the constitutional oath, and retired justice Anthony Kennedy - whom Mr Kavanaugh is replacing - administered the judicial oath. Protesters had gathered outside the court and at one point some ran up the steps and banged on its ornate doors. Other demonstrators climbed on the nearby statue of justice. Protesters sat on the statue of justice outside the Supreme Court He sent out a tweet of congratulations: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Later he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One, saying Mr Kavanaugh had withstood a ""horrible attack by the Democrats"" and that women were ""outraged"" at what had happened to the nominee. Mr Trump also said he was ""100% certain"" that the woman who had accused Mr Kavanaugh of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, had named the wrong person. The upper house is split 51-49 in favour of the Republicans and the vote was largely along party lines. In the end, there was indeed a two-vote margin, the closest nomination vote since 1881. The only party dissenters were Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who had intended to vote no, and Democrat Joe Manchin, who voted yes. That should have meant a 51-49 tally, but the absence of Republican Steve Daines, a yes voter who was at his daughter's wedding, altered the final figures. This video can not be played Donald Trump's nominee has been embroiled in a bitter battle over sexual assault allegations. Ms Murkowski opted instead to simply mark herself as ""present"", leaving the final vote 50-48. In their final summations, the two Senate party leaders reflected how bitter the divide had become. Minority Democrat leader Chuck Schumer said Mr Kavanaugh did not belong on the bench as he had ""obscured his views to the American people"", ""repeatedly misled the Senate"" and delivered one of the ""bitterest and most partisan testimonies ever presented by a nominee"". He also said Mr Trump had ""stooped to new depths"" in mocking the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford. The decision of Susan Collins to vote yes helped sway the final tally Mr Schumer said that for all those who opposed the nomination, ""there is one answer - vote"" in the November mid-term elections. Majority Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Mr Kavanaugh was a ""serious scholar, a brilliant student of the law and a meticulous and dedicated public servant"". He said events had ""strained our basic principles of fairness and justice"" and that the vote showed the Senate was ""an institution where evidence and facts matter"". He spoke of ""intimidation by the mob"" and said the Senate vote should be one ""to turn away from darkness"". Ms Murkowski had earlier said that although Mr Kavanaugh was a ""good man"", he was ""not the right person for the court at this time"" and his ""appearance of impropriety has become unavoidable"". Joe Manchin is facing a difficult re-election campaign in West Virginia, a traditionally Republican state that Mr Trump won by a landslide. He said he ""found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist"". There were shouts of ""shame"" from the public gallery as he voted yes. Two Republican waverers, Susan Collins and Jeff Flake, finally decided to back the judge. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has been decided. The political war, however, is just beginning. Donald Trump's court pick generated a controversy that captured the nation's attention in a way that few political issues do. It generated daily headlines rivalled only by the US quadrennial presidential elections. Now that the bombs have been thrown, it's time to assess the fallout. Read more from Anthony Basically, it's the final arbiter of US law. It has the ultimate say on such contentious issues as abortion and gun control. The Democrats are still smarting from the previous Supreme Court appointment. Republicans last year successfully stalled the process, meaning it fell to Mr Trump, not Barack Obama, to nominate the new justice. Mr Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch strengthened the conservative leaning. All eyes will now be on November's mid-term elections. Mr Trump will be able to campaign on the back of an important victory, but commentators will be watching closely how the Kavanaugh affair affects women voters.

Oil tanker collision kills at least 50Dozens of people suffer second-degree burns after a tanker collided with a car in the DR Congo.Africa,"This video can not be played The oil tanker collided with a car on a major road between two cities At least 50 people have died after an oil tanker collided with a car on a major road in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The incident occurred near the city of Kisantu, between the capital Kinshasa and the port of Matadi. One hundred people suffered second-degree burns, Atou Matabuana, the governor of Kongo Central region said. ""The flames spread rapidly, engulfing nearby houses,"" the UN's Okapi radio reported.

A doctor at nearby hospital treating the victims said it was a race against time to treat survivors. ""We are trying to help them, we are trying to rehydrate them but sadly there are those who are dying,"" Dr Tresor told the agency. Mr Matabuana said local authorities had ""taken measures to take charge of all the victims"". However,the pro-democracy group Lucha criticised the response the lack of ambulances in a tweet,external.

"Child mental health referrals 'up 26%'But a substantial number of children are failing to meet thresholds for treatment, a report says.Health","The number of referrals to Camhs has increased by over a quarter in five years, according to a report The number of referrals to child and adolescent mental health services in England has increased by 26% over the past five years, Education Policy Institute (EPI) research suggests. Its report also reveals one in four referrals was either rejected or deemed inappropriate for treatment. Out of 60 providers questioned, 54 gave a response. The Department of Health said it was investing an additional Â£1.4bn into mental health services for children. The figures, shared with BBC Radio 5 live Investigates, were compiled using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests submitted to child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) and local authorities in England. Some providers in England were unable to give the full information requested - 33 supplied data about numbers of referrals over five years. Based on these figures, mental health referrals for under 18s increased from 157,000 in 2013-14 to 198,280 in 2017-18. According to data from more providers - 50 in total - for 2017-18 alone, children and adolescent mental health referrals topped 264,000. Child mental health: Camhs 'not fit for purpose' Caring for a child with mental health issues Child mental health: When it feels like no-one is listening George Hodgson, now 22, experienced problems accessing Camhs when he went for an assessment, after struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks. Describing how he felt at the time, George told5 live Investigates:""I was a complete state, throughout the session I was crying and was having regular intrusive suicidal thoughts."" George struggled to access CAMHS when he was 16 After being told he would not be seen again for 40 weeks, George was left feeling frightened and that he was not being taken seriously. He and his family decided they could not wait that long and got help privately. Two years after the initial assessment, and after receiving no correspondence in the interim, they received a call saying George could now be seen by Camhs. Reflecting on his experience, George said: ""I don't know if I would have coped if private support wasn't there. I'm not sure I would be here today."" Jo Hutchinson, director of social mobility and vulnerable learners at the EPI, said the research provided little evidence of good news for children. ""While we have seen a reduction in some of the longest waiting times, many children still face a lengthy period of time before they can receive any specialist treatment and the number of referrals into these stretched services is rising."" According tothe EPI report,external, around 55,800 children under-18 did not meet the criteria for specialist treatment after being referred in 2017-18. Some reasons for excluding them from treatment include: self-harm referrals accepted only if accompanied by another mental health condition a weight loss of less than 15% from their ideal weight for an eating disorder (although this is against National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines) young people must have already engaged with early intervention services and waited a specified length of time. Many providers also said that some young people's needs should be met by other services, for example if they were homeless or had parents with a substance addiction. Some local authorities - 27 out of the 111 who responded to the FOI - said they had scrapped services related to the mental health and wellbeing of children over the last eight years. These included community-based early intervention services, family counselling and mental health support for looked-after children, as well as school-based programmes to support children with mild to moderate mental health difficulties. Emma Thomas, chief executive of Young Minds, said: ""We hear every day from young people who haven't been able to get the help they need from Camhs. ""Crucially, we also need to address the gaps in youth and community services that could provide help early on, before young people require more specialist treatment."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are transforming mental health services for children and young people with an additional Â£1.4bn and are on track to ensure that 70,000 more children a year have specialist mental health care by 2020-21. ""We are improving access to mental health services through schools with a brand new dedicated workforce, as well as piloting a four-week waiting time standard in some areas, so we can better understand how to reduce waiting times. ""We are completely committed to achieving parity between physical and mental health as part of our long-term plan for the NHS, backed by an additional Â£20.5bn of funding per year by 2023-24.""

Turkey probe into missing Saudi writer,"Jamal Khashoggi has not been seen since lunchtime on Tuesday Turkish prosecutors have opened an investigation into the disappearance of a missing Saudi journalist. Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has not been seen since Tuesday, when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish sources quoted by Reuters and the Washington Post say they believe he has been killed inside the consulate. They did not give any evidence for the claim, nor suggest how he was killed. Saudi officials have not yet commented, however a source at the consulate - also quoted by Reuters - described the accusations as baseless. The source added that a security team had arrived in Istanbul to investigate Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. Earlier, Prince bin Salman told Bloomberg News thatTurkish authorities were welcome to search the building,external. Turkish media said prosecutors were now looking closely at the case, although this may be a widening of an inquiry begun on Tuesday. The two unnamed sources said on Saturday that the initial assessment of police was that Mr Khashoggi had been killed at the consulate. ""We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,"" one of the sources told Reuters. A source quoted by The Washington Post,externalsaid the journalist was killed by a 15-member Saudi team sent ""specifically for the murder"". The BBC's Mark Lowen says that, if confirmed, the state-sponsored murder on Turkish soil of a high-profile Saudi dissident would worsen already strained relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.

When asked if Mr Khashoggi faced charges in Saudi Arabia, the crown prince said his country would need to know where he was first.

The US Grand Prix could be a last chance saloon for Sebastian Vettel.

May urges Labour voters to switch,"Theresa May also used her Conservative Party Conference speech to appeal to Labour voters Theresa May has made a pitch to Labour voters unhappy at Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, urging people to look beyond ""party labels"". Writing in the Observer,external, the prime minister said voters were not ""bound by ideology"" and urged lifelong Labour voters to look ""afresh"" at her party. She said the Tories had to offer a ""positive and optimistic vision"" and do more than just criticise Mr Corbyn. But Labour said people were facing ""brutal cuts"" and ""won't be fooled"". Mrs May's pitch to Labour supporters follows her speech to the Conservative Party conference in which she set out domestic policies including a boost to council house-building and a promised end to austerity.

By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent It's not often that politicians admit that they're wrong. And Theresa May hasn't gone quite that far, but she has acknowledged that her tactics aren't working. The Conservatives, as she puts it, ""must do more than demonstrate the flaws of Corbynism"" - which is another way of saying that attacks on the Labour leader's political past alone won't win them an election. The prime minister is concerned enough about people voting for a Labour government that she says ""we are not just a party to clean up a mess"" - and outlines several policies she hopes will appeal to Labour supporters. She will have to hope that people believe her claim that the end to austerity ""is in sight"" and that they think eight years of financial belt-tightening has been worth it. And it's not just Labour voters Theresa May is appealing to. She may well need the support of their MPs to get any Brexit deal she reaches with the EU through Parliament. Responding to Mrs May's article, Labour Party chair Ian Lavery said the claim that austerity policies were over was ""a con"". ""The Tories have spent their entire time in power running down our schools, local services and NHS, while gifting huge tax breaks to big business,"" he said.

Nurmagomedov beats McGregor and starts brawlUgly scenes mar UFC 229 as lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov brawls by the octagon after beating Conor McGregor.,"Khabib Nurmagomedov was escorted from the arena by police Ugly scenes marred UFC 229 as lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov began a brawl by the octagon after beating Conor McGregor. Seconds after landing a fourth-round submission, the Russian vaulted the cage and headed towards Irishman McGregor's team, prompting a melee. Meanwhile, McGregor was involved in a bust-up in the octagon with members of his opponent's team. Three of Nurmagomedov's party were arrested but later released. 'This is not my best side' - champion Nurmagomedov apologises for ugly scenes 'Bad for the brand and bad for the sport - White on UFC 229 chaos The BBC MMA Show podcast: A night to remember/forget UFC president Dana White said McGregor had refused to press charges. Earlier White could be heard telling the 30-year-old winner he could not receive his belt in the octagon as he feared it may incite trouble among those present at Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena. He later said the Nevada State Commission, which sanctioned the bout, has withheld Nurmagomedov's fight payment pending an investigation. ""I know if we put the belt on him [Nurmagomedov] in the octagon there'll be things thrown,"" said White. ""I just said let's just try and get him out of here. ""Police officers were getting punched, security guys were getting punched. I actually think police and security did an incredible job. Khabib jumped over the cage like one of those Parkour guys. What are you expected to do? "" McGregor appeared stunned and was quickly escorted away by his team, while heavyweight and light-heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier entered the octagon to seemingly try to calm Nurmagomedov, who left the arena flanked by police. What was billed as the biggest bout in UFC history, one set to break the organisation's pay-per-view record and where McGregor returned after a 693-day absence, will now prompt difficult questions for White and the company. How extraordinary UFC 229 unfolded in Las Vegas Listen to a replay of the fight every hour on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra UFC president Dana White tried to speak to a stunned McGregor in the aftermath of the contest Nurmagomedov largely dominated proceedings before administering a rear-naked choke, prompting McGregor to tap out with one minute and 57 seconds of round four remaining. The champion instantly shouted at the beaten man and then pointed at McGregor's team before exiting the ring and attacking Dillon Danis, a fighter who trains with McGregor. While the brawl took place, McGregor was involved in a bust-up in the octagon with one of Nurmagomedov's training partners. Nurmagomedov left the arena with fans throwing objects towards him, while White said he felt ""sick"" over the scenes. The rivalry between the fighters was evident between rounds as they often traded words BBC MMA Show presenter Nick Peet: After seeing that I'll be so surprised if Khabib isn't suspended and stripped of the belt, he caused a riot. He blew it, he completely lost control. To do it in front of 20,000 fans in Vegas in an environment that is being broadcast to the world. It's incredible. Khabib has let his team down, he's let his fans down. This is an absolute disgrace what he has done here. Former UFC fighter Dan Hardy on BBC Radio 5 live: I feel that because it was a one-sided fight, Khabib didn't have chance to get the respect of McGregor. Because Khabib has mauled McGregor for four rounds, he didn't get the closure he needed from the fight. As soon as he got back up, there was fight left in him and that's why he went for one of McGregor's men. Nurmagomedov used his renowned wrestling skills to dominate McGregor on the floor and won the contest with a choke The aftermath to the bout managed to overshadow one of the most acrimonious build-ups to a contest the UFC has seen. In McGregor's two years out of the Octagon his one-fight Â£76m foray into boxing -a defeat to Floyd Mayweather- further built his profile. Nurmagomedov - now unbeaten in 27 MMA bouts - added to his own reputation by landing the lightweight belt which once belonged to 'The Notorious'. When McGregor attacked a bus carrying his rival and UFC staff - prompting afive-day community service charge- the flames were fanned further. Unsurprisingly, the pair refused to touch gloves seconds before the contest. Actors including Mel Gibson and Matt Damon sat ringside, as did Northern Irish golfer Rory McIlroy and they saw Nurmagomedov - who began honing his renowned wrestling skills at the age of eight - take his rival down inside a minute. McGregor - pinned to the cage - survived for four minutes and though his coach told him Nurmagomedov could not improve on his opening five-minute segment, the champion and heavy pre-fight favourite flew out in round two, landing a superb overhand right. It staggered McGregor, who somehow withstood a ground and pound lasting close to two minutes to again make it to the end of the round. McGregor had never stopped an opponent after the second round in his UFC career and as he struggled to gain any sort of foothold, it appeared a flash knockout would be his best hope. He looked more threatening in the third and managed to repel takedown attempts but after again being pinned to the cage in the fourth, he eventually succumbed to a choke. Nurmagomedov, the first Russian and Muslim to win a UFC title, had delivered a dominant display but his immediate actions changed the mood and narrative instantly. McGregor was escorted back to his changing room while Nurmagomedov was still being calmed in the octagon Former world heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury:""What the average fan don't understand is it's showbusiness as well as a fight. Think how big a rematch could be."" Former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson:""Watching the @TheNotoriousMMA vs @TeamKhabib fight. Unimaginable never thought it would go down like this."" British cruiserweight Tony Bellew:""Conor lost the fight fair and square. Not a chance in the world he deserves to be attacked by two men! One in front and one from behind! Both bare knuckle after he's just been fighting for 20 minutes anyway. It's a disgrace. The coward jumping the cage is a disgrace. UFC have to deal with this."" UFC heavyweight and light-heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier:""Hey guys, two wrongs don't make it right. Conor didn't deserve that. No one did. But some things aren't for fight promotion. Religion, family, country. Throwing stuff in Brooklyn. For Khabib it wasn't fight promotion, it was really personal. Different culture man. Sucks.""

"May urges Labour voters to switch to ToriesWriting in the Observer the prime minister said her party had a ""moderate and patriotic programme"".UK","Theresa May also used her Conservative Party Conference speech to appeal to Labour voters Theresa May has made a pitch to Labour voters unhappy at Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, urging people to look beyond ""party labels"". Writing in the Observer,external, the prime minister said voters were not ""bound by ideology"" and urged lifelong Labour voters to look ""afresh"" at her party. She said the Tories had to offer a ""positive and optimistic vision"" and do more than just criticise Mr Corbyn. But Labour said people were facing ""brutal cuts"" and ""won't be fooled"". Mrs May's pitch to Labour supporters follows her speech to the Conservative Party conference in which she set out domestic policies including a boost to council house-building and a promised end to austerity. But the conference was dominated by Brexit, with her strategy facing heavy criticism as discussions with the EU enter the final straight. May the moderate looks beyond Brexit Reality Check: What are the plans to boost council homes? In her article Mrs May said the Conservatives had a responsibility to offer a home to former Labour supporters who were ""appalled"" by the direction of the party under Mr Corbyn. But the prime minister recognised her party must ""do more than demonstrate the flaws of Corbynism"". ""We need to offer a positive and optimistic vision of the better future that our policies will deliver,"" she said. She said her government would ""restore the dream of homeownership to a new generation"" by building more homes and lifting the cap on the amount councils can borrow to fund new developments - policies also mentioned in her conference speech. She also pledged to tackle the cost of living and restated her promise that the end of austerity was ""in sight"". By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent It's not often that politicians admit that they're wrong. And Theresa May hasn't gone quite that far, but she has acknowledged that her tactics aren't working. The Conservatives, as she puts it, ""must do more than demonstrate the flaws of Corbynism"" - which is another way of saying that attacks on the Labour leader's political past alone won't win them an election. The prime minister is concerned enough about people voting for a Labour government that she says ""we are not just a party to clean up a mess"" - and outlines several policies she hopes will appeal to Labour supporters. She will have to hope that people believe her claim that the end to austerity ""is in sight"" and that they think eight years of financial belt-tightening has been worth it. And it's not just Labour voters Theresa May is appealing to. She may well need the support of their MPs to get any Brexit deal she reaches with the EU through Parliament. Responding to Mrs May's article, Labour Party chair Ian Lavery said the claim that austerity policies were over was ""a con"". ""The Tories have spent their entire time in power running down our schools, local services and NHS, while gifting huge tax breaks to big business,"" he said. ""The prime minister is clearly spooked, so is resorting to desperate pleas in an attempt to revive her failing administration. The British public won't be fooled.""

"Green mamba caught after biting womanIts presumed owner, who had not registered the snake, is in hospital after receiving an antidote.Europe","The green mamba's bite is highly venomous and can be fatal in minutes (file photo) A highly venomous green mamba snake that escaped from its presumed owner on Tuesday after biting her in the Czech capital, Prague, has been caught. The snake had gone into hiding in a Prague district and residents were placed on alert and warned to keep an eye out for the reptile. The woman, who had not registered the snake, is in an induced coma at a city hospital after receiving an antidote. The snake was caught in a tree near its home on Friday. On Wednesday, police and paramedics were called to a house in Hlubocepy district in the south of the city where the woman was found unconscious. The house was evacuated, and herpetologists (zoologists who specialise in the study of snakes) were called in to help locate the reptile. Children at a nearby kindergarten were kept inside as a safety measure. Woman finds snake in oven Seven foot snake falls from attic hatch It was thought the snake was unlikely to leave the house because of the recent cool weather, but in the end it was found on a tree about 200 metres (656 ft) from its home. ""Mamba found! And caught!"" Miroslav Bobek, head of the Prague zoo whose employee caught the mamba, tweeted. He said thatthe mamba may have left its hiding place inside the house on the day of its capture after the weather warmed up,external. ""I would like to know when the snake set out on the trip, but yesterday's [Thursday] warm afternoon and a nearly subtropical Friday made it easier,"" he added. The woman who found it in her garden wrapped around a tree said she was still in shock and added that the snake appeared to have ""had enough"" too, reports say. Experts say the green mamba's venom spreads fast, and its bite can be fatal in as little as 30 minutes.

"Turkey probe into missing Saudi writerJamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, disappeared after entering the building in Istanbul.","Jamal Khashoggi has not been seen since lunchtime on Tuesday Turkish prosecutors have opened an investigation into the disappearance of a missing Saudi journalist. Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has not been seen since Tuesday, when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish sources quoted by Reuters and the Washington Post say they believe he has been killed inside the consulate. They did not give any evidence for the claim, nor suggest how he was killed. Saudi officials have not yet commented, however a source at the consulate - also quoted by Reuters - described the accusations as baseless. The source added that a security team had arrived in Istanbul to investigate Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. Earlier, Prince bin Salman told Bloomberg News thatTurkish authorities were welcome to search the building,external. Turkish media said prosecutors were now looking closely at the case, although this may be a widening of an inquiry begun on Tuesday. The two unnamed sources said on Saturday that the initial assessment of police was that Mr Khashoggi had been killed at the consulate. ""We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,"" one of the sources told Reuters. A source quoted by The Washington Post,externalsaid the journalist was killed by a 15-member Saudi team sent ""specifically for the murder"". The BBC's Mark Lowen says that, if confirmed, the state-sponsored murder on Turkish soil of a high-profile Saudi dissident would worsen already strained relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Turkey has taken the side of Qatar over its blockade by Saudi Arabia and other neighbours, and Turkey's rapprochement with Iran has riled the government in Riyadh. Saudi woman activist 'faces death penalty' Saudi Arabia to punish online satire Arrested for having breakfast with a woman Reuters earlier quoted the Turkish ruling party as saying the investigation would be comprehensive and that the government's sensitivity about the case was at the ""highest level"". The AK Party said Mr Khashoggi's whereabouts would be uncovered. The head of the Turkish-Arab Media Association told the New York Times thatTurkish police officers providing security for the consulate had checked their security cameras and did not see the journalist leave on foot,external. But Turan Kislakci added that diplomatic cars had been seen moving in and out. On Wednesday, the Turkish foreign ministry summoned Saudi Arabia's ambassador and asked for an explanation about the disappearance. Prince bin Salman told Bloomberg: ""He's a Saudi citizen and we are very keen to know what happened to him. And we will continue our dialogue with the Turkish government to see what happened to Jamal there. The Saudi consulate said Khashoggi left after completing paperwork ""My understanding is he entered and he got out after a few minutes or one hour. I'm not sure. We are investigating this through the foreign ministry to see exactly what happened at that time. ""The premises are sovereign territory, but we will allow them to enter and search and do whatever they want to do. If they ask for that, of course, we will allow them. We have nothing to hide."" When asked if Mr Khashoggi faced charges in Saudi Arabia, the crown prince said his country would need to know where he was first. Mr Khashoggi went to the consulate to obtain a document certifying he had divorced his ex-wife, so that he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e, Hatice, who went with him to the building and waited outside, but did not see him leave. Jamal Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e Hatice waited outside the Saudi consulate on Wednesday She said that he was ""stressed and sad"" that he was forced to go to the building. He was required to surrender his mobile phone, which is standard practice in some diplomatic missions. Hatice said he left the phone with her and told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not return. She said she waited for him outside the consulate from about 13:00 (10:00 GMT) until after midnight and did not see him leave. She returned when the consulate reopened on Wednesday morning. The 59-year-old journalist is one of the most prominent critics of the crown prince, who has unveiled reforms praised by the West while carrying out an apparent crackdown on dissent, which has seen human and women's rights activists, intellectuals and clerics arrested, and waging a war in Yemen that has triggered a humanitarian crisis. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: Saudi Arabia needs reform, but one-man rule is ""bad"" for the kingdom A former editor of the al-Watan newspaper and a short-lived Saudi TV news channel, Mr Khashoggi was for years seen as close to the Saudi royal family. He served as an adviser to senior Saudi officials. After several of his friends were arrested, his column was cancelled by the al-Hayat newspaper and he was allegedly warned to stop tweeting, Mr Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia for the US, from where he wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and continued to appear on Arab and Western TV channels.

'We want to be accepted into the club',"The female winner of the Nobel Prize in Physicshas criticised a senior scientist's commentsthat physics was ""invented and built by men"" as ""silly"". Prof Alessandro Strumia, of Pisa University, told an audience of young, mainly female, physicists that physics was ""becoming sexist against men"". It didn't go down well. What do other women in science think? Getting into it:I can't remember a time when I didn't want to become a scientist. I was voted ""most likely to become a scientist"" in high school. I was unabashedly geeky and read lots of books. I grew up with no role models in science and was not aware of any famous female scientist. I didn't even meet a scientist until I went to university. What are you working on?I got tired of the abstract and wanted to work on something that would make an impact. I'm now working on a cure for urinary tract infections. It's the most common reason in the UK that an antibiotic is prescribed - and the most common infection in elderly people, yet few studies have been done on it. Currently antibiotics can't reach inside the bladder so we are using nano-technology to create little particles of antibiotics that can go inside the bladder wall. We're hoping clinical trials will start late next year, and a cure could be available quite soon afterwards. Prof Strumia's comments:If you took them at face value, they could be quite demoralising - he is a big-shot professional. Most of what he presented has been debunked and there's been a swift universal rebuttal from the science community of his comments. Greatest achievement:Managing to cling onto my job. Most women I know were forced to leave. There aren't that many jobs and most go to men. Memorable moment:An elderly male professor assumed I was the research nurse when he first met me in a lift. What I've learned:I have been in science for 30 years. I've never seen any evidence that women are not as good as men at science. It's a pervasive view but is simply not true, in my opinion. Hope for the future:I'm just looking forward to that day when we can be accepted into the club on our own terms. I don't know if that will ever happen. Allow Twitter content?

Getting into it:I had a really great and supportive physics teacher when I was at school, as well as very supportive parents - though they were both medical doctors and that put me off working in the NHS! They did inspire me though to do something I loved and to always be asking questions. What are you working on?I work with carbon-based materials for light emitting diodes. Think of the pixels in your TV screen or your mobile phone. We are looking at light, low-cost, high efficiency and flexible displays. Prof Strumia's comments:They are really damaging to the community. Most of us realise that having diversity, having people who think differently to you, is so important to research. If you only have people who look and think the same, you will never progress. Greatest achievement:For me, it was when I was asked to take part in the International Visitor Leadership Programme in the US. There were 48 people representing different countries, and I represented the UK. Memorable moment:The thing is that the challenges women face in the field are less overt than a moment. There are biases when you apply for a new job, with peer reviews... and it affects non-Western scientists too. Sometimes we are facing sexism and we don't even know it. What I've learned:There are challenges, but if we work closely together, we can overcome them. Hope for the future:That we won't have to be excited about one women getting a Nobel Prize in physics and that it instead becomes a yearly occurrence. Seven trailblazing women in science Viewpoint: Everyone must fight sexism in science First woman Physics Nobel winner in 55 years Getting into it:She spent a long eight years getting a zoology degree as she had to work intermittently cleaning houses, delivering pizzas and working in gas stations to pay for her fees. She became a lab technician but the low pay prompted her to return to her studies, and she got a PhD in chemistry at 36. ""I wasn't deeply passionate about science but I was pretty good at it and could earn some decent money."" What are you working on?Research lecturer in the biochemistry department at Oxford University. Prof Strumia's comments:I think he's weak and feeling threatened. In nature, some oak trees kill off small oak trees so they can grow bigger and stronger. Greatest achievement:Helping my students achieve their goals or giving them the courage to do something else. Memorable moment:I'm a middle-of-the-road scientist but I always funded my own research. Every single time I got an award, at least one person would tell me: ""You only got it because you are a woman."" It's, like, thanks! What I've learned:I used to want to be seen just as a scientist but you are prejudged for being a woman before you even walk through the door. They don't mean to do it. Hope for the future:It's very important to listen to each other. I hope we get to the place where people take this seriously.

YouTuber 'could be making $2m a month',"One of the world's most subscribed-to vloggers, Shane Dawson, is halfway through an eight-part series about fellow YouTuber Jake Paul. The videos are around 40 minutes in length, have stacked up more than 50m views and, probably unsurprising to most, are making a lot of money. An industry expert told Radio 1 Newsbeat that Shane could be making around $2m (Â£1.5m) a month. Jake is the brother of Logan Paul, whoearlier this year controversially filmeda man appearing to have taken his life. The premise of Shane's series is to get to know one of the platform's most notorious stars. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jake has also been involved in his fair share of controversial incidents. He's beenaccused of bullyingin the past, exploiting other YouTubers and creating content inappropriate for his young audience. In the opening episode, Shane asks: ""Could he be doing this series with me just to get views?"" But the reason Shane has made this series on his channel - which has around 18m subscribers - is because there's big business in getting ad sponsors at the beginning of his vlogs. Shane ""could definitely be paid anything from $85,000 to $170,000 for one video,"" explains Jessica Brennan, an influencer marketing manager for agency The Specialist Works. ""The fact he's probably making around 15 videos a month means he's earning around $2m a month."" That's a claim that Shane denied when he saw our story. Allow Twitter content?

During one of the earlier episodes Shane asks, ""Is Jake Paul a sociopath?"" - a comment which resulted in a lot of criticism for making a reckless claim without substance. Shane apologised on Snapchat, and now he's tweeted that he's taking a break from social media until the series is complete. Lesser-known YouTubers are uploading reaction videos to the series, something Jessica would advise channels to do. ""It's a great tactic to jump on the bandwagon, it means you get more views suddenly because people are searching for this subject,"" Jessica tells Newsbeat. It essentially creates a chain reaction, allowing other vloggers to capitalise on the original series. Fraser Macdonald, known as iNabber on the platform, appears in episode one and says it was a ""career-changing opportunity"". ""I've gained around 70,000 subscribers in a few days,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""It means the money's going to go up."" This video can not be played How Logan and Jake Paul became social media superstars Jake posted on his own channel that he's had no influence on the production of the series. Recently, vlogger Joe Suggtold Newsbeat he's hopinghis appearance on Strictly Come Dancing will allow social media stars to transition to mainstream media. But that might not be a priority for Shane. If one of his shows was on traditional TV, or even newer services like Netflix, he would have to split the money with the platform or TV channel. By creating a series like this, he gets to keep all the profits. Jessica says that could set a trend, with other vloggers ""evolving"" their channels to replicate what Shane is doing.

Second allergy death from Pret sandwich,"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, also died after suffering an allergic reaction to a Pret sandwich, in 2016 A second customer is believed to have died from an allergic reaction to a product bought from Pret a Manger, the chain has said. The person died in 2017 after eating a ""super-veg rainbow flatbread"" which was supposed to be dairy-free. Sandwich chain Pret said it was mis-sold a guaranteed dairy-free yoghurt, as it contained dairy protein. But the company who sold Pret the yoghurt denied that it is to blame and said the ""true cause"" is unknown. It comes after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15,died after eating a Pret a Manger baguette in 2016. Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death? 'People can die' - allergy sufferers speak out The second customer died on 27 December last year after buying the sandwich from a store in Stall Street, Bath. Pret said the yoghurt in the product was supplied by Coyo - a coconut milk brand which is stocked in shops and supermarkets across the UK. The chain said it withdrew all affected products as soon as it was made aware of the incident by Bath and North East Somerset Council. A Pret spokesman said subsequent testing by Pret and two independent authorities found the Coyo dairy-free yoghurt contained traces of dairy protein. ""This is believed to have resulted in the tragic death of a customer from an allergic reaction in December 2017,"" he said. Pret then ended its relationship with Coyo and is in the process of taking legal action, he added. In February this year,Coyo recalled all of its dairy-free coconut yoghurtsafter they were found to contain dairy. The vegan brand was investigated by the Food Standards Agency and the London Borough of Bexley - where Coyo is based - before it issued an allergy alert. But in a statement on Sunday, Coyo denied it was to blame for the death. It said the contamination of its yoghurts in February was not related to the Pret case, and urged against speculation. ""The claims made by Pret are unfounded,"" it said. ""The dairy-free product we provided to Pret in December 2017, at the time of this tragedy, is not linked to the product we recalled in February 2018. ""The product recalled in 2018 was made with a contaminated raw material that was only supplied to us in January 2018. ""Pret's inability to provide us with a batch code, despite several requests, has severely limited our ability to investigate this further."" Allow Twitter content?

Coyo added that it will continue to assist in the case to find the ""true cause"". ""We urge all parties to work together, and not to speculate on the cause of this tragic death which is unknown as far as we are aware and is still being investigated by the coroner's court,"" the company added. Following the incident in February, Coyo previously said it was ""devastated"" to discover dairy in its yoghurts, ""especially as being dairy-free sits at the heart of everything we do"". It said it had carried out a ""thorough review"" of its ingredients and identified that the contaminated material was provided by an external third-party supplier, whose relationship had now been terminated. By Joe Miller, business reporter, BBC News Pret made its name on the High Street with slogans such as ""freshly prepared, lovingly handmade"" - a concerted effort to differentiate itself from the average fast food joint. A page on its website is even entitled ""Doing the right thing: It's what makes Pret, Pret"". So the twin blows to its reputation - two deaths apparently due to allergic reactions to its food - strike at the very heart of the 32-year-old brand and it may explain why in this instance the chain has been so quick to point the finger at one of its former suppliers, Coyo. Unsurprisingly, Coyo, whose carefully curated social media feeds talk about ""trust"" and whose products are marketed as being integral to leading ""nourished lives"", has been quick to punch back. Coyo, as a younger, smaller, company, is perhaps more susceptible to reputational damage. But even Pret, which has grown exponentially over the last decade and has seen global sales rise year after year, will know that such headlines could eventually threaten its bottom line. The spokesman for Pret said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of our customer in this terrible case and we will seek to assist them in any way we can."" On Sunday, the family of Miss Ednan-Laperouse, who died from an allergic reaction to a Pret sandwich, said they were ""incredibly saddened"" to hear of a second death. ""Our hearts go out to the bereaved family.""

Pret announced it would list all ingredients on its freshly-made productsfollowing her death. Milk allergy is one of the most common allergies for children, but most grow out of it by the time they start school,the NHS says.,external For adults, it is rare - with one in every 200 adults estimated to have a cow's milk allergy, according to theAnaphylaxis Campaign charity.,external It is caused when the body's immune system wrongly perceives some of the proteins in cow's milk to be a threat. Symptoms can develop within minutes and can include redness, hives and puffiness around the mouth and eyes as well as vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea in some cases. In more serious cases, there may be an anaphylactic reaction which includes swelling in the mouth or throat, wheezing, coughing or a fall in blood pressure leading to collapse. According to the charity, a splash of milk on the skin can cause immediate symptoms in some cases. Inhaling cow's milk protein - for example when milk is being heated or prepared - can also cause reactions among some people. A milk allergy is not the same as lactose intolerance, which is a digestive problem.
