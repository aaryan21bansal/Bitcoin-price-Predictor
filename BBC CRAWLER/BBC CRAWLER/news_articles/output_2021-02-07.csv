Biden sets out firm line on Iran sanctionsJoe Biden says he will not lift sanctions to kick-start talks over Tehran's nuclear programme.US & Canada,"US President Joe Biden says he will not lift economic sanctions against Iran until it complies with the terms agreed under a 2015 nuclear deal. Mr Biden was speaking in a CBS News interview aired on Sunday. But Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Tehran would only return to compliance if the US first lifted all economic sanctions. The 2015 deal sought to limit Iran's nuclear programme, with sanctions eased in return. Former President Donald Trump, however, withdrew the US from the deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, leading Iran to roll back on a number of its commitments. Tough tests for Biden in 'new' Middle East Why do limits on uranium enrichment matter? Iran, which says its nuclear programme is peaceful, has been increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium. Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear bombs. Under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal - an agreement reached between Iran, the US, China, France, Germany, Russia and the UK - Tehran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment and allow international inspectors to access sites and facilities. In return, sanctions imposed on Tehran were lifted. But Mr Trump withdrew the US from the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in an effort to force Iran to negotiate a new accord, and reinstated economic sanctions. Mr Trump wanted to place indefinite curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles. Iran refused. In July 2019, it breached the 3.67% cap on uranium enrichment and in January this year announced it hadresumed enriching uranium to 20% purity. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% purity. This video can not be played The US and Iran came to the brink of war during Donald Trump's presidency In a short clip of the interview published before the full broadcast at 16:00 EST (21:00 GMT) on Sunday, Mr Biden was asked if he would halt economic sanctions to bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, and he replied: ""No."" What will Biden do about Iran? Meanwhile, Ali Khamenei said that for Iran to return to its commitments under the deal, the US must first ""abolish all sanctions"", Iranian state TV reported on Sunday. ""We will assess, and if we see that they have acted faithfully in this regard, we will return to our commitment,"" he said, adding: ""It is the irreversible and final decision and all Iranian officials have consensus over it."" The president also talked about the US relationship with China. He said there was no reason for Washington to be drawn into direct conflict with Beijing, but that both sides would engage in what he called ""extreme competition"" on the global economic stage. Mr Biden said he had not spoken to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, since becoming president last month, and that he had not changed his stance towards Beijing. ""He's very bright, he's very tough,"" Mr Biden said of Mr Xi, adding: ""He doesn't have a democratic - small 'd' - bone in his body.""

Amazon criticised in paying lower rates than shops,"Amazon has been criticised for paying less in business rates than British bricks and mortar retailers. The online retail giant's financial results revealed that UK sales for 2020 totalled $26.5bn (Â£19.3bn) - a 51% jump from $17.5bn in 2019. Amazon's overall business rates bill for 2020-2021 is estimated by researchers to be Â£71.5m - just 0.37% of its retail sales. They say this is far lower than what the retail sector typically pays. Amazon insists that it pays its tax and has created thousands of jobs in the UK. Sunak urges US to back digital services tax Amazon pays Â£290m in UK tax as sales surge to Â£14bn Online shoppers warned about hidden price rises Business rates are calculated by looking at a property's rateable value and multiplying it by a tax rate set by the government. A new tax rate comes into effect at the start of each financial year on 1 April. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), full-year retail sales at physical shops for the 12 months ending 31 December 2020 fell 10.3% from Â£318.5bn in 2019 to Â£285.8bn. Retail advisor Altus Group says that bricks and mortar retailers would have paid Â£8.25bn in business rates in 2020, had they not been given a tax holiday due to the pandemic. It says the figure was calculated using rateable values, multiplied by the 2020 tax rate. The Â£8.25bn figure amounts to 2.9% of total retail sales, which is much higher than what Amazon pays. For instance, Arcadia - which owns Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins -  would have had to pay Â£91m in business rates on its 444 stores in 2020, had there not been a tax holiday, Altus Group says. Without the business rates holiday, Arcadia Group would have paid Â£91m in taxes on its 444 stores in 2020, says Altus Group A Treasury spokesman said: ""We want to see thriving high streets, which is why we've spent tens of billions of pounds supporting shops throughout the pandemic and are supporting town centres through the changes online shopping brings. ""Our business rates review call for evidence included questions on whether we should shift the balance between online and physical shops by introducing an online sales tax. We're considering responses now."" Separately, the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) calculated the business rates paid by physical shops in 2019 and found that they paid Â£7.17bn in business rates, or 2.3% of their total retail sales in 2019. The two organisations said that Amazon, which has close to 100 sites in the UK, including distribution warehouses and lockers on High Streets, is not paying enough tax. However, their calculations do not include corporation tax, which is currently at 19% of profits. Amazon would not comment on the calculations made by Altus Group and CRR. A spokesman for Amazon said: ""We've invested more than Â£23bn in jobs and infrastructure in the UK since 2010. ""Last year we created 10,000 new jobs and last week we announced 1,000 new apprenticeships. This continued investment helped contribute to a total tax contribution of Â£1.1bn during 2019 - Â£293m in direct taxes and Â£854m in indirect taxes."" The government is currently reviewing the way in which the business rates system works, and is also separately considering a 2% tax on online sales and services. But business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that any tax rises would place additional pressure on businesses that are already struggling due to the pandemic.

Over 12 million in UK have had first Covid jab,"More than 12 million people in the UK have now had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, after 550,000 first jabs were given out on Saturday. The government is aiming to offer first doses to 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. At the current rate, about 16 million people would receive a first jab by that date. The UK's daily Covid cases continue to fall, but remain high - with another 15,845 reported on Sunday. Another 373 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the data also showed. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. When will I get the vaccine? Will I get side effects from the vaccine? The update on vaccine progress comes as scientists say early trials suggest Oxford-AstraZeneca's jaboffers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. Meanwhile, workplace Covid testing isbeing offered to more companies in England, for staff who cannot work from home during lockdown, the government says. Businesses with more than 50 employees are now able to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. The speedy rollout of Covid vaccines to all vulnerable people is seen as critical to reducing the pandemic's death toll and relieving pressure on the NHS. Once the first four priority groups, including the over-70s, healthcare workers and people shielding, have received their jabs, the programme will move on to people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions. From spring, the government plans to begin vaccinating the rest of the adult population, another 21 million people. Teachers, transport workers, supermarket workers and the military could be prioritised. The UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, andScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externaleach offer their own advice on testing. On Sunday, Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman said her ambitionwas to have every adult vaccinated for Covid ""in the summer"". The Scottish government had previously set a September target to vaccinate all over-18s. The UK is currently receiving doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and a second vaccine, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. A third vaccine, made by US company Moderna, has been approved but supplies are not expected to be available until spring. The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Palace denies reports Queen lobbied to change law,"The Queen was shown legislation which may have forced her to reveal her private finances in the 1970s ""by convention"", Buckingham Palace says. Paperspublished by the Guardian,externalsuggest the monarch's personal lawyers successfully lobbied to change a draft law to conceal her wealth. The documents were unearthed as part of an investigation into Queen's consent. It is a process where Parliament asks for consent when debating bills which affect the Crown's interests. More than 1,000 draft laws have been seen by the Queen or the Prince of Wales before being approved by MPs as part of the procedure,the Guardian said,external. Queen's consent is always granted where requested, the palace said. The long-established convention sees the monarch asked to provide consent by Parliament when it is considering legislation ""which would affect the prerogative or interests of the Crown"", according to the Royal Family's website. This process is separate to Royal Assent, where the monarch formally approves to a bill passed by Parliament for it to become law. Royal Assent has not been refused since 1708. Royal accounts show potential Â£35m Covid shortfall Queen and Prince Philip get Covid vaccine New Â£5 coin to mark Queen's 95th birthday The government memos, found in the National Archives, date back to 1973. They show that the Queen, concerned that new legislation might force her to reveal her private holdings in companies, despatched lawyers to argue her case with the then Department of Trade and Industry. A revision to the draft law subsequently enabled her as a head of state to sidestep the new regulations. The Guardian suggests that early sight of the draft legislation, under the powers of Queen's consent, gave the monarch an unrivalled opportunity to influence the legislation to her advantage. This is a good get by the Guardian - shining a light into the always-sensitive interactions between palace and government as regards money. The palace line on this is pretty simple - the mechanism of Queen's consent is a matter for government and discussions between the sovereign through her lawyers and government departments are a fact of life. Getting first sight of legislation that may affect you is a pretty significant advantage for any monarch. Not because anyone thinks about a block or veto or a threat of it.  But because then you get a chance to get your lawyers round early. Why is the palace denying a threat of a block, something that no one has alleged? Because, says a source, the allegations put to it by the Guardian were broader than those that turned up in the story published yesterday. It's not entirely surprising that given the consultation in these areas, the Queen would have something to say. The Queen is not a normal citizen. The tone of the correspondence published by the Guardian is a little surprising - it suggests a degree of involvement that belies the palace's claim that the mechanism is simply a formality. The Guardian has compiled a list of 1,062 parliamentary bills that it says have been subject to Queen's consent since Elizabeth II's reign began in 1952 - which works out at about 14 uses of the procedure per year. It features a wide range of legislation including laws which affected her private estates in Balmoral and Sandringham. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""Queen's consent is a parliamentary process, with the role of sovereign purely formal. Consent is always granted by the monarch where requested by government. Any assertion that the sovereign has blocked legislation is simply incorrect. ""Whether Queen's consent is required is decided by Parliament, independently from the royal household, in matters that would affect Crown interests, including personal property and personal interests of the monarch. ""If consent is required, draft legislation is, by convention, put to the sovereign to grant solely on advice of ministers and as a matter of public record.""

Man City put four past Reds at AnfieldTwo errors from Liverpool keeper Alisson gift leaders Manchester City a 10th straight Premier League win and a 10-point lead over the champions.,"This video can not be played Analysis: 'I love him' - Jenas on 'remarkable' Foden display Manchester City took a potentially decisive hold on the Premier League title race as they thrashed Liverpool at Anfield - helped by a virtuoso performance by Phil Foden and a nightmare display from the champions' goalkeeper Alisson. City's comprehensive triumph, their first at Anfield since 2003 and Pep Guardiola's first away to Liverpool as a manager, was achieved in such comfort that they were able to recover from Ilkay Gundogan's first-half penalty miss. Gundogan, who skied his spot-kick after Fabinho fouled Raheem Sterling, made amends when he put City ahead four minutes into the second period, after Alisson could only push out Foden's shot. Mohamed Salah equalised for Liverpool from the spot just after the hour after he was hauled back by Ruben Dias - but then came the combination of Alisson's errors and Foden's genius as the hosts were run ragged. Alisson was punished for two poor clearances as Foden set up Gundogan to put City back in front after 73 minutes, then three minutes later the Brazil keeper inexplicably sent a pass straight to Bernardo Silva, whose clever cross was headed in almost on the goalline by Sterling. City saved the best until last when Foden, the game's outstanding performer and watched by England manager Gareth Southgatei, thundered a magnificent finish high past the beleaguered Alisson seven minutes from time. The emphatic victory leaves City five points ahead of second-placed Manchester United, having played a game less - and 10 points ahead of Liverpool with a match in hand. Only Man City collapse will stop title win now, but I don't see them cracking - Shearer analysis 'Too soon to talk of crisis, but champions on worrying slide' Foden a 'huge talent' but can 'still improve' - Guardiola Manchester City and Guardiola have had some miserable days and nights at Anfield since Jurgen Klopp became Liverpool manager - this was the game, the performance and the scoreline that made this almost the perfect day. Guardiola's incendiary reaction to Gundogan's first-half penalty miss demonstrated how much he wanted to win this game and perhaps how he feared history repeating itself. But his frustration was short-lived as City produced a second-half masterclass that left the champions badly beaten. And while the Reds will point to their collection of injuries as a reason for their fall from grace, it should also be pointed out that City were missing the brilliance of midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and the predatory instincts of striker Sergio Aguero. It was only a rare error from Dias that gave Liverpool hope - although Sadio Mane headed over in the first half and Ederson saved well from Roberto Firmino - and once Gudogan restored City's advantage there was only one winner here. This video can not be played Liverpool performance was good enough to draw - Klopp At the heart of it all was the brilliant Foden, head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch and flourishing even more when Guardiola cleverly removed Riyad Mahrez and placed the 20-year-old England international on the right flank. He made two goals and scored a sensational fourth as City put down a marker and confirmed their status as the team to beat in the title race. It was also a 14th straight win, which equals the all-time winning run by an English top-flight team, shared with Preston in 1892 and Arsenal in 1987. City have been growing in stature in recent weeks, imperious in defence and threatening in attack - but this ruthless dismissal of an opponent that has haunted them at Anfield in the recent past is their most powerful statement of intent yet. The sight of Liverpool keeper Alisson slumping in dejection after Foden's shot tore past him into the roof of the net - he could barely have seen it - for Manchester City's fourth goal summed up the sheer misery of the champions. As Liverpool have won Premier League and Champions League titles, the 28-year-old Brazilian has been one of their most reliable figures, a game-changer to place alongside the arrival of defender Virgil van Dijk. However, he suffered arguably the biggest nightmare of his Liverpool career on Sunday, making two bad clearances in the build-up to City's crucial second goal, then compounding it with an even worse error as he picked out Silva standing all on his own with an inexplicable pass, the Portuguese accepting the invitation to set up Sterling. Alisson is the first Liverpool keeper to make two errors leading directly to a goal in a single game since Loris Karius against Real Madrid in the Champions League final in May 2018 Liverpool showed occasional flashes of the old flair in the first half but ended up outclassed and on the receiving end of their third successive Premier League home loss, City following in the footsteps of Burnley  - who ended the Reds' 68-match unbeaten league run at Anfield - and Brighton. In reality, it was City - so organised, composed and determined to press Liverpool - who were vastly superior over the whole piece. Of course, Liverpool injuries will take a heavy toll, but this was a tough 90 minutes for midfielder Thiago Alcantara, who is struggling to adapt to the pace of the Premier League and made life difficult for himself with a needless early foul on Gundogan that brought a yellow card. This video can not be played Guardiola impressed by Man City commitment And while much is rightly made of the attacking prowess of full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, they struggled to cope with City's width as Sterling and Foden exposed them brutally at times. Liverpool look very flat at Anfield and the stats say it all. They are the first side to lose three straight home matches the season after winning the title since Chelsea in March 1956 and have 27 points fewer than they did at the same stage last season - the biggest drop by any reigning champions in top-flight history. Klopp clearly felt this was not the day to risk his deadline-day centre-back signings Ben Davies and Ozan Kabak, but they still looked horribly vulnerable. Liverpool's manager and their players have enjoyed some triumphant days against City here in recent seasons - this was not one of them. Liverpool manager Klopp told BBC Sport:""I saw a really good game and big mistakes. In each game, when you make these kind of mistakes, it's very likely you concede goals. ""It's easy to agree that the first half was a really good game, two sides really trying a lot to cause problems for each other, and I liked a lot I saw in the game. ""Coming out in the second half, they changed the system and we didn't move enough in midfield. We scored our goal and in that moment it was possible the game goes in our direction, but Alisson made two massive mistakes, gave two goals away - and then a genius situation from Phil Foden. ""The confidence could have suffered after the last game but tonight I saw a very confident team, if I'm honest. I liked the football we played. It's very difficult to explain that we lost 4-1."" Manchester City boss Guardiola told BBC Sport:""I have a lot of emotions, many things happening in the game. Gundogan missed a penalty - it's like a routine against them - but we started really, really well, doing what we want to do. ""In the second half, the way we reacted to the goal, the way we played with quality, made the difference. ""For many years we were not able to win here. Hopefully next time we can do it with people. Anfield is so intimidating."" Speaking to Sky Sports, he added:""It is an important win, but it is February. Of course, the gap to fifth is big right now and [qualifying] for the Champions League next season is important - but 10 wins in a row in this period is something exceptional."" Four of the past six penalties to have missed the target completely in the Premier League have been by Manchester City players, with three of those coming against Liverpool (Mahrez in October 2018, De Bruyne in November 2020 and Gundogan on Sunday). In comparison, Liverpool have converted their last 19 Premier League penalties, with Salah scoring 13 of those. City's Sterling won his 21st penalty in the Premier League - more than any other player in the history of the competition. Sterling is only the third player to score 100 or more goals under Guardiola, after Barcelona's Lionel Messi (211) and City team-mate Aguero (120). Of all players to score at least 10 goals within the top five European leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) this season, only Borussia Dortmund's Erling Braut Haaland (20 years 2021 days) is younger than Manchester City's Foden (20 years 255 days). Since netting his first goal of the season on 15 December, City's Ilkay Gundogan has scored at least three more Premier League goals than any other player (nine). Liverpool visit third-placed Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday (12:30 GMT kick-off).

Man City put four past Reds at AnfieldTwo errors from Liverpool keeper Alisson gift leaders Manchester City a 10th straight Premier League win and a 10-point lead over the champions.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Analysis: 'I love him' - Jenas on 'remarkable' Foden display Manchester City took a potentially decisive hold on the Premier League title race as they thrashed Liverpool at Anfield - helped by a virtuoso performance by Phil Foden and a nightmare display from the champions' goalkeeper Alisson. City's comprehensive triumph, their first at Anfield since 2003 and Pep Guardiola's first away to Liverpool as a manager, was achieved in such comfort that they were able to recover from Ilkay Gundogan's first-half penalty miss. Gundogan, who skied his spot-kick after Fabinho fouled Raheem Sterling, made amends when he put City ahead four minutes into the second period, after Alisson could only push out Foden's shot. Mohamed Salah equalised for Liverpool from the spot just after the hour after he was hauled back by Ruben Dias - but then came the combination of Alisson's errors and Foden's genius as the hosts were run ragged. Alisson was punished for two poor clearances as Foden set up Gundogan to put City back in front after 73 minutes, then three minutes later the Brazil keeper inexplicably sent a pass straight to Bernardo Silva, whose clever cross was headed in almost on the goalline by Sterling. City saved the best until last when Foden, the game's outstanding performer and watched by England manager Gareth Southgatei, thundered a magnificent finish high past the beleaguered Alisson seven minutes from time. The emphatic victory leaves City five points ahead of second-placed Manchester United, having played a game less - and 10 points ahead of Liverpool with a match in hand. Only Man City collapse will stop title win now, but I don't see them cracking - Shearer analysis 'Too soon to talk of crisis, but champions on worrying slide' Foden a 'huge talent' but can 'still improve' - Guardiola Manchester City and Guardiola have had some miserable days and nights at Anfield since Jurgen Klopp became Liverpool manager - this was the game, the performance and the scoreline that made this almost the perfect day. Guardiola's incendiary reaction to Gundogan's first-half penalty miss demonstrated how much he wanted to win this game and perhaps how he feared history repeating itself. But his frustration was short-lived as City produced a second-half masterclass that left the champions badly beaten. And while the Reds will point to their collection of injuries as a reason for their fall from grace, it should also be pointed out that City were missing the brilliance of midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and the predatory instincts of striker Sergio Aguero. It was only a rare error from Dias that gave Liverpool hope - although Sadio Mane headed over in the first half and Ederson saved well from Roberto Firmino - and once Gudogan restored City's advantage there was only one winner here. This video can not be played Liverpool performance was good enough to draw - Klopp At the heart of it all was the brilliant Foden, head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch and flourishing even more when Guardiola cleverly removed Riyad Mahrez and placed the 20-year-old England international on the right flank. He made two goals and scored a sensational fourth as City put down a marker and confirmed their status as the team to beat in the title race. It was also a 14th straight win, which equals the all-time winning run by an English top-flight team, shared with Preston in 1892 and Arsenal in 1987. City have been growing in stature in recent weeks, imperious in defence and threatening in attack - but this ruthless dismissal of an opponent that has haunted them at Anfield in the recent past is their most powerful statement of intent yet. The sight of Liverpool keeper Alisson slumping in dejection after Foden's shot tore past him into the roof of the net - he could barely have seen it - for Manchester City's fourth goal summed up the sheer misery of the champions. As Liverpool have won Premier League and Champions League titles, the 28-year-old Brazilian has been one of their most reliable figures, a game-changer to place alongside the arrival of defender Virgil van Dijk. However, he suffered arguably the biggest nightmare of his Liverpool career on Sunday, making two bad clearances in the build-up to City's crucial second goal, then compounding it with an even worse error as he picked out Silva standing all on his own with an inexplicable pass, the Portuguese accepting the invitation to set up Sterling.

South Africa halts AstraZeneca jab over new strain,"South Africa has recorded more than 1.4 million Covid cases South Africa has put its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold after a study showed ""disappointing"" results against its new Covid variant. Scientists say the variant accounts for 90% of new Covid cases in South Africa. The trial, involving some 2,000 people, found that the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases. But experts are hopeful that the vaccine will still be effective at preventing severe cases. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent. The country has received one million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and was preparing to start vaccinating people. Oxford jab offers less S Africa Covid protection How worrying are the new variants? South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against jumping to conclusions about the efficacy of Covid vaccines. Dr Katherine O'Brien, the WHO's director of immunisation, said it was very plausible that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would still have a meaningful impact on the South African variant, especially when it came to preventing hospitalisations and death. ""Comparing from one piece of evidence to the next really can't be done without a sort of level playing field,"" she said, referring to the evaluation of different trials in different populations and age groups. Dr O'Brien stressed that the WHO's expert panel held ""a very positive view"" of proceeding with the use of the vaccine, including in areas where variants were circulating, but that more data and information would be needed as the pandemic continued. South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said his government would wait for further advice on how best to proceed with the AstraZeneca vaccine in light of the findings. In the meantime, he said, the government would offer vaccines produced by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in the coming weeks. The trial was carried out by researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and the UK's Oxford University, but has not yet been peer reviewed. The trial's chief investigator, Prof Shabir Madhi, said it showed that ""unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness"". This video can not be played Prof Barry Schoub on South Africa's decision to stop the AstraZeneca vaccine roll-out. Prof Madhi said the study had not been able to investigate the vaccine's efficacy in preventing more serious infections, as participants had an average age of 31 and so did not represent the demographic most at risk of severe symptoms from the virus. The vaccine's similarity to one produced by Johnson & Johnson, which was found in a recent study to be highly effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa, suggested it would still prevent serious illness, according to Prof Madhi. ""There's still some hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine might well perform as well as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a different age group demographic that I address of severe disease,"" he told the BBC. Other experts were also hopeful that the vaccine remained effective at combating more serious cases. ""What we're seeing from other vaccine developers is that they have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses and what that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases, but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford's lead vaccine developer, told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. She said developers were likely to have a modified version of the injection against the South Africa variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, later this year. Ministers in the UK have sought to reassure the public over the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi saidthe injection appeared to work well against dominant variants in the UK, while Health Minister Edward Argar said there was ""no evidence"" the vaccine was not effective at preventing severe illness. Early results from Modernasuggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant, while AstraZeneca hassaid its vaccine provides good protection against the UK variant first identified late last year. Early results also suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. The mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target. It means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way. Trials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator. Therefore the news about Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue. The fact it now only has ""minimal"" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant. But we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings. What is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation. What this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus. Progress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this. The South Africa variant carries a mutation that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. However, there is no evidence that it causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. At least 20 other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have found cases of the variant. Many South Africans have reacted with shock and disappointment at news that the 1.5 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines will not be as effective as experts had hoped against the new variant first discovered here in November. While there are now more questions than ready answers, the message from health officials is that all is not lost. They believe the vaccine may still be effective in preventing severe illness and go some way in reducing the number of people who need to be admitted into hospital for treatment. This is important in a country where some 80% of the population cannot afford private health care and rely on state hospitals - which are currently overstretched - for health care. So what's the plan now? South Africa's health minister has said they will take a steer from local scientists on how to repurpose the vaccine to get the most out of it. It has been suggested that the vaccine may be useful if given to the older population and to people with co-morbidities. In terms of managing people's concerns, the government and scientists may need to go the extra mile in reassuring citizens that there is still a plan in place and lives can and will be saved.

Amazon criticised in paying lower rates than shopsAmazon has been accused of paying less business rates tax than British bricks and mortar retailers.Business,"Amazon has been criticised for paying less in business rates than British bricks and mortar retailers. The online retail giant's financial results revealed that UK sales for 2020 totalled $26.5bn (Â£19.3bn) - a 51% jump from $17.5bn in 2019. Amazon's overall business rates bill for 2020-2021 is estimated by researchers to be Â£71.5m - just 0.37% of its retail sales. They say this is far lower than what the retail sector typically pays. Amazon insists that it pays its tax and has created thousands of jobs in the UK. Sunak urges US to back digital services tax Amazon pays Â£290m in UK tax as sales surge to Â£14bn Online shoppers warned about hidden price rises Business rates are calculated by looking at a property's rateable value and multiplying it by a tax rate set by the government. A new tax rate comes into effect at the start of each financial year on 1 April. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), full-year retail sales at physical shops for the 12 months ending 31 December 2020 fell 10.3% from Â£318.5bn in 2019 to Â£285.8bn. Retail advisor Altus Group says that bricks and mortar retailers would have paid Â£8.25bn in business rates in 2020, had they not been given a tax holiday due to the pandemic. It says the figure was calculated using rateable values, multiplied by the 2020 tax rate. The Â£8.25bn figure amounts to 2.9% of total retail sales, which is much higher than what Amazon pays. For instance, Arcadia - which owns Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins -  would have had to pay Â£91m in business rates on its 444 stores in 2020, had there not been a tax holiday, Altus Group says. Without the business rates holiday, Arcadia Group would have paid Â£91m in taxes on its 444 stores in 2020, says Altus Group A Treasury spokesman said: ""We want to see thriving high streets, which is why we've spent tens of billions of pounds supporting shops throughout the pandemic and are supporting town centres through the changes online shopping brings. ""Our business rates review call for evidence included questions on whether we should shift the balance between online and physical shops by introducing an online sales tax. We're considering responses now."" Separately, the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) calculated the business rates paid by physical shops in 2019 and found that they paid Â£7.17bn in business rates, or 2.3% of their total retail sales in 2019. The two organisations said that Amazon, which has close to 100 sites in the UK, including distribution warehouses and lockers on High Streets, is not paying enough tax. However, their calculations do not include corporation tax, which is currently at 19% of profits. Amazon would not comment on the calculations made by Altus Group and CRR. A spokesman for Amazon said: ""We've invested more than Â£23bn in jobs and infrastructure in the UK since 2010. ""Last year we created 10,000 new jobs and last week we announced 1,000 new apprenticeships. This continued investment helped contribute to a total tax contribution of Â£1.1bn during 2019 - Â£293m in direct taxes and Â£854m in indirect taxes."" The government is currently reviewing the way in which the business rates system works, and is also separately considering a 2% tax on online sales and services. But business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that any tax rises would place additional pressure on businesses that are already struggling due to the pandemic.

Largest protests in Myanmar in more than a decade,"This video can not be played Tens of thousands of people take part in the largest protest in Myanmar in more than a decade Myanmar has seen its largest protests in more than a decade, as tens of thousands of people rallied against the military coup and demanded the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. ""We don't want military dictatorship. We want democracy,"" the crowds chanted in the main city, Yangon. Rallies were held in more than a dozen other cities. Internet access has now been restored after a day-long blackout. The army has not yet commented on the growing opposition to Monday's coup. The military seized power after claiming, without evidence, that the November election was fraudulent. The rulers declared a year-long state of emergency and have been hunkered down in the capital, Nay Pyi Daw. Ms Suu Kyi and senior leaders of her National League for Democracy Party (NLD), including President Win Myint, have been put under house arrest. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Citizens protest through art What this means for Aung San Suu Kyi In Yangon, people wore red shirts and held red balloons, the colour of Ms Suu Kyi's party, while cars and buses slowed to sound their horns in support. Many flashed the three-finger salute, a symbol of defiance against authoritarianism in the region. Demonstrators waved flags of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party in Yangon The internet shutdown imposed by the military failed to curb the protesters. ""Respect our vote,"" read one banner, in reference to the NLD's landslide win in November. Sunday's protests in Yangon were the biggest since the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, when thousands of the country's monks rose up against the military regime. Crowds marched towards the Sule Pagoda in the city centre while police vehicles and officers in riot gear were stationed near Yangon University. There were no immediate reports of violence. Anti-coup protesters gathered in Yangon on Sunday despite an internet shutdown ""First, we don't want to go back to military rule. We don't want to live in fear. Secondly, we want Mother Su to be freed from being under detention unjustly,"" a protester told the BBC. ""And third, we want to root out the system where soldiers take civilian administrative positions."" Another demonstrator said that Ms Suu Kyi was ""our true leader"", adding: ""She is our only hope for our democracy, if she died or something happened to her, what is our future? We really need her back."" A third said: ""This protest is not the end. We'll group... [every day] until we're free from the dictatorship."" Smaller protests were also held in Nay Pyi Daw, Mawlamine and Mandalay, the country's second-largest city. In the town of Myawaddy, there were reports of shots being fired, but no immediate reports of any injuries. According to some local media outlets, police had used rubber bullets to break up a rally. By Nyein Chan, BBC Burmese, Yangon People from all different backgrounds, not just students and activists, have joined the protests in Yangon. They shouted anti-military slogans and sang famous revolutionary songs from the 1988 student uprising against the military regime. The atmosphere was charged and protesters were defiant. They are angry but also quietly afraid. They know that the military is capable of using violence to suppress dissent but they feel like they have no choice. When a group of protesters met a row of soldiers they chanted at them: ""You're trained to be professional soldiers, do not kill civilians."" The monitoring group NetBlocks Internet Observatory said connectivity rose to about 50% by 14:00 local time (07:30 GMT) but access to social media, including Facebook and Twitter, remained blocked. The shutdown was criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International said the blackout was ""heinous and reckless"" and warned it could put people at risk of human rights violations. Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds Where else have we seen the three-finger salute? How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' The United Nations special rapporteur on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, called on the agency's Human Rights Council to convene a special session on the ""unfolding crisis"", saying: ""[The] junta must stand down now."" The coup took place as a new session of parliament was set to open. Many Burmese watched events unfold in real time on Facebook, which is the country's primary source of information and news.

Snatched from a beach to train North Korea's spies,"15 November 1977, Niigata, Japan: It was after sunset on a crisp November evening when Megumi Yokota left her last badminton practice. Sharp winds chilled the fishing port of Niigata, and the grey sea rumbled at its brink. The lights of home were seven minutes' walk away. Megumi, 13, with her book-bag and badminton racquet, said goodbye to two friends 800ft from her parents' front door. But she never reached it. As six o'clock became seven and the quiet street failed to produce her daughter, Sakie Yokota began to panic. She ran to the gym at Yorii Middle School, expecting to meet her en route. ""They left a long time ago,"" the school's night watchman said. Police, tracker dogs, torches splitting the darkness. They scoured a nearby pine forest calling Megumi's name. Sakie sped down the road to the beach, frantically scanning every car parked nearby. It made sense to search the shoreline. But perhaps something stronger and more ineffable drove the mother to the water's edge that night. Out on the Sea of Japan, out of Sakie's sight, a boat manned by North Korean agents was speeding towards the Korean Peninsula with a terrified schoolgirl locked in the hold. They left no evidence, and not a single witness. The crime was so brazen and bizarre that few would even imagine it, let alone solve it. But over the years, it became clear that Megumi was not the only victim. The Japanese government says that from 1977 until at least 1983, North Korean agents abducted 17 Japanese citizens. Some analysts believe the true figure could be more than 100. In the year that followed Megumi's disappearance, police poured 3,000 staff days into the search. A kidnapping unit occupied the Yokota house. Patrol boats cross-hatched the sea. The investigation drew an agonising blank. Megumi's father Shigeru paced the sand every morning. At night, he cried in the bath. Sakie cried when she was alone, hoping Megumi's brothers, twins aged nine, wouldn't hear her. A dark sand-timer had turned over for the Yokota family. For years, they tried simply to endure the void. But missing Megumi was alive. A North Korean spy who defected to the South in 1993 told Seoul in detail about an abducted Japanese woman who matched her description. ""I remember her very clearly,"" said Ahn Myong-jin. ""I was young, and she was beautiful."" He said one of her kidnappers - a senior spy-master - had told him her story in 1988: The abduction was an unplanned blunder, he said. No-one had meant to take a kid. Two agents finishing up a spy mission to Niigata had been waiting on the beach for a pick-up boat, when they realised they'd been spotted from the road. Fearing discovery, they grabbed the figure. Megumi was tall for her age, and in the darkness they couldn't tell she was a child. She arrived in North Korea after 40 hours locked in a pitch-black storage room, Ahn said, her fingernails torn and bloody from trying to claw her way out. The agents who took her were chastised for their poor judgement. She was too young; what use did they have for a little girl? Megumi cried for her mother and refused to eat, unnerving her state minders. To soothe her, they promised that if she worked hard and learned fluent Korean, she would be allowed to go home. It was a lie to fool a devastated child. Her captors had no such intention. Instead, North Korea would force Megumi to work as a spy trainer, teaching Japanese language and behaviour at an elite school for espionage. For this to happen once would be extraordinary. But the bungled abduction set a kind of precedent in North Korea. The country's future leader Kim Jong-il, then head of its intelligence services, wanted to expand his spy programme. Kidnapped foreigners weren't just useful as teachers. They could be spies themselves, or Pyongyang could steal their identities for false passports. They could marry other foreigners (something forbidden to North Koreans), and their children, too, could serve the regime. The beaches of Japan were full of ordinary people, ripe for abduction, who would stand no chance against highly-trained agents. ""People think I don't remember much about my sister... but I do clearly remember her, even though I was third or fourth grade in elementary school."" When Megumi's younger brother, Takuya Yokota, and his twin Tetsuya were nine, the police hunting for Megumi showed them martial arts videos, urging them - ""don't get beaten - be strong."" Every day for 43 years, he has tried to heed that advice. Now 52, he sits in a business suit holding a copy of a postcard his sister sent before her kidnapping. At the end she wrote, ""I'll be home soon!! Please wait."" ""She was very chatty, very active and bright,"" he says. ""She was like a sunflower for our family. ""Without her at the dining table, conversation was limited. The atmosphere got very dark. ""I was very worried, but somehow I went to bed and got up in the morning - every day, to find that she was missing. I got up, and I still couldn't find her."" For the first two decades after Megumi disappeared, the Yokotas had nothing but a cold case and their own desperate need to understand what had happened. They tried to guess how she might be ageing. She had been tall at 13; was she still? Had she kept her childhood dimples? A shadow hung over every question. They had no clue if she had survived that last November night. In coastal towns in the late 1970s, rumours hovered like sea gulls. Locals spoke of strange radio signals and lights from unknown ships, or Korean cigarette packets discarded by the shore. In August 1978, a couple on a beach date in Toyama prefecture were gagged, hooded and handcuffed by four men who spoke oddly formal, accented Japanese. They were hastily abandoned when a dog-walker came by and the dog barked, spooking their attackers. Others were less lucky. On 7 January 1980, Japan's Sankei Shimbun newspaper ran a front-page story: ""Three couples on dates evaporate mysteriously along the coasts of Fukui, Niigata, and Kagoshima - is a foreign intelligence agency involved?"" But it took a convicted terrorist to finally firm up the link to North Korea. Kim Hyun-hui had killed 115 people by helping to smuggle a bomb onto a South Korean passenger plane in 1987. Staring down a death sentence in Seoul, she testified that she was a North Korean agent acting on state orders. She said she had learned Japanese language and behaviour so she could work undercover. Her teacher, she said, was an abducted Japanese woman whom she lived with for almost two years. The testimony was compelling. But Japan's government wouldn't officially acknowledge that North Korea was stealing people. The two countries had a hostile history and no diplomatic relations. It was easier to ignore the evidence. When Japanese negotiators tried to raise the issue privately, the North angrily denied any abductees existed and terminated talks. It was 1997 - 20 years after Megumi went missing - when Pyongyang finally agreed to investigate. 21 January 1997 ""We have information that your daughter is alive in North Korea."" Shigeru was stunned. A Japanese official named Tatsukichi Hyomoto, the personal secretary to an MP, had contacted the Yokotas out of the blue. He had been probing abductions by Pyongyang for a decade, and wanted to meet them as soon as possible. Along with deep shock, a mad hope sprang back into the family's hearts. The government believed Megumi was alive. So the question at once became: How do we get her back? The Yokotas went public with their kidnap story. They were terrified North Korea would kill Megumi to cover up what had happened, but her father argued the case would be treated as hearsay unless her name was revealed. They had to spread the news across Japan, and beg the country for help. The family appeared on primetime TV. Questions were raised in parliament. In May, the government publicly confirmed that Megumi was not an isolated case: There were more like the Yokotas, aching for stolen daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and mothers. Seven of these families formed a support group to demand the rescue of their loved ones: the Association of Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea. They talked at length, pooling what little they knew. The abductions appeared opportunistic, but patterns soon emerged. Most victims were young lovers in their twenties. Beaches across Japan had been recast as crime scenes. On 12 August 1978, nine months after Megumi disappeared, 24-year-old office clerk Rumiko Masumoto went to watch the sunset with her boyfriend, Shuichi Ishikawa, 23, at a beach in Kagoshima Prefecture. Just a day earlier, she had shyly told her family about their relationship over dinner. Their car was found locked at the scene, with Rumiko's wallet and sunglasses in the passenger seat. Her camera was there too - filled with pictures the couple took of each other the day they disappeared. Police picked up one of Shuichi's sandals not far from the water's edge. Every kidnapping was a private tragedy. A loved one who fell out of the world without notice. Some of those left bereft were driven to the edge of madness by their loss. The press and the public weren't always sympathetic. News reports referred to the abductions as ""alleged"". Several Japanese politicians believed the claims were South Korean disinformation spread to discredit the North. But as the families drew up petitions, filled the airwaves, and lobbied the government, the truth was gathering weight like a rolling snowball. Five years later, in North Korea, it would stop at the feet of Kim Jong-il himself. 17 September 2002 ""As the host, I regret that we had to make the prime minister of Japan come to Pyongyang so early in the morning,"" said North Korea's leader. But his companion's anger had nothing to do with the time. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi had flown in to discuss normalising Japan's relations with North Korea, hoping the step would boost his flagging opinion rating. Instead, he had walked into a diplomatic ambush. After a brutal 1990s famine believed to have killed more than two million North Koreans, Kim Jong-il wanted food aid and investment, and an apology for Japan's 35-year colonisation of Korea. Japan wanted - and had refused to proceed without - details of every citizen abducted by Pyongyang's spies. Half an hour before the historic meeting, the list of names appeared: North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens. But just five were said to be alive. The causes of death given for the other eight included drowning, choking on the fumes from a broken coal heater, a heart attack in a woman of 27, and two car accidents in a country where private citizens rarely own cars. Pyongyang claimed it could not provide their remains, as floods had washed away almost all their graves. Koizumi was aghast. ""I was utterly distressed by the information that was provided,"" he told Kim Jong-il, ""and as the prime minister, who is ultimately responsible for the interests and security of the Japanese people, I must strongly protest. I cannot bear to imagine how the remaining family members will take the news."" Kim listened in silence, taking notes on a memo pad, then enquired: ""Shall we take a break now?"" Debating their predicament in an anteroom, deputy Cabinet spokesman Shinzo Abe - who would become Japan's longest-serving prime minister - urged Koizumi not to sign the declaration committing to normalisation talks unless Pyongyang formally apologised for the kidnappings. When the delegates reconvened, Kim picked up a memo and read: ""We have thoroughly investigated this matter, including by examining our government's role in it. Decades of adversarial relations between our two countries provided the background of this incident. It was, nevertheless, an appalling incident. ""It is my understanding that this incident was initiated by special mission organizations in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by blindly motivated patriotism and misguided heroism. ""[…] As soon as their scheme and deeds were brought to my attention, those who were responsible were punished. This kind of thing will never be repeated."" The dictator of Pyongyang said the abductions were designed to provide its spies with native-Japanese teachers, and false identities for missions in South Korea. Some victims were snatched from beaches, yes - and others lured from studies or travels in Europe. He spoke of Megumi, the youngest named abductee by many years, saying her kidnappers had been tried and found guilty in 1998. One was executed, and the other died during a 15-year sentence, he said. ""I would like to take this opportunity to apologise straightforwardly for the regrettable conduct of those people. I will not allow that to happen again."" Koizumi signed the Pyongyang Declaration. Five alive, eight declared dead. Back in Japan, at a Tokyo guesthouse owned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the abductees' families were waiting anxiously for news. Megumi's parents sat down with the Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister, Shigeo Uetake. He took a breath. ""I regret to inform you..."" North Korea says Megumi Yokota hanged herself in a pine forest on 13 April 1994, on the grounds of a Pyongyang mental hospital where she was being treated for depression. This is her second death date. The North initially claimed she had died on 13 March 1993, before declaring that an error. As evidence, Pyongyang produced what it said was a hospital ""death registry"". It was a form with the words ""Registry of Patient Entering and Leaving the Hospital,"" on the back of it. But ""Entering and Leaving the Hospital,"" had been crossed out several times and the word ""Death,"" written instead. Japan told North Korea it found the document highly suspect. Another kidnapped Japanese woman, Fukie Chimura, later said that Megumi had moved in next-door to her and her husband in North Korea in June 1994, two months after Megumi's supposed death, and lived there for several months. The Yokota family don't believe Megumi killed herself. Still, Sakie finds the details of Pyongyang's story chilling. ""In Niigata, we had pine forests,"" she told the Washington Post in 2002. ""I'm sure she missed them. I'm sure she was very lonely. For a minute, I thought maybe she longed so much for us and she couldn't come back that, in an instant, she [took her own life.] ""I cried. But in the next minute, I said no, that could not have happened. I do not want it to have happened. I don't want her to have gone through that."" Two years after declaring Megumi dead, Pyongyang handed over what it said were her ashes. They arrived on the 27th anniversary of her kidnapping. Her parents had kept their daughter's umbilical cord when she was born - a Japanese tradition - and DNA tests were performed. The samples didn't match. The scientist who tested the ashes would later say they could have been contaminated, making the result inconclusive. But North Korea had form for providing dubious remains. It had already sent bones it claimed were those of abductee Kaoru Matsuki, a man it said had died aged 42. They included a jawbone fragment which a dental expert said belonged to a woman in her sixties. On 15 October 2002, the five abductees who North Korea said were alive landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. They stepped off the plane to Japanese flags and homemade ""Welcome home"" banners, and sobbed on the runway in the arms of their families. Pyongyang had agreed the five could visit Japan for a week to 10 days. They would never set foot in North Korea again. How do you rescue someone whose captor insists they are dead? Of course, the Yokotas weren't the only family facing this nightmarish question. Rumiko Masumoto, the young office clerk who disappeared with her new boyfriend, was also on the list of deceased. North Korea says Rumiko died of a heart attack in her twenties. Her family don't accept that. ""There's no one in my family with heart failure,"" her brother says simply. Teruaki Masumoto was 22 and studying fishery in Hokkaido at the time of his sister's 1978 abduction. He is 65 now, retired from a job grading tuna at Tokyo's main fish market. He and Megumi Yokota share a birthday - 5 October - though they are nine years apart. Megumi would be 56 now, and his sister Rumiko 66. Rumiko doted on her brother, the youngest of four Masumoto siblings. ""She was very kind to me,"" he says. ""Since our family wasn't so affluent, we lived in one room with a family of six. Rumiko and I slept on the same futon until I was about 12 years old. She loved me so much. When I got scolded by my father, she cried and defended me."" Teruaki has charted four decades of lost time on a precious gift from Rumiko: a watch she gave him when he got into university. In recent years, the war of missing seconds has grown to feel ever more urgent. Rumiko and Teruaki's father, Shoichi, died of lung cancer in 2002. Their mother Nobuko made it to 90 before passing away in 2017. For four decades she waited for her daughter to come home. But in her later years, she acknowledged that death might reach her first. The search for a stolen child, dead or hidden in a pariah state, is a brutal legacy to leave. But it's an issue many abductees' families have been forced to address. With the parents' generation now gone or in their twilight years, should they tell their present, living children to fight on with everything they have? Is it even a choice? There was no formal handover, but Teruaki tends the dark sand-timer now. ""My father, when he was still alive back in around 2000, became unable to come to Tokyo,"" he says. ""At the time he said to me - 'I'm sorry.' And I felt sort of puzzled and uncomfortable, because I was doing this not because of my father but because of my missing sister. ""My mother sometimes told me that she wondered if Rumiko would ever come back to Japan. So I think my mother half doubted that she would see her alive. But they didn't say things like, 'this is your time' or 'I want you to keep doing this rescue mission.' No, they didn't say that to me."" They didn't need to. ""Yes."" Megumi's brother, Takuya Yokota, was still in his thirties when he felt the mantle settling on his shoulders. ""When I went to the United States to see President Bush in 2006, I found my ageing parents had trouble spending a long time on a plane,"" he says. ""And in Japan too, if we went somewhere far from Tokyo, they would also have trouble travelling. At that time, I understood that my parents would not be able to go to far-away places any more."" Only two of the victims' parents remain alive. Sakie, the youngest, will turn 85 in February. Megumi's father Shigeru, softly-spoken but steely, died on 5 June 2020. He went into hospital in April 2018, and fought every day that followed to stay alive a little longer, with his treasured daughter's picture by his bed. In Japan, where everyone knows about ""The Abduction Issue"", it's not possible to protect a child with personal ties for long. Both Teruaki Masumoto and Takuya Yokota are fathers: Teruaki to a young daughter, and Takuya to a son in his early twenties. Takuya believes his son was in infant school when they told him what had happened to Aunt Megumi. ""Probably when he was six or seven years old. I'm sure I had talked to him at the age of nine, the age I was when my sister got abducted."" Teruaki's daughter was younger still. ""My daughter knows about Rumiko,"" he says. ""My wife told her before she entered kindergarten. There's this festival in Japan in summer, in July, when we think a couple separated by the Milky Way meet once a year up in the sky. We write our wish on a short piece of paper and put it onto a tree. On that paper, my four-year-old daughter wrote, 'I want to see my aunt.' Not every abductee's family has the luxury of insulating children from the burdens of loss and duty, as Teruaki knows. Since 2004 he has campaigned alongside Koichiro Iizuka. The person stolen from Koichiro was his mother. He was 16 months old at the time. Aged 22, Yaeko Taguchi was a nightclub hostess, and single mother to a baby son and three-year-old daughter. When she disappeared with no explanation in June 1978, her children were left abandoned in their Tokyo nursery. Yaeko's baby son was adopted by her brother, Shigeo Iizuka, and raised as his fourth child. Her daughter was cared for by an aunt. Now 43, Koichiro Iizuka remembers nothing about his birth mother. He's notably polite, calling her ""Yaeko-san"" - ""Ms Yaeko"". ""Mum"" and ""Dad"" are Shigeo and his wife Eiko. And until he reached 22, he had no idea his life was more complex than that. ""When I got a job I had the chance to go abroad for training, and I needed to apply for my passport,"" he explains. ""In order to do that I needed to get a family registration paper. And I took it and looked at it, and found that I was adopted by Mr Iizuka. ""First I couldn't imagine why they had kept this secret for so long; I just couldn't imagine, so I needed some time. It took me a week before I went to my parents. ""When I came home, my mother was out of the house but my father was there. So I told him I had looked at the family registration paper and had found out I was adopted. And I asked him - what happened to me?"" Shigeo took him to lunch and told him the truth. ""He told me, as the paper says you're not my biological child. And I have this youngest sister - whose name is Yaeko - and you are a child of hers."" He held back the darkest part until they were home. ""He told me, there is this person Kim Hyun-hui - the North Korean agent, the bomber of the KAL plane in 1987, and she said she was taught by a Japanese teacher. Kim Hyun-hui was shown several pictures twice [by Japanese police] - and she picked Yaeko-san, saying 'this is my teacher.' From that it was clear that she was one of the abductees in North Korea."" The claim was corroborated by Fukie Chimura, one of the abductees returned to Japan, who said she had shared accommodation with Yaeko. In 2004, two years after the five Japanese made it home from North Korea, Koichiro decided to reveal publicly that he was Yaeko Taguchi's son. He was frustrated by the diplomatic impasse on rescuing the others, keen to do all he could to push the issue. ""This person Yaeko-san wasn't real in my memory - she was like someone in a story,"" he says. ""But this woman in the story gave birth to me, so it was shocking to me that I wouldn't be able to see her. ""My father was given a lecture by a foreign ministry official who said there was no proof to support North Korea saying that she was dead. And my father said he just couldn't believe it - he couldn't take the word of North Korea. ""So we thought - I thought - that I wanted to rescue her, help her."" The plane bomber Kim Hyun-hui had been sentenced to death for her crimes, but was ultimately pardoned by South Korea's then president. In 2009, Koichiro and Shigeo Iizuka travelled to Busan, South Korea to meet her, and learn what they could about her time with Yaeko. ""She said, I feel that Yaeko-san is my sister, and I'm very happy to see my sister's son today,"" recalls Koichiro. ""And I hope someday that the four of us can meet at one time."" Officially, North Korea says Yaeko Taguchi died in a car accident in 1986. But Ms Kim disputes that, saying she spoke to a driver who reported seeing her alive the following year. She would now be 65. Koichiro knows he may ultimately be left searching for his mother, the missing stranger, without the backing of those who knew and loved her. ""Of course I feel time is very important. Especially because Yaeko-san has two siblings who have already died. My father is ageing. I want him to see her again very much. Not only my family, but the other abductees' families… I can easily see they're getting older. People who used to be very active - some of them are gone already, and some are very frail."" North Korea has never admitted it was behind the bombing of Korean Air Flight 858, and maintains there is no such person as Kim Hyun-hui. Yaeko Taguchi's family fear that after tutoring Kim and spending her days surrounded by spies, Yaeko may simply know too much ever to be released. All those caught up in this struggle share a common dread: That passing time will make a mockery of it, as the abductees age beyond reasonable hope of survival. Would they have died of old age in North Korea by now? At time of writing - no. But it will fall to the current generation to address the question. ""Time passes equally for both sides,"" says Takuya Yokota. ""Yes, they are getting older too. And I think spending a year or 20 years in Japan or in England or the US has a different meaning to spending the same amount of time in North Korea. In North Korea, it's very hard not only to stay alive until tomorrow, but to keep alive today."" For Teruaki Masumoto, not even their loved ones' deaths would justify giving up. ""If their deaths were proven then we would want their bones to be back with us. That's the Japanese mentality. We would also continue to hold the Japanese government accountable for not being able to rescue the abductees. Even though there are 17 abductees 'approved' by the government, I think many, many more are in North Korea - more than a hundred. If there are other abductees, we should be able to establish what happened to them. So we're not going to stop working any time soon."" In 2014, North Korea agreed to open an investigation into the fates of the eight acknowledged abductees it has not returned, despite having declared them dead. It was dragged out until 2016, then cancelled in a spat over nuclear test sanctions. Megumi's father dreamed of walking her through the lights and liveliness of Roppongi, Tokyo's entertainment district. But in her mother's prayers, they go to a field together where they can lie down looking at the sky, without anybody around, and just quietly and peacefully spend time. Sakie writes open letters to her daughter, in the hope the words may somehow reach her. Part of one,published by JAPAN forwardlast year before the loss of her husband, reads as follows: ""Dear Megumi, ""I know it might seem a bit strange that I am just casually reaching out to you. Are you well? ""[...] I have been trying my best to live a full life, but I feel my body weakening, and every day gets a little bit harder. When I see your father at the hospital desperately doing his rehabilitation exercises, I am overcome with an urgency to find a way for him to see you. ""This is the reality of ageing. It's not just your father and me. We may be dealing with ageing, sickness, and weariness, but the families of all the victims in North Korea still go on yearning to see their loved ones back on native soil and hold them in their arms. ""We don't have much time left. We've fought long and hard with our hearts and souls, but we cannot hold out much longer. ""[...]I want to celebrate my next birthday with you. Only the nation of Japan - the government - can make that happen. But sometimes I'm overcome with a sense of unease and am concerned that our efforts are futile when I see what's going on in our government. I doubt they have the will to solve this problem and figure out a way to bring the victims home. ""[…] Somehow, I have managed to survive this raging storm. I am thankful that you also have survived, supported by a greater power. We are not alone. And so I pray again today as I think of all of you. ""It will take more effort than ever before to bring all the victims back to Japan. Of course, Japan must stand up for itself, but we also need courage, love, and righteousness from around the world. (Those of you who read my letter, please take a moment to remember in your heart the abductees still trapped in North Korea. Please speak out for them.) ""Dearest Megumi, I will keep up the fight to bring you back home to me, your father, and your brothers Takuya and Tatsuya. My resolve remains unshaken, even at age 84. So please take care of yourself and never lose hope.""

Snatched from a beach to train North Korea's spiesHow North Korea kidnapped unsuspecting Japanese citizens and refused to give them back.,"15 November 1977, Niigata, Japan: It was after sunset on a crisp November evening when Megumi Yokota left her last badminton practice. Sharp winds chilled the fishing port of Niigata, and the grey sea rumbled at its brink. The lights of home were seven minutes' walk away. Megumi, 13, with her book-bag and badminton racquet, said goodbye to two friends 800ft from her parents' front door. But she never reached it. As six o'clock became seven and the quiet street failed to produce her daughter, Sakie Yokota began to panic. She ran to the gym at Yorii Middle School, expecting to meet her en route. ""They left a long time ago,"" the school's night watchman said. Police, tracker dogs, torches splitting the darkness. They scoured a nearby pine forest calling Megumi's name. Sakie sped down the road to the beach, frantically scanning every car parked nearby. It made sense to search the shoreline. But perhaps something stronger and more ineffable drove the mother to the water's edge that night. Out on the Sea of Japan, out of Sakie's sight, a boat manned by North Korean agents was speeding towards the Korean Peninsula with a terrified schoolgirl locked in the hold. They left no evidence, and not a single witness. The crime was so brazen and bizarre that few would even imagine it, let alone solve it. But over the years, it became clear that Megumi was not the only victim. The Japanese government says that from 1977 until at least 1983, North Korean agents abducted 17 Japanese citizens. Some analysts believe the true figure could be more than 100. In the year that followed Megumi's disappearance, police poured 3,000 staff days into the search. A kidnapping unit occupied the Yokota house. Patrol boats cross-hatched the sea. The investigation drew an agonising blank. Megumi's father Shigeru paced the sand every morning. At night, he cried in the bath. Sakie cried when she was alone, hoping Megumi's brothers, twins aged nine, wouldn't hear her. A dark sand-timer had turned over for the Yokota family. For years, they tried simply to endure the void. But missing Megumi was alive. A North Korean spy who defected to the South in 1993 told Seoul in detail about an abducted Japanese woman who matched her description. ""I remember her very clearly,"" said Ahn Myong-jin. ""I was young, and she was beautiful."" He said one of her kidnappers - a senior spy-master - had told him her story in 1988: The abduction was an unplanned blunder, he said. No-one had meant to take a kid. Two agents finishing up a spy mission to Niigata had been waiting on the beach for a pick-up boat, when they realised they'd been spotted from the road. Fearing discovery, they grabbed the figure. Megumi was tall for her age, and in the darkness they couldn't tell she was a child. She arrived in North Korea after 40 hours locked in a pitch-black storage room, Ahn said, her fingernails torn and bloody from trying to claw her way out. The agents who took her were chastised for their poor judgement. She was too young; what use did they have for a little girl? Megumi cried for her mother and refused to eat, unnerving her state minders. To soothe her, they promised that if she worked hard and learned fluent Korean, she would be allowed to go home. It was a lie to fool a devastated child. Her captors had no such intention. Instead, North Korea would force Megumi to work as a spy trainer, teaching Japanese language and behaviour at an elite school for espionage. For this to happen once would be extraordinary. But the bungled abduction set a kind of precedent in North Korea. The country's future leader Kim Jong-il, then head of its intelligence services, wanted to expand his spy programme. Kidnapped foreigners weren't just useful as teachers. They could be spies themselves, or Pyongyang could steal their identities for false passports. They could marry other foreigners (something forbidden to North Koreans), and their children, too, could serve the regime. The beaches of Japan were full of ordinary people, ripe for abduction, who would stand no chance against highly-trained agents. ""People think I don't remember much about my sister... but I do clearly remember her, even though I was third or fourth grade in elementary school."" When Megumi's younger brother, Takuya Yokota, and his twin Tetsuya were nine, the police hunting for Megumi showed them martial arts videos, urging them - ""don't get beaten - be strong."" Every day for 43 years, he has tried to heed that advice. Now 52, he sits in a business suit holding a copy of a postcard his sister sent before her kidnapping. At the end she wrote, ""I'll be home soon!! Please wait."" ""She was very chatty, very active and bright,"" he says. ""She was like a sunflower for our family. ""Without her at the dining table, conversation was limited. The atmosphere got very dark. ""I was very worried, but somehow I went to bed and got up in the morning - every day, to find that she was missing. I got up, and I still couldn't find her."" For the first two decades after Megumi disappeared, the Yokotas had nothing but a cold case and their own desperate need to understand what had happened. They tried to guess how she might be ageing. She had been tall at 13; was she still? Had she kept her childhood dimples? A shadow hung over every question. They had no clue if she had survived that last November night. In coastal towns in the late 1970s, rumours hovered like sea gulls. Locals spoke of strange radio signals and lights from unknown ships, or Korean cigarette packets discarded by the shore. In August 1978, a couple on a beach date in Toyama prefecture were gagged, hooded and handcuffed by four men who spoke oddly formal, accented Japanese. They were hastily abandoned when a dog-walker came by and the dog barked, spooking their attackers. Others were less lucky. On 7 January 1980, Japan's Sankei Shimbun newspaper ran a front-page story: ""Three couples on dates evaporate mysteriously along the coasts of Fukui, Niigata, and Kagoshima - is a foreign intelligence agency involved?"" But it took a convicted terrorist to finally firm up the link to North Korea. Kim Hyun-hui had killed 115 people by helping to smuggle a bomb onto a South Korean passenger plane in 1987. Staring down a death sentence in Seoul, she testified that she was a North Korean agent acting on state orders. She said she had learned Japanese language and behaviour so she could work undercover. Her teacher, she said, was an abducted Japanese woman whom she lived with for almost two years. The testimony was compelling. But Japan's government wouldn't officially acknowledge that North Korea was stealing people. The two countries had a hostile history and no diplomatic relations. It was easier to ignore the evidence. When Japanese negotiators tried to raise the issue privately, the North angrily denied any abductees existed and terminated talks. It was 1997 - 20 years after Megumi went missing - when Pyongyang finally agreed to investigate. 21 January 1997 ""We have information that your daughter is alive in North Korea."" Shigeru was stunned. A Japanese official named Tatsukichi Hyomoto, the personal secretary to an MP, had contacted the Yokotas out of the blue. He had been probing abductions by Pyongyang for a decade, and wanted to meet them as soon as possible. Along with deep shock, a mad hope sprang back into the family's hearts. The government believed Megumi was alive. So the question at once became: How do we get her back? The Yokotas went public with their kidnap story. They were terrified North Korea would kill Megumi to cover up what had happened, but her father argued the case would be treated as hearsay unless her name was revealed. They had to spread the news across Japan, and beg the country for help. The family appeared on primetime TV. Questions were raised in parliament. In May, the government publicly confirmed that Megumi was not an isolated case: There were more like the Yokotas, aching for stolen daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and mothers. Seven of these families formed a support group to demand the rescue of their loved ones: the Association of Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea. They talked at length, pooling what little they knew. The abductions appeared opportunistic, but patterns soon emerged. Most victims were young lovers in their twenties. Beaches across Japan had been recast as crime scenes. On 12 August 1978, nine months after Megumi disappeared, 24-year-old office clerk Rumiko Masumoto went to watch the sunset with her boyfriend, Shuichi Ishikawa, 23, at a beach in Kagoshima Prefecture. Just a day earlier, she had shyly told her family about their relationship over dinner. Their car was found locked at the scene, with Rumiko's wallet and sunglasses in the passenger seat. Her camera was there too - filled with pictures the couple took of each other the day they disappeared. Police picked up one of Shuichi's sandals not far from the water's edge. Every kidnapping was a private tragedy. A loved one who fell out of the world without notice. Some of those left bereft were driven to the edge of madness by their loss. The press and the public weren't always sympathetic. News reports referred to the abductions as ""alleged"". Several Japanese politicians believed the claims were South Korean disinformation spread to discredit the North. But as the families drew up petitions, filled the airwaves, and lobbied the government, the truth was gathering weight like a rolling snowball. Five years later, in North Korea, it would stop at the feet of Kim Jong-il himself. 17 September 2002 ""As the host, I regret that we had to make the prime minister of Japan come to Pyongyang so early in the morning,"" said North Korea's leader. But his companion's anger had nothing to do with the time. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi had flown in to discuss normalising Japan's relations with North Korea, hoping the step would boost his flagging opinion rating. Instead, he had walked into a diplomatic ambush. After a brutal 1990s famine believed to have killed more than two million North Koreans, Kim Jong-il wanted food aid and investment, and an apology for Japan's 35-year colonisation of Korea. Japan wanted - and had refused to proceed without - details of every citizen abducted by Pyongyang's spies. Half an hour before the historic meeting, the list of names appeared: North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens. But just five were said to be alive. The causes of death given for the other eight included drowning, choking on the fumes from a broken coal heater, a heart attack in a woman of 27, and two car accidents in a country where private citizens rarely own cars. Pyongyang claimed it could not provide their remains, as floods had washed away almost all their graves. Koizumi was aghast. ""I was utterly distressed by the information that was provided,"" he told Kim Jong-il, ""and as the prime minister, who is ultimately responsible for the interests and security of the Japanese people, I must strongly protest. I cannot bear to imagine how the remaining family members will take the news."" Kim listened in silence, taking notes on a memo pad, then enquired: ""Shall we take a break now?"" Debating their predicament in an anteroom, deputy Cabinet spokesman Shinzo Abe - who would become Japan's longest-serving prime minister - urged Koizumi not to sign the declaration committing to normalisation talks unless Pyongyang formally apologised for the kidnappings. When the delegates reconvened, Kim picked up a memo and read: ""We have thoroughly investigated this matter, including by examining our government's role in it. Decades of adversarial relations between our two countries provided the background of this incident. It was, nevertheless, an appalling incident. ""It is my understanding that this incident was initiated by special mission organizations in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by blindly motivated patriotism and misguided heroism. ""[…] As soon as their scheme and deeds were brought to my attention, those who were responsible were punished. This kind of thing will never be repeated."" The dictator of Pyongyang said the abductions were designed to provide its spies with native-Japanese teachers, and false identities for missions in South Korea. Some victims were snatched from beaches, yes - and others lured from studies or travels in Europe. He spoke of Megumi, the youngest named abductee by many years, saying her kidnappers had been tried and found guilty in 1998. One was executed, and the other died during a 15-year sentence, he said. ""I would like to take this opportunity to apologise straightforwardly for the regrettable conduct of those people. I will not allow that to happen again."" Koizumi signed the Pyongyang Declaration. Five alive, eight declared dead. Back in Japan, at a Tokyo guesthouse owned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the abductees' families were waiting anxiously for news. Megumi's parents sat down with the Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister, Shigeo Uetake. He took a breath. ""I regret to inform you..."" North Korea says Megumi Yokota hanged herself in a pine forest on 13 April 1994, on the grounds of a Pyongyang mental hospital where she was being treated for depression. This is her second death date. The North initially claimed she had died on 13 March 1993, before declaring that an error. As evidence, Pyongyang produced what it said was a hospital ""death registry"". It was a form with the words ""Registry of Patient Entering and Leaving the Hospital,"" on the back of it. But ""Entering and Leaving the Hospital,"" had been crossed out several times and the word ""Death,"" written instead. Japan told North Korea it found the document highly suspect. Another kidnapped Japanese woman, Fukie Chimura, later said that Megumi had moved in next-door to her and her husband in North Korea in June 1994, two months after Megumi's supposed death, and lived there for several months. The Yokota family don't believe Megumi killed herself. Still, Sakie finds the details of Pyongyang's story chilling. ""In Niigata, we had pine forests,"" she told the Washington Post in 2002. ""I'm sure she missed them. I'm sure she was very lonely. For a minute, I thought maybe she longed so much for us and she couldn't come back that, in an instant, she [took her own life.] ""I cried. But in the next minute, I said no, that could not have happened. I do not want it to have happened. I don't want her to have gone through that."" Two years after declaring Megumi dead, Pyongyang handed over what it said were her ashes. They arrived on the 27th anniversary of her kidnapping. Her parents had kept their daughter's umbilical cord when she was born - a Japanese tradition - and DNA tests were performed. The samples didn't match. The scientist who tested the ashes would later say they could have been contaminated, making the result inconclusive. But North Korea had form for providing dubious remains. It had already sent bones it claimed were those of abductee Kaoru Matsuki, a man it said had died aged 42. They included a jawbone fragment which a dental expert said belonged to a woman in her sixties. On 15 October 2002, the five abductees who North Korea said were alive landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. They stepped off the plane to Japanese flags and homemade ""Welcome home"" banners, and sobbed on the runway in the arms of their families. Pyongyang had agreed the five could visit Japan for a week to 10 days. They would never set foot in North Korea again. How do you rescue someone whose captor insists they are dead? Of course, the Yokotas weren't the only family facing this nightmarish question. Rumiko Masumoto, the young office clerk who disappeared with her new boyfriend, was also on the list of deceased. North Korea says Rumiko died of a heart attack in her twenties. Her family don't accept that. ""There's no one in my family with heart failure,"" her brother says simply. Teruaki Masumoto was 22 and studying fishery in Hokkaido at the time of his sister's 1978 abduction. He is 65 now, retired from a job grading tuna at Tokyo's main fish market. He and Megumi Yokota share a birthday - 5 October - though they are nine years apart. Megumi would be 56 now, and his sister Rumiko 66. Rumiko doted on her brother, the youngest of four Masumoto siblings. ""She was very kind to me,"" he says. ""Since our family wasn't so affluent, we lived in one room with a family of six. Rumiko and I slept on the same futon until I was about 12 years old. She loved me so much. When I got scolded by my father, she cried and defended me."" Teruaki has charted four decades of lost time on a precious gift from Rumiko: a watch she gave him when he got into university. In recent years, the war of missing seconds has grown to feel ever more urgent. Rumiko and Teruaki's father, Shoichi, died of lung cancer in 2002. Their mother Nobuko made it to 90 before passing away in 2017. For four decades she waited for her daughter to come home. But in her later years, she acknowledged that death might reach her first. The search for a stolen child, dead or hidden in a pariah state, is a brutal legacy to leave. But it's an issue many abductees' families have been forced to address. With the parents' generation now gone or in their twilight years, should they tell their present, living children to fight on with everything they have? Is it even a choice? There was no formal handover, but Teruaki tends the dark sand-timer now. ""My father, when he was still alive back in around 2000, became unable to come to Tokyo,"" he says. ""At the time he said to me - 'I'm sorry.' And I felt sort of puzzled and uncomfortable, because I was doing this not because of my father but because of my missing sister. ""My mother sometimes told me that she wondered if Rumiko would ever come back to Japan. So I think my mother half doubted that she would see her alive. But they didn't say things like, 'this is your time' or 'I want you to keep doing this rescue mission.' No, they didn't say that to me."" They didn't need to. ""Yes."" Megumi's brother, Takuya Yokota, was still in his thirties when he felt the mantle settling on his shoulders. ""When I went to the United States to see President Bush in 2006, I found my ageing parents had trouble spending a long time on a plane,"" he says. ""And in Japan too, if we went somewhere far from Tokyo, they would also have trouble travelling. At that time, I understood that my parents would not be able to go to far-away places any more."" Only two of the victims' parents remain alive. Sakie, the youngest, will turn 85 in February. Megumi's father Shigeru, softly-spoken but steely, died on 5 June 2020. He went into hospital in April 2018, and fought every day that followed to stay alive a little longer, with his treasured daughter's picture by his bed. In Japan, where everyone knows about ""The Abduction Issue"", it's not possible to protect a child with personal ties for long. Both Teruaki Masumoto and Takuya Yokota are fathers: Teruaki to a young daughter, and Takuya to a son in his early twenties. Takuya believes his son was in infant school when they told him what had happened to Aunt Megumi. ""Probably when he was six or seven years old. I'm sure I had talked to him at the age of nine, the age I was when my sister got abducted."" Teruaki's daughter was younger still. ""My daughter knows about Rumiko,"" he says. ""My wife told her before she entered kindergarten. There's this festival in Japan in summer, in July, when we think a couple separated by the Milky Way meet once a year up in the sky. We write our wish on a short piece of paper and put it onto a tree. On that paper, my four-year-old daughter wrote, 'I want to see my aunt.' Not every abductee's family has the luxury of insulating children from the burdens of loss and duty, as Teruaki knows. Since 2004 he has campaigned alongside Koichiro Iizuka. The person stolen from Koichiro was his mother. He was 16 months old at the time. Aged 22, Yaeko Taguchi was a nightclub hostess, and single mother to a baby son and three-year-old daughter. When she disappeared with no explanation in June 1978, her children were left abandoned in their Tokyo nursery. Yaeko's baby son was adopted by her brother, Shigeo Iizuka, and raised as his fourth child. Her daughter was cared for by an aunt. Now 43, Koichiro Iizuka remembers nothing about his birth mother. He's notably polite, calling her ""Yaeko-san"" - ""Ms Yaeko"". ""Mum"" and ""Dad"" are Shigeo and his wife Eiko. And until he reached 22, he had no idea his life was more complex than that. ""When I got a job I had the chance to go abroad for training, and I needed to apply for my passport,"" he explains. ""In order to do that I needed to get a family registration paper. And I took it and looked at it, and found that I was adopted by Mr Iizuka. ""First I couldn't imagine why they had kept this secret for so long; I just couldn't imagine, so I needed some time. It took me a week before I went to my parents. ""When I came home, my mother was out of the house but my father was there. So I told him I had looked at the family registration paper and had found out I was adopted. And I asked him - what happened to me?"" Shigeo took him to lunch and told him the truth. ""He told me, as the paper says you're not my biological child. And I have this youngest sister - whose name is Yaeko - and you are a child of hers."" He held back the darkest part until they were home. ""He told me, there is this person Kim Hyun-hui - the North Korean agent, the bomber of the KAL plane in 1987, and she said she was taught by a Japanese teacher. Kim Hyun-hui was shown several pictures twice [by Japanese police] - and she picked Yaeko-san, saying 'this is my teacher.' From that it was clear that she was one of the abductees in North Korea."" The claim was corroborated by Fukie Chimura, one of the abductees returned to Japan, who said she had shared accommodation with Yaeko. In 2004, two years after the five Japanese made it home from North Korea, Koichiro decided to reveal publicly that he was Yaeko Taguchi's son. He was frustrated by the diplomatic impasse on rescuing the others, keen to do all he could to push the issue. ""This person Yaeko-san wasn't real in my memory - she was like someone in a story,"" he says. ""But this woman in the story gave birth to me, so it was shocking to me that I wouldn't be able to see her. ""My father was given a lecture by a foreign ministry official who said there was no proof to support North Korea saying that she was dead. And my father said he just couldn't believe it - he couldn't take the word of North Korea. ""So we thought - I thought - that I wanted to rescue her, help her."" The plane bomber Kim Hyun-hui had been sentenced to death for her crimes, but was ultimately pardoned by South Korea's then president. In 2009, Koichiro and Shigeo Iizuka travelled to Busan, South Korea to meet her, and learn what they could about her time with Yaeko. ""She said, I feel that Yaeko-san is my sister, and I'm very happy to see my sister's son today,"" recalls Koichiro. ""And I hope someday that the four of us can meet at one time."" Officially, North Korea says Yaeko Taguchi died in a car accident in 1986. But Ms Kim disputes that, saying she spoke to a driver who reported seeing her alive the following year. She would now be 65. Koichiro knows he may ultimately be left searching for his mother, the missing stranger, without the backing of those who knew and loved her. ""Of course I feel time is very important. Especially because Yaeko-san has two siblings who have already died. My father is ageing. I want him to see her again very much. Not only my family, but the other abductees' families… I can easily see they're getting older. People who used to be very active - some of them are gone already, and some are very frail."" North Korea has never admitted it was behind the bombing of Korean Air Flight 858, and maintains there is no such person as Kim Hyun-hui. Yaeko Taguchi's family fear that after tutoring Kim and spending her days surrounded by spies, Yaeko may simply know too much ever to be released. All those caught up in this struggle share a common dread: That passing time will make a mockery of it, as the abductees age beyond reasonable hope of survival. Would they have died of old age in North Korea by now? At time of writing - no. But it will fall to the current generation to address the question. ""Time passes equally for both sides,"" says Takuya Yokota. ""Yes, they are getting older too. And I think spending a year or 20 years in Japan or in England or the US has a different meaning to spending the same amount of time in North Korea. In North Korea, it's very hard not only to stay alive until tomorrow, but to keep alive today."" For Teruaki Masumoto, not even their loved ones' deaths would justify giving up. ""If their deaths were proven then we would want their bones to be back with us. That's the Japanese mentality. We would also continue to hold the Japanese government accountable for not being able to rescue the abductees. Even though there are 17 abductees 'approved' by the government, I think many, many more are in North Korea - more than a hundred. If there are other abductees, we should be able to establish what happened to them. So we're not going to stop working any time soon."" In 2014, North Korea agreed to open an investigation into the fates of the eight acknowledged abductees it has not returned, despite having declared them dead. It was dragged out until 2016, then cancelled in a spat over nuclear test sanctions. Megumi's father dreamed of walking her through the lights and liveliness of Roppongi, Tokyo's entertainment district. But in her mother's prayers, they go to a field together where they can lie down looking at the sky, without anybody around, and just quietly and peacefully spend time. Sakie writes open letters to her daughter, in the hope the words may somehow reach her. Part of one,published by JAPAN forwardlast year before the loss of her husband, reads as follows: ""Dear Megumi, ""I know it might seem a bit strange that I am just casually reaching out to you. Are you well? ""[...] I have been trying my best to live a full life, but I feel my body weakening, and every day gets a little bit harder. When I see your father at the hospital desperately doing his rehabilitation exercises, I am overcome with an urgency to find a way for him to see you. ""This is the reality of ageing. It's not just your father and me. We may be dealing with ageing, sickness, and weariness, but the families of all the victims in North Korea still go on yearning to see their loved ones back on native soil and hold them in their arms. ""We don't have much time left. We've fought long and hard with our hearts and souls, but we cannot hold out much longer. ""[...]I want to celebrate my next birthday with you. Only the nation of Japan - the government - can make that happen. But sometimes I'm overcome with a sense of unease and am concerned that our efforts are futile when I see what's going on in our government. I doubt they have the will to solve this problem and figure out a way to bring the victims home. ""[…] Somehow, I have managed to survive this raging storm. I am thankful that you also have survived, supported by a greater power. We are not alone. And so I pray again today as I think of all of you. ""It will take more effort than ever before to bring all the victims back to Japan. Of course, Japan must stand up for itself, but we also need courage, love, and righteousness from around the world. (Those of you who read my letter, please take a moment to remember in your heart the abductees still trapped in North Korea. Please speak out for them.) ""Dearest Megumi, I will keep up the fight to bring you back home to me, your father, and your brothers Takuya and Tatsuya. My resolve remains unshaken, even at age 84. So please take care of yourself and never lose hope.""

Breaking|Breaking newsMore than 12 million in UK have had first Covid jabMore than 12 million people in UK have now had their first vaccine dose against coronavirusUK,"More than 12 million people in the UK have now had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, after 550,000 first jabs were given out on Saturday. The government is aiming to offer first doses to 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. At the current rate, about 16 million people would receive a first jab by that date. The UK's daily Covid cases continue to fall, but remain high - with another 15,845 reported on Sunday. Another 373 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the data also showed. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. When will I get the vaccine? Will I get side effects from the vaccine? The update on vaccine progress comes as scientists say early trials suggest Oxford-AstraZeneca's jaboffers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. Meanwhile, workplace Covid testing isbeing offered to more companies in England, for staff who cannot work from home during lockdown, the government says. Businesses with more than 50 employees are now able to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. The speedy rollout of Covid vaccines to all vulnerable people is seen as critical to reducing the pandemic's death toll and relieving pressure on the NHS. Once the first four priority groups, including the over-70s, healthcare workers and people shielding, have received their jabs, the programme will move on to people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions. From spring, the government plans to begin vaccinating the rest of the adult population, another 21 million people. Teachers, transport workers, supermarket workers and the military could be prioritised. The UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, andScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externaleach offer their own advice on testing. On Sunday, Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman said her ambitionwas to have every adult vaccinated for Covid ""in the summer"". The Scottish government had previously set a September target to vaccinate all over-18s. The UK is currently receiving doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and a second vaccine, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. A third vaccine, made by US company Moderna, has been approved but supplies are not expected to be available until spring. The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

"Snatched from a beach to train North Korea's spiesPeer sorry for calling Covid a 'gift' for lawyersLabour's Lord Falconer says he was talking about legal challenges, but regrets his choice of words.UK Politics","15 November 1977, Niigata, Japan: It was after sunset on a crisp November evening when Megumi Yokota left her last badminton practice. Sharp winds chilled the fishing port of Niigata, and the grey sea rumbled at its brink. The lights of home were seven minutes' walk away. Megumi, 13, with her book-bag and badminton racquet, said goodbye to two friends 800ft from her parents' front door. But she never reached it. As six o'clock became seven and the quiet street failed to produce her daughter, Sakie Yokota began to panic. She ran to the gym at Yorii Middle School, expecting to meet her en route. ""They left a long time ago,"" the school's night watchman said. Police, tracker dogs, torches splitting the darkness. They scoured a nearby pine forest calling Megumi's name. Sakie sped down the road to the beach, frantically scanning every car parked nearby. It made sense to search the shoreline. But perhaps something stronger and more ineffable drove the mother to the water's edge that night. Out on the Sea of Japan, out of Sakie's sight, a boat manned by North Korean agents was speeding towards the Korean Peninsula with a terrified schoolgirl locked in the hold. They left no evidence, and not a single witness. The crime was so brazen and bizarre that few would even imagine it, let alone solve it. But over the years, it became clear that Megumi was not the only victim. The Japanese government says that from 1977 until at least 1983, North Korean agents abducted 17 Japanese citizens. Some analysts believe the true figure could be more than 100. In the year that followed Megumi's disappearance, police poured 3,000 staff days into the search. A kidnapping unit occupied the Yokota house. Patrol boats cross-hatched the sea. The investigation drew an agonising blank. Megumi's father Shigeru paced the sand every morning. At night, he cried in the bath. Sakie cried when she was alone, hoping Megumi's brothers, twins aged nine, wouldn't hear her. A dark sand-timer had turned over for the Yokota family. For years, they tried simply to endure the void. But missing Megumi was alive. A North Korean spy who defected to the South in 1993 told Seoul in detail about an abducted Japanese woman who matched her description. ""I remember her very clearly,"" said Ahn Myong-jin. ""I was young, and she was beautiful."" He said one of her kidnappers - a senior spy-master - had told him her story in 1988: The abduction was an unplanned blunder, he said. No-one had meant to take a kid. Two agents finishing up a spy mission to Niigata had been waiting on the beach for a pick-up boat, when they realised they'd been spotted from the road. Fearing discovery, they grabbed the figure. Megumi was tall for her age, and in the darkness they couldn't tell she was a child. She arrived in North Korea after 40 hours locked in a pitch-black storage room, Ahn said, her fingernails torn and bloody from trying to claw her way out. The agents who took her were chastised for their poor judgement. She was too young; what use did they have for a little girl? Megumi cried for her mother and refused to eat, unnerving her state minders. To soothe her, they promised that if she worked hard and learned fluent Korean, she would be allowed to go home. It was a lie to fool a devastated child. Her captors had no such intention. Instead, North Korea would force Megumi to work as a spy trainer, teaching Japanese language and behaviour at an elite school for espionage. For this to happen once would be extraordinary. But the bungled abduction set a kind of precedent in North Korea. The country's future leader Kim Jong-il, then head of its intelligence services, wanted to expand his spy programme. Kidnapped foreigners weren't just useful as teachers. They could be spies themselves, or Pyongyang could steal their identities for false passports. They could marry other foreigners (something forbidden to North Koreans), and their children, too, could serve the regime. The beaches of Japan were full of ordinary people, ripe for abduction, who would stand no chance against highly-trained agents. ""People think I don't remember much about my sister... but I do clearly remember her, even though I was third or fourth grade in elementary school."" When Megumi's younger brother, Takuya Yokota, and his twin Tetsuya were nine, the police hunting for Megumi showed them martial arts videos, urging them - ""don't get beaten - be strong."" Every day for 43 years, he has tried to heed that advice. Now 52, he sits in a business suit holding a copy of a postcard his sister sent before her kidnapping. At the end she wrote, ""I'll be home soon!! Please wait."" ""She was very chatty, very active and bright,"" he says. ""She was like a sunflower for our family. ""Without her at the dining table, conversation was limited. The atmosphere got very dark. ""I was very worried, but somehow I went to bed and got up in the morning - every day, to find that she was missing. I got up, and I still couldn't find her."" For the first two decades after Megumi disappeared, the Yokotas had nothing but a cold case and their own desperate need to understand what had happened. They tried to guess how she might be ageing. She had been tall at 13; was she still? Had she kept her childhood dimples? A shadow hung over every question. They had no clue if she had survived that last November night. In coastal towns in the late 1970s, rumours hovered like sea gulls. Locals spoke of strange radio signals and lights from unknown ships, or Korean cigarette packets discarded by the shore. In August 1978, a couple on a beach date in Toyama prefecture were gagged, hooded and handcuffed by four men who spoke oddly formal, accented Japanese. They were hastily abandoned when a dog-walker came by and the dog barked, spooking their attackers. Others were less lucky. On 7 January 1980, Japan's Sankei Shimbun newspaper ran a front-page story: ""Three couples on dates evaporate mysteriously along the coasts of Fukui, Niigata, and Kagoshima - is a foreign intelligence agency involved?"" But it took a convicted terrorist to finally firm up the link to North Korea. Kim Hyun-hui had killed 115 people by helping to smuggle a bomb onto a South Korean passenger plane in 1987. Staring down a death sentence in Seoul, she testified that she was a North Korean agent acting on state orders. She said she had learned Japanese language and behaviour so she could work undercover. Her teacher, she said, was an abducted Japanese woman whom she lived with for almost two years. The testimony was compelling. But Japan's government wouldn't officially acknowledge that North Korea was stealing people. The two countries had a hostile history and no diplomatic relations. It was easier to ignore the evidence. When Japanese negotiators tried to raise the issue privately, the North angrily denied any abductees existed and terminated talks. It was 1997 - 20 years after Megumi went missing - when Pyongyang finally agreed to investigate. 21 January 1997 ""We have information that your daughter is alive in North Korea."" Shigeru was stunned. A Japanese official named Tatsukichi Hyomoto, the personal secretary to an MP, had contacted the Yokotas out of the blue. He had been probing abductions by Pyongyang for a decade, and wanted to meet them as soon as possible. Along with deep shock, a mad hope sprang back into the family's hearts. The government believed Megumi was alive. So the question at once became: How do we get her back? The Yokotas went public with their kidnap story. They were terrified North Korea would kill Megumi to cover up what had happened, but her father argued the case would be treated as hearsay unless her name was revealed. They had to spread the news across Japan, and beg the country for help. The family appeared on primetime TV. Questions were raised in parliament. In May, the government publicly confirmed that Megumi was not an isolated case: There were more like the Yokotas, aching for stolen daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and mothers. Seven of these families formed a support group to demand the rescue of their loved ones: the Association of Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea. They talked at length, pooling what little they knew. The abductions appeared opportunistic, but patterns soon emerged. Most victims were young lovers in their twenties. Beaches across Japan had been recast as crime scenes. On 12 August 1978, nine months after Megumi disappeared, 24-year-old office clerk Rumiko Masumoto went to watch the sunset with her boyfriend, Shuichi Ishikawa, 23, at a beach in Kagoshima Prefecture. Just a day earlier, she had shyly told her family about their relationship over dinner. Their car was found locked at the scene, with Rumiko's wallet and sunglasses in the passenger seat. Her camera was there too - filled with pictures the couple took of each other the day they disappeared. Police picked up one of Shuichi's sandals not far from the water's edge. Every kidnapping was a private tragedy. A loved one who fell out of the world without notice. Some of those left bereft were driven to the edge of madness by their loss. The press and the public weren't always sympathetic. News reports referred to the abductions as ""alleged"". Several Japanese politicians believed the claims were South Korean disinformation spread to discredit the North. But as the families drew up petitions, filled the airwaves, and lobbied the government, the truth was gathering weight like a rolling snowball. Five years later, in North Korea, it would stop at the feet of Kim Jong-il himself. 17 September 2002 ""As the host, I regret that we had to make the prime minister of Japan come to Pyongyang so early in the morning,"" said North Korea's leader. But his companion's anger had nothing to do with the time. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi had flown in to discuss normalising Japan's relations with North Korea, hoping the step would boost his flagging opinion rating. Instead, he had walked into a diplomatic ambush. After a brutal 1990s famine believed to have killed more than two million North Koreans, Kim Jong-il wanted food aid and investment, and an apology for Japan's 35-year colonisation of Korea. Japan wanted - and had refused to proceed without - details of every citizen abducted by Pyongyang's spies. Half an hour before the historic meeting, the list of names appeared: North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens. But just five were said to be alive. The causes of death given for the other eight included drowning, choking on the fumes from a broken coal heater, a heart attack in a woman of 27, and two car accidents in a country where private citizens rarely own cars. Pyongyang claimed it could not provide their remains, as floods had washed away almost all their graves. Koizumi was aghast. ""I was utterly distressed by the information that was provided,"" he told Kim Jong-il, ""and as the prime minister, who is ultimately responsible for the interests and security of the Japanese people, I must strongly protest. I cannot bear to imagine how the remaining family members will take the news."" Kim listened in silence, taking notes on a memo pad, then enquired: ""Shall we take a break now?"" Debating their predicament in an anteroom, deputy Cabinet spokesman Shinzo Abe - who would become Japan's longest-serving prime minister - urged Koizumi not to sign the declaration committing to normalisation talks unless Pyongyang formally apologised for the kidnappings. When the delegates reconvened, Kim picked up a memo and read: ""We have thoroughly investigated this matter, including by examining our government's role in it. Decades of adversarial relations between our two countries provided the background of this incident. It was, nevertheless, an appalling incident. ""It is my understanding that this incident was initiated by special mission organizations in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by blindly motivated patriotism and misguided heroism. ""[…] As soon as their scheme and deeds were brought to my attention, those who were responsible were punished. This kind of thing will never be repeated."" The dictator of Pyongyang said the abductions were designed to provide its spies with native-Japanese teachers, and false identities for missions in South Korea. Some victims were snatched from beaches, yes - and others lured from studies or travels in Europe. He spoke of Megumi, the youngest named abductee by many years, saying her kidnappers had been tried and found guilty in 1998. One was executed, and the other died during a 15-year sentence, he said. ""I would like to take this opportunity to apologise straightforwardly for the regrettable conduct of those people. I will not allow that to happen again."" Koizumi signed the Pyongyang Declaration. Five alive, eight declared dead. Back in Japan, at a Tokyo guesthouse owned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the abductees' families were waiting anxiously for news. Megumi's parents sat down with the Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister, Shigeo Uetake. He took a breath. ""I regret to inform you..."" North Korea says Megumi Yokota hanged herself in a pine forest on 13 April 1994, on the grounds of a Pyongyang mental hospital where she was being treated for depression. This is her second death date. The North initially claimed she had died on 13 March 1993, before declaring that an error. As evidence, Pyongyang produced what it said was a hospital ""death registry"". It was a form with the words ""Registry of Patient Entering and Leaving the Hospital,"" on the back of it. But ""Entering and Leaving the Hospital,"" had been crossed out several times and the word ""Death,"" written instead. Japan told North Korea it found the document highly suspect. Another kidnapped Japanese woman, Fukie Chimura, later said that Megumi had moved in next-door to her and her husband in North Korea in June 1994, two months after Megumi's supposed death, and lived there for several months. The Yokota family don't believe Megumi killed herself. Still, Sakie finds the details of Pyongyang's story chilling. ""In Niigata, we had pine forests,"" she told the Washington Post in 2002. ""I'm sure she missed them. I'm sure she was very lonely. For a minute, I thought maybe she longed so much for us and she couldn't come back that, in an instant, she [took her own life.] ""I cried. But in the next minute, I said no, that could not have happened. I do not want it to have happened. I don't want her to have gone through that."" Two years after declaring Megumi dead, Pyongyang handed over what it said were her ashes. They arrived on the 27th anniversary of her kidnapping. Her parents had kept their daughter's umbilical cord when she was born - a Japanese tradition - and DNA tests were performed. The samples didn't match. The scientist who tested the ashes would later say they could have been contaminated, making the result inconclusive. But North Korea had form for providing dubious remains. It had already sent bones it claimed were those of abductee Kaoru Matsuki, a man it said had died aged 42. They included a jawbone fragment which a dental expert said belonged to a woman in her sixties. On 15 October 2002, the five abductees who North Korea said were alive landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. They stepped off the plane to Japanese flags and homemade ""Welcome home"" banners, and sobbed on the runway in the arms of their families. Pyongyang had agreed the five could visit Japan for a week to 10 days. They would never set foot in North Korea again. How do you rescue someone whose captor insists they are dead? Of course, the Yokotas weren't the only family facing this nightmarish question. Rumiko Masumoto, the young office clerk who disappeared with her new boyfriend, was also on the list of deceased. North Korea says Rumiko died of a heart attack in her twenties. Her family don't accept that. ""There's no one in my family with heart failure,"" her brother says simply. Teruaki Masumoto was 22 and studying fishery in Hokkaido at the time of his sister's 1978 abduction. He is 65 now, retired from a job grading tuna at Tokyo's main fish market. He and Megumi Yokota share a birthday - 5 October - though they are nine years apart. Megumi would be 56 now, and his sister Rumiko 66. Rumiko doted on her brother, the youngest of four Masumoto siblings. ""She was very kind to me,"" he says. ""Since our family wasn't so affluent, we lived in one room with a family of six. Rumiko and I slept on the same futon until I was about 12 years old. She loved me so much. When I got scolded by my father, she cried and defended me."" Teruaki has charted four decades of lost time on a precious gift from Rumiko: a watch she gave him when he got into university. In recent years, the war of missing seconds has grown to feel ever more urgent. Rumiko and Teruaki's father, Shoichi, died of lung cancer in 2002. Their mother Nobuko made it to 90 before passing away in 2017. For four decades she waited for her daughter to come home. But in her later years, she acknowledged that death might reach her first. The search for a stolen child, dead or hidden in a pariah state, is a brutal legacy to leave. But it's an issue many abductees' families have been forced to address. With the parents' generation now gone or in their twilight years, should they tell their present, living children to fight on with everything they have? Is it even a choice? There was no formal handover, but Teruaki tends the dark sand-timer now. ""My father, when he was still alive back in around 2000, became unable to come to Tokyo,"" he says. ""At the time he said to me - 'I'm sorry.' And I felt sort of puzzled and uncomfortable, because I was doing this not because of my father but because of my missing sister. ""My mother sometimes told me that she wondered if Rumiko would ever come back to Japan. So I think my mother half doubted that she would see her alive. But they didn't say things like, 'this is your time' or 'I want you to keep doing this rescue mission.' No, they didn't say that to me."" They didn't need to. ""Yes."" Megumi's brother, Takuya Yokota, was still in his thirties when he felt the mantle settling on his shoulders. ""When I went to the United States to see President Bush in 2006, I found my ageing parents had trouble spending a long time on a plane,"" he says. ""And in Japan too, if we went somewhere far from Tokyo, they would also have trouble travelling. At that time, I understood that my parents would not be able to go to far-away places any more."" Only two of the victims' parents remain alive. Sakie, the youngest, will turn 85 in February. Megumi's father Shigeru, softly-spoken but steely, died on 5 June 2020. He went into hospital in April 2018, and fought every day that followed to stay alive a little longer, with his treasured daughter's picture by his bed. In Japan, where everyone knows about ""The Abduction Issue"", it's not possible to protect a child with personal ties for long. Both Teruaki Masumoto and Takuya Yokota are fathers: Teruaki to a young daughter, and Takuya to a son in his early twenties. Takuya believes his son was in infant school when they told him what had happened to Aunt Megumi. ""Probably when he was six or seven years old. I'm sure I had talked to him at the age of nine, the age I was when my sister got abducted."" Teruaki's daughter was younger still. ""My daughter knows about Rumiko,"" he says. ""My wife told her before she entered kindergarten. There's this festival in Japan in summer, in July, when we think a couple separated by the Milky Way meet once a year up in the sky. We write our wish on a short piece of paper and put it onto a tree. On that paper, my four-year-old daughter wrote, 'I want to see my aunt.' Not every abductee's family has the luxury of insulating children from the burdens of loss and duty, as Teruaki knows. Since 2004 he has campaigned alongside Koichiro Iizuka. The person stolen from Koichiro was his mother. He was 16 months old at the time. Aged 22, Yaeko Taguchi was a nightclub hostess, and single mother to a baby son and three-year-old daughter. When she disappeared with no explanation in June 1978, her children were left abandoned in their Tokyo nursery. Yaeko's baby son was adopted by her brother, Shigeo Iizuka, and raised as his fourth child. Her daughter was cared for by an aunt. Now 43, Koichiro Iizuka remembers nothing about his birth mother. He's notably polite, calling her ""Yaeko-san"" - ""Ms Yaeko"". ""Mum"" and ""Dad"" are Shigeo and his wife Eiko. And until he reached 22, he had no idea his life was more complex than that. ""When I got a job I had the chance to go abroad for training, and I needed to apply for my passport,"" he explains. ""In order to do that I needed to get a family registration paper. And I took it and looked at it, and found that I was adopted by Mr Iizuka. ""First I couldn't imagine why they had kept this secret for so long; I just couldn't imagine, so I needed some time. It took me a week before I went to my parents. ""When I came home, my mother was out of the house but my father was there. So I told him I had looked at the family registration paper and had found out I was adopted. And I asked him - what happened to me?"" Shigeo took him to lunch and told him the truth. ""He told me, as the paper says you're not my biological child. And I have this youngest sister - whose name is Yaeko - and you are a child of hers."" He held back the darkest part until they were home. ""He told me, there is this person Kim Hyun-hui - the North Korean agent, the bomber of the KAL plane in 1987, and she said she was taught by a Japanese teacher. Kim Hyun-hui was shown several pictures twice [by Japanese police] - and she picked Yaeko-san, saying 'this is my teacher.' From that it was clear that she was one of the abductees in North Korea."" The claim was corroborated by Fukie Chimura, one of the abductees returned to Japan, who said she had shared accommodation with Yaeko. In 2004, two years after the five Japanese made it home from North Korea, Koichiro decided to reveal publicly that he was Yaeko Taguchi's son. He was frustrated by the diplomatic impasse on rescuing the others, keen to do all he could to push the issue. ""This person Yaeko-san wasn't real in my memory - she was like someone in a story,"" he says. ""But this woman in the story gave birth to me, so it was shocking to me that I wouldn't be able to see her. ""My father was given a lecture by a foreign ministry official who said there was no proof to support North Korea saying that she was dead. And my father said he just couldn't believe it - he couldn't take the word of North Korea. ""So we thought - I thought - that I wanted to rescue her, help her."" The plane bomber Kim Hyun-hui had been sentenced to death for her crimes, but was ultimately pardoned by South Korea's then president. In 2009, Koichiro and Shigeo Iizuka travelled to Busan, South Korea to meet her, and learn what they could about her time with Yaeko. ""She said, I feel that Yaeko-san is my sister, and I'm very happy to see my sister's son today,"" recalls Koichiro. ""And I hope someday that the four of us can meet at one time."" Officially, North Korea says Yaeko Taguchi died in a car accident in 1986. But Ms Kim disputes that, saying she spoke to a driver who reported seeing her alive the following year. She would now be 65. Koichiro knows he may ultimately be left searching for his mother, the missing stranger, without the backing of those who knew and loved her. ""Of course I feel time is very important. Especially because Yaeko-san has two siblings who have already died. My father is ageing. I want him to see her again very much. Not only my family, but the other abductees' families… I can easily see they're getting older. People who used to be very active - some of them are gone already, and some are very frail."" North Korea has never admitted it was behind the bombing of Korean Air Flight 858, and maintains there is no such person as Kim Hyun-hui. Yaeko Taguchi's family fear that after tutoring Kim and spending her days surrounded by spies, Yaeko may simply know too much ever to be released. All those caught up in this struggle share a common dread: That passing time will make a mockery of it, as the abductees age beyond reasonable hope of survival. Would they have died of old age in North Korea by now? At time of writing - no. But it will fall to the current generation to address the question. ""Time passes equally for both sides,"" says Takuya Yokota. ""Yes, they are getting older too. And I think spending a year or 20 years in Japan or in England or the US has a different meaning to spending the same amount of time in North Korea. In North Korea, it's very hard not only to stay alive until tomorrow, but to keep alive today."" For Teruaki Masumoto, not even their loved ones' deaths would justify giving up. ""If their deaths were proven then we would want their bones to be back with us. That's the Japanese mentality. We would also continue to hold the Japanese government accountable for not being able to rescue the abductees. Even though there are 17 abductees 'approved' by the government, I think many, many more are in North Korea - more than a hundred. If there are other abductees, we should be able to establish what happened to them. So we're not going to stop working any time soon."" In 2014, North Korea agreed to open an investigation into the fates of the eight acknowledged abductees it has not returned, despite having declared them dead. It was dragged out until 2016, then cancelled in a spat over nuclear test sanctions. Megumi's father dreamed of walking her through the lights and liveliness of Roppongi, Tokyo's entertainment district. But in her mother's prayers, they go to a field together where they can lie down looking at the sky, without anybody around, and just quietly and peacefully spend time. Sakie writes open letters to her daughter, in the hope the words may somehow reach her. Part of one,published by JAPAN forwardlast year before the loss of her husband, reads as follows: ""Dear Megumi, ""I know it might seem a bit strange that I am just casually reaching out to you. Are you well? ""[...] I have been trying my best to live a full life, but I feel my body weakening, and every day gets a little bit harder. When I see your father at the hospital desperately doing his rehabilitation exercises, I am overcome with an urgency to find a way for him to see you. ""This is the reality of ageing. It's not just your father and me. We may be dealing with ageing, sickness, and weariness, but the families of all the victims in North Korea still go on yearning to see their loved ones back on native soil and hold them in their arms. ""We don't have much time left. We've fought long and hard with our hearts and souls, but we cannot hold out much longer. ""[...]I want to celebrate my next birthday with you. Only the nation of Japan - the government - can make that happen. But sometimes I'm overcome with a sense of unease and am concerned that our efforts are futile when I see what's going on in our government. I doubt they have the will to solve this problem and figure out a way to bring the victims home. ""[…] Somehow, I have managed to survive this raging storm. I am thankful that you also have survived, supported by a greater power. We are not alone. And so I pray again today as I think of all of you. ""It will take more effort than ever before to bring all the victims back to Japan. Of course, Japan must stand up for itself, but we also need courage, love, and righteousness from around the world. (Those of you who read my letter, please take a moment to remember in your heart the abductees still trapped in North Korea. Please speak out for them.) ""Dearest Megumi, I will keep up the fight to bring you back home to me, your father, and your brothers Takuya and Tatsuya. My resolve remains unshaken, even at age 84. So please take care of yourself and never lose hope.""

Lastminute.com failed to meet refund deadline,"Many holiday plans were torn up by the coronavirus crisis Online travel agent Lastminute.com failed to keep to a promise to refund people for Covid-hit holidays. In December, it agreed to pay all outstanding package holiday refunds by the end of January. But consumer group Which? said several customers still hadn't received a full refund after the deadline had passed. ""The refund process has been a very complex and difficult,"" Lastminute.com said. Which? has called on the Competition and Markets Authority to uncover how many customers were not refunded in time and take appropriate action. ""Despite being given ample time to return all outstanding refunds to customers - as well as clear instructions regarding its liability for refunding both accommodation and flight costs - Lastminute.com has failed to meet its commitment to the regulator,"" said Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel. ""The CMA must send a clear message that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable."" A CMA spokesperson said: ""CMA action led to Lastminute.com committing to pay out over Â£7m to customers waiting for money back. ""They must now report to us on how they are complying with the commitments they signed up to and the deadlines agreed. Should it become clear that they have breached these undertakings we will consider further action."" Lastminute.com said: ""Throughout this very challenging year, our customers have remained our number one priority, and we continue our commitment to dedicating our resources to helping them with their requests. ""Each customer request is unique, and often requiring a human touch-point and we've been working hard to get the money processed back through the system and into our customers' pockets as quickly as possible."" Lastminute customer Sheryl McLeod had her Barcelona holiday cancelled but hasn't yet had a full refund Sheryl McLeod booked a holiday for two adults and two children to Barcelona for July 2020 through Lastminute.com. The firm told her in June the flights and hotel were cancelled and there were no alternatives, so the trip would be cancelled and refunded. In September she was told by email that her refund was ready and she accepted the option of a cash refund. For months afterwards Lastminute.com claimed it was finalising her refund. Then, on 27 January, she was finally sent Â£932.49 - more than Â£300 short of the Â£1,274.68 she was owed. Claire Barder is another customer who told Which? she didn't receive a full refund for her cancelled holiday before the CMA's deadline. Despite receiving confirmation of a refund for her July holiday to Barcelona, she was only given Â£431.75 - nearly Â£600 short as it did not include the flight portion of the trip. After Which? approached Lastminute.com both customers were told they would receive their outstanding money back. ""We can confirm that the refund has been sent to the customers also for the flight,"" Lastminute.com said. If your travel company cancels a package holiday for any reason, it has to give you a full refund by law within 14 days. Similarly, if you booked a flight (which was departing or arriving in an EU country or the UK or on an EU or UK airline) through a holiday company and the flight was cancelled, you must be reimbursed. But many people have been left waiting months for a pay-out during the pandemic as travel firms face a cashflow crisis. Since the start of the Covid crisis, the CMA has written to more 100 package holiday firms to remind them of their obligations to comply with consumer protection law. Last week it began an investigation of Teletext Holidays following complaints it has failed to refund people for trips that have been cancelled by the Covid-19 pandemic. Some online travel agents have reported difficulties in securing refunds from airlines to pass on to their customers, meaning they have handed only partial refunds for cancelled package holidays. But under the Package Travel and Linked Travel Regulations 2018, if a package holiday is cancelled by the provider, the customer is legally entitled to a full refund - including all travel and travel-related services - within 14 days.

Warning over 'risky' TikTok trading tips,"TikTok creators have been offering ""risky"" trading tips in the wake of the GameStop shares frenzy, a UK regulator has warned. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said people should be wary of users ""promising high-return investments"". Many videos contain financial advice without disclaimers about the risks involved. TikTok said it removed content that ""deceives people to gain an unlawful financial advantage"". This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? The BBC found several popular video-makers on TikTok encouraging people to buy shares in GameStop, BlackBerry and AMC. The share price of these companies saw a boost at the end of January, as people on a Reddit message board encouraged one another to invest. Other videos encouraged people to invest in the crypto-currency Dogecoin. 'Failing' firm soars in value as amateurs buy stock Dogecoin takes off after tip by Elon Musk GameStop: Who is winning the market battle? Millions of videos have been posted using hashtags such as #bigstocktips, #fintok, #stonks, #stocktok and #stockstobuy. Many of the videos fail to warn users that the content should not be taken as financial advice and that making investments carries a risk. Several videos used examples of past market performance as an indication that users would receive a profit in the future. Past market performance can never guarantee future profits. One popular astrologer with more than one million followers suggested that the position of the planets could affect the price of crypto-currency. ""This February is not the cutest for Bitcoinâ¦ Mercury is in retrograde,"" they said. The same account also made forecasts for Tesla, GameStop and the crypto-currency Ethereum. ""Consumers should be wary of adverts and advice online and on social media promising high-return investments, and should always do further research on the product they are considering,"" an FCA spokeswoman told the BBC. ""There are risks with taking unregulated investment advice and we engage with social media platforms to have pages which breach our regulations taken down."" The FCA said it hoped the government would include ""financial harms"" in its forthcoming online safety bill. The crypto-currencytrading platform Paxful,externalanalysed more than 1,200 TikTok videos and found that 14% of them encouraged users to make certain financial decisions without a warning about the risks involved. In total, those videos had clocked up 16,765,837 views and 2,239,684 likes. ""Videos that encourage risky, over-simplified and impulsive financial decisions without appropriate disclaimers can mislead young or inexperienced viewers, damaging their finances as a result,"" it said in a blog post. Since TikTok videos are short, there is little time in which to fully explain the financial risks, said Nick Agwuncha, co-founder of Money Medics, a start-up that provides financial education for millennials. ""TikTok is fast food content. It lacks depth,"" he said. ""You shouldn't be gullible to get-rich-quick schemes. If you're looking at personal finance and investing, you should always try to take a long-term mindset, do your due diligence and research."" Some influencers may be self-motivated to recommend certain stocks they have already invested in, to increase demand and push up the share price, he added. In a statement, TikTok said:"" We are committed to promoting a safe environment on TikTok, and actively work to educate our community about online safety and media literacy."" TikTok said it removed content that depicted or promoted investment schemes with promises of high returns, fixed betting or any other types of scams. Stocks explained: What's going on with GameStop?

Ali's conqueror Spinks dies aged 67,"Leon Spinks stunned Muhammad Ali in 1978 before losing a rematch Former world heavyweight champion Leon Spinks has died aged 67. The American achieved a famous upset win over Muhammad Ali in 1978, in just his eighth professional fight. He had suffered with health issues in his later years and was diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer in 2019. ""His final fight was fought with the same skill, grace and grit that had carried him through so many lifetime challenges,"" said a statement from his management company. Neon Leon's brightest night - Costello & Bunce podcast The former US marine died on Friday evening in Henderson, Nevada, with his wife Brenda Glur Spinks by his side. ""Leon fought his battle with numerous illnesses resiliently, never losing his trademark smile. Showing true Spinks determination, he never threw in the towel,"" the statement added. Born in St Louis, Spinks won gold at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, then rose to greater prominence a little more than 18 months later, given the nod via a split decision to stun Ali and claim the WBC, WBA and lineal heavyweight titles. In one of the biggest upsets in the history of the sport, Spinks defied his 10-1 underdog odds with bookmakers to prevail after 15 rounds, winning 145-140 and 144-141 on two scorecards while a third went 143-142 in favour of Ali. His reign as world champion lasted exactly seven months as a sharper and fitter Ali gained revenge in a rematch in September 1978, becoming the first three-time lineal heavyweight champion after a comfortable points win. Spinks did get another opportunity for heavyweight glory in June 1981, but was stopped inside three rounds by Larry Holmes. Spinks then dropped down to cruiserweight but was defeated by WBA champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi in 1986. He boxed on for another nine years and finished with a record of 26 wins, 17 defeats and three draws. Known for his gap-toothed grin, Spinks' battles in the ring contributed to his ill health in later life. It was found he had shrinkage in the brain in 2012 before his cancer diagnosis was confirmed a few years later. His son Cory, 42, is a former undisputed welterweight champion who also won a world title in the light-middleweight division. Spinks' younger brother Michael, 64, was undisputed light-heavyweight champion for a period in the 1980s, before moving up to heavyweight, where he won the IBF title and avenged Leon's loss to Holmes.

Snow and ice warnings issued for parts of the UK,"A snow plough on the A66 near Bowes in County Durham where the road was closed due to heavy snow Heavy snow and ice has brought disruption to parts of the UK, withcoronavirus vaccination centres and schools shuttingin some areas. Yellow warnings for snow cover much of England and Scotland, as well as parts of Northern Ireland until Wednesday. Police have warned people not to travel, with long delays expected and road closures in some parts. On Monday, 30cm (12in) of snow fell in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, while up to 22cm fell in parts of the east of England. Heavy snowfall and temperatures as low as -15C have been forecast for parts of Scotland, withthe Met Office issuing an amber warning for snow,externalfor areas including Perthshire, Stirlingshire and Fife from 03:00 to 21:00 on Tuesday. Further south temperatures could get as low as -10C, BBC Weather's Billy Payne said, in what he described as the most significant cold spell since the Beast from the East three years ago. ""We'll see further snow showers over the next couple of days and widespread overnight frosts and ice with temperatures for some not rising above freezing,"" he said.

Call for UK-wide Covid rules for 'consistency',"Andrew RT Davies says it is a ""time for consistency"" on areas where all four UK chief medical officers agree A ""common framework"" of UK-wide Covid rules should be adopted, according to the leader of the Tories in the Senedd. Andrew RT Davies wants Welsh ministers to work with the UK government to provide ""consistency"" in areas where all four UK chief medical officers ""undoubtedly agree"". Mr Davies said devolution ""shouldn't mean the Welsh Government should always do things differently"". Wales currently has a lower Covid case rate than England and Northern Ireland. Youngest to return to primary schools from 22 February Welsh independence: How worried should UK ministers be? The youngest pupils will return to Welsh primary schools the weekafter the February half-term, but English schools are not set toreopen until the start of March. Speaking in the Senedd on Tuesday, the first minister said he was ""pleased"" the Welsh Government had ""regular meetings with the UK government every Wednesday - and a number of days in between most weeks now - where we are able to talk about common approaches"". Wales has a lower Covid case rate currently than England and Northern Ireland But Mark Drakeford added: ""We will all [four governments in the UK], nonetheless, be calibrating the decisions that we make in the circumstances that we face. ""The number of people falling ill with coronavirus per 100,000 of the population in Wales is falling at the moment every day. ""It's about half the level that is to be seen across the border in England. I wouldn't want to deny Welsh businesses or outdoor attractions the chance of opening earlier if our circumstances allowed that to happen."" Boris Johnson has said he intends to announce plans toease England's lockdown restrictions from the 22 February. Wales leads the UK on first vaccine dose rate Clarity call on reopening Wales to tourists Writing in the Sunday Times, the Conservatives' Senedd leader said his party ""rejects the 'how can Wales be different just for the sake of it' approach of Welsh Labour."" Mr Davies said: ""That doesn't mean each and every decision made by a Conservative government in Wales would be identical to one made by a Conservative government in Westminster. ""But it's time for consistency in areas where all four chief medical officers of the United Kingdom undoubtedly agree, rather than persisting with the professor in the Bay's policy of poking the prime minister in the eye at every turn. ""Like people and business across Wales, we want to cut the politics and see the adoption of a common framework on restrictions."" In his article, Mr Davies referenceda recent YouGov poll,externalconducted in Wales. The poll from January suggested 63% of respondents believed decisions around lockdown measures should happen at the same time for the whole of the UK even if some areas are at different levels than others at reducing the spread of the virus. A separate question asking how coronavirus lockdown rules are decided suggested that 47% believed the UK government should decide the rules for the whole of the UK, 43% said devolved governments should decide the rules, with 10% saying they didn't know.

Horses 'dying and ill' from lockdown walkers' food,"This video can not be played Chicco was still nursing when she died Owners have said a rise in lockdown walkers feeding their horses has led to some dying and falling ill. A four-month-old foal in Pembrokeshire died last week, after vegetables and sandwiches were repeatedly found in her field. Animal owners claim the rise in walkers who don't understand the Countryside Code is becoming ""a real problem"". The RSPCA said it was ""essential"" the public did not feed horses without permission. Crops 'damaged nationwide' by lockdown walkers Deserted streets are 'massive nature experiment' Ten sheep killed after dog attack at Ystrad Meurig People in Wales are only currently allowed to travel for essential purposes butcan leave their homes to exercise,externalfor unlimited times and periods each day, while maintaining social distancing. Natalie Morris, who lives in Haverfordwest, said her foal's stomach was found to be ""completely blocked"" by vets, when it died on 29 January. She claimed this was because of walkers feeding her horses or leaving food in their field. The 36-year-old said she had been finding potatoes, peelings, pasta and sandwiches in tin foil and cling film ""daily"" in her horses' field in the weeks before Chicco's death. Four-month-old foal Chicco died last week ""It is such a waste,"" she said. ""It is people not caring what they have left and the impact it will have. This behaviour has gone crazy. ""It has become a lot worse this lockdown; normally regular walkers here are clued up and know not to feed them."" Natural resources used at 'unsustainable rate' Ms Morris said Chicco was still nursing from her mother, just starting to eat stud mix and haylage, when she died. Now Ms Morris, who owns two horses, said she's looking for a new field to rent without a public footpath running through it. Meanwhile in Pontypridd, Lindsey Howard said she ""nearly lost"" her horse when she choked on whole potatoes someone had left in their field last April, during lockdown. ""The potato was so large it took two vets to move it to her stomach,"" she said. Two vets treated Lindsey Howard's horse after it choked on a whole potato She said she never experienced the issue of people wrongly feeding her horse in the 20 years she has lived on her farm, until the pandemic. Amanda Jones, who owns nine horses in Mountain Ash, said she had found walkers feeding her horses inappropriate food on two occasions in January. ""There was a woman throwing over brussels sprouts, and I managed to jump over the gate and throw them out. ""This would kill them, because they don't have a gag reflex,"" she said. Amanda Jones says walkers have tried to feed her horses brussels sprouts and cabbage Ms Jones said on another occasion she found a walker feeding her horses cabbage, which would cause them a ""really upset stomach"". ""It is a real problem. We live on top of a mountain and have had a lot more walkers out here during lockdown. ""A lot of it is ignorance I think, people think they're doing a good thing by feeding horses."" Horses 'poisoned by lockdown walkers' Crops 'damaged nationwide' by lockdown walkers avoiding mud RSPCA equine welfare expert Dr Mark Kennedy said food that ""might seem innocent to the general public"" could actually be ""highly dangerous"" to horses. Dr Kennedy added some horses might also be on specialist diets to control health conditions. ""Even foods which are safe for horses can be lethal if they are not prepared properly as they can cause obstructions in the horse's oesophagus (gullet) resulting in them choking to death."" He said horse owners concerned about this coulddownload signs to warn the public,external. The attack on sheep happened near Aberystwyth on New Year's Eve Elsewhere Wyn Evans, who farms near Aberystwyth in Ceredigion, lost seven ewes and found a further five sheep injured after an attack by two dogs on New Year's Eve. He said, although he appreciated that ""many people take great joy in walking their dog in Wales' beautiful countryside"" and that exercise was ""particularly important"" during lockdown, people should keep dogs on leads around livestock. National Farmers' Union (NFU) Cymru president John Davies has urged all walkers to follow the Countryside Code, following other reports of dog attacks on sheep. Hundreds of animals saved in 'harrowing' rescue 'Eighty stolen dogs' rescued in police raids ""Keep dogs on a short lead around livestock (but release your dog if chased by cattle), keep to the designated footpaths, leave gates as you found them and pick up your litter."" He added that, while feeding animals ""may appear kind"", it could cause ""serious implications for the health and welfare"" of the animal. ""We must remember that many of those open spaces enjoyed by walkers are working farms and are the permanent homes of livestock and wildlife - therefore, they must be treated with respect."" Since the pandemic, the Countryside Code in the UK has been updated -you can read it here,external. It urges people to respect the local community, including not interfering with animals and following marked paths. The code also asks people to protect the natural environment and plan ahead when going outdoors.

Covid tests expanded to more workplaces in England,"Workplace Covid testing is being offered to more companies in England, for staff who cannot work from home during lockdown, the government says. Businesses with more than 50 employees are now able to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged businesses and employees to take up the offer to ""stop this virus spreading"". ""When you consider that around one in three people have the virus without symptoms and could potentially infect people without even knowing it, it becomes clear why focusing testing on those without symptoms is so essential,"" he said, adding that firms should regularly test staff. The government said the wider criteria would ""hugely"" increase the number of different businesses that are able to sign up, with small and medium sized companies now able to take part. A website has been launched for more businessesto register for the rapid testing programme,external. UK announces 18,262 cases on Saturday What is the UK's R number and why does it matter? It comes as England's national lockdown continues, and the UK's daily reported coronavirus deaths and cases remain high. The latest figures showed another 828 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there were a further 18,262 cases. As of Friday, the UK had given a first jab to nearly 11.5 million people. Meanwhile, GPs in England will be paid an additional Â£10 by the NHS for every housebound patient they vaccinate against Covid-19. As well as offering vaccinations at their practices, GPs have been visiting patients to provide jabs to often vulnerable people who cannot leave their homes. The extra Â£10-per-visit funding is to recognise the extra staff time and complexity of vaccinating housebound people, NHS England said. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the expanded workplace testing regime would complement the rollout of Covid vaccines in the drive to ""reopen the economy and recover our way of life as soon as it is safe to do so"". And the British Chambers of Commerce said it would be ""working hard to ensure that eligible businesses take up this opportunity"". But union officials said employers could not rely on lateral flow testing alone to ensure the safety of staff, citing that Public Health England (PHE) found examples of missed asymptomatic positive cases during the mass testing pilot in Liverpool last year. Dan Shears, GMB union's health, safety and environment director, said: ""These rapid tests are not a magic bullet, and it is vital that employers understand the limitations and take steps to address them. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth welcomed the extra testing but said ""so much more needs to be done to make workplaces Covid-secure including improving ventilation and upgraded PPE (personal protection equipment) standards"". ""This is even more important when the most recent data shows hundreds of outbreaks in workplaces since the start of January,"" he said. Some 112 UK organisations have so far signed up to take part in workplace testing, with employees being tested across 500 sites, according to government figures. This includes private sector organisations in the food, manufacturing, energy and retail sectors, and public sector employers such as job centres, transport networks, and the military. NHS Test and Trace said that, as of 29 January, it had provided Transport for London (TfL) staff with 2,173 tests, identifying 28 positive cases who would have otherwise continued working alongside colleagues. But a CBI survey found that 87% of UK businesses were not currently testing in the workplace, citing reasons such as the availability of NHS testing for individuals, unclear guidance, and the operational, logistical and/or regulatory complexity of offering testing. Of those not carrying out workplace testing, 69% said they were not planning to offer testing in the next three months. The CBI said the government had ""a big role"" to provide guidance and make it simple to introduce workplace testing. According to the Department of Health, tests are currently being provided free to both public and private sector employers until at least 31 March, and the government's support will be kept under review. NHS Test and Trace will support organisations to deliver the asymptomatic testing by supplying the kits, and offering guidance and training for delivery. The additional funding for GPs is retrospective and will apply to any vaccinations that have already been delivered to those who cannot leave their homes. More than 1,000 GP services are part of the NHS vaccination programme, alongside over 250 hospital hubs and nearly 200 services run by high street pharmacies. The UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations. Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externaleach offer their own advice on testing.

Oxford jab offers less S Africa Covid protection,"This video can not be played Prof Sarah Gilbert said the new version of the vaccine ""will be available for the autumn"" Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine offers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant, scientists say early trials suggest. A new study, not yet peer reviewed, involved about 2,000 people who were on average 31 years old. But Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford lead vaccine developer, said vaccines should still protect against severe disease. She said developers were likely to have a modified Oxford jab by the autumn to combat the South Africa variant. South Africa has said it is putting its rollout of the Oxford vaccine on temporary hold, while scientists advise on the best way to proceed following the results of the study. The variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, is already the dominant virus variant in large parts of South Africa. Earlier, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Andrew Marr that a booster in the autumn and annual vaccines could be required to combat variants. More than 100 cases of the South Africa variant have been found in the UK. When will I get the coronavirus vaccine? How worrying are the new variants? South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? A study outlining early trials, firstreported by the Financial Times,external, suggests the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate disease caused by the variant, the University of Oxford said. Prof Gilbert told the Andrew Marr Show current vaccines ""have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses"". ""What that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease."" She added: ""That's really important for healthcare systems, even if we are having mild and asymptomatic infections, to prevent people going into hospital with Covid would have a major effect."" Meanwhile, Mr Zahawi said the UK government hadruled out issuing so-called ""vaccine passports""to enable people who have had the jab against coronavirus to travel abroad. This isn't a complete surprise. The mutation involved - known as E484K - seems to help the virus dodge immunity built up to previous variants and current vaccines. Real world trials of two other vaccines (Janssen and Novavax) showed a dip in performance in South Africa too. This is the same mutation that has also appeared in some cases of the ""Kent variant"" in the UK. We are still waiting for scientists to publish their report in order to find out what ""limited"" means in hard numbers. If people are still getting sick, even if it's mild, then they can spread the virus and that will make it harder to get on top of cases. If the Oxford vaccine can prevent severe disease, and AstraZeneca thinks it will, then it would still be a life-saving vaccine. But it is clear coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change vaccines in the future to keep up. In a separate statement, AstraZeneca said the jab offered ""limited"" protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the variant. A spokesman for the pharmaceutical company said it had not yet been able to properly establish whether the jab would prevent severe disease and hospitalisation caused by the South Africa variant because those involved in the study had predominantly been young, healthy adults. But the company expressed confidence the vaccine would offer protection against serious cases, because it created neutralising antibodies similar to those of other coronavirus vaccines. The study, which assessed a two-dose regimen, is due to be published on Monday. Five reasons to be (cautiously) hopeful on Covid What has the government done about the South Africa strain? Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: ""This study confirms that the pandemic coronavirus will find ways to continue to spread in vaccinated populations, as expected, but, taken with the promising results from other studies in South Africa using a similar viral vector, vaccines may continue to ease the toll on health care systems by preventing severe disease."" In a news conference on Sunday, Prof Shabir Madhi, who has led trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, said the study had been ""largely disappointing"" in terms of the jab's efficacy against the South Africa variant. ""Unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness,"" he said, adding that the data did not say whether or not the vaccine might still protect at least against severe infections. Earlier, Prof Madhi said a vaccine developed by Janssen showed it stopped moderate to severe disease, rather than all disease, and this kept people out of hospital. ""These findings recalibrate thinking about how to approach the pandemic virus and shift the focus from the goal of herd immunity against transmission to the protection of all at-risk individuals in population against severe disease,"" Prof Madhi added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? QUARANTINE:Will I need to self-isolate in a hotel? On Saturday, AstraZenecasaid its vaccine provided good protection against the variant first discovered in Kent, which is now dominant in the UK. Early results suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants. Data on two new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one fromNovavaxand another fromJanssen- appear to offer some protection. And early results from Modernasuggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant. Experts say vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match for new variants in a matter of weeks or months if necessary.

The FCA said it hoped the government would include ""financial harms"" in its forthcoming online safety bill.

Internet shutdown fails to stop Myanmar protests,"This video can not be played Tens of thousands of people take part in the largest protest in Myanmar in more than a decade Myanmar has seen its largest protests in more than a decade, as tens of thousands of people rallied against the military coup and demanded the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. ""We don't want military dictatorship. We want democracy,"" the crowds chanted in the main city, Yangon. Rallies were held in more than a dozen other cities. Internet access has now been restored after a day-long blackout. The army has not yet commented on the growing opposition to Monday's coup. The military seized power after claiming, without evidence, that the November election was fraudulent. The rulers declared a year-long state of emergency and have been hunkered down in the capital, Nay Pyi Daw. Ms Suu Kyi and senior leaders of her National League for Democracy Party (NLD), including President Win Myint, have been put under house arrest. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Citizens protest through art What this means for Aung San Suu Kyi In Yangon, people wore red shirts and held red balloons, the colour of Ms Suu Kyi's party, while cars and buses slowed to sound their horns in support. Many flashed the three-finger salute, a symbol of defiance against authoritarianism in the region. Demonstrators waved flags of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party in Yangon The internet shutdown imposed by the military failed to curb the protesters. ""Respect our vote,"" read one banner, in reference to the NLD's landslide win in November. Sunday's protests in Yangon were the biggest since the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, when thousands of the country's monks rose up against the military regime. Crowds marched towards the Sule Pagoda in the city centre while police vehicles and officers in riot gear were stationed near Yangon University. There were no immediate reports of violence. Anti-coup protesters gathered in Yangon on Sunday despite an internet shutdown ""First, we don't want to go back to military rule. We don't want to live in fear. Secondly, we want Mother Su to be freed from being under detention unjustly,"" a protester told the BBC. ""And third, we want to root out the system where soldiers take civilian administrative positions."" Another demonstrator said that Ms Suu Kyi was ""our true leader"", adding: ""She is our only hope for our democracy, if she died or something happened to her, what is our future? We really need her back."" A third said: ""This protest is not the end. We'll group... [every day] until we're free from the dictatorship."" Smaller protests were also held in Nay Pyi Daw, Mawlamine and Mandalay, the country's second-largest city. In the town of Myawaddy, there were reports of shots being fired, but no immediate reports of any injuries. According to some local media outlets, police had used rubber bullets to break up a rally. By Nyein Chan, BBC Burmese, Yangon People from all different backgrounds, not just students and activists, have joined the protests in Yangon. They shouted anti-military slogans and sang famous revolutionary songs from the 1988 student uprising against the military regime. The atmosphere was charged and protesters were defiant. They are angry but also quietly afraid. They know that the military is capable of using violence to suppress dissent but they feel like they have no choice. When a group of protesters met a row of soldiers they chanted at them: ""You're trained to be professional soldiers, do not kill civilians."" The monitoring group NetBlocks Internet Observatory said connectivity rose to about 50% by 14:00 local time (07:30 GMT) but access to social media, including Facebook and Twitter, remained blocked. The shutdown was criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International said the blackout was ""heinous and reckless"" and warned it could put people at risk of human rights violations.

Cuba opens up its economy to private businesses,"Many private businesses work in Cuba's tourist industry which has been hit hard by the pandemic Cuba has announced it will allow private businesses to operate in most sectors, in what is a major reform to its state-controlled economy. Labour Minister Marta Elena Feito said the list of authorised activities had expanded from 127 to more than 2,000. Only a minority of sectors would be reserved for the state, she said. The communist country's economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and US sanctions introduced by the Trump administration. Last year its economy shrank by 11% - its worst decline in almost three decades - and Cubans have been facing shortages of basic goods. The man who saved Old Havana from decay Cuba country profile Ms Feito said just 124 economic activities would be exempt from private involvement although she did not mention which ones. ""That private work continues to develop, is the objective of this reform,"" Ms Feito was quoted by AFP as saying. She said the move would ""help free the productive forces"" of the private sector. This video can not be played What changed in US-Cuba policy under Trump? Experts on Cuba's tangled and complicated economy say the step essentially opens up almost all economic activity on the island to some form of private enterprise, the BBC's Will Grant in Havana says. This will be a significant shot in the arm for those families and individuals who harbour hopes of moving beyond just the very small businesses into medium-sized ventures, he notes. Apart from hundreds of thousands of small farms, Cuba's non-state sector is composed mainly of small private businesses run by artisans, taxi drivers and tradesmen. Around 600,000 people, around 13% of the workforce, joined the private sector when the opportunity arose. However a large number of private businesses are involved in the island's tourist industry, which has been hard hit by the pandemic and sanctions. Given how slowly reforms tend to move in Cuba, it may still be some time before the change is noticeable in daily economic life, our correspondent says. Cuba placed back on US terrorism sponsor list Some 60 years of hostility between the US and Cuba were eased in 2015 when thenUS President Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro agreed to normalise relations, allowing US citizens to visit the island and empowering local businesses. ButObama's efforts were rolled back by his successor, President Donald Trump, with the support of hawkish Cuban-Americans who saw Mr Obama's historic opening as an appeasement of Castro's communist regime. New US President Joe Biden - who was Barack Obama's vice-president - has previously signalled that he wants to improve US-Cuban relations but observers say it is not clear how high it might be on his priority list.

'Limited' SA variant protection from Oxford jab,"This video can not be played Prof Sarah Gilbert said the new version of the vaccine ""will be available for the autumn"" Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine offers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant, scientists say early trials suggest. A new study, not yet peer reviewed, involved about 2,000 people who were on average 31 years old. But Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford lead vaccine developer, said vaccines should still protect against severe disease. She said developers were likely to have a modified Oxford jab by the autumn to combat the South Africa variant. South Africa has said it is putting its rollout of the Oxford vaccine on temporary hold, while scientists advise on the best way to proceed following the results of the study. The variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, is already the dominant virus variant in large parts of South Africa. Earlier, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Andrew Marr that a booster in the autumn and annual vaccines could be required to combat variants. More than 100 cases of the South Africa variant have been found in the UK. When will I get the coronavirus vaccine? How worrying are the new variants? South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? A study outlining early trials, firstreported by the Financial Times,external, suggests the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate disease caused by the variant, the University of Oxford said. Prof Gilbert told the Andrew Marr Show current vaccines ""have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses"". ""What that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease."" She added: ""That's really important for healthcare systems, even if we are having mild and asymptomatic infections, to prevent people going into hospital with Covid would have a major effect."" Meanwhile, Mr Zahawi said the UK government hadruled out issuing so-called ""vaccine passports""to enable people who have had the jab against coronavirus to travel abroad. This isn't a complete surprise. The mutation involved - known as E484K - seems to help the virus dodge immunity built up to previous variants and current vaccines. Real world trials of two other vaccines (Janssen and Novavax) showed a dip in performance in South Africa too. This is the same mutation that has also appeared in some cases of the ""Kent variant"" in the UK. We are still waiting for scientists to publish their report in order to find out what ""limited"" means in hard numbers. If people are still getting sick, even if it's mild, then they can spread the virus and that will make it harder to get on top of cases. If the Oxford vaccine can prevent severe disease, and AstraZeneca thinks it will, then it would still be a life-saving vaccine. But it is clear coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change vaccines in the future to keep up. In a separate statement, AstraZeneca said the jab offered ""limited"" protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the variant. A spokesman for the pharmaceutical company said it had not yet been able to properly establish whether the jab would prevent severe disease and hospitalisation caused by the South Africa variant because those involved in the study had predominantly been young, healthy adults. But the company expressed confidence the vaccine would offer protection against serious cases, because it created neutralising antibodies similar to those of other coronavirus vaccines. The study, which assessed a two-dose regimen, is due to be published on Monday. Five reasons to be (cautiously) hopeful on Covid What has the government done about the South Africa strain? Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: ""This study confirms that the pandemic coronavirus will find ways to continue to spread in vaccinated populations, as expected, but, taken with the promising results from other studies in South Africa using a similar viral vector, vaccines may continue to ease the toll on health care systems by preventing severe disease."" In a news conference on Sunday, Prof Shabir Madhi, who has led trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, said the study had been ""largely disappointing"" in terms of the jab's efficacy against the South Africa variant. ""Unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness,"" he said, adding that the data did not say whether or not the vaccine might still protect at least against severe infections. Earlier, Prof Madhi said a vaccine developed by Janssen showed it stopped moderate to severe disease, rather than all disease, and this kept people out of hospital. ""These findings recalibrate thinking about how to approach the pandemic virus and shift the focus from the goal of herd immunity against transmission to the protection of all at-risk individuals in population against severe disease,"" Prof Madhi added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? QUARANTINE:Will I need to self-isolate in a hotel? On Saturday, AstraZenecasaid its vaccine provided good protection against the variant first discovered in Kent, which is now dominant in the UK. Early results suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants. Data on two new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one fromNovavaxand another fromJanssen- appear to offer some protection. And early results from Modernasuggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant.

"Horses 'dying and ill' from lockdown walkers' foodThe RSPCA say it is ""essential"" the public do not feed horses without the owners' permissionWales","This video can not be played Chicco was still nursing when she died Owners have said a rise in lockdown walkers feeding their horses has led to some dying and falling ill. A four-month-old foal in Pembrokeshire died last week, after vegetables and sandwiches were repeatedly found in her field. Animal owners claim the rise in walkers who don't understand the Countryside Code is becoming ""a real problem"". The RSPCA said it was ""essential"" the public did not feed horses without permission. Crops 'damaged nationwide' by lockdown walkers Deserted streets are 'massive nature experiment' Ten sheep killed after dog attack at Ystrad Meurig People in Wales are only currently allowed to travel for essential purposes butcan leave their homes to exercise,externalfor unlimited times and periods each day, while maintaining social distancing. Natalie Morris, who lives in Haverfordwest, said her foal's stomach was found to be ""completely blocked"" by vets, when it died on 29 January. She claimed this was because of walkers feeding her horses or leaving food in their field. The 36-year-old said she had been finding potatoes, peelings, pasta and sandwiches in tin foil and cling film ""daily"" in her horses' field in the weeks before Chicco's death. Four-month-old foal Chicco died last week ""It is such a waste,"" she said. ""It is people not caring what they have left and the impact it will have. This behaviour has gone crazy. ""It has become a lot worse this lockdown; normally regular walkers here are clued up and know not to feed them."" Natural resources used at 'unsustainable rate' Ms Morris said Chicco was still nursing from her mother, just starting to eat stud mix and haylage, when she died. Now Ms Morris, who owns two horses, said she's looking for a new field to rent without a public footpath running through it. Meanwhile in Pontypridd, Lindsey Howard said she ""nearly lost"" her horse when she choked on whole potatoes someone had left in their field last April, during lockdown. ""The potato was so large it took two vets to move it to her stomach,"" she said. Two vets treated Lindsey Howard's horse after it choked on a whole potato She said she never experienced the issue of people wrongly feeding her horse in the 20 years she has lived on her farm, until the pandemic. Amanda Jones, who owns nine horses in Mountain Ash, said she had found walkers feeding her horses inappropriate food on two occasions in January. ""There was a woman throwing over brussels sprouts, and I managed to jump over the gate and throw them out. ""This would kill them, because they don't have a gag reflex,"" she said. Amanda Jones says walkers have tried to feed her horses brussels sprouts and cabbage Ms Jones said on another occasion she found a walker feeding her horses cabbage, which would cause them a ""really upset stomach"". ""It is a real problem. We live on top of a mountain and have had a lot more walkers out here during lockdown. ""A lot of it is ignorance I think, people think they're doing a good thing by feeding horses."" Horses 'poisoned by lockdown walkers' Crops 'damaged nationwide' by lockdown walkers avoiding mud RSPCA equine welfare expert Dr Mark Kennedy said food that ""might seem innocent to the general public"" could actually be ""highly dangerous"" to horses. Dr Kennedy added some horses might also be on specialist diets to control health conditions. ""Even foods which are safe for horses can be lethal if they are not prepared properly as they can cause obstructions in the horse's oesophagus (gullet) resulting in them choking to death."" He said horse owners concerned about this coulddownload signs to warn the public,external. The attack on sheep happened near Aberystwyth on New Year's Eve Elsewhere Wyn Evans, who farms near Aberystwyth in Ceredigion, lost seven ewes and found a further five sheep injured after an attack by two dogs on New Year's Eve. He said, although he appreciated that ""many people take great joy in walking their dog in Wales' beautiful countryside"" and that exercise was ""particularly important"" during lockdown, people should keep dogs on leads around livestock. National Farmers' Union (NFU) Cymru president John Davies has urged all walkers to follow the Countryside Code, following other reports of dog attacks on sheep. Hundreds of animals saved in 'harrowing' rescue 'Eighty stolen dogs' rescued in police raids ""Keep dogs on a short lead around livestock (but release your dog if chased by cattle), keep to the designated footpaths, leave gates as you found them and pick up your litter."" He added that, while feeding animals ""may appear kind"", it could cause ""serious implications for the health and welfare"" of the animal. ""We must remember that many of those open spaces enjoyed by walkers are working farms and are the permanent homes of livestock and wildlife - therefore, they must be treated with respect."" Since the pandemic, the Countryside Code in the UK has been updated -you can read it here,external. It urges people to respect the local community, including not interfering with animals and following marked paths.

Crowd gathers for second day of Myanmar protests,"This video can not be played Tens of thousands of people take part in the largest protest in Myanmar in more than a decade Myanmar has seen its largest protests in more than a decade, as tens of thousands of people rallied against the military coup and demanded the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. ""We don't want military dictatorship. We want democracy,"" the crowds chanted in the main city, Yangon. Rallies were held in more than a dozen other cities. Internet access has now been restored after a day-long blackout. The army has not yet commented on the growing opposition to Monday's coup. The military seized power after claiming, without evidence, that the November election was fraudulent. The rulers declared a year-long state of emergency and have been hunkered down in the capital, Nay Pyi Daw. Ms Suu Kyi and senior leaders of her National League for Democracy Party (NLD), including President Win Myint, have been put under house arrest. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Citizens protest through art What this means for Aung San Suu Kyi In Yangon, people wore red shirts and held red balloons, the colour of Ms Suu Kyi's party, while cars and buses slowed to sound their horns in support. Many flashed the three-finger salute, a symbol of defiance against authoritarianism in the region. Demonstrators waved flags of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party in Yangon The internet shutdown imposed by the military failed to curb the protesters. ""Respect our vote,"" read one banner, in reference to the NLD's landslide win in November. Sunday's protests in Yangon were the biggest since the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, when thousands of the country's monks rose up against the military regime. Crowds marched towards the Sule Pagoda in the city centre while police vehicles and officers in riot gear were stationed near Yangon University. There were no immediate reports of violence. Anti-coup protesters gathered in Yangon on Sunday despite an internet shutdown ""First, we don't want to go back to military rule. We don't want to live in fear. Secondly, we want Mother Su to be freed from being under detention unjustly,"" a protester told the BBC. ""And third, we want to root out the system where soldiers take civilian administrative positions."" Another demonstrator said that Ms Suu Kyi was ""our true leader"", adding: ""She is our only hope for our democracy, if she died or something happened to her, what is our future? We really need her back."" A third said: ""This protest is not the end. We'll group... [every day] until we're free from the dictatorship."" Smaller protests were also held in Nay Pyi Daw, Mawlamine and Mandalay, the country's second-largest city. In the town of Myawaddy, there were reports of shots being fired, but no immediate reports of any injuries. According to some local media outlets, police had used rubber bullets to break up a rally. By Nyein Chan, BBC Burmese, Yangon People from all different backgrounds, not just students and activists, have joined the protests in Yangon. They shouted anti-military slogans and sang famous revolutionary songs from the 1988 student uprising against the military regime. The atmosphere was charged and protesters were defiant. They are angry but also quietly afraid. They know that the military is capable of using violence to suppress dissent but they feel like they have no choice. When a group of protesters met a row of soldiers they chanted at them: ""You're trained to be professional soldiers, do not kill civilians."" The monitoring group NetBlocks Internet Observatory said connectivity rose to about 50% by 14:00 local time (07:30 GMT) but access to social media, including Facebook and Twitter, remained blocked. The shutdown was criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International said the blackout was ""heinous and reckless"" and warned it could put people at risk of human rights violations. Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds Where else have we seen the three-finger salute? How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' The United Nations special rapporteur on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, called on the agency's Human Rights Council to convene a special session on the ""unfolding crisis"", saying: ""[The] junta must stand down now."" The coup took place as a new session of parliament was set to open. Many Burmese watched events unfold in real time on Facebook, which is the country's primary source of information and news.

It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, either directly or indirectly,  leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. Buta deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslimssent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh. It triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and her previous supporters in the international community after she refused to condemn the crackdown or describe it as ethnic cleansing.

Covid testing expanded to more England workplaces,"Workplace Covid testing is being offered to more companies in England, for staff who cannot work from home during lockdown, the government says. Businesses with more than 50 employees are now able to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged businesses and employees to take up the offer to ""stop this virus spreading"". ""When you consider that around one in three people have the virus without symptoms and could potentially infect people without even knowing it, it becomes clear why focusing testing on those without symptoms is so essential,"" he said, adding that firms should regularly test staff. The government said the wider criteria would ""hugely"" increase the number of different businesses that are able to sign up, with small and medium sized companies now able to take part. A website has been launched for more businessesto register for the rapid testing programme,external. UK announces 18,262 cases on Saturday What is the UK's R number and why does it matter? It comes as England's national lockdown continues, and the UK's daily reported coronavirus deaths and cases remain high. The latest figures showed another 828 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there were a further 18,262 cases. As of Friday, the UK had given a first jab to nearly 11.5 million people. Meanwhile, GPs in England will be paid an additional Â£10 by the NHS for every housebound patient they vaccinate against Covid-19. As well as offering vaccinations at their practices, GPs have been visiting patients to provide jabs to often vulnerable people who cannot leave their homes. The extra Â£10-per-visit funding is to recognise the extra staff time and complexity of vaccinating housebound people, NHS England said. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the expanded workplace testing regime would complement the rollout of Covid vaccines in the drive to ""reopen the economy and recover our way of life as soon as it is safe to do so"". And the British Chambers of Commerce said it would be ""working hard to ensure that eligible businesses take up this opportunity"". But union officials said employers could not rely on lateral flow testing alone to ensure the safety of staff, citing that Public Health England (PHE) found examples of missed asymptomatic positive cases during the mass testing pilot in Liverpool last year. Dan Shears, GMB union's health, safety and environment director, said: ""These rapid tests are not a magic bullet, and it is vital that employers understand the limitations and take steps to address them. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth welcomed the extra testing but said ""so much more needs to be done to make workplaces Covid-secure including improving ventilation and upgraded PPE (personal protection equipment) standards"". ""This is even more important when the most recent data shows hundreds of outbreaks in workplaces since the start of January,"" he said. Some 112 UK organisations have so far signed up to take part in workplace testing, with employees being tested across 500 sites, according to government figures. This includes private sector organisations in the food, manufacturing, energy and retail sectors, and public sector employers such as job centres, transport networks, and the military. NHS Test and Trace said that, as of 29 January, it had provided Transport for London (TfL) staff with 2,173 tests, identifying 28 positive cases who would have otherwise continued working alongside colleagues. But a CBI survey found that 87% of UK businesses were not currently testing in the workplace, citing reasons such as the availability of NHS testing for individuals, unclear guidance, and the operational, logistical and/or regulatory complexity of offering testing. Of those not carrying out workplace testing, 69% said they were not planning to offer testing in the next three months. The CBI said the government had ""a big role"" to provide guidance and make it simple to introduce workplace testing. According to the Department of Health, tests are currently being provided free to both public and private sector employers until at least 31 March, and the government's support will be kept under review. NHS Test and Trace will support organisations to deliver the asymptomatic testing by supplying the kits, and offering guidance and training for delivery. The additional funding for GPs is retrospective and will apply to any vaccinations that have already been delivered to those who cannot leave their homes. More than 1,000 GP services are part of the NHS vaccination programme, alongside over 250 hospital hubs and nearly 200 services run by high street pharmacies. The UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations. Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externaleach offer their own advice on testing.

"Jab protection against variant 'limited', study suggests","This video can not be played Prof Sarah Gilbert said the new version of the vaccine ""will be available for the autumn"" Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine offers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant, scientists say early trials suggest. A new study, not yet peer reviewed, involved about 2,000 people who were on average 31 years old. But Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford lead vaccine developer, said vaccines should still protect against severe disease. She said developers were likely to have a modified Oxford jab by the autumn to combat the South Africa variant. South Africa has said it is putting its rollout of the Oxford vaccine on temporary hold, while scientists advise on the best way to proceed following the results of the study. The variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, is already the dominant virus variant in large parts of South Africa. Earlier, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Andrew Marr that a booster in the autumn and annual vaccines could be required to combat variants. More than 100 cases of the South Africa variant have been found in the UK. When will I get the coronavirus vaccine? How worrying are the new variants? South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? A study outlining early trials, firstreported by the Financial Times,external, suggests the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate disease caused by the variant, the University of Oxford said. Prof Gilbert told the Andrew Marr Show current vaccines ""have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses"". ""What that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease."" She added: ""That's really important for healthcare systems, even if we are having mild and asymptomatic infections, to prevent people going into hospital with Covid would have a major effect."" Meanwhile, Mr Zahawi said the UK government hadruled out issuing so-called ""vaccine passports""to enable people who have had the jab against coronavirus to travel abroad. This isn't a complete surprise. The mutation involved - known as E484K - seems to help the virus dodge immunity built up to previous variants and current vaccines. Real world trials of two other vaccines (Janssen and Novavax) showed a dip in performance in South Africa too. This is the same mutation that has also appeared in some cases of the ""Kent variant"" in the UK. We are still waiting for scientists to publish their report in order to find out what ""limited"" means in hard numbers. If people are still getting sick, even if it's mild, then they can spread the virus and that will make it harder to get on top of cases. If the Oxford vaccine can prevent severe disease, and AstraZeneca thinks it will, then it would still be a life-saving vaccine. But it is clear coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change vaccines in the future to keep up. In a separate statement, AstraZeneca said the jab offered ""limited"" protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the variant. A spokesman for the pharmaceutical company said it had not yet been able to properly establish whether the jab would prevent severe disease and hospitalisation caused by the South Africa variant because those involved in the study had predominantly been young, healthy adults. But the company expressed confidence the vaccine would offer protection against serious cases, because it created neutralising antibodies similar to those of other coronavirus vaccines. The study, which assessed a two-dose regimen, is due to be published on Monday. Five reasons to be (cautiously) hopeful on Covid What has the government done about the South Africa strain? Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: ""This study confirms that the pandemic coronavirus will find ways to continue to spread in vaccinated populations, as expected, but, taken with the promising results from other studies in South Africa using a similar viral vector, vaccines may continue to ease the toll on health care systems by preventing severe disease."" In a news conference on Sunday, Prof Shabir Madhi, who has led trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, said the study had been ""largely disappointing"" in terms of the jab's efficacy against the South Africa variant. ""Unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness,"" he said, adding that the data did not say whether or not the vaccine might still protect at least against severe infections. Earlier, Prof Madhi said a vaccine developed by Janssen showed it stopped moderate to severe disease, rather than all disease, and this kept people out of hospital. ""These findings recalibrate thinking about how to approach the pandemic virus and shift the focus from the goal of herd immunity against transmission to the protection of all at-risk individuals in population against severe disease,"" Prof Madhi added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? QUARANTINE:Will I need to self-isolate in a hotel? On Saturday, AstraZenecasaid its vaccine provided good protection against the variant first discovered in Kent, which is now dominant in the UK. Early results suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants. Data on two new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one fromNovavaxand another fromJanssen- appear to offer some protection. And early results from Modernasuggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant. Experts say vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match for new variants in a matter of weeks or months if necessary.
