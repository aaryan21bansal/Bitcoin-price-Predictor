Dog 'hanging' video appears on Facebook,"Buster's owner said he contacted the police because he has nothing to hide A dog owner has spoken of his distress after police investigated claims he hanged his pet. A video posted on social media appeared to show a dog being hanged outside a house in north Belfast. The original story emerged on Sunday, when a video was posted on Facebook. At the time, police described the dog's treatment as a ""horrible crime"" but on Monday they clarified they had visited the owner and the dog was not abused. The 21-second video, taken from behind railings, is thought to have been captured by a passer-by. The man who owns the dog, who wishes only to be known by his first name Andre, contacted the police on Monday morning when a friend told him the police were looking for him. ""Because I have nothing to hide the first thing I did this morning was contact the police,"" he said. A police officer along with an animal welfare officer called to his home, and after showing them the dog they informed him there would be no investigation. Buster is an American bulldog Andre is very disappointed at how this issue has been handled. He strongly believes that if the woman thought he was abusing his dog she should've called the police ""then and there"" instead of uploading a video to social media. He said a group of people came to his home on Sunday evening as they had seen the video on Facebook. ""I showed my dog to the group, and I was able to show them videos of me training my dog, and they then apologised to me. ""I do wonder, if I didn't have my dog with me I might not have been able to explain the situation,"" he said. The woman who recorded the footage claimed the dog was hanging from this frame Andre got Buster when he was a four-month old pup and says he has a passion for the American bulldog breed. ""I got my dog as a companion. Training my dog introduces me to new friends and a new social network. ""Having a dog gives me a purpose - it improves my mental health,"" he added. ""Buster is my best friend. It breaks my heart even being accused of abusing him."" In a Facebook post on Sunday, PSNI North Belfast said the video was ""hard to watch"" and they appealed for witnesses to come forward. However, PSNI Ch Insp Kelly Moore said police visited the dog's owner on Monday morning, along with animal welfare staff from Belfast City Council. ""I can confirm after the visit that the dog is in good health and no abuse had taken place. Rather the dog was being trained and was playing with a toy. ""We are satisfied that no crime has taken place and that the animal is well looked after,"" she added.

'Spiritual abuse' vicar banned by church,"The Reverend Timothy Davis was suspended in 2016 A Church of England vicar who ""spiritually abused"" a boy has been banned from ministry for two years. The Reverend Timothy Davis is understood to be the first priest to have been convicted of such abuse by the Bishop's Disciplinary Tribunal. Mr Davis, of Christ Church, Abingdon, held two-hour private prayer sessions in the teenager's bedroom after moving in with his family in 2013. He also told his victim his girlfriend was ""evil"" and a ""bad seed"". Mr Davis lived with the family, who were members of his congregation, for six months after meeting the boy during a mentoring programme. During the prayer sessions they had laid hands on each other's head, shoulders, chest and back, although the tribunal ruled in January that there was no ""sexual touching"". In its judgement in January,the tribunal said,externalthe boy was ""scared"" and ""overcome by the intensity of what Mr Davis was doing"". As well as the prayer sessions, the tribunal heard Mr Davis had sent him text messages about his girlfriend in a bid to end their relationship. It said the vicar's ""domination"" of the boy amounted to ""misconduct which was unbecoming and inappropriate to the work and office of a Clerk in Holy Orders."" The vicar met the teenager during a mentoring programme at his church Mr Davis, who is aged in his 50s, was suspended from his position in 2016. He will need to undergo a risk assessment if he wants to return to ministry after serving the ban. After the judgement, a spokesman for the Diocese of Oxford said: ""Tim Davis betrayed the trust of everyone involved in a youth mentoring program at Christ Church Abingdon."" The vicar's behaviour was ""in no way reflective of acceptable church practice"", the spokesman said.

"Don't go on Russia Today, Labour tells MPs","This video can not be played John McDonnell says he won't appear on Russia Today Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said he won't be making any more appearances on Kremlin-sponsored TV station Russia Today. He said RT's coverage ""goes beyond objective journalism"" and it was ""right"", after events in Salisbury, that Labour MPs did not appear on it. A party spokesman said: ""We are keeping the issue under review"". Mr McDonnell also backed visa sanctions against Russians suspected of corruption. Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested a deal could be reached with Labour to bring in sanctions. Salisbury diners told to wash possessions after nerve agent attack Russian state TV anchor warns 'traitors' But he rejected a call from the widow of murdered Alexander Litvinenko for the Conservatives to pay back more than Â£820,000 donated by Russian-linked business people since Prime Minister Theresa May came to power. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr there were ""very strict rules"" governing donations to UK political parties. This video can not be played Marina Litvinenko: 'Lessons haven't been learned' ""There are people in this country who are British citizens who are of Russian origin - I don't think we should taint them, we should tar them with Putin's brush. ""We should recognise that people come to this country from many places, they become British citizens, they live under UK law and they should have full participation rights in our society once they're British citizens."" It came after Marina Litvinenko warned the government: ""You need to be very selective who you are friends with. ""When you allow people with money to come to your country to make a business, you need to make sure where the money has come from."" Mrs Litvinenko said the UK government's response to the murder of her husband, an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin who was fatally poisoned in 2006, had not been strong enough and lessons had not been learned. Mr Hammond, who was foreign secretary when the UK government inquiry into Mr Litvinenko's death was published, in 2015, said ""we took measures which are still in place today"" but he said the Russian government continued to protect the suspects the UK wanted to extradite to stand trial for his murder. Asked by Andrew Marr if the Russians ""were laughing at us"" and believed they could act without implications in the UK, he said: ""Nobody is laughing at us - this is a very serious investigation that is going on and let's see where it leads us."" Labour has been under fire for some time from the Conservatives over appearances by its MPs and spokespeople on RT UK. Mr McDonnell said he had appeared on the rolling news channel in the past to raise certain issues but he added: ""I've been looking overnight... in terms of changes in coverage on Russian television, in particular, and I think we have to step back now."" He added: ""I can understand why people have [appeared on RT] up until now because we have treated it like every other television station. ""We tried to be fair with them and as long as they abide by journalistic standards that are objective that's fine but it looks as if they have gone beyond that line, so yes, we will have that discussion."" Peter Dowd, who as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury is Mr McDonnell's deputy, said he had appeared on RT on a number of occasions, including in a programme broadcast at the start of this week. Mr Dowd told Sky's Sunday with Niall Paterson: ""In light of the events of this week, of course we will undertake a review of what we do in regards to these, as you will always do in these sorts of circumstances."" The Kremlin-funded news channel began broadcasting internationally in 2005 in English, Arabic and Spanish as Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today). It shortened its name to RT several years later and began focusing on US news. It launched a dedicated UK service in 2014. It says it provides a ""Russian viewpoint"" on world events and challenges ""mainstream media"" - but critics say it is a propaganda vehicle for the Russian government. It has been sanctioned by UK regulator Ofcom for misleading programmes on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said last year it was ""an absolute scandal"" that Labour MPs had given interviews to RT. A number of Conservative MPs - and ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage - have also appeared on the channel and ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond hosts a weekly chat show. Why has RT registered as a foreign agent with the US? Mr McDonnell called on the government to pass a British version of the US Magnitsky Act - which punishes Russians involved in corruption and human rights violations - if the Kremlin is found to be behind the poisoning in Salisbury. He said that the Labour Party had already moved amendments to the Money Laundering Bill currently going through parliament to introduce Magnitsky clauses - amendments he said were opposed by the Conservative Party. ""We hope now they'll enable us to bring those amendments back at the Report stage of the bill"" he said. Chancellor Philip Hammond said introducing Magnitsky clauses was not ""strictly necessary"". ""The home secretary already has the power to exclude individuals from the UK if she believes that their presence here is not conducive to the national security or the public good. ""But we're seeking to reach an accommodation with those who have put this amendment forward. ""Let's see if we can come to a proposal that works for everybody."" RT have crossed line - McDonnell.

We're not out of the tunnel yet - Hammond,"This video can not be played Chancellor Philip Hammond: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel"" Chancellor Philip Hammond has rejected calls by Labour and some Conservatives to announce the end of austerity in his spring statement on Tuesday. He is expected to unveil the smallest budget deficit since 2002, thanks to better than expected public finances. But he told the BBC national debt was still too high, adding: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel... but we are still in the tunnel at the moment."" Labour has urged him toend the ""pain and misery"" of public spending cuts. Mr Hammond told the Andrew Marr Show it would be wrong to pour ""every penny"" into additional public spending. What not to expect from the spring statement Why is there no Budget this March? UK economic growth exceeds forecasts He said it was ""very important moment"" to see debt starting to fall after growing for 17 continuous years. But he said: ""We should be very careful looking at single sets of figures - one quarter or two quarters - we need to look at what's happening sustainably in the economy."" The day-to-day deficit has been eliminated, it emerged earlier this month, two years later than former chancellor George Osborne had wanted when he set out in 2010. The UK is now running a surplus of Â£3.8bn in its current budget - the money borrowed to fund day-to-day spending rather than long-term investment - according to the Office for National Statistics. ""We have a debt of Â£1.8 trillion - 86.5% of our GDP,"" Mr Hammond said. ""All the international organisations recognise that is higher than the safe level."" Mr Hammond told the BBC that ""we need to get our debt lower"". ""I think most people in this country would be horrified to be reminded that we have Â£65,000 worth of public debt for every household in this country,"" he said. The chancellor is due to announce a half-yearly update of Britain's public finance figures on Tuesday, but confirmed he would not be delivering any new tax or spending measures. ""If there is the flexibility and the space to do something, then we will decide in the autumn how we are going to use that,"" he said. Economists expect the chancellor will announce borrowing is set to be around Â£7bn lower in 2017-18 than had been predicted, when he unveils the latest forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Also appearing on Andrew Marr, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called on the government to end its austerity programme. He said recent economic figures were ""not a matter for celebration"" - and said the chancellor ""should be coming into the real world"". He said Mr Hammond had ""shifted the deficit onto the shoulders of NHS managers, headteachers and onto the shoulders of local government leaders. ""They're facing a financial crisis because of government cutbacks,"" he told Marr. This video can not be played John McDonnell says he won't appear on Russia Today He called thegovernment's plans for an NHS pay deal""miserly and mean-spirited"". ""Pay is at the moment just about matching inflation, that's all,"" he added. Mr McDonnell has called on the government to use its spring statement to end what Labour called an ""immediate crisis"" in public services. But Mr Hammond vowed to ""look at the numbers"" in the autumn Budget. He said: ""Local authorities have done an incredible job in delivering efficiencies,"" adding: ""Of course they're under some pressures"".

Momentum chief quits Labour race,"Momentum founder Jon Lansman has dropped his bid for the vacant post of Labour's general secretary. On Twitter, he said he had ""decided to step back from the race"",externalto focus on his role on the party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC). He said he had achieved his aim of sparking debate about the party's governance and encouraging others to stand for general secretary. The Labour leadership favours Unite official Jennie Formby for the role. Mr Lansman is understood to have come under pressure from Jeremy Corbyn to pull out of the race. His surprise entry into the contest to replace Iain McNicol as general secretary sparked concerns about a power struggle between Unite, which is Labour's biggest financial backer, and Momentum, the campaign group set up to support Mr Corbyn's leadership. Mr Lansman has argued for a much greater say for Labour members in the running of the party, including whether the general secretary should be elected by the membership, rather than chosen by the NEC. According the Observer,external, Ms Formby was the ""frontrunner"" for the post but her allies were attempting to calm concerns she would launch a ""clear-out"" of Labour staff deemed to be insufficiently supportive of the leader. In his statement, Mr Lansman said his main aim had been to open the contest up to other contenders. ""Over the last few days, in spite of media reports to the contrary including misogynist attacks on Jennie Formby in today's Observer, NEC members have begun a productive, comradely debate about the future of the party. ""Whether the general secretary should be elected and what a transformed, member-led Labour party would look like are big, urgent questions - and I'm heartened to see members across the country openly debating them."" He said ""a number of party members"" had been in touch with him to say they were considering a bid for the general secretary role. He said would give his ""full support"" to whoever took up the post. But he called for an end to the era of centralised ""command and control"" in the Labour Party, in which the views of members were ""too often ignored"" and over-ruled at the party conference. Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is a member of Labour's NEC, told ITV's Peston on Sunday Labour needed a general secretary that did not just represent one wing of the party. ""We want to see the full suite of candidates and we'll make an informed decision at the time,"" she added.

Restaurants warn over 'damaging closures',"A group of restaurant bosses is warning the government it must act to avoid ""damaging closures and job losses"". In a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond, they have asked for ""root and branch"" reform of business rates. The chief executive of Bills and the chairman of pub and restaurant chain Mitchells and Butlers are among the 15 who signed the letter. A string of chains including Jamie's Italian and Byron have closed outlets recently amid financial difficulties. Last week, pizza chain Prezzo became the latest to cut back, closing 94 outlets. That amounted to about a third of its outlets and included all of its TexMex chain Chimichanga. Barbecoa, a smaller chain also owned by Jamie Oliver, went into administration last month, while Italian chain Carluccio's has called in accountants KPMG to advise on possible strategies to cut costs. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Jamie Oliver closes flagship restaurant Six reasons behind the High Street crisis In the letter to the chancellor ahead of his spring statement on the economy on Tuesday, the business leaders described a ""perfect storm"" that has hit their sector. They blamed ""soaring business rates, rising employment costs and Brexit-fuelled inflation"" for the difficult trading conditions. ""We need government action now to reduce the unnecessary costs of doing business if we are to avoid damaging closures and job losses,"" the letter said. ""The sector is at a tipping point and needs focused attention now."" According to research published last week,one in three of the UK's top 100 restaurant groups are not making a profit. Consumer spending power - squeezed by low wage growth and higher inflation - means consumers are reining in discretionary leisure spending in general. Some are replacing it with home delivered meals, or ready-meals like Marks and Spencer's successful Dine In for Two for Â£10. Some analysts also argue there has been too much expansion among chain restaurants. Speaking to the BBC last month, Roger Tejwani, from stockbrokers Finncap, said: ""There is too much capacity in the market with consumers having a considerable amount of choice.""

SpaceX and Tesla 'almost went bankrupt',"Elon Musk said he initially didn't think his companies were likely to succeed Elon Musk says his companies SpaceX and Tesla are both still alive only ""by the skin of their teeth"". The entrepreneur told an audience at the South by South West (SXSW) conference that both companies almost went bankrupt in 2008. ""I gave both SpaceX and Tesla a probability of less than 10% likely to succeed,"" he said during a Q&A session. ""At the beginning in 2002, I wouldn't even let my own friends invest as I didn't want to lose their money."" Mr Musk said he made $180m (Â£130m) when PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, and he initially put $90m into SpaceX and Tesla, but the costs kept mounting. He said 2008 was an incredibly difficult year -SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket failed for the third time,external, and Tesla almost went bankrupt two days before Christmas. By this point, he only had about $40m left. ""I could put it all into one company, and the other company would definitely die, or if I split it into both SpaceX and Tesla, then they both might die,"" he said. ""And when you put your energy into building something, it's your baby, so I couldn't choose. I put the money into both, and thank goodness they both came through."" Elon Musk: Mars ship test flights 'next year' The man who sent his sports car into space The story of Elon Musk's rocket launch Mr Musk also got divorced, and he said he had to borrow money from his friends to pay his rent. ""SpaceX is alive by the skin of its teeth, and so is Tesla - if things had just gone a little differently, both companies would be dead,"" he said. Mr Musk said he had to be the chief engineer for the Falcon 1 because he couldn't get any other suitable candidates to join the company, and he didn't want to risk his venture on engineers he felt weren't of the right standard. And although he can now afford to hire as many talented engineers as he would like, he still continues to spend 80-90% of his time working on engineering and design at both SpaceX and Tesla, leaving other executives to manage the business side of the companies. However, he said that over time, he felt Tesla had caused him far ""more drama"" than SpaceX. He also said his tunnelling firm,the Boring Company, was started as a joke because he thought the name was funny, and although he tweets about it a lot, it actually only takes up about 2% of his time. When asked why he decided to go into the space industry and electric cars, he explained that he had been interested in both subjects when he was in university. He also said he didn't feel enough progress had been made in recent years on space travel. ""I wondered why we weren't making progress with getting people on the moon, and where are all the space hotels we were promised in 2001: A Space Odyssey?"" he said. ""The genesis of SpaceX was not to create a company, but how do we get Nasa's budget to be bigger?"" Mr Musk remains convinced thatlife on Mars is both possible and necessary. He fears another ""dark age"" should a third world war occur, and feels that Mars will be integral to helping the human race survive and regenerate. He also feels there are plentiful business opportunities there. ""They will start off building a rudimentary base... then this will open up a world of new opportunities, because Mars will need pizza joints, great bars - Mars Bars,"" he said.

'Wrong' cream tea sparks angry outcry,"The original ""offending"" promotional photograph A Mother's Day cream tea advert has sparked fury for depicting a scone with the jam dolloped on the cream. The National Trust's Lanhydrock in Bodmin angered Cornish locals by depicting the delicacy in the rival Devon tradition on a Facebook post. Outraged locals said they were going to cancel memberships over the blunder. The Trust apologised for the ""heinous mistake"", adding staff will wear #JamFirst badges to support ""a proper cream tea"". About 300 people complained on the post, with some claiming it was ""horrifying"" and ""made them feel sick"". The badges were made especially after the public outcry Campaigners said the matter of placing jam first was about identity The member of staff responsible for the post ""had been reprimanded and marched back over the Tamar"" to neighbouring county Devon, the Trust said. Richard Levy, Lanhydrock's Visitor Experience manager, said it was a ""genuine mistake"" and the staff member was ""meekly crawling around trying to avoid the storm"" before returning to work on Monday. Colin Leggo, from Twitter campaign @Jam_First, said: ""It's all about identity, it's like the pasty as well. If people get something wrong that you're so connected with... We love how passionate people can be about it, but the reaction did seem full on."" Stevie Selvey posted: ""Wow... Are people really getting worked up about a picture of a scone just cause it had cream on first? How pathetic."" Lanhydrock boasts a late Victorian country house with garden and wooded estate Mr Levy told the BBC he decided to get #JamFirst badges especially made after posting: ""There's no truth in the rumour that we're renaming the property Jamhydrock"". Emma Phillips bravely responded ""#creamfirstandproud"". Duncan Biscotto posted: ""Don't apologise, it still tastes the same - there are worse atrocities in the world.""

Backlash for Cable over Brexit comment,"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable said too many older people who voted for Brexit were ""driven by nostalgia"" Sir Vince Cable has denied suggesting older Brexit voters were racist. In a speech at his party's spring conference, the Lib Dem leader said too many older people who voted Leave longed for a world where ""faces were white"" and were ""driven by nostalgia"". Tory MPs have labelled the comments as ""wrong"" and ""unwise"". But Sir Vince called it a ""simple truth of the matter"" that the majority of the older generation voted Leave while younger people favoured Remain. In his speech on Sunday, Sir Vince said a ""nostalgia for a world where passports were blue, faces were white and the map was coloured imperial pink"" had driven some older voters to Brexit. ""And it was their votes on one wet day in June which crushed the hopes and aspirations of young people for years to come,"" he added. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether he was suggesting older Brexit voters were racist, Sir Vince said: ""I didn't suggest that at all."" But he repeated his claim that ""nostalgia for that world"" was a factor in how people had voted. ""Why else has so much fuss been made about the change in the colour of the passport?"" he added. Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Corbyn: Labour Brexit approach 'sensible' Conservative MPs have criticised the Lib Dem leader over his speech. Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Sir Vince should be trying to bring country together, not seeking to tear it apart."" Tory party chair Brandon Lewis said his comments were ""rude"" and ""offensive"". Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said ""calling 17.4 million people racists is unfair and unwise"" and the deputy chairman of the Conservatives, James Cleverly, said ""not liking brown faces"" was not the reason he voted Brexit.

Putin ordered plane to be downed,"Mr Putin is expected to win re-election later this month Russia's President Putin ordered the shooting down of a passenger plane that was reportedly carrying a bomb and targeting the opening of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, he says in a new film. In the two-hour film, posted online, Mr Putin says he was told a plane from Ukraine to Turkey had been hijacked as the Games were about to start. It was found to be a false alarm, he says. The plane was not shot down. The film comes ahead of an election he is expected to win on 18 March. Mr Putin faces seven challengers but none are expected to attract widespread support and the most prominent opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been barred from standing. Why would Putin want to nuke Florida? Strawberry tycoon among Putin challengers Putin cast as national saviour ahead of poll ""I was told: a plane en route from Ukraine to Istanbul was seized, captors demand landing in Sochi,"" Mr Putin says in the film, Reuters reported. The pilots of a Turkish Pegasus Airlines Boeing 737-800, flying from Kharkiv to Istanbul with 110 people on board, said a passenger had a bomb and had told them to divert the plane to Sochi, reporter Andrey Kondrashov says. In the film, Mr Putin says security officials told him that the emergency procedure in such a situation was to down the plane. ""I told them: act according to the plan,"" Mr Putin says. Mr Putin says he ordered the plane to be shot down shortly before the Sochi opening ceremony Minutes later he received another call informing him that it was a false alarm, he says. He arrived at the Olympic venue in Sochi with Olympic officials shortly afterwards, he says. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has confirmed Mr Putin's account, Reuters reported. The first part of the documentary, entitled Putin, has been posted on social media accounts, including one belonging to key state media manager and commentator Dmitry Kiselyov, and a pro-Kremlin YouTube account. During the film Mr Putin was asked by interviewer Mr Kondrashov - a top state TV presenter and currently Mr Putin's election campaign press secretary - if there were any circumstances in which he could envisage returning Crimea to Ukraine. ""What are you talking about? Such circumstances do not exist and never will,"" Mr Putin said.Russia's Tass news agency reported his remarks,external. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine after the country's pro-Russian leader was overthrown in 2014. Last Septemberthe UN accused Russia of committing ""grave human rights violations""in Crimea. The place that's rather difficult to get into In the film, Mr Putin says that he may forgive some things, ""but not everything"". When asked by Mr Kondrashov to clarify what cannot be forgiven, the Russian leader says: ""Betrayal."" Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president However, Mr Putin says he has not yet had to deal with ""serious events that can be called betrayal"". ""Maybe I have chosen people who are not capable of doing such a thing,"" he says. The Russian president's paternal grandfather worked as a chef for the former leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, Mr Putin says. Mr Putin's grandfather cooked for former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin Spiridon Putin was a highly regarded member of Stalin's staff, Mr Putin says. ""[He] was a cook at Lenin's and later at Stalin's, at one of the dachas in the Moscow area,"" Mr Putin says, Reuters reported. Spiridon Putin continued to cook for the Soviet establishment until not long before his death in 1965 at the age of 86, the film says. Analysis by Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow The Kremlin wants the highest possible turnout at next week's election to give ""Putin 4"" fresh legitimacy. This two-hour hagiography is part of that. It seems crafted to fill Russians with admiration and ensure they head out to vote. The film presents Vladimir Putin as strong and focussed. But he's caring, too, filmed with lots of big close-ups, cheeky smiles and hints of emotion. The key lines, though, come at the very start: the idea that the West will never put Russia in its place, Crimea will never be returned and Russia's president is not someone to be messed with. There's also a stress on his appeal to the young, via adoring interviews with teenagers born on the day he came to power.  As for the handling of the 2000 Kursk submarine tragedy, Putin is now cast as decisive and humane - far from the harsh image he projected at the time when he smirked at a question on the fate of the Kursk, and said ""it sank"". But at the heart of it all is a story of how a strongman hero 'saved' a country from ruin. In that, it underlines how Putin inherited a military in tatters and developed a force that Russians can be proud of, and the world has to reckon with once again.

France's Le Pen proposes new party name,"Ms Le Pen wants to change how French voters see the party which was founded by her father France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen has proposed changing her party's name to National Rally from National Front in a bid to improve its image. She told members that the current name was a ""psychological barrier"" for voters. The plan to change the party's name was approved by a slim majority and members will get to vote again on the proposal. Ms Le Pen was defeated by President Emmanuel Macron in a run-off vote last year. Since then the party has lost voters and Ms Le Pen has come under attack from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the party in 1972. Whatever happened to France's far right? What makes Marine Le Pen far right? Mr Le Pen, 89, told Reuters last month that a name change would be political ""suicide"". But Ms Le Pen hopes it will change attitudes to her party, which is associated by many voters with racism and anti-Semitism, and make it easier to form alliances with other parties. She told members that the National Front name was associated with a ""glorious and epic history"" but also prevented the party from winning elections and gaining followers. ""For a lot of French people, even those who are sincere, it's a psychological barrier,"" she said. ""We were originally a protest party. There should be no doubt now that we can be a ruling party,"" she added. Fifty-two percent of members backed changing the party name on Saturday, the party says. Members will now vote on the new name by post. Whatever happened to France's far right? What makes Marine Le Pen far right?

SpaceX and Tesla 'almost went bankrupt'Elon Musk opens up about the early days of his companies at the SXSW conference in Texas.3m3 minutes ago,"Elon Musk said he initially didn't think his companies were likely to succeed Elon Musk says his companies SpaceX and Tesla are both still alive only ""by the skin of their teeth"". The entrepreneur told an audience at the South by South West (SXSW) conference that both companies almost went bankrupt in 2008. ""I gave both SpaceX and Tesla a probability of less than 10% likely to succeed,"" he said during a Q&A session. ""At the beginning in 2002, I wouldn't even let my own friends invest as I didn't want to lose their money."" Mr Musk said he made $180m (Â£130m) when PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, and he initially put $90m into SpaceX and Tesla, but the costs kept mounting. He said 2008 was an incredibly difficult year -SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket failed for the third time,external, and Tesla almost went bankrupt two days before Christmas. By this point, he only had about $40m left. ""I could put it all into one company, and the other company would definitely die, or if I split it into both SpaceX and Tesla, then they both might die,"" he said. ""And when you put your energy into building something, it's your baby, so I couldn't choose. I put the money into both, and thank goodness they both came through."" Elon Musk: Mars ship test flights 'next year' The man who sent his sports car into space The story of Elon Musk's rocket launch Mr Musk also got divorced, and he said he had to borrow money from his friends to pay his rent. ""SpaceX is alive by the skin of its teeth, and so is Tesla - if things had just gone a little differently, both companies would be dead,"" he said. Mr Musk said he had to be the chief engineer for the Falcon 1 because he couldn't get any other suitable candidates to join the company, and he didn't want to risk his venture on engineers he felt weren't of the right standard. And although he can now afford to hire as many talented engineers as he would like, he still continues to spend 80-90% of his time working on engineering and design at both SpaceX and Tesla, leaving other executives to manage the business side of the companies. However, he said that over time, he felt Tesla had caused him far ""more drama"" than SpaceX. He also said his tunnelling firm,the Boring Company, was started as a joke because he thought the name was funny, and although he tweets about it a lot, it actually only takes up about 2% of his time. When asked why he decided to go into the space industry and electric cars, he explained that he had been interested in both subjects when he was in university. He also said he didn't feel enough progress had been made in recent years on space travel. ""I wondered why we weren't making progress with getting people on the moon, and where are all the space hotels we were promised in 2001: A Space Odyssey?"" he said. ""The genesis of SpaceX was not to create a company, but how do we get Nasa's budget to be bigger?"" Mr Musk remains convinced thatlife on Mars is both possible and necessary. He fears another ""dark age"" should a third world war occur, and feels that Mars will be integral to helping the human race survive and regenerate. He also feels there are plentiful business opportunities there. ""They will start off building a rudimentary base... then this will open up a world of new opportunities, because Mars will need pizza joints, great bars - Mars Bars,"" he said.

The talks in 400 words,"This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Friday has been a landmark day in the history of the Korean tensions. Here's your very brief guide to what has just happened Two South Korean officials had dinner with Kim Jong-un this week in North Korea - that was itself significant. They then flew to the US with a message from Mr Kim - he wanted to meet US President Donald Trump and was prepared to give up his nuclear weapons. Mr Trump accepted the offer- they might now meet as soon as May. The two leaders have hurled insults and threatsat each other over the past year, like ""Little Rocket Man"" and ""dotard"". South Korea - with which North Korea is still, on paper, at war - said this news ""came like a miracle"". BecauseNorth Korea's nuclear weapons programme has worried the world for decades. It has conducted six illegal underground nuclear tests and fired off numerous long-distance missiles. It says it could hit the US with a nuke - though that's still not certain. It could definitely attack its neighbours. Giving up the weapons would be seismic. It's not clear. It could be thatyears of sanctions designed to force it to talk are working. It could be it sees Donald Trump as someone it can manipulate. Or it could think now is its chance to finally be recognised as a serious nuclear state. Complicated diplomacy, and the clock is ticking. We don't yet know where any talks will take place, nor who will be involved along with the leaders. We also don't know what North Korea wants in exchange for a meeting. North Korea hasn't actually committed to anything yet. If it does agree to throw out its nukes, the main issue will be how to prove it. It has reneged on agreements before. As our correspondent says,it's the political gamble of the century. The other main players are: Japan, which neighbours the Koreas. It is cautiously optimistic but wants North Korea to give up nuclear weapons before anything happens. China, North Korea's main financial backer. It has always pushed for everyone to talk, and said things were ""heading in the right direction"". Russia, which has a tiny border with the North. It called it ""a step in the right direction"". The gamble of the century Strange optics of announcement Did sanctions push Kim to talks? US-N Korea talks: What could happen now?

Salisbury diners told to wash possessions,"This video can not be played Prof Dame Sally Davies said the risk of harm was ""low"" Up to 500 Salisbury pub-goers and diners have been told to wash possessions as a precaution after nerve agent traces were found. Trace amounts of the substance used to poison ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were found on and around a table where the pair ate at Zizzi restaurant, the BBC has learned. The table, along with other items, has been removed and destroyed. Scientists have advised police it could take weeks for the premises to reopen. Traces of the nerve agent were also found at the Mill pub in Salisbury. Sergei and Yulia Skripal, who remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital, are understood to have eaten on a table away from other diners. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said the risk of harm to fellow diners was ""low"". Theadvice to wash possessions,externalapplies to anyone in either venue between 13:30 GMT on Sunday 4 March and closure on Monday: Clothes should be washed, ideally in a washing machine Clothes which cannot be washed, for example if they need dry cleaning, should be double bagged in plastic until further notice Mobile phones, handbags and other electronic items should be wiped with baby wipes, which should be bagged in plastic and put in the bin Other items such as jewellery and glasses should be washed with warm water and detergent Hands should be washed after the handling of any items suspected of being contaminated. Dame Sally said after ""rigorous scientific analysis"" there was some concern that prolonged exposure over weeks and months could cause health problems but it was ""not a subject for panic"". She said the advice was a ""belt and braces"" measure, adding: ""I am confident none of these customers or staff will have suffered harm."" What are nerve agents? Labour to boycott Russia Today - McDonnell Russian spy: What we know so far The man at centre of spy story Poisoning poses major challenge for MI6 But people in Salisbury are concerned the advice was not given sooner. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are still critically ill in hospital Steve Cooper, who was at the Mill pub with his wife and dog for a couple of hours last Sunday afternoon, told the BBC he was outraged. He said he would now wash his shoes, watch and phone but feared using baby wipes would not get rid of a nerve agent. Some of his friends, who had been in the pub at the same time and seen Mr Skripal head to the toilet, could not remember what they had been wearing that day, he added. Mr Cooper said he had become increasingly concerned for his safety in the last few days. ""I'd like to know what are the long-term implications to me and my wife,"" he said. This video can not be played Steve Cooper was in the pub where traces of a nerve agent have been found Dame Sally said it had been a ""painstaking process"" and the ""scientific tests take time"" but no harm had been caused by the wait. Alastair Hay, professor emeritus of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, said nerve agents degrade in the environment. ""Contact with moisture will lead to breakdown of the nerve agent - this is why people having visited the restaurant or pub in question last Sunday afternoon or Monday are being advised to wash their possessions,"" he said. This video can not be played Dr Richard Guthrie, a chemical weapons expert, explains how the nerve agent might have been used Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found slumped on a bench in the city on Sunday. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill attending the pair, remains seriously ill in hospital but has been talking to his family. The pub and restaurant are two of five sites in Salisbury focused on by investigators. Mr Skripal's home and the cemetery where Mr Skripal's wife and son are buried are also being examined. At a press conference on Sunday, Chief Constable Kier Pritchard of Wiltshire Police said he was ""unable to clarify"" how long those crime scenes would remain closed to the public. Det Sgt Nick Bailey remains in hospital The advice affects anyone at the Mill pub between 13:30 on Sunday and its closure at 23.10 on Monday Members of the military are assisting police for a third day having previously helped with the removal of vehicles of interest including an ambulance. More than 250 counter terrorism police are now involved in the investigation, which has yielded 200 pieces of evidence so far and more than 240 witnesses. At a Sunday service at Salisbury Cathedral, the bishop - the Right Reverend Nicholas Holtam - said as well as a ""shocking attack on two individuals"", the attack was a ""violation of our community"". Mr Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6 in 2004, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"".

Trump 'knows risks of meeting N Korea',"This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies CIA director Mike Pompeo has defended Donald Trump's decision to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying the president understands the risks. Mr Trump ""isn't doing this for theatre, he is going there to solve a problem,"" the spy chief told Fox News Sunday. The president has said the yet-to-be-arranged summit could produce the ""greatest deal for the world"". But critics have warned that if the talks go poorly, the two nations will be in a worse position than before. The political gamble of the 21st Century The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit In brief: What just happened? No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. Such a summit, which Pyongyang has long wanted, has previously been seen as possible only after major concessions from the North Koreans. But Mr Trump reportedly accepted the offer on the spot when it was relayed by South Korean envoys on Thursday, taking his own administration by surprise. Two of those envoys are now on the way to China and Japan to brief the leaders of each country on the upcoming talks. South Korean President Moon Jae-in's top security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi. Meanwhile, Suh Hoon, chief of the intelligence agency, is headed to Tokyo to speak with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. North Korea has said several times in the past that it would consider giving up its nuclear weapons under the right conditions. But attempts to negotiate aid-for-disarmament deals have failed repeatedly since 2003, when the North pulled out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). But Mr Pompeo told CBS the administration had its eyes ""wide open"" to the challenge of dealing with North Korea. The strange optics of the North Korea announcement South Korea statement on Kim-Trump meeting Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? He said the country was coming to the table now because US-led sanctions have battered it economically. ""Never before have we had the North Koreans in a position where their economy was at such risk, where their leadership was under such pressure,"" he told Fox News. Another top White House official, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, stressed the ""clear"" objective of the talks was getting rid of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, and restated that the US expects there to be no missile or nuclear test ahead of the meeting. Politicians from both main parties in US politics expressed concerns over the planned meeting, however. Republican Senator Cory Gardner told CBS he wanted ""concrete, verifiable steps toward denuclearisation"" before the talks take place. Another Republican Senator, Jeff Flake, told NBC he was sceptical about whether denuclearisation was a realistic goal at all. North Korea has rapidly advanced its nuclear missile program Speaking to the same channel, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren raised fears that what she called the ""decimated"" US State Department lacked officials familiar with Pyongyang's methods. ""I want to see our president succeed, because if he succeeds, America succeeds. The world is safer,"" she said. ""But I am very worried that they're going to take advantage of him."" At a political rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Mr Trump told supporters he believed North Korea wanted to ""make peace"". But he said he might leave the talks quickly if it didn't look like progress for nuclear disarmament could be made. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Hey, who knows what's going to happen?"" said Mr Trump at the rally for a Republican congressional candidate. ""I may leave fast or we may sit down and make the greatest deal for the world.""

China approves 'president for life' change,"This video can not be played Should China's Xi be president for life? China has approved the removal of the two-term limit on the presidency, effectively allowing Xi Jinping to remain in power for life. The constitutional changes were passed by the annual sitting of parliament, the National People's Congress. The vote was widely regarded as a rubber-stamping exercise. Two delegates voted against the change and three abstained, out of 2,964 votes. China had imposed a two-term limit on its president since the 1990s. But Mr Xi, who would have been due to step down in 2023, defied the tradition of presenting a potential successor during October's Communist Party Congress. Instead, he consolidated his political power as the party voted to enshrine his name and political ideology in the party's constitution - elevating his status to the level of its founder, Chairman Mao. On paper, the congress is the most powerful legislative body in China - similar to the parliament in other nations. But it was widely believed that it would approve what it was told to. In depth: Xi, the president who lived in a cave How China's 'two sessions' meetings work A Chinese move that many expected Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent in Beijing It is now hard to see Xi Jinping being challenged in any way whatsoever. He has amassed power the likes of which has not been seen since Chairman Mao Zedong. Mr Xi applauded after the amendment was passed Only five years ago Beijing was being ruled by a collective leadership. Under ex-President Hu Jintao you could imagine differing views being expressed in the then nine-member Politburo Standing Committee. There was a feeling that Mr Hu needed to please various factions within the Communist Party and it seemed that every 10 years a new leader would come along with their own people in a process of smooth transition. From today all this has gone. The constitution has been altered to allow Xi Jinping to remain as president beyond two terms and they would not have gone to this much trouble if that was not exactly what he intended to do. There has been no national debate as to whether a leader should be allowed to stay on for as long as they choose. Quietly but surely Xi Jinping has changed the way his country is governed, with himself well and truly at the core. The issue is not, however, without controversy. Online censors in China have been blocking discussion around the topic, including images of Winnie the Pooh.Social media users have taken to using the cartoon character to represent Mr Xi. Social media users create ""Winnie the Pooh"" memes to avoid being seen as making derogatory posts against Mr Xi (r) One government critic described the proposal in an open letter last month as a ""farce"", in a rare show of public dissent. Former state newspaper editor Li Datong wrote that scrapping term limits for the president and vice-president would sow the seeds of chaos - in a message sent to some members of the national congress. ""I couldn't bear it any more. I was discussing with my friends and we were enraged. We have to voice our opposition,"" he told BBC Chinese. State media, however, have portrayed the changes as much-needed reform. US President Donald Trump was criticised by some commentators for seeming to approve of Mr Xi's unlimited rule, saying on Monday: ""President for life... I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."" At a political rally on Saturday, Mr Trump insisted he had merely been joking during a fundraiser, and that his comments were represented unfairly by some media. Mr Xi's possible third term is not the only item the National People's Congress is likely to approve. It was also expected to: confirm China's new government line-up for the next five years, kicking off Xi Jinping's second term as president ratify a law to set up a new powerful anti-corruption agency ratify the inclusion of the president's political philosophy - ""Xi Jinping thought"" - in the constitution Xi Jinping thought is the ideology approved by the Communist Party last October. Officially, it is ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era"". Schoolchildren, college students and staff at state factories will have to study the political ideology, which the Communist Party is trying to portray as a new chapter for modern China. Human cost of China's economic reforms The changing Chinese family in five charts The lawyer who simply vanished Mr Xi became president in 2013, and quickly consolidated personal power while cementing China as the regional superpower. He also fought corruption, punishing more than a million party members - which has helped his popularity among some. At the same time, however, China has clamped down on many emerging freedoms, increasing its state surveillance and censorship programs. Critics also say Mr Xi has used the anti-corruption purge to sideline political rivals.

Labour to shun Russia Today,"This video can not be played John McDonnell says he won't appear on Russia Today Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said he won't be making any more appearances on Kremlin-sponsored TV station Russia Today. He said RT's coverage ""goes beyond objective journalism"" and it was ""right"", after events in Salisbury, that Labour MPs did not appear on it. A party spokesman said: ""We are keeping the issue under review"". Mr McDonnell also backed visa sanctions against Russians suspected of corruption. Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested a deal could be reached with Labour to bring in sanctions. Salisbury diners told to wash possessions after nerve agent attack Russian state TV anchor warns 'traitors' But he rejected a call from the widow of murdered Alexander Litvinenko for the Conservatives to pay back more than Â£820,000 donated by Russian-linked business people since Prime Minister Theresa May came to power. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr there were ""very strict rules"" governing donations to UK political parties. This video can not be played Marina Litvinenko: 'Lessons haven't been learned' ""There are people in this country who are British citizens who are of Russian origin - I don't think we should taint them, we should tar them with Putin's brush. ""We should recognise that people come to this country from many places, they become British citizens, they live under UK law and they should have full participation rights in our society once they're British citizens."" It came after Marina Litvinenko warned the government: ""You need to be very selective who you are friends with. ""When you allow people with money to come to your country to make a business, you need to make sure where the money has come from."" Mrs Litvinenko said the UK government's response to the murder of her husband, an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin who was fatally poisoned in 2006, had not been strong enough and lessons had not been learned. Mr Hammond, who was foreign secretary when the UK government inquiry into Mr Litvinenko's death was published, in 2015, said ""we took measures which are still in place today"" but he said the Russian government continued to protect the suspects the UK wanted to extradite to stand trial for his murder. Asked by Andrew Marr if the Russians ""were laughing at us"" and believed they could act without implications in the UK, he said: ""Nobody is laughing at us - this is a very serious investigation that is going on and let's see where it leads us."" Labour has been under fire for some time from the Conservatives over appearances by its MPs and spokespeople on RT UK. Mr McDonnell said he had appeared on the rolling news channel in the past to raise certain issues but he added: ""I've been looking overnight... in terms of changes in coverage on Russian television, in particular, and I think we have to step back now."" He added: ""I can understand why people have [appeared on RT] up until now because we have treated it like every other television station. ""We tried to be fair with them and as long as they abide by journalistic standards that are objective that's fine but it looks as if they have gone beyond that line, so yes, we will have that discussion."" Peter Dowd, who as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury is Mr McDonnell's deputy, said he had appeared on RT on a number of occasions, including in a programme broadcast at the start of this week. Mr Dowd told Sky's Sunday with Niall Paterson: ""In light of the events of this week, of course we will undertake a review of what we do in regards to these, as you will always do in these sorts of circumstances."" The Kremlin-funded news channel began broadcasting internationally in 2005 in English, Arabic and Spanish as Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today). It shortened its name to RT several years later and began focusing on US news. It launched a dedicated UK service in 2014. It says it provides a ""Russian viewpoint"" on world events and challenges ""mainstream media"" - but critics say it is a propaganda vehicle for the Russian government. It has been sanctioned by UK regulator Ofcom for misleading programmes on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said last year it was ""an absolute scandal"" that Labour MPs had given interviews to RT. A number of Conservative MPs - and ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage - have also appeared on the channel and ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond hosts a weekly chat show. Why has RT registered as a foreign agent with the US? Mr McDonnell called on the government to pass a British version of the US Magnitsky Act - which punishes Russians involved in corruption and human rights violations - if the Kremlin is found to be behind the poisoning in Salisbury. He said that the Labour Party had already moved amendments to the Money Laundering Bill currently going through parliament to introduce Magnitsky clauses - amendments he said were opposed by the Conservative Party. ""We hope now they'll enable us to bring those amendments back at the Report stage of the bill"" he said. Chancellor Philip Hammond said introducing Magnitsky clauses was not ""strictly necessary"".

Bono sorry for charity's alleged bullying,"Bono said he was left ""reeling and furious"" U2 singer Bono has apologised after claims of bullying and abuse emerged at One, the charity he co-founded. Among the allegations are that one female worker was demoted after refusing to ""become intimate"" with a foreign government official. The woman's manager reportedly made ""sexist and suggestive comments"" about her to the official. Bono told the Mail on Sunday newspaper: ""We are all deeply sorry. I hate bullying, can't stand it."" The newspaper said the charity publicly admitted the issues,externalhours after it had sent a long list of allegations at the end of an investigation, in order to allow One to comment. The statement from the charity's CEO, Gayle Smith, said former employees had notified the organisation earlier this week about pending legal action over their complaints. It said ""historical issues"" of mistreatment emerged in November when some former employees from its Johannesburg office told their stories on social media. Oxfam's Haiti prostitution claims Charity boss resigns from Unicef after behaviour complaints ""The investigation yielded evidence of unprofessional conduct and, in particular, what I would characterize as bullying and belittling of staff between late 2011 and 2015 in our Johannesburg office,"" Ms Smith said. ""Staff were called names, and some said their manager put them to work on domestic tasks in her home,"" she added. The allegation involving the woman who refused to ""become intimate"" with the foreign official could not be corroborated, the statement said - but Ms Smith said it was not being discounted. In addition, the company said it had discovered that its African wing was not paying taxes between 2010 and 2015, but was instead a ""non-resident taxpayer"". Ms Smith was not CEO at the time of the alleged offences. She said the investigation showed ""institutional failure"" and that she had apologised to the former employees who agreed to speak to her. Bono, meanwhile, spoke with the Mail on Sunday about its investigation, saying he was left ""reeling and furious"" when he learned of the allegations in November. ""My team and I heard concerns about low morale and poor management in this office but nothing along the lines of what emerged recently,"" he said. ""The head office failed to protect those employees and I need to take some responsibility for that,"" he told the Mail - adding that he would like to meet the victims to apologise in person. Other prominent members of the charity's board include former UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer. The charity was founded in 2004 and says its aim is to tackle ""extreme poverty"". Its sister organisation, Red, was founded two years later, and raises funds through the sale of branded luxury goods, including those of Apple computers. Bono and Apple join forces for charity.

Ofwat to quiz water firms over shortages,"The water regulator for England and Wales is to investigate why thousands of homessuffered water shortagesin the wake of the recent cold weather. Homes and businesses faced days without running water after pipes burst during a thaw which followed freezing weather conditions. Ofwat will look at how prepared water firms were and what support they subsequently offered customers. It said at the time that companies had ""fallen well short"". Some water companies handed out bottled water as some households were without a mains supply for three days.

Blind skier: From 70mph crash to silver medal," By Beth Rose, BBC Ouch:PyeongChang Conditions are good. Nineteen-year-old Millie Knight is preparing for a race that will see her hit speeds of 115km/h (71mph). Registered blind, she will rely on her guide, Brett Wild, to talk her down the mountain. They are a team. Fist bump. Ritual. A whispered chant from Irish band, The Script: “You could be the greatest, you can be the best, you can be the King Kong banging on your chest.” Into the gates. “Three, two, one.” Wild pushes off. “Go.” Knight follows. The mountain falls away. The cut of skis on snow and the intense exchange of instructions is all that can be heard as Wild shouts out the course. Spectators stand silent, forbidden to make noise. Knight only has 5% vision. It is peripheral and blurry but she catches glints of Wild’s orange jacket, which keeps her on track. Twists and turns. Rhythmic. And then the final stretch, downhill, skis straight, body tucked. All out until they're over the line. The mountain's silence is broken by cheering. Knight and Wild have become champions in the World Para Alpine Skiing Championships. It's a first for Britain at such an event. But Knight fails to stop. She crashes at 115km/h. “I heard her on the comms screaming,” says Wild. “I looked back and could tell instantly how bad it was. She was getting rag-dolled and there was blood all over the snow. She slid on the ice and it ripped her face.” Knight had skidded under an inflatable barrier, which re-inflated on top of her. “She was saying she couldn't breathe,” says Wild. Sports psychologist Kelley Fay watched the crash unfold. “Brett was frantic. Millie wouldn't have known what was happening,” she says. Knight was taken to hospital. Besides cuts and bruises, she was apparently unharmed and discharged in time for the medal ceremony. Knight's injuries The next day the pair returned to compete in the Super G - a form of slalom. But as psychologist Fay took up her position at the bottom of the course, she felt uneasy. “I knew Millie’s head wasn't in the right place,” she says. “So I radioed up and we pulled her out of the race. She was really cross, but in the end she could see we'd made the right decision for her.” It was the first sign that all was not well with the teenager. “We'd been skiing together for over a year and she'd never crashed,” says Wild. “Millie was known for staying on her feet.” That was January 2017. A month later, in South Korea at a test event for the Paralympics, the blind skier found herself in hospital again. “It was at the finish line again,” Knight says. “I flipped and landed on my head a couple of times and we were blue-lighted off to hospital.” A diagnosis of concussion would take her off the ski slopes. Recuperation included light gym sessions, but too much exertion could wipe her out for days. That's when fear crept in.” Knight's brain scan Unable to confront the mountains, the fear started to eat away at her. She threw herself into her school work - A-levels were looming - and her love of photography. Knight photographs people and movement - skiing rarely features - and often sells her work. “I take photos to see the world because the way I see it is very different,” she says. “It's almost like a new language to me. When I look through the camera I realise that's what everyone else sees.” Knight started to prepare for her first solo photography exhibition. But as hard as she focused, her mind kept replaying the crash. “I thought, ‘Have I lost this? Have I lost my bottle? Am I not going to be as good as I was?’” Knight had always been known for her fearlessness. She has skied since she was six - the same age that she was left with 5% vision. As a baby, an infection scarred the retina of her right eye. Five years later the sight was gone in her left eye, too. “I don't remember having sight,” she says. “It's not an event in my life and my mum never made a big deal about it.” “She was a massive skier, so she just put me into ski school and didn't tell them I couldn't see.” Knight stayed close to the instructor and became a natural follower on the snow. Millie Knight The family took annual ski holidays. It was something to create memories with and a chance to feel speed - after all, Knight would never ride a bike or drive a car. “I can see about two to three metres in front of me but it's unclear and foggy,” she says. “Within that, I don't really have depth perception, so I don't know how far away things are.” Millie Knight and her mother Suzanne In 2012, when she was 12, Knight attended the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics. “That was the moment I was like, ‘Wow I want to be one of those athletes.’” Back at home in Canterbury, she contacted Disability Snowsport UK and began to focus on ski training. Her mother Suzanne acted as her guide. At 13, Knight made it on to the UK development team and just two years later qualified for the Sochi Paralympics. She became ParalympicsGB's youngest Winter Games athlete and was nominated as flag-bearer to lead the team into the Fisht Olympic Stadium. Knight carries the flag “I was thinking, ‘Why am I here, it's crazy’. I was so starstruck,” she says. She was too young to compete in all the ski events but came fifth in the slalom and the giant slalom. After the Games, Knight’s guide retired from the sport to go to university. Good guides are hard to come by, partly because of the expense. Unless they are at the top of their game, guides pay their own way. Others retire due to injury. Over the following season, Knight went through eight guides. None was quite right. Then in 2016, Knight’s development coach Euan Bennett, heard about a young Royal Navy skier who had represented Scotland at a junior level and thought he’d be worth a trial. Brett Wild had joined the Royal Navy when he was 19. He grew up in Scotland where his dad managed Glasgow Ski Centre and his mum was an instructor. They put Wild on the snow aged three and he competed for Scotland as a teenager. He travelled the world to training camps and competitions and almost went full time in his final year of school. Brett Wild Bennett told Wild that as a guide, he would need to ski a couple of metres ahead of Knight, but they wouldn't be tethered. They would communicate via Bluetooth headsets. He would need to be proficient in five disciplines - Downhill, Super-G, Giant Slalom, Slalom and Super Combined, which is made up of one downhill run and a slalom event. Wild was up for it and flew to Austria for a trial. Knight was less sure. She had been used to older guides who took control and made decisions. Wild was just 23 and had no idea what he was doing. But he took to it quickly and easily. Knight and Wild As they descend a slope, Wild is expected to describe the terrain from the start gate to the finish line. A “steep here”, a “flatter” there, as well as the snow conditions - “bumpy”, “icy”, “soft”. He will also instruct Knight to turn at every gate for the rhythmical changes. If she can’t catch sight of his orange jacket in front of her, she will let him know by saying “off”. “I was told her life is in my hands and that she’s my responsibility until she has her skis off,” says Wild. After a week’s training, Knight threw Wild into the deep end by asking him to guide for her at an international competition in Aspen, Colorado, US. The Navy agreed Wild could go but only if he returned immediately for a nine-month tour of duty. Waiting for him in Aspen was Knight’s sports psychologist Kelley Fay. She wanted to ensure that her young charge would be in good hands. “I could see his potential but he was just a boy. So I pulled him aside and had a stern conversation with him about what he needed to do,” she says. “He said I frightened the life out of him, but I wanted him to hit the ground running.” The pep talk worked. By the end of the competition, the pair had picked up seven medals including three golds. “It was hard to get my head around,” Wild says. “The week before I was pleased to win a bronze medal at the Inter-Service Championships. Then I had three gold World Cup medals to bring home.” PyeongChang beckoned and the Navy agreed to release Wild for two years, on a reduced salary, to take Knight to the Winter Games. But the crash a year later in South Korea changed everything for Knight. With just over 12 months to go, the blind skier was gripped with the fear of racing down a mountainside. Her Paralympic hopes hung in the balance. “Before my crash, I was confident because I had nothing to fear. But afterwards I was thinking, ‘Why am I doing this if it is going to cause me injuries?’” “My performance is 80% psychological and 20% talent because when you’re standing there and you have that second of doubt - that's when things start to go wrong.” Psychologist Fay says Knight was the most confident ski racer she had worked with. “She wasn’t cocky but had a lot of self belief in what she could achieve. She had no anxiety before the crashes. “After the first one we got her on her skis very quickly but the second one meant she was removed from that ski world. That made this particularly difficult to overcome,” she says. Kelly Fay with Knight and Wild Fay spent up to 90 minutes a day with Knight. Sometimes they would talk during a 10-minute ski-lift ride to redirect Knight's thoughts before the next run, or discuss her body language to make her look and feel more confident. “You could see she was willing to do whatever it took, but whenever she put her speed skis on it just freaked her out,” Fay says. “Even when we were doing a gentle slope, she’d be saying ‘I can't do this’. She was that frightened. “That was when we knew it was very serious.” As time ticked away, they needed a breakthrough. Kelly speaks to Knight and Wild Fay accompanied Knight to Chile to the ParaGB training camp, in the hope she could establish where Knight's fear came from and why both crashes happened in the finish area. They started with the basics - how to stop. “The guys are 100% committed all the way down for speed. But the last few gates are normally straight, so a lot of them switch off because it's just ‘go go go’,” says Fay. “We worked a lot to make sure she was staying fully engaged until they were stopped, but even that didn’t take the fear away.” Then Fay had another idea - they would return to the site of the crash and face Knight's fears head-on. The trio went back to the exact spot where the crash happened, where Knight's confidence had been shattered. “It was about reprogramming my brain into thinking differently about it,” Knight says. “Changing my emotions towards it.” Fay says: “It was getting her to accept that this is speed racing, so there's an element of risk involved. But if we did A, B and C that would minimise it.” Knight and Wild Wild, naturally, blamed himself for the crash and Knight’s subsequent loss of confidence. As her guide he was meant to be her eyes. “I think of Millie as a little sister and I feel very protective of her,” he says. “I felt useless that I couldn’t help. All I could do was stay positive when she was losing belief in herself. There were times when she was upset and I didn't know what to do. “I tried to stay positive, but it was out of my control. The problems were in Millie’s head.” Knight's crash and loss of confidence had set them and their training back and they needed to make up ground on the snow. Knight weight training The got stuck into training. They needed to work on their trust and relationship both on and off the slopes. Daily training would begin at 05:00. They practised relentlessly, eradicating any potential for error “When I'm skiing all I can hear is Brett and his skis,” says Knight. “I'm only aware of following Brett's commands, I totally zone in and that's all I’m focused on.” Learning how to fall, gracefully. However, I'm not best known for being graceful, especially when it comes to falling...😬 A post shared byMillie Knight(@knight_millie) onAug 5, 2017 at 10:04am PDT In January 2018 news came through that the pair had made the GB team for PyeongChang. But the physical and mental hurdle of returning to the slopes in competition remained. Had Knight's fears finally be conquered? The pair were to find out at a pre-Games competition in Canada. They were faultless. Three bronze medals out of four. But the top accolade went to Knight and Wild’s team-mates - Menna Fitzpatrick and guide Jennifer Kehoe - who won two golds and a silver. Their fight back to the top was not yet over. Menna Fitzpatrick and guide Jennifer Kehoe “Canada was good,” says Wild. “I don't think it's exactly where we wanted to be, but we're now back in the mix. We were about a second off the fastest girl so we are close enough. It’s just whether we can bring it all together on race day.” But Knight saw it as proof her fears had dissipated. “I think now I'm much stronger mentally. When I think about my crash I smile, I don't think of it and get worried any more.” Knight and Wild A gold medal hangs in the balance. But so does the partnership the pair has effortlessly formed. The two years that Wild was granted by the Navy is almost up. He’s still part of the armed forces ski team but isn’t sure whether he will be allowed to continue working with Knight on another Paralympic cycle. A gold medal might just swing it - and keep the pair together. “I wouldn't want to follow anyone else down a mountain,” Knight says. “It would be devastating if we couldn’t ski together again.” Built with Shorthand"

Labour to boycott Russia Today,"This video can not be played John McDonnell says he won't appear on Russia Today Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said he won't be making any more appearances on Kremlin-sponsored TV station Russia Today. He said RT's coverage ""goes beyond objective journalism"" and it was ""right"", after events in Salisbury, that Labour MPs did not appear on it. A party spokesman said: ""We are keeping the issue under review"". Mr McDonnell also backed visa sanctions against Russians suspected of corruption. Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested a deal could be reached with Labour to bring in sanctions. Salisbury diners told to wash possessions after nerve agent attack Russian state TV anchor warns 'traitors' But he rejected a call from the widow of murdered Alexander Litvinenko for the Conservatives to pay back more than Â£820,000 donated by Russian-linked business people since Prime Minister Theresa May came to power. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr there were ""very strict rules"" governing donations to UK political parties. This video can not be played Marina Litvinenko: 'Lessons haven't been learned' ""There are people in this country who are British citizens who are of Russian origin - I don't think we should taint them, we should tar them with Putin's brush. ""We should recognise that people come to this country from many places, they become British citizens, they live under UK law and they should have full participation rights in our society once they're British citizens."" It came after Marina Litvinenko warned the government: ""You need to be very selective who you are friends with. ""When you allow people with money to come to your country to make a business, you need to make sure where the money has come from."" Mrs Litvinenko said the UK government's response to the murder of her husband, an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin who was fatally poisoned in 2006, had not been strong enough and lessons had not been learned. Mr Hammond, who was foreign secretary when the UK government inquiry into Mr Litvinenko's death was published, in 2015, said ""we took measures which are still in place today"" but he said the Russian government continued to protect the suspects the UK wanted to extradite to stand trial for his murder. Asked by Andrew Marr if the Russians ""were laughing at us"" and believed they could act without implications in the UK, he said: ""Nobody is laughing at us - this is a very serious investigation that is going on and let's see where it leads us."" Labour has been under fire for some time from the Conservatives over appearances by its MPs and spokespeople on RT UK. Mr McDonnell said he had appeared on the rolling news channel in the past to raise certain issues but he added: ""I've been looking overnight... in terms of changes in coverage on Russian television, in particular, and I think we have to step back now."" He added: ""I can understand why people have [appeared on RT] up until now because we have treated it like every other television station. ""We tried to be fair with them and as long as they abide by journalistic standards that are objective that's fine but it looks as if they have gone beyond that line, so yes, we will have that discussion."" Peter Dowd, who as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury is Mr McDonnell's deputy, said he had appeared on RT on a number of occasions, including in a programme broadcast at the start of this week. Mr Dowd told Sky's Sunday with Niall Paterson: ""In light of the events of this week, of course we will undertake a review of what we do in regards to these, as you will always do in these sorts of circumstances."" The Kremlin-funded news channel began broadcasting internationally in 2005 in English, Arabic and Spanish as Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today). It shortened its name to RT several years later and began focusing on US news. It launched a dedicated UK service in 2014. It says it provides a ""Russian viewpoint"" on world events and challenges ""mainstream media"" - but critics say it is a propaganda vehicle for the Russian government. It has been sanctioned by UK regulator Ofcom for misleading programmes on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said last year it was ""an absolute scandal"" that Labour MPs had given interviews to RT. A number of Conservative MPs - and ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage - have also appeared on the channel and ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond hosts a weekly chat show. Why has RT registered as a foreign agent with the US? Mr McDonnell called on the government to pass a British version of the US Magnitsky Act - which punishes Russians involved in corruption and human rights violations - if the Kremlin is found to be behind the poisoning in Salisbury. He said that the Labour Party had already moved amendments to the Money Laundering Bill currently going through parliament to introduce Magnitsky clauses - amendments he said were opposed by the Conservative Party. ""We hope now they'll enable us to bring those amendments back at the Report stage of the bill"" he said. Chancellor Philip Hammond said introducing Magnitsky clauses was not ""strictly necessary"". ""The home secretary already has the power to exclude individuals from the UK if she believes that their presence here is not conducive to the national security or the public good. ""But we're seeking to reach an accommodation with those who have put this amendment forward. ""Let's see if we can come to a proposal that works for everybody."" RT have crossed line - McDonnell.

Man restrained by police officers dies,"Officers were called to Polsted Road, Lewisham, to reports of a man trying to enter back gardens A man restrained by officers while he ""appeared to be having a mental health crisis"" has died, police have said. The 35-year-old was ""in an agitated state"" when police were called to Polsted Road in Lewisham, the Met said. Residents had reported seeing a man trying to gain access to back gardens in the street. An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation has been launched.

We're not out of the tunnel yet - HammondThe chancellor says he will not relax his grip on public spending in his spring statement on Tuesday.9m10 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Chancellor Philip Hammond: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel"" Chancellor Philip Hammond has rejected calls by Labour and some Conservatives to announce the end of austerity in his spring statement on Tuesday. He is expected to unveil the smallest budget deficit since 2002, thanks to better than expected public finances. But he told the BBC national debt was still too high, adding: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel... but we are still in the tunnel at the moment."" Labour has urged him toend the ""pain and misery"" of public spending cuts. Mr Hammond told the Andrew Marr Show it would be wrong to pour ""every penny"" into additional public spending. What not to expect from the spring statement Why is there no Budget this March? UK economic growth exceeds forecasts He said it was ""very important moment"" to see debt starting to fall after growing for 17 continuous years. But he said: ""We should be very careful looking at single sets of figures - one quarter or two quarters - we need to look at what's happening sustainably in the economy."" The day-to-day deficit has been eliminated, it emerged earlier this month, two years later than former chancellor George Osborne had wanted when he set out in 2010. The UK is now running a surplus of Â£3.8bn in its current budget - the money borrowed to fund day-to-day spending rather than long-term investment - according to the Office for National Statistics. ""We have a debt of Â£1.8 trillion - 86.5% of our GDP,"" Mr Hammond said. ""All the international organisations recognise that is higher than the safe level."" Mr Hammond told the BBC that ""we need to get our debt lower"". ""I think most people in this country would be horrified to be reminded that we have Â£65,000 worth of public debt for every household in this country,"" he said. The chancellor is due to announce a half-yearly update of Britain's public finance figures on Tuesday, but confirmed he would not be delivering any new tax or spending measures. ""If there is the flexibility and the space to do something, then we will decide in the autumn how we are going to use that,"" he said. Economists expect the chancellor will announce borrowing is set to be around Â£7bn lower in 2017-18 than had been predicted, when he unveils the latest forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Also appearing on Andrew Marr, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, called on the government to end its austerity programme. He said recent economic figures were ""not a matter for celebration"" - and said the chancellor ""should be coming into the real world"". He said Mr Hammond had ""shifted the deficit onto the shoulders of NHS managers, headteachers and onto the shoulders of local government leaders. ""They're facing a financial crisis because of government cutbacks,"" he told Marr. This video can not be played John McDonnell says he won't appear on Russia Today He called thegovernment's plans for an NHS pay deal""miserly and mean-spirited"". ""Pay is at the moment just about matching inflation, that's all,"" he added. Mr McDonnell has called on the government to use its spring statement to end what Labour called an ""immediate crisis"" in public services. But Mr Hammond vowed to ""look at the numbers"" in the autumn Budget. He said: ""Local authorities have done an incredible job in delivering efficiencies,"" adding: ""Of course they're under some pressures"".

Nun in Katy Perry lawsuit 'dies in court'Sister Catherine Rose Holzman was fighting the singer's bid to buy her former convent in California.14h14 hours agoUS & Canada,"Singer Katy Perry got caught up in a lawsuit involving two nuns and the Los Angeles Archdiocese A nun embroiled in a property dispute with singer Katy Perry collapsed and died during a court hearing on Friday, US media report. Sister Catherine Rose Holzman was 89. She was one of two nuns locked in a legal battle with Perry and the Los Angeles Archdiocese over a former convent in the city. Perry agreed to buy the property for $14.5m (Â£10.4m) in 2015, but the deal turned sour when the former residents objected. Sister Catherine Rose and Sister Rita Callanan said they were uncomfortable handing the convent and its eight surrounding acres over to the star, whose sometimes provocative hits include I Kissed A Girl and Ur So Gay. Perry reportedly visited the nuns to win them over, and is said to have shown them her tattoo of Jesus and sung a hymn for them. But the pair remained unconvinced. ""I found her videos,"" Sister Rita Callanan told the Los Angeles Times.,external""I wasn't happy with any of it."" The nuns instead sold the residence to local restaurant owner Dana Hollister, without the approval of their Archdiocese. Perry and the Catholic Church were awarded almost $10m in damages in 2017, when their lawyers successfully argued that the sisters had no right to sell the property. The nuns had failed to get the consent of Archbishop Jose Gomez and the Vatican, which must approve the sale of any property worth over $7.5m, the advocates said. Perry convent sale 'violates our vows', say nuns A jury then concluded that the restaurateur had deliberately interfered with Perry's planned purchase. The post-judgement proceedings have been put on hold following the nun's death. In a statement on Friday, Archbishop Gomez said: ""Sister Catherine Rose served the Church with dedication and love for many years, and today we remember her life with gratitude."" 'Millions' join Spanish women's strike Trump wins order to silence porn actress Tearful 'Pharma Bro' Shkreli sentenced Sister Catherine Rose spoke to Fox11 LA hours before her collapse,externalin what may have been her final interview.

"Trump: N Korea talks could be 'greatest deal'President Trump said meeting Kim Jong-un could fail or bring about ""the greatest deal for the world"".22m22 minutes agoUS & Canada","US President Donald Trump has said his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un could either fail or lead to the ""greatest deal for the world"". At a political rally in Pennsylvania, Mr Trump told supporters he believed North Korea wanted to make peace. But he said he might leave the talks quickly if it didn't look like progress for nuclear disarmament could be made. In his speech, the US leader warned of tariffs on European cars, and launched his slogan for re-election in 2020. The political gamble of the 21st Century The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit ""Hey, who knows what's going to happen?"" said Mr Trump on Saturday at the rally for a Republican congressional candidate. ""I may leave fast or we may sit down and make the greatest deal for the world."" In his wide-ranging speech, he said he hoped a deal to ease nuclear tensions would happen, particularly to help countries like North Korea. He also said he believed the North Koreans would honour their commitment not to test any more missiles. Mr Trump told the crowd: ""I think they want to make peace, I think it's time."" This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies No date or place has been set for the meeting, despite initial reports it would happen by the end of May. South Korea's presidential office said the North Korean truce village of Panmunjom, which sits at the demilitarised zone between the North and the South,was a ""serious"" option, Yonhap news agency reported,external. Sweden, Switzerland and China have also been named as possible hosts. No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader and Mr Trump's decision to accept an invitation from the North Korean leader - relayed by South Korean envoys on Thursday - reportedly took top administration officials by surprise.

Mr Trump tweeted that a deal was ""very much in the making"", though the White House said the meeting would not take place unless Pyongyang took ""concrete actions"". The US has made ""zero concessions"" with its sanctions, said Vice-President Mike Pence, following news of the upcoming meeting being agreed. He said he believed North Korea's willingness to talk proved the US strategy of isolating the country was working. This was a speech meant for Mr Trump's core supporters, the BBC Washington correspondent Chris Buckler says.

He announced that his 2020 re-election campaign slogan would be: ""Keep America Great, exclamation point."" Appealing to his base, he again raised the possibility of the death penalty for drug dealers. President Trump talked tough on trade, describing tariffs as his baby. He re-iterated his threat to tax cars imported from the European Union, saying that the EU better raise barriers and get rid of its own tariffs. Trump imposes controversial tariffs EU wants clarity on Trump tariff exemption ""If you're not going to do that, we're going to tax Mercedes Benz, we're going to tax BMW,"" he said. Mr Trump's words may raise concerns or rile up anger overseas, our correspondent says, but it appealed to the audience Mr Trump wanted to address - his core supporters.

Trump: N Korea talks could be 'greatest deal',"US President Donald Trump has said his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un could either fail or lead to the ""greatest deal for the world"". At a political rally in Pennsylvania, Mr Trump told supporters he believed North Korea wanted to make peace. But he said he might leave the talks quickly if it didn't look like progress for nuclear disarmament could be made. In his speech, the US leader warned of tariffs on European cars, and launched his slogan for re-election in 2020. The political gamble of the 21st Century The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit ""Hey, who knows what's going to happen?"" said Mr Trump on Saturday at the rally for a Republican congressional candidate. ""I may leave fast or we may sit down and make the greatest deal for the world."" In his wide-ranging speech, he said he hoped a deal to ease nuclear tensions would happen, particularly to help countries like North Korea. He also said he believed the North Koreans would honour their commitment not to test any more missiles. Mr Trump told the crowd: ""I think they want to make peace, I think it's time.""

South Korea's presidential office said the North Korean truce village of Panmunjom, which sits at the demilitarised zone between the North and the South,was a ""serious"" option, Yonhap news agency reported,external. Sweden, Switzerland and China have also been named as possible hosts. No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader and Mr Trump's decision to accept an invitation from the North Korean leader - relayed by South Korean envoys on Thursday - reportedly took top administration officials by surprise.

Mr Trump tweeted that a deal was ""very much in the making"", though the White House said the meeting would not take place unless Pyongyang took ""concrete actions"". The US has made ""zero concessions"" with its sanctions, said Vice-President Mike Pence, following news of the upcoming meeting being agreed. He said he believed North Korea's willingness to talk proved the US strategy of isolating the country was working.

Appealing to his base, he again raised the possibility of the death penalty for drug dealers. President Trump talked tough on trade, describing tariffs as his baby. He re-iterated his threat to tax cars imported from the European Union, saying that the EU better raise barriers and get rid of its own tariffs.

China prepares to approve 'life president',"This video can not be played Should China's Xi be president for life? China has approved the removal of the two-term limit on the presidency, effectively allowing Xi Jinping to remain in power for life. The constitutional changes were passed by the annual sitting of parliament, the National People's Congress. The vote was widely regarded as a rubber-stamping exercise. Two delegates voted against the change and three abstained, out of 2,964 votes. China had imposed a two-term limit on its president since the 1990s. But Mr Xi, who would have been due to step down in 2023, defied the tradition of presenting a potential successor during October's Communist Party Congress. Instead, he consolidated his political power as the party voted to enshrine his name and political ideology in the party's constitution - elevating his status to the level of its founder, Chairman Mao. On paper, the congress is the most powerful legislative body in China - similar to the parliament in other nations. But it was widely believed that it would approve what it was told to. In depth: Xi, the president who lived in a cave How China's 'two sessions' meetings work A Chinese move that many expected Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent in Beijing It is now hard to see Xi Jinping being challenged in any way whatsoever. He has amassed power the likes of which has not been seen since Chairman Mao Zedong. Mr Xi applauded after the amendment was passed Only five years ago Beijing was being ruled by a collective leadership. Under ex-President Hu Jintao you could imagine differing views being expressed in the then nine-member Politburo Standing Committee. There was a feeling that Mr Hu needed to please various factions within the Communist Party and it seemed that every 10 years a new leader would come along with their own people in a process of smooth transition. From today all this has gone. The constitution has been altered to allow Xi Jinping to remain as president beyond two terms and they would not have gone to this much trouble if that was not exactly what he intended to do. There has been no national debate as to whether a leader should be allowed to stay on for as long as they choose. Quietly but surely Xi Jinping has changed the way his country is governed, with himself well and truly at the core. The issue is not, however, without controversy. Online censors in China have been blocking discussion around the topic, including images of Winnie the Pooh.Social media users have taken to using the cartoon character to represent Mr Xi. Social media users create ""Winnie the Pooh"" memes to avoid being seen as making derogatory posts against Mr Xi (r) One government critic described the proposal in an open letter last month as a ""farce"", in a rare show of public dissent. Former state newspaper editor Li Datong wrote that scrapping term limits for the president and vice-president would sow the seeds of chaos - in a message sent to some members of the national congress. ""I couldn't bear it any more. I was discussing with my friends and we were enraged. We have to voice our opposition,"" he told BBC Chinese. State media, however, have portrayed the changes as much-needed reform. US President Donald Trump was criticised by some commentators for seeming to approve of Mr Xi's unlimited rule, saying on Monday: ""President for life... I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."" At a political rally on Saturday, Mr Trump insisted he had merely been joking during a fundraiser, and that his comments were represented unfairly by some media. Mr Xi's possible third term is not the only item the National People's Congress is likely to approve. It was also expected to: confirm China's new government line-up for the next five years, kicking off Xi Jinping's second term as president ratify a law to set up a new powerful anti-corruption agency ratify the inclusion of the president's political philosophy - ""Xi Jinping thought"" - in the constitution Xi Jinping thought is the ideology approved by the Communist Party last October. Officially, it is ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era"". Schoolchildren, college students and staff at state factories will have to study the political ideology, which the Communist Party is trying to portray as a new chapter for modern China. Human cost of China's economic reforms The changing Chinese family in five charts The lawyer who simply vanished Mr Xi became president in 2013, and quickly consolidated personal power while cementing China as the regional superpower. He also fought corruption, punishing more than a million party members - which has helped his popularity among some. At the same time, however, China has clamped down on many emerging freedoms, increasing its state surveillance and censorship programs. Critics also say Mr Xi has used the anti-corruption purge to sideline political rivals.

China country profile,"China is one of the world's most populous countries. It has a continuous culture stretching back nearly 4,000 years and originated many of the foundations of the modern world. The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang, who retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the People's Republic on the mainland and the Republic of China on Taiwan. After stagnating for decades under the rigid totalitarian socialism of founder Mao Zedong, China reformed its economy along partly-capitalist lines to make it one of the world's fastest-growing, as well a leading exporter. China is now a major overseas investor, and is pursuing an increasingly assertive foreign and defence policy far beyond East Asia. But economic change has not been matched by political reform, and the Communist Party retains a tight grip on political life and much of wider society.

Since taking over he has concentrated power in his hands, rather than sticking with the traditional post-Mao system of collective leadership. His position as the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong was cemented in 2017, when his name and political philosophy was written into the Communist Party constitution. In early 2018 the party allowed him to remain in office indefinitely by abolishing the conventional two-term presidential limit. President Xi rejects constitutional democracy and human rights as models for China, has imposed strict limits on freedom of expression, especially on social media, tightened control over Hong Kong and  incarcerated thousands of Muslim Uyghurs in brutal ""re-education camps"". China has the world's biggest internet audience, but content is tightly controlled China is the largest media market in the world. Outlets operate under tight Communist Party control. The opening-up of the industry has extended to distribution and advertising, but not necessarily to editorial content. Beijing tries to limit access to foreign news by restricting rebroadcasting and the reach of satellite TV, and by blocking websites using an extensive filtering system known as the ""Great Firewall"". With 772 million users, China has the world's largest online population. Three powerful companies - Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - dominate the market. Tencent's WeChat messenger has more than 900 million users worldwide. Readfull media profile Sun Yat-sen was the first president of the Republic of China - and is acknowledged by both Beijing and Taipei as a key 20th Century figure Some key events in China's history: 16th-11th Centuries BC- Shang or Yin dynasty rules northern China: the first Chinese state for which clear written records remain. 1046-256BC- Zhou dynasty: centralised power gradually decreases from the 8th Century onwards, with regional warlords increasingly exercising political autonomy. 475-221BC- Warring States period: China is split into seven major states, the period is characterised by warfare, as well as bureaucratic and military reforms. 221-206BC- The Chinese heartland is united for the first time under the first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, founder of the Qin dynasty. 206BC-220AD- Following civil war, the Han dynasty emerges, creating a cultural identity among still remembered in the ethnonym of the Han Chinese. The empire expands its territory with military campaigns in central Asia, Mongolia, Korea, southern China and Vietnam. 7th-13th Centuries- Under the Tang (618-690) and Song dynasties (960-1279) China's economy flourishes. It is the first country to issue paper money. Between the 10th-11th centuries, China's population doubles to 100 million mostly due to the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China. 1205-1279- Mongol conquest of China. China's population halves during this period. The Great Wall of China was built in the 14th Century as a barrier against the nomadic peoples of the north 1368-1644- Ming dynasty: follows the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. China's capital is moved from Nanjing to Beijing.

The Manchu conquest of China (1618-1683) sees a decades long conflict between the emerging Qing dynasty, the incumbent Ming dynasty, and several smaller factions. It ends with the consolidation of Qing rule, the last imperial dynasty of China. 1839-42 and 1856-60- Opium Wars. Fought between China, the UK and later France, triggered by China's campaign to stop opium trafficking by British merchants. European military superiority forces China to unequal treaties granting trade concessions and territory to Western powers. This begins China's ""century of humiliation"" (1839-1940s) a term used in China to describe the period of intervention and subjugation of the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China by Western powers and Japan. 1850-1864- The Taiping Rebellion: civil war between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the Hakka-led Taiping Heavenly Kingdom based in Nanjing.

After hesitation, the Imperial government supports the Boxers. Western powers intervene with 20,000 troops and capture and loot Beijing. The Qing dynasty's handling of the rebellion further weakens their control over China. 1911-12- Military revolts lead to the proclamation of Republic of China under Sun Yat-sen, but much of the country is taken over by warlords. Late-1920s- The Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek, reunify much of the country and move the capital to Nanjing. 1927-37- China is politically and militarily divided between the Kuomintang and the Communists under Mao Zedong.

This date is sometimes seen as the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. 1937-45- Second Sino-Japanese War: The 1937 Marco Polo Bridge incident sees Chinese and Japanese forces clash, leading to a full-scale Japanese invasion. Japan quickly captures Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing. Some 40,000-300,000 Chinese are killed by Japanese forces in the Nanjing massacre - which remains an issue between modern China and Japan. China's government relocates to Chongqing. 1939- War reaches a stalemate: Japan controls major cities but lacks the forces to control the interior. 1939-45- World War Two sees uneasy alliance between the Communists and Kuomintang. 1945-49- China's civil war resumes as Japan's military defeat becomes clearer. The Communists gain control of mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in 1949 under Mao Zedong, forcing the leadership of the Republic of China to retreat to the island of Taiwan.

"Ofwat to quiz water firms over shortagesOfwat expects compensation to be ""fair, fast and free from hassle for customers"".2m2 minutes agoUK","The water regulator for England and Wales is to investigate why thousands of homessuffered water shortagesin the wake of the recent cold weather. Homes and businesses faced days without running water after pipes burst during a thaw which followed freezing weather conditions. Ofwat will look at how prepared water firms were and what support they subsequently offered customers. It said at the time that companies had ""fallen well short"". Some water companies handed out bottled water as some households were without a mains supply for three days.

More than 20,000 homes were affectedin London, where schools were forced to close and people were advised to take shorter showers as Thames Water repaired burst pipes. In Wales, 3,000 properties lost supply and there weredelays in distributing bottled waterto certain areas. West Midlands-based carmaker Jaguar Land Rover closed plants to preserve water for homes, hospitals and schools, while the chocolate maker Cadbury sent workers home from its Bournville plant. Water companiesare obliged by the regulator to compensate customers,externalwho have had their supply disrupted for an extended period of time. Most companies are being more generous than the minimum compensation available under Ofwat guidelines.

Both suppliers and customers affected will contribute to the review. ""To be left without a vital public service like water - in some cases for several days - is deeply distressing, particularly for those in vulnerable circumstances, "" Ms Fletcher said.

"Student asked to leave bar over turbanAmrik Singh was told the bar in Nottinghamshire had a ""no headwear"" policy.10h10 hours agoNottingham","This video can not be played Amrik Singh told staff his turban was a religious requirement A student said he felt ""victimised"" when asked to leave a bar because he was wearing a turban. Student Amrik Singh was told that Rush in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, had a ""no headwear"" policy. Mr Singh recorded himself saying his turban is a religious requirement and is then asked: ""I didn't think you were allowed to drink anyway."" The management has apologised and said the staff involved faced suspension pending an investigation. Amrik Singh said while he was considering legal options, he hoped the case would educate people Mr Singh, 22, a law student at Nottingham Trent University, said he went to Rush with friends on Friday night. He was initially allowed in but was approached after half an hour and told he had to remove his turban. He said: ""I explained that a turban isn't just headgear, but part of my religion and that I was allowed to wear a turban in public. The bouncer ignored this and said I needed to take it off. ""I refused and was subsequently dragged away from my friends."" The bar management said they were shocked by the actions of their door staff Mr Singh said he asked to speak to whoever was in charge as he felt ""victimised"" and recorded the conversation. In this, Mr Singh repeatedly explains the significance of his turban but is told any headgear is against club policy, ""like trainers"". Mr Singh said he was eventually allowed back in but told in future he would be barred. He said: ""This experience ruined my night. It broke my heart. ""I'm very fortunate that I'm well spoken and I am able to stand up for myself. What if it was someone who wasn't confident was told to leave? I am disgusted."" Mr Singh said he had not reported the incident to police as he did not believe a law had been broken but was ""considering legal options"". However, he said he wanted the main impact of the case to be one of education ""about what is it like to be treated this way"". The bar's management has apologised, calling it ""absolutely unacceptable"" and confirming the staff member had been suspended.

'Disabled women are human tooâDay-by-day guide,"South Korea was celebrated for the way it hosted the Winter Olympics, but in the first edition of its volunteer handbook, published in January, it felt it necessary to remind volunteers, known as the Passion Crew, that ""a female disabled is also a female human being"". So is it ready to host the Paralympics? South Korea is famed for its technology and fast-pace, its difficult relationship with North Korea and of course K-Pop which burst on to the Western music scene with Gangnam Style. But it hasn't always been as forward-thinking when it comes to women, especially if they're disabled. ""Women could never be heroes,"" travel writer, Seoul-dweller and disability campaigner Seyoon Jane Hong, 30, says. ""Until the 20th Century, everything was male-centred. ""Even now if you are young, you may experience unfairness. When you're a woman, oppression is added. And if there is a disability, it is triple discrimination."" K-pop star Psy performing his global hit Gangnam Style It's something she and her friends face, but the country is in flux - divided by age, gender and ability - perhaps not too dissimilar to the UK. ""Baby Boomers and the older generation give more value to economic development than human rights, peace and equality,"" she says. ""To them, disabled people are patients who need help. ""Younger generations, on the other hand, are much more flexible. They acknowledge that various people live together in society and regard people as important rather than economic."" Hong has been in a wheelchair for 20 years after she contracted a spinal cord virus - aged 10. She spent years confined to Seoul, South Korea's capital, until she decided to travel alone when the first accessible express train, KTX was completed. She felt liberation and wanderlust - emotions that had never been experienced by disabled people older than her. Hong recalls elderly women telling her how their lives were stunted by the perception of their disability. They were dehumanised - forced to marry older men, or unsuitable disabled men, because remaining single was unacceptable. ""They have not been recognised for their femininity because they may have difficulty in bearing and nurturing children,"" she says. ""They experienced repression and frustration from the people around them. There was no opportunity."" She says expectations have changed and, in 2018, there is less emphasis on marriage and beauty, and those with disabilities are ""free to love and get married or spontaneously stay single"". As a United Nations member, South Korea follows theUN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,external. The convention includes the equal rights of women and children who are disabled. Since the 1990s, disabled children have attended mainstream school. Hong is young enough to have benefitted from this inclusive step forward, although she says her own experience was challenging. ""If the teacher had a strong understanding of the disability, it was easy to participate in the class. But if not, it was difficult."" Preconceptions have started to change, with talks and outreach programmes in place. There are many disabled students at university although youth unemployment is high and, for those with disabilities, it's even worse. The OECD, the club of industrialised nations, says 5% of South Korea's 50 million population are registered disabled and, of those, 64.5% are unemployed according toHuman Rights Korea,external. The government has tried to combat these high figures by taxing companies Â£637 annually if they don't employ 1.5 disabled people for every 50 people they hire. But according to theMinistry of Employment and Labor,external, more than half of all companies opt to pay the fine instead. Britain doesn't have a quota system but other European countries like Germany and Austria do - and are said to have a similar pushback from employers. Those in South Korea who are unable to find work can apply for benefits through a controversial grading system based entirely on medical assessments rather than factors such as whether someone lives rurally or in the city. Hong says the money is never enough and leaves many people ""having to rely on their families"". There are some spotlight areas of progress, most noticeably in the creative sector with disabled contributors featuring more in newspapers and on TV. KBS, the state-run broadcaster, made headlines around the world in 2011 when itemployed Lee Chang-hoon as a TV news anchor. Blind presenter Lee Chang-hoon in front of TV camera Chang-hoon lost his sight as a baby but, at the age of 27, he impressed the producers with his ability to read and write scripts quickly in Braille and became the first of a number of disabled presenters. In the online world, animator Laila - who is deaf - has made her mark with popular web comic I Am Deaf, which is about living in South Korea without hearing. An enthusiastic 9.4 million people read ""webtoons"" each day and Hong describes Laila's story as ""popular with everyone"". In one of its 200 episodes, the main character is mystified when asweet potato is thrown at them,external. It turns out to be hurled by a visitor when the character doesn't hear the doorbell. Despite the bizarre storyline, people seem to relate to these skits, with one person commenting: ""I can only hear from one side of the ear, but I could already identify a lot with you, I'm learning how to understand others through you."" Hong herself is the author of Europe, There's No Reason Not to Go, a guide which documents her wheelchair travels. She is passionate that all disabled people have the chance to explore internationally and says it's a route into social participation. Seyoon Jane Hong - who has been in a wheelchair since the age of 10 - on a mountain trail But overseas travel has highlighted the accessibility challenges she still has in her own country. About 70% of buses in Seoul do not have low floors - making them inaccessible for wheelchairs. Bus companies don't want to invest in a minority, and, with its many cars and illegal street parking, Seoul is unfriendly for blind people, Hong says. This jars a little with the country's adoption of the UN Convention which ""requires"" each signatory to ""identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers and ensure that disabled people can access their environment and transportation"". The world has been focused on Pyeongchang as a Winter Olympic and Paralympic host. We think of the host venues as cities, but this is a region - with a ski resort - and it has given the country chance to showcase how far it has come. A high-speed train, suitable for wheelchairs, will shuttle spectators to the Games - and the Paralympic committee has ensured there are parking areas, ramps and accessible accommodation. One of the venues for the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Paralympic Games Hong sees Pyeongchang 2018 as an opportunity for people to communicate about the global future of disability and says South Korea is ready for the Winter Paralympics. ""You do not have to speak a foreign language in this age. You can talk as you and I do with a translator. What is important is meeting people in the world who share the same values. ""I want to meet more disabled people in the world. That way, you can apply better values back to Korea, and we can distribute the great value of Korea to others."" Despite requests for a statement on the wording in the volunteer handbook, the organisers of Pyeongchang 2018, did not respond to the BBC. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said it had requested the clumsy wording be updated and said the phrase may have been lost in translation. As per the IPC's request, the webpage containing a link to the booklet was ""temporarily [taken] down for system update"" - but this has remained the case for over a month and now the games are under way.
